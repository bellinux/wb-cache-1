Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the trends of cancer trial eligibility criteria between 1999 and 2014. The yearly distributions of eligibility concepts for chemicals and drugs, procedures, observations, and medical conditions extracted from free-text eligibility criteria of 32, 000 clini-cal trials for 89 cancer types were analyzed. We identified the <b>concepts</b> <b>that</b> <b>trend</b> upwards or downwards in all or selected cancer types, and the <b>concepts</b> <b>that</b> show anomalous <b>trends</b> for some cancers. Later, concept trends were studied in a disease-specific manner and illustrated for breast cancer.

This study contributes a method for concept trend analysis and original knowledge of the trends in cancer clinical trial eligibility criteria...|$|R

40|$|At the inter-specific level, per {{offspring}} investment (POI), {{degree of}} abbreviated development, and lecithotrophic potential all increase with increasing latitude and freshwater penetration among crustaceans. These traits are considered adaptations to conditions of decreasing growth potential. We {{hypothesis that the}} relationship between POI and abbreviated development also occurs at the intra-specific level. We studied the caridean shrimp, Palaemonetes varians, to investigate the hypothesis that under food-limited conditions, higher POI enables development through fewer larval instars. Larvae from broods of greater POI (measured as hatchling dry weight, W, and categorised as ‘small’, ‘medium’, or ‘large’) generally developed through fewer larval instars. With increasing starvation period, larval development time increased and larval growth rate, juvenile W, juvenile carbon mass, and juvenile C:N ratio all decreased. Larval development time decreased with increasing larval W category. In contrast larval growth rate, juvenile W, juvenile carbon mass, and juvenile C:N ratio all increased with increasing larval W categorys. There were no interactions between starvation treatment and larval W category for any larval or juvenile trait, except larval development time. These results are consistent with the relationship between POI and larval instar number (abbreviation of development) at the inter-specific level and support the <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> macro-ecological <b>trends</b> in development modes at the inter-specific level may be driven by selection occurring on POI at the intra-specific level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The East African Community (EAC) ’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{sector has}} been {{confronted with the}} {{convergence}} phenomenon. This is a <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> describes the <b>trend</b> of blurring boundaries between the traditionally distinct ICT sectors, namely: Information Technology (IT), broadcasting and telecommunications. This is significant for the EAC since {{the driving force behind}} this convergence phenomenon is that of efficiency. It necessitates the need to rethink the current legislative and regulatory frameworks in the ICT sector in order to cope with this phenomenon. The need to address this is pertinent since adapting to legislative and regulatory frameworks that are fully converged will expand access to ICT, stimulate economic growth, technological advancement, and also faster integration process of the EAC. Therefore this paper aims to demonstrate the following: Implications and challenges of this trend for the EAC legislative and regulatory frameworks; the need for a common legislative and regulatory framework that is fully converged. It therefore focuses on the inadequacies of the existing legislative and regulatory frameworks and reveals the lacunae in the present frameworks and how they fail to adequately address convergence phenomenon. The paper recommends effective, workable and consistent proposals on how to address the inadequacies. This brings awareness and deepens the understanding of the regulatory convergence issues to the ICT stakeholders in the region and the challenges of convergence on the existing frameworks. This will contribute to better legislative and regulatory frameworks in the EAC ICT market. It will therefore enable the region to enjoy the benefits of convergence and minimise instances of inefficiency in regulation of these converged ICT markets. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The Sophiology {{features}} the mystical and poetic intuition {{of the so-called}} “femme éternelle” {{as one of the}} basic concepts of its doctrine. However, the analysis of concrete sophiological <b>concepts</b> shows <b>that</b> this <b>trend</b> in thought was characterized by a fairly strong internal competition of projects. Trying to build up such sophiology as would, in the eyes of its creators, correspond to the Orthodox ecclesiastical tradition, individual authors attempted to purify their constructions from certain aspects of Solovyov’s sophiological ideas. But an unbiased examination of certain sophiological doctrines shows that the struggle for a truly “ecclesiastical” Sophia in reality led to a re-thinking of the very notions of ecclesiasticism and tradition - on the basis of theoretical reﬂ ection over the data provided by immediate religious experience which was perceived by its subjects as a personal revelation. The Sophiology of Father P. Florensky constitutes one of such attempts. In his book “The Pillar and Ground of the Truth” Sophia represents a carefully thought-over philosophical and theological concept representing an onto-symbolic representation of the Truth, which is not so much conceived rationally as by way of religious praxis. Central for such conceiving is the notion of “ecclesiasticism”. The experience of building-up a religious and philosophical synthesis found in the book of Florensky in reality presupposed (in view of the alleged traditional character of his constructions and his appeals to the archaically stylized medieval imagery and symbols) the emergence of a substantially new style of religiousness which found wide recognition in the quickly modernizing Russian society of the beginning of the 20 th century...|$|R
