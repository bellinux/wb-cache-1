25|$|On August 1, 2002, {{in celebration}} of the City of Klaipėda's 750th anniversary, a museum was opened at the castle. The museum {{is located in the}} Prince Fredric chamber under the bastion, where {{artillery}} was stored in the 17th century. Visitors may familiarize themselves with the excavated findings, view the authentic remaining sections of the castle, and follow its historical development. The City of Klaipėda, in partnership with the European Network of National Heritage Organisations, envisions a re-integration of the castle and its surroundings with the Old Town and the <b>Curonian</b> <b>Lagoon.</b> The castle's site has since become one of Klaipėda's most popular tourist attractions. The annual Klaipėda Castle Jazz Festival is held on the grounds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Epiphytic lichens are {{well-known}} {{indicators of}} air contamination. The chemical composition of lichens {{is affected by}} the concentration of pollutants in the environment. Usually, researchers assess long-term variations in trace elements or other pollutants in the study area, or identify spatial features of air contamination. The aim {{of this study is to}} create a database of trace element concentrations in the samples of the epiphytic lichen Hypogymnia physodes growing in the Kaliningrad region. The database can be used as a “reference point” for monitoring studies. Another objective is to identify the spatial patterns of iron, manganese, nickel, cadmium, silver, lead, strontium, rubidium, and calcium in the Kaliningrad region. With the help of a regular grid, samples of wild lichens were collected from pine and birch trees, 1. 2 – 1. 8 m from their bases, in August 2010. One- to two-year-old thalli were used in the chemical analysis. The metals Ag, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, Fe, Mn, and Zn were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry AAS (Mn and Fe by flame atomic absorption FA AAS and the others by electro thermal atomisation ETA AAS); the elements Sr, Rb, and Ca were determined by X-ray fluorescence. The concentration of metals in the western coastal area (the Sambian or Kaliningrad Peninsula) is higher than it is in the central and eastern parts of the region. Principal component factor analysis was carried out to detect and characterise different pollution sources. The authors examined the features of spatial distribution of trace elements. The prevailing wind direction is between south and west; therefore, the highest concentrations of trace elements were found on the Sambian peninsula and on the coasts of the Vistula and <b>Curonian</b> <b>Lagoons.</b> The chemical composition of lichens on the Sambian peninsula may have developed under the impact of both local pollution sources—vehicles, thermal energy facilities, and ports—and such factors as trans-boundary traffic and sea spray...|$|R
2500|$|On the {{long-term}} average, the Baltic Sea is ice-covered {{at the annual}} maximum for about 45% of its surface area. The ice-covered area during such a typical winter includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, the archipelago west of Estonia, the Stockholm archipelago, and the Archipelago Sea southwest of Finland. The remainder of the Baltic does not freeze during a normal winter, {{with the exception of}} sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the <b>Curonian</b> <b>Lagoon.</b> The ice reaches its maximum extent in February or March; typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the Bothnian Bay, the northern basin of the Gulf of Bothnia, is about [...] for landfast sea ice.

2500|$|Juodkrantė {{was first}} {{mentioned}} (as Schwarzort) by the Teutonic Knights in 1429 {{in a letter}} describing storm damages. It was initially situated along the Baltic Sea shore, about 2.5km from the present location. In the early 17th century, due to the Black Death, and moving sand dunes threatening to bury the village, it lost almost all of its inhabitants. In the 1680s, the village relocated to its present location along the <b>Curonian</b> <b>Lagoon</b> shore. After 1724, the sources do not mention the village along the Baltic Sea shore any more. The village did quite well in the new location: a tavern was opened in 1673, a school in 1743, and a wooden church in 1795. Until 1740 the village belonged to [...] (Klaipėda County), then from 1740-1795 to Church District [...] (Karvaičiai). It grew in importance after Carwaiten/Karvaičiai/ village was swallowed by traveling sand and {{the seat of the}} Church District relocated here. The wooden church burned down in 1878 but was soon replaced by a red brick Lutheran church in 1885.|$|E
2500|$|The German–Lithuanian border {{had been}} stable since the Treaty of Melno in 1422.

The Klaipėda Region covered , which included the <b>Curonian</b> <b>Lagoon</b> of approximately [...] According to contemporary statistics by Fred Hermann Deu, 71,156 Germans and 67,259 Prussian Lithuanians lived in the region. The idea of uniting Lithuania Minor with Lithuania surfaced during the Lithuanian National Revival of the late 19th century. It was part of the vision to consolidate all ethnic Lithuanian lands into an independent Lithuania. The activists also eyed Klaipėda (Memel), a major sea port in the Baltic Sea. It would become Lithuania's only deep-water access to the sea and having a port was seen as an economic necessity for self-sustainability. On November 30, 1918, twenty-four Prussian Lithuanian activists signed the Act of Tilsit, expressing their desire to unite Lithuania Minor with Lithuania. Based on these considerations, the Lithuanians petitioned the Allies to attach the whole of Lithuania Minor (not limited to Klaipėda Region) to Lithuania. However, at the time Lithuania was not officially recognized by the western powers and not invited into any post-war conferences.|$|E
