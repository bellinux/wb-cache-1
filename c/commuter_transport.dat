The tram system is the only one in the world operated exclusively with double-decker trams, and is one of only three non-heritage tram systems in the world that use double-deck cars the others being Blackpool Tramway, United Kingdom and Alexandria Tram, Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that the project would use the {{majority}} of available national and provincial transport funds in a context where massive amounts were needed to deal with widespread traffic congestion and <b>commuter</b> <b>transport</b> problems nationally and in the province. The existing railway system in the province, under national rather than provincial control, which serves the majority of the population, was severely underfunded and large-scale and violent public unrest caused by inadequate and old trains had manifested in the province. Critics alleged that options like rapid bus transit could achieve similar levels of service {{at a fraction of the}} costs, however, the estimated 62,000 daily riders requires a capacity unfeasible by BRT. [...] These matters were never submitted to a public debate as the project was designed and launched within the confines of the Gauteng Government bureaucracy.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the request}} of company founder William T. Piper, Piper began {{development}} of a six- to eight-seat twin-engined corporate and <b>commuter</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft in 1962 under the project name Inca. The type, now designated the PA-31 and looking like a scaled-up Twin Comanche, was officially announced in late 1964 after its first flight on 30 September that year. It was a low-wing monoplane with a conventional tail, powered by two [...] Lycoming TIO-540-A turbocharged engines in so-called [...] "tiger shark" [...] cowlings, a feature shared with the Twin Comanche and also the PA-23 Aztec. As testing proceeded two cabin windows were added to {{each side of the}} fuselage and the engines moved further forward. The PA-31, now named [...] "Navajo" [...] after a Native American tribe, was not certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) until 24 February 1966, and deliveries did not begin until the following year, after the type was recertified in mid-1966 with an increase in maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) from [...] to [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{individual}} {{opportunity of}} cost is an often overlooked {{cause of the}} rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result {{in an increase in}} demand for a service. Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms {{a major part of the}} total cost of <b>commuter</b> <b>transport,</b> rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption. While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect. [...] Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates. [...] For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.|$|E

Corinne Mulley, the chair of the Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies, described the launch of the card as a [...] "missed opportunity" [...] since, at the time, Opal retained many of the [...] "interchange penalties" [...] of paying for transfers, and Opal was more expensive than MyMulti for some multi-modal <b>commuters.</b> <b>Transport</b> Minister Gladys Berejiklian rejected the criticism, stating that [...] "we believe that customers should pay for the mode they are using".|$|R

Conceptual design studies were performed at {{two levels of}} technology, an advanced general aviation engines sized to provide 186 / 250 shaft kW/hp under cruise conditions at 7620 (25, 000 m/ft) altitude. A follow on study extended the results to larger (2500 hp max.) engine sizes suitable for applications such as <b>commuter</b> <b>transports</b> and helicopters. The study engine designs were derived from relevant engine development background including both prior and recent engine test results using direct injected unthrottled rotary engine technology. Aircraft studies, using these resultant growth engines, define anticipated system effects of the performance and power density improvements for both single engine and twin engine airplanes. The calculated results indicate superior system performance and 27 to 33 percent fuel economy improvement for the rotary engine airplanes as compared to equivalent airframe concept designs with current baseline engines. The research and technology activities required to attain the projected engine performance levels are also discussed. Previously announced in STAR as N 83 - 1891...|$|R
