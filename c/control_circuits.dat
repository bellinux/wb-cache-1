5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and <b>control</b> <b>circuits</b> and power supplies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel single-input {{sampling}} instance <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> used in primary-side controller of Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) without optical-coupler and secondary feedback <b>control</b> <b>circuit.</b> The novel <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is based on}} the idea determining the sampling instance of current switching cycle by the duration of the voltage pulse at the auxiliary wingding during the previous switching cycle. So the sampling instance is always kept constant, as long as the duration of the voltage pulse is not changed. The control deviations resulting from changeful parameters can be reduced. Thus, high controlling accuracy can be achieved. According to the design, the width of the sampling signal is adjustable, which enlarges the range of application. Besides, the characteristic of single-input makes the obtaining of input signal easy. Keyword realized by controlling the dead-time [3]. Each period the controlled variable is sampled and hold before the dead-time coming. The sampling instance is of great significance for the performance of the controller. So it is important to control the sampling instance accurately.
