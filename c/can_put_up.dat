25|$|Regarding invertebrates, the {{burrowing}} owl seems {{less of a}} generalist. It is extremely fond of termites such as Termitidae, and Orthoptera such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) and true crickets (Gryllidae). Bothynus and Dichotomius anaglypticus scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) were eaten far more often than even closely related species by many {{burrowing owl}}s across central São Paulo (Brazil). Similarly, {{it was noted that}} among scorpions Bothriuridae were much preferred, among spiders Lycosidae (wolf spiders), and among millipedes (Diplopoda) certain Diplocheta. Small ground beetles (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as burrowing owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>up.</b> Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beetles which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{mortality}} are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles {{have been killed}} by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings {{are more likely to be}} killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a hind having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being “oiled” by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocida) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of 4 fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.|$|E
500|$|After 10.Qxd2, Tseitlin {{explains}} that [...] "opening manuals assess this position as favourable to White {{on the basis}} of the bishop pair. However, considering the closed nature of the position, White faces substantial difficulties in the realisation of this nominal advantage." [...] Black has not a lot of things to be proud of as there are no targets in White's camp, but <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a lot of resistance thanks to small assets. Black's Ne5 is strongly centralised, attacks the c4-pawn, and restricts the Bf1 from moving to the natural squares d3 and f3. Moreover, exchanging the knight with Bxe5 is not appealing for White, since that would mean losing the advantage of the bishop pair. Also, the Bc8 can sometimes become better than its counterpart the Bf1, if it makes it to the good squares b7 or c6 while the Bf1 remains restricted by the Ne5.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Bianco for USA Today wrote of Chenoweth's guest appearance: [...] "Her presence {{may not make}} much sense, but that's probably all right. If it means hearing Chenoweth sing, we <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with any explanation the show cares to offer." [...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal was equally positive regarding Chenoweth's role, praising her [...] "powerful voice", [...] "kittenish mien" [...] and [...] "commanding presence". Flandez deemed the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] the show's best number since [...] "Don't Stop Believin debuted in the pilot episode. Mike Hale of the New York Times similarly stated that [...] "The Rhodes Not Taken" [...] was [...] "the best episode musically since the pilot", calling the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] "truly rousing".

[...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|During 2008, Aeon {{started to}} work on the next studio album. In January 2009, the band toured in Europe with Hate Eternal, Misery Index and See You Next Tuesday. In September, Carlberg {{departed}} and was replaced by Victor Brandt of Satyricon. The members commented Carlberg's departure: [...] "Being on tour in a not-so-known death metal band like Aeon often means really tough conditions and bad economy. We totally understand that not everyone <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with this way of life." [...] The band subsequently recorded its third studio album, Path of Fire, at Empire Studio in Östersund, Sweden. Nilsson and Dlimi recorded also the bass, because Brandt did not have enough time to learn the songs. The album was mixed the following month at Mana Recording Studios in St, Petersburg, Florida by Erik Rutan. In January 2010, Brandt departed and was replaced by Marcus Edvardsson of Souldrainer and Sanctification.|$|E

2500|$|From 2007 to 2009, Chenoweth played Olive Snook in the {{television}} series, Pushing Daisies.
