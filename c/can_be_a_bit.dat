5|$|The metro {{operates}} with a proof-of-payment system, so riders {{must have}} a valid ticket before entering the station platforms. The system is divided into zones, and the fare structure is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen, including the buses managed by Movia, local DSB trains and the S-train. The system lies within four different zones. Ticket machines are available at all stations, where special tickets for dogs and bicycles can also be purchased. A two-zone ticket costs DKK24, and a three-zone ticket DKK36, and tickets are good for 60 minutes. Holders of the Copenhagen Card museum pass ride free of charge, as do up to two children under twelve years of age accompanied by an adult. As of 2012, the metro has fully adapted to the national electronic fare card system Rejsekort. Outside the Central zones, the outer zones are divided into sub-zones and ticketing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> confusing for visitors familiar with how zones work in London or Berlin. Passengers must specify, on their ticket which sub-zone they wish to travel to.|$|E

[...] Crick {{went on to say that}} Kate was more suited to Mark than Mason and that picking between the two should be a no-brainer. Anthony D. Langford from TheBacklot.com quipped [...] "Oh and he's kind of a goof, but Brennan is really hot." [...] In 2016, Crick (All About Soap) criticised the character for arresting his fiancée on their wedding day, saying [...] "We all know Mark Brennan <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> strait-laced when it comes to being a copper (has there ever been a man in Ramsay Street who takes the law so seriously?), but apprehending your own bride while she's practically waiting at the alter for you...

500|$|Following singer Taylor Swift's win for {{the music}} video [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and {{declared}} that singer Beyoncé deserved the award for her [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] video. He declared, [...] "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm {{going to let you}} finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." [...] West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident. Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from an US urban radio station commented: [...] "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour— urban audiences <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate." [...] Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.|$|E
500|$|Bill Johnson {{compared}} Dragon Warrior {{to modern}} RPGs and noted the game's {{complete lack of}} replay value, which is due {{as much to the}} requirement that almost everything in the game must be done to beat it as to its difficulty. Johnson noted the game's historical importance; he said: [...] " [...] a tough road to walk, but reaching its end will instill a new appreciation of what today's RPG's are all about." [...] The 2009 book Vintage Games contrasted Dragon Warrior to the 1986 NES title The Legend of Zelda; it said, while both titles share common RPG elements, Zelda features a fantasy setting and magic but no level or turn-based combat system, and Dragon Warrior features both. Nintendo Power said the game's historical significance is its greatest aspect, and noted that [...] "playing Dragon Warrior these days <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a chore". GamePro wrote that their favorite aspect of the game was the Elizabethan-English dialogue, and that they were disappointed by its removal in the GBC remake.|$|E

The Itchy and Scratchy one {{is by far the}} best, and Starship Poopers is only really amusing once the Jerry Springer segment begins." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review saying [...] "The series usually rises to the occasion of its Halloween episodes, and “IX” doesn’t disappoint. Each of the three stories satisfies, as they offer a lot of clever, amusing moments. [...] "Toupée" [...] is probably the best, though, as it’s the most creative of the bunch. While funny, the other two <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> predictable." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times wrote that the episode is [...] "certainly not on a par with that all-time doppelganger classic, [...] "Treehouse of Horror VII", [...] still, No. 9's dialogue is sharp and there's reassuring continuity to such beloved institutions as Itchy and Scratchy." ...|$|E

[...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me.

500|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} Chrissie in EastEnders meant that Oberman, more than most, {{had to endure}} the gruelling schedule of working on a soap, taping up to twenty scenes a day. Although she was only in EastEnders for 18 months, such was the centrality of Chrissie to the show and storylines Oberman felt she had done 4 years worth of acting, noting {{that by the time}} of her departure [...] "Chrissie has packed into a year what most soap characters do in three." [...] This all came during a period of great uncertainty for the show; media criticism and negative publicity created immense pressure behind-the-scenes, with large-scale cast culls and speculation in the press and on the set over who may be next. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman described the atmosphere as like a [...] "vacuum", with the cast [...] "just waiting to see what the next stage is – It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> tense but it's exciting. I really don't know what's going to happen." [...] However, the prominent role of Chrissie in the show as it moved forward meant that Oberman came out of the uncertainty with more to show than most, receiving an improved deal and extending her contract for a year, with the BBC's head of drama John Yorke declaring he had [...] "big plans" [...] for Chrissie.|$|E
