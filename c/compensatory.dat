5|$|The Yankees {{have made}} 11 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and 19 <b>compensatory</b> picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Yankees have been awarded <b>compensatory</b> draft choices for failing to sign first round picks Tyrell Godwin (1997) and Gerrit Cole (2008). Though the Yankees also failed to sign Mark Prior (1998), they were not awarded a <b>compensatory</b> pick, as Prior was chosen with the pick received for Godwin, and <b>compensatory</b> rules only allow for one compensation pick for failing to sign a player. The Yankees have also surrendered 10 first round picks due to free agent signings.|$|E
