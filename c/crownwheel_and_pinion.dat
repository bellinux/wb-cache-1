50|$|On lap two Clark {{went off}} and dropped {{to the rear of}} the field, while Hulme and Stewart managed to pass Bandini into the lead after he too slipped on Brabham's oil. Hulme stayed in front until the sixth lap when Stewart swept past, until his <b>crownwheel</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> broke on lap 14. Hulme re-took the lead. The race settled down with Bandini second, McLaren third, after the {{departure}} of Surtees, with an engine failure. Clark's heroic battle from 14th up to fourth ended with broken shock absorber on lap 43.This promoted Chris Amon to fourth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the resistance to rolling contact fatigue of a-C:H:W and MoS 2 /Ti coated gears. The investigation of rolling contact fatigue was realised by means of a gear test rig using FZG PT C/ 10 / 90 pitting test. Four material combinations of gears were tested: wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> uncoated, wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated, wheel coated <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> uncoated as well as wheel uncoated <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated. The tests were performed using for lubrication mineral gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level and 80 W/ 90 viscosity grade. The results indicate that for the coated/coated pair (wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated) <b>and</b> uncoated/coated pair (uncoated wheel <b>and</b> coated <b>pinion)</b> a significant decrease in the fatigue life compared to the uncoated gears was obtained. The best results were obtained in the case of the coated/uncoated pair (a-C:H:W coated wheel <b>and</b> uncoated <b>pinion)</b> – even fourfold increase in the fatigue life was observed. This shows a very high potential of application of PVD coatings for gears...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion.</b> In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering assay is reasonable.

50|$|Portal axles (or portal gear) are an offroad {{technology}} {{where the}} axle tube {{is above the}} center of the wheel hub and where there is a reduction gearbox in the hub. This gives two advantages: ground clearance is increased, particularly beneath the low-slung differential housing of the main axles; and secondly the hub gearing allows the axle halfshafts to drive the same power but at reduced torque (by using higher shaft speed). This reduces load on the axle <b>crownwheel</b> <b>and</b> differential.|$|R

The benefit is the larger ring gear, better angle cut on the teeth and Dana 60 diameter pinion shaft.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimum synthesis of Ackermann, rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>and</b> centre lever steering mechanisms using Hookes and Jeeves optimization. The objective {{function of the}} optimisation comprises of steering error. The length of the steering arm has been assumed as one-fifth of the wheel track for all cases. The steering error, transmission angle and mechanical advantages of these steering mechanisms have been compared. It {{has been found that}} the rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> steering mechanism produces the least steering error. The transmission angle and mechanical advantage of the centre lever steering mechanism are most favourable. A suggestion has been made to replace the existing Ackermann steering mechanism for long wheelbase vehicles by a central outrigger type leading rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> steering mechanism.
