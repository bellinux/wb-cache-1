Potential savings in computation are very large (perhaps six orders of magnitude in some cases) and important implications exists for modeling and computational analysis. It is to be noted that once we realize that we can be less constrained by the mathematics by removing the necessity of techniques such as linearization, perturbation, or discretization to make analysis and computation of the models feasible and practical; we become able to develop more sophisticated and realistic models. Modeling effectively means retention of essential features while striving for simplicity so that the resulting equations can be solved.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the one-exciton {{absorption}} spectrum is considered for the lattice of two-level interacting atoms whose initial energy splitting depends on the coordinate. It is shown that for some types of interatomic interaction, this problem {{can be reduced to}} a differential equation of Schrodinger type, which, in some cases, can be solved in closed form. By way of example, problems on the one dimensional chain having an initial splitting jump and on the spherical cluster are solved. In both cases analitical solutions are obtained, which considerably reduce the time required for calculations of one-dimensional systems and permit the calculation of three-dimensional spherical clusters, whereas the numerical calculation becomes impossible for the clusters with a radius larger than ten lattice constants. The spectra calculated for small systems completely coincide with the spectra obtained by means of numerical diagonalization.

40|$|AbstractTo {{implement}} {{for large}} inventory systems becomes rather cumbersome because each item requires managements of order cycle and quantity. The inventory control problem is greatly simplified {{as only a}} few groups rather than many items {{will have to be}} controlled. This method is the ABC analysis. A. K.

The grouping scheme can thus be viewed as a simple process of dividing the items into optimal ranges of the PDHC values. Further the order cycle grouping is shown to be, usually, superior to the order quantity grouping scheme.
