In this study, strengthening the frames of chairs includes stretcher and bracket {{used in the}} control samples.

One-piece and two-piece type chairs have an important advantage in comparison with control samples, if only the front to back load is noted.

30|$|Performance {{of chairs}} can be {{clarified}} by {{the behavior of}} component parts. In addition, loading type is effective {{on the behavior of}} component parts. In this study, chairs are made from straight and curved parts. In practice, chairs with curved parts are under tension or compression load. Various failure modes of curved parts were different between tension load and compression load. Compression loads are applied to entirely <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> of one-piece type (b) when the chairs are subjected to the top to down load or the front to back load. Tension failure locations of <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> have occurred in the bottom. But shear failure modes appeared in <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> of two-piece type (a) when the chairs are subjected to the front to back load. Two curved dimensional parts were separated under tension load. The shear failure locations of <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> were found in the front-curved legs. The various failure modes of curved parts are shown in Fig.  13. Since performance of chairs is similar to curved samples, and these properties are known in the initial step of the study and step of performance test of chairs, the first step in this study was performed to identify the behavior of component parts in the chairs.|$|E
30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to build a chair resistant to force from front to back. To achieve this goal, poplar wood was treated with heat and steam, and then curved at an angle of 90 °. <b>Curved</b> <b>frame</b> was used for manufacturing chairs. In this study, three different designs of chairs were used. Control sample is a chair of custom type. The first design was a chair with a <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> forming the structure back down to bottom (one-piece type) and the second design with two curved parts (two-piece type). Front to back load tests were conducted by mechanical universal testing machine in accordance with DIN EN 1729 - 2 standard. For each design, the test was repeated three times. The results of the experiment showed that differences between the designs were significant. The full type chairs were broken at the load about 1725  N, but the partial type chairs at about 1421  N. For the top to bottom load test, the full type chairs were broken at about 1052  N, other chairs were more resistant. In general, by introducing a design using the <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> made of treated poplar, the resistance of chairs is improved.|$|E

40|$|Aspects of {{curved beam}} effects and their {{importance}} in designing composite frame structures are discussed. The curved beam effect induces radial flange loadings {{which in turn}} causes flange curling. This curling increases the axial flange stresses and induces transverse bending. These effects are more important in composite structures due to their general inability to redistribute stresses by general yielding, such as in metal structures. A detailed finite element analysis was conducted and used {{in the design of}} composite <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> specimens. Five specimens were statically tested and compared with predicted and test strains. The <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> effects must be accurately accounted for to avoid premature fracture; finite element methods can accurately predict most of the stresses and no elastic relief from curved beam effects occurred in the composite frames tested.

However, with all the advantages of <b>curved</b> <b>frames</b> with glulam beams their using is constrained by imperfect methods of stress analysis based on the principles of calculation of structures with solid wood. The need for careful study and improvement of methods of calculation of <b>Curved</b> <b>frames</b> determines the relevance of researched topic. Aim: The aim of this research is to study the numerous researches of pilot frame for further improving of methods of stress analysis in the cornice nodes of <b>curved</b> <b>frames.</b> Materials and Methods: In order to achieve this goal the theoretical displacements and component stress state were determined using experimental elastic characteristics of the frames material. Glulam beams compared to a solid closer to trans tropic design scheme of symmetry, according to which the mechanical and elastic properties of building materials in planes perpendicular direction along the wood fibers are equivalent. For reliable determination of the parameters of the stress-strain state in the elements of any shape, getting of quality pictures of stress distribution {{along the length of the}} frame and establishing patterns of changes in stress in the composition of the assembly, the software system LIRA-CAD has been used, where a model of orthogonal anisotropy (orthotropy) in the plate finite elements has been realized. Results: Analyzing the results, we can conclude that the overall coincidence between theoretical and experimental data is satisfactory. Arguably, the strained state of frames obtained by theoretical calculation with taking into account the real physical and mechanical characteristics of the experimental designs material is significant. Given that in the compressed-bending elements the additional bending moment on the normal force is a function of movement, we can assume that this calculation method of finite elements in LIRA-CAD allows satisfactorily determine the tension in view of the deformed circuit frames and anisotropy of physical and mechanical properties of glulam beams...|$|R

40|$|The Big Bang {{paradigm}} observed {{universe is}} hypothesised as virtual lens effect. The observer’s flat light cone used {{to observe the}} sky would generate this by intersecting an actual curved, static and spatially closed cosmos. Its curved space-time would have tilting time axis and be fractal in time. The Hubble length is the only empirical data input needed in the topology, tangent to the <b>curved</b> <b>frame</b> at 60 ◦ time axis tilting from the observer, for reciprocal transferability between curved space-time and lens effect. This specifies a 30 ◦ angle between the space axis and {{the speed of light}} c vector, and a 60 ◦ angle between the time axis and the speed of light c vector. These allow measuring the <b>curved</b> <b>frame.</b> Here, brightness would discount fractality remaining unaffected, while redshift would be affected.

30|$|The formula {{coefficients}} of MOE and MOR are 0.25 and 1.5 {{that are related}} to straight pieces. According to formulation, the MOE and MOR for curved sample under tension or compression loads have more estimated quantity than value amount of the control samples, whereas the MOE and MOR of curved sample are decreased for applied load through the formatting processes. The front to back loads of one-piece and two-piece type chairs as shown in Fig.  12 are improved. The increasing strength of chairs with <b>curved</b> <b>frames</b> is due to their design and less number of joints when compared with custom chairs. Note that this chair has a better performance than custom chair where the loading is applied under front to back. The one-piece type chairs (B) are less strong than other chairs when the loading is applied under top to down. The legs of chairs have a key role against top to down load. The bending properties of curved samples are decreased for the combined effect such as pressure and high temperature. But the strength and stability of structures like a chair with <b>curved</b> <b>frames</b> are more than the custom chairs. The effect of curved components on the chair is shown in the loading diagram (Fig.  12). The stiffness and strength of chair B with two <b>curved</b> <b>frames</b> (one-piece type chair) as shown in Fig.  12 have improved when compared to the loading diagram of the custom chair.|$|R
