After arranging to meet Wozniak in his dorm room (whereupon the latter noted Draper's disheveled appearance and body odor), he began to teach his phone phreaking skills to Wozniak and one of his friends, Steve Jobs; a phone phreaking business formed by Wozniak and Jobs presaged the eventual emergence of Apple.

We also demonstrate how the simulator-independent modeling framework PyNN can transparently take advantage of this, passing a connection description through to the simulator layer for rapid processing in C++ where a simulator supports the <b>connection</b> generator <b>interface</b> and falling-back to slower iteration in Python otherwise.

40|$|Full-wave de-embedding {{refers to}} a network de-embedding {{technique}} in which the fixture effects are removed by characterizing any <b>connection</b> <b>interface</b> using a full-wave EM simulation method instead of by measurement alone. This technique is able to achieve consistent definition of equivalent circuit voltage and current when the de-embedded results are used for EM/circuit cosimulation. Adopting this approach, we describe an improved full-wave de-embedding method for characterizing one-port devices, where multiple redundant fixtures with mutually complementary properties are used to minimize the effects of random errors. Based on a linearized error model, the proposed method is able to improve the de-embedding accuracy over a broad frequency range, particularly when the device under test is reconfigurable. The proposed method is verified through the de-embedding of a surface-mount p-i-n diode, for which numerical and experimental results are provided. We also compare our technique with the thru-reflect-line method, and {{the results show that}} full-wave de-embedding can be more reliable in developing device models for accurate EM/circuit cosimulation purposes. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Large {{power modules}} include several {{parallel}} mounted chips per switch to raise active area and current. By the electro-mechanical <b>connection</b> <b>interface,</b> the resulting large parasitic inductance {{is a huge}} problem especially for very fast switching SiC devices [1]. This challenge is handled by many approaches e. g.

In this paper we demonstrate an approach to enable excellent switching performance with conventional power module technologies: By using a recently developed monolithic silicon RC (Si-RC) element [4] to decouple the bus bar, this problem can be solved in a very efficient way. The Si-RC element is assembled directly adjacent to the power switches on the DBC. This allows a significant reduction of the SiC chip area by minimizing the power losses ca used by the switching transients from the parasitic DClink and module inductances...|$|E
30|$|The {{other point}} {{which should be}} noted is that the {{reference}} model which is {{the representative of the}} classical code-based SW can only tolerate forces up to 500 kN and severe damage has occurred at the wall base, in which the system cannot be even repaired and is fully out of service after the cyclic test. On the other hand, the proposed models have tolerated around 560 – 750 kN of lateral loading and based on the observation, no specific damage was monitored in the SW; however, the external steel plates which were connected to the base steel chassis were yielded that can be easily replaced after the experiment. In case of more severe loadings, the steel bolts at <b>connection</b> <b>interface</b> may fail as well, which can be replaced with the new ones as well, but such the case is not observed in the current investigation.
