Gambari.|$|E
5000|$|The Hague Institute and the Stimson Center, {{based in}} Washington, DC {{gathered}} [...] "a {{select group of}} eminent statespersons and public intellectuals" [...] to address global threats and challenges related to fragile states, climate change and the <b>cyber-economy.</b> The Commission convened consultations online {{and around the world}} to facilitate a report which complements the UN Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals agenda, the UN Peacebuilding Architecture, the Fourth Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague, and the UN Conference on Parties on Climate Change in Paris.|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{has created}} a blossoming <b>cyber-economy</b> and {{a new way of}} {{conducting}} business. Unfortunately for those looking for jurisdictional certainty, however, cyberspace also effectively eliminates geographic boundaries. The unprecedented circumstances set by this new frontier have put federal courts in the unenviable position of deciding whether Internet-based cases meet diversity jurisdiction requirements. Examining the constitutional history and recent use of diversity, this Note argues that the Founders did not foresee an era where every contract or sales case would end up in federal court; rather, they intended diversity jurisdiction to be a rare and perhaps temporary proposition. The author argues that the potential of Internet-based contacts to throw a large number of cases into federal court could overburden the federal system. This Note suggests that the solution to this problem lies in courts following the Founder 2 ̆ 7 s intent...|$|E
50|$|Two {{important}} elements, {{absent from}} The Third Wave, are (1) the explicit tie-in to Cyberspace and {{the surge of}} new technologies that have cropped up {{since the time of}} The Third Wave (e.g. YouTube, social networking, <b>cyber-economies,</b> the Internet, itself, etc.), (2) the beginnings of an account of just what kind of economy may come to replace the monetary system.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} 2 ̆ 2 {{advertising}} injury 2 ̆ 2 coverage in general liability policies has been shrinking {{in response to}} the proliferation of liabilities caused by the growth of the <b>cyber-economy.</b> In response to this shrinking coverage under general liability policies, insurers have been quick to develop new endorsements and specialized products to fill the gaps in coverage. The author argues that significant commercial risks relating to unfair competition claims have been eliminated from coverage under general liability policies, but that there also appears to be no corresponding development of specific endorsements or stand-alone products to deal with this gap in coverage. Specifically, claims against former employees who establish a competing enterprise are unlikely to be covered under the newest revisions of language in general liability policies. The author notes that these liabilities can be crippling to a new enterprise, and suggests that these new enterprises may be surprised to find that these commercial liabilites are not covered by their liability insurance package...|$|E
40|$|The new economy, {{also called}} e -economy, {{is the most}} {{frequently}} used term in economic and technicalliterature, discussions of scientists, businessmen and politicians beside globalization and information technologysociety. Three planes of understanding of the new economy can be distinguished: as a system of new principlesexplaining how economic subjects function on the market; as activities of economic subjects in the strongly changedconditions. Owing to the dynamic development of technical progress, especially in information technology economicsubjects change completely strategy of their activities many times. Information and knowledge as main economiccategories, which are the basis of the contemporary business, are the foundation of acti vity another term is assigned tothis understanding, namely knowledge -based-economy. The third plane, new economy treated as a subject, namelydetermining activities of an enterprise in the IT sector. Therefore, the new economy, also called <b>cyber-economy,</b> constitutes a new paradigm of business. On thisvirtual market E-business is a new form of an exchange of resources by means of information technology systems andinternet technologies, conducted on-line through electronic connections and an informatio n exchange by use ofelectronic multimedia such as Internet, cable and satellite television, telephony, electronic cards, Intra and Extranet atthe national and international level...|$|E
