50|$|As an {{alternative}} to conducting human visual inspections, an <b>alarmed</b> <b>carrier</b> PDS may be constructed to automate the inspection process through electronic monitoring with an alarm system. In an <b>Alarmed</b> <b>Carrier</b> PDS, the carrier system is “alarmed” with specialized optical fibers deployed within the conduit {{for the purpose of}} sensing acoustic vibrations that usually occur when an intrusion is being attempted on the conduit in order {{to gain access to the}} cables.|$|R
50|$|Legacy <b>alarmed</b> <b>carrier</b> systems {{monitor the}} carrier {{containing}} the cables being protected. More advanced systems monitor the fibers within, or intrinsic to, the cables being protected to turn those cables into sensors, which detect intrusion attempts.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{government}} organization, utilizing an <b>alarmed</b> <b>carrier</b> PDS in conjunction with interlocking armored cable may, in some cases, allow {{for the elimination of}} the carrier systems altogether. In these instances, the cables being protected can be installed in existing conveyance (wire basket, ladder rack) or suspended cabling (on D-rings, J-Hooks, etc.).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{compositional semantics}} (operational, denotational and logical) for a process algebra enhanced with input/output actions and preemption combinators, {{in the presence}} of fairness. The context of this paper is Triveni, a process-algebra-based design methodology that combines threads and events in the context of object-oriented programming [CJJ 98 a, CJJ 98 b]. Triveni has been realized as an API, JavaTriveni [CJJ 98 a], in the Java programming language. A case study in JavaTriveni is described in [CJJ 98 b], involving the re-implementation of a piece of telecommunication software [...] the <b>Carrier</b> Group <b>Alarms</b> (CGA) software of Lucent Technologies' 5 ESS switc...|$|R
50|$|Middle 20th century analog carrier systems had <b>Carrier</b> Group <b>Alarms</b> {{by which}} {{the failure of a}} pilot signal was alerted to {{telephone}} exchange equipment, imposing an automated make-busy condition so the trunks carried by the failed system would not be used. The improved AIS originated with the T-carrier system, and became a standard feature of subsequent plesiochronous and synchronous circuit-based communication systems, and is also part of the ATM standards.As the use of Ethernet for long-distance data links has increased, the need for a similar end-to-end OA&M function has {{led to the development of}} a similar Ethernet alarm indication signal (EthAIS).|$|R
50|$|These {{alarm states}} are also lumped under the term <b>Carrier</b> Group <b>Alarm</b> (CGA). The meaning of CGA is that {{connectivity}} on the digital carrier has failed. The {{result of the}} CGA condition varies depending on the equipment function. Voice equipment typically coerces the robbed bits for signaling to a state {{that will result in}} the far end properly handling the condition, while applying an often different state to the customer equipment connected to the alarmed equipment. Simultaneously, the customer data is often coerced to a 0x7F pattern, signifying a zero-voltage condition on voice equipment. Data equipment usually passes whatever data may be present, if any, leaving it to the customer equipment to deal with the condition.|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{interest}} has been {{show in the}} development and application of real time On-The-Fly (OTF) kinematic GPS. A major error source and limitation of such a positioning technique is that caused by cycle slips. When these occur, the integer ambiguities must be resolved for, which can take hundreds of epochs to complete depending on satellite availability and geometry. This research has focused on investigating the applications of real time OTF GPS, as well as its limitations and precision, which has been shown in the thesis to be precise to a few millimetres. The limitations of such a system at present include the use of UHF telemetry links, which at best have a line of sight range of - 10 km. The research has shown that alternatives are required, and the use of a relay station can prove invaluable. Cycle slips are another major limiting factor when using OTF GPS, as once a cycle slip occurs, it can either be corrected for or the integer ambiguities resolved for. The second option can take hundreds of seconds, depending on the algorithms used and the satellite number and geometry. This research has partly focused on the development of software which will instantaneously detect and correct for cycle slips in high rate GPS data. The applications of real time OTF GPS are numerous. Research has been carried out to investigate its use to monitor and control construction plant as well as monitoring the movement of large structures. As OTF positioning is precise to a few millimetres, it is ideal for the control of construction plant, and has been compared to laser levelling and precise digital levelling. Such a GPS system gives the user a 3 -dimensional position for the bulldozer blade, for example. Such information can prove invaluable for quality control as well as developing an automated system, which would be controlled by real time OTF GPS. In addition, real time OTF GPS has been shown in the research to provide instantaneous positioning of large structures in the form of bridges. Such information could provide future systems which would monitor the structure for dangerous movements, resulting in a failure <b>alarm.</b> <b>Carrier</b> phase kinematic GPS has previously been shown to work over baseline lengths of < 20 km. The use of Multiple Reference Stations (MRS) has been shown in this research to enable OTF GPS to be applied over longer baseline lengths, with a precision in the order of 12 cm over 132 km...|$|R
