40|$|<b>Coordinate</b> <b>{{relation}}</b> {{refers to}} the relation between instances of a concept and {{the relation between the}} directly hyponyms of a concept. In this paper, we focus on the task of extracting terms which are coordinate with a user given seed term in Chinese, and grouping the terms which belong to different concepts if the seed term has several meanings. We propose a semi-supervised method that integrates manually defined linguistic patterns and automatically learned semi-structural patterns to extract coordinate terms in Chinese from web search results. In addition, terms are grouped into different concepts based on their co-occurring terms and contexts. We further calculate the saliency scores of extracted terms and rank them accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method generates results with high quality and wide coverage. Comment: This paper was written several years ag...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article takes {{issue with}} the {{traditional}} view of English compounds such as governess-cum- piano-teacher, according to which the medial morpheme -cum- is insignificant. The study is first centered on {{the appearance of the}} linking element in the English language. New insight into its distribution and function is then provided by scrutinizing a list of 259 compounds extracted from a present-day newspaper corpus. It is found that -cum- appears exclusively in non-institutionalized coordinate nominal and adjectival compounds and that it plays a distinctive role which sets -cum- compounds apart from asyndetic compounds: the linking element is predominantly used in complex compounds to simultaneously mark the internal boundary (boundaries) within the construction and the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relation</b> that holds between the compounding elements. The discussion finally focuses on the status of -cum-, which appears to be a hybrid syntactic-morphological unit of present-day English...|$|E
40|$|The <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> {{hypothesis}} theorizes {{that the}} recognition system that mediates most basic-level object recognition is a structural description that represents shape using categorical relations whereas the recognition system that mediates face recognition represents shape via a <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> representation. According to the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis, the factor determining which visual recognition system mediates a given recognition task is the computational {{demands of the}} task. According to the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis, if the visual recognition task requires distinctions to be made among stimuli that share the same structural description, then the task will be performed by the face recognition system. Further, the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis predicts that any task requiring discrimination between objects that share the same structural description should be difficult for prosopagnosics because their coordinate system has been damaged, because according to the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis, prosopagnosia results from damage to the coordinate recognition system which is required for any task that cannot be performed using a structural description representation;Experiments 1, 2, and 3 compared a prosopagnosic 2 ̆ 7 s ability to distinguish stimuli that either shared a common structural description or did not: discriminating animals, real objects, and nonsense objects. In all cases, the prosopagnosic showed massive problems with any task that required discrimination within a structural description just as predicted by the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis. The purpose of Experiment 4 was {{to see if the}} prosopagnosic showed a deficit on a Kosslyn metric judgment task but not on a categorical judgment task. Once again, the prosopagnosic had significantly more difficulty with coordinate tasks indicating that the same neural mechanism may mediate coordinate tasks regardless of whether the visual recognition task involves coding the position of the primitives in the representation used for object recognition or judging the spatial distance between two different objects;The <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis correctly predicted the results of all of the experiments. That is, just as predicted by <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis, LB made significantly more errors than the controls on those trials that required discrimination within a structural description, but not on those trials that could be accomplished on the basis of structural descriptions...|$|R
40|$|Casner (2006) {{tested the}} ability of a prosopagnosic, LB, to {{discriminate}} objects that would require the use of the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> recognition system posited by Cooper and Wojan. Casner reported that the prosopagnosic, LB, was impaired in <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> tasks, but did not differ significantly from controls in all tasks that only required categorical recognition. However, Farah, Levinson, and Klein (1995) reported on a patient who was not impaired at discriminating eyeglasses, a task for which the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis would predict an impairment. The present study replicated Farah et al. 2 ̆ 7 s paradigm with the prosopagnosic, LB. One experiment found that LB, relative to controls, was significantly impaired when discriminating eyeglasses requiring the use of a <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> recognition system rather than a categorical recognition system, however, the other experiment failed to find such a difference. Two experiments results may have arisen from a strategy that LB developed used...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to describe and test a framework (the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis) for understanding the types of shape representations and recognition tasks that are mediated in dissociable neural subsystems. The results from Experiment 1 demonstrate {{that there is a}} right hemisphere advantage for recognizing upright animals, but that inverting animals eliminates the right hemisphere advantage for basic-level animal recognition. The results of Experiment 2 showed that there is a right hemisphere advantage for physically discriminating objects that differ only in their metric properties but {{that there is not a}} right hemisphere advantage for objects that can be discriminated using a structural description. Experiment 3 tested whether showing the metric change objects at different orientations eliminates the right hemisphere advantage for the metric change trials. Experiment 4 was designed to investigate the effects of metric vs. geon changes in priming. Unfortunately, the results of Experiments 3 and 4 were inconclusive (possibly due to a lack of statistical power). Although the results of Experiments 3 and 4 were inconclusive, Experiments 1 and 2 provide strong evidence for the <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> hypothesis and are inconsistent with other current hypotheses regarding the neural subsystems for visual recognition. The results thus suggest that one subsystem mediates structural description representations and subserves any recognition tasks that can be performed using a structural description and the other subsystem mediates <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> representations, and mediates recognition tasks that require a <b>coordinate</b> <b>relations</b> representation...|$|R
40|$|Transverse trace-free (TT) tensors play an {{important}} role in the initial conditions of numerical relativity, containing two of the component freedoms. Expressing a TT tensor entirely, by the choice of two scalar potentials, is not a trivial task however. Assuming the added condition of axial symmetry, expressions are given in both spherical and cylindrical coordinates, for TT tensors in flat space. A <b>coordinate</b> <b>relation</b> is then calculated between the scalar potentials of each coordinate system. This is extended to a non-flat space, though only one potential is found. The remaining equations are reduced to form a second order partial differential equation in two of the tensor components. With the axially symmetric flat space tensors, the choice of potentials giving Bowen-York conformal curvatures, are derived. A restriction is found for the potentials which ensure an axially symmetric TT tensor, which is regular at the origin, and conditions on the potentials, which give an axially symmetric TT tensor with a spherically symmetric scalar product, are also derived. A comparison is made of the extrinsic curvatures of the exact Kerr solution and numerical Bowen-York solution for axially symmetric black hole space-times. The Brill wave, believed to act as the difference between the Kerr and Bowen-York space-times, is also studied, with an approximate numerical solution found for a mass-factor, under different amplitudes of the metric...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{relations}} are commonly divided in two global classes. Categorical relations concern abstract relations which define areas of spatial equivalence, whereas coordinate {{relations are}} metric and concern exact distances. Categorical and <b>coordinate</b> <b>relation</b> processing {{are thought to}} rely on at least partially separate neurocognitive mechanisms, as reflected by differential lateralization patterns, in particular in the parietal cortex. In this study we address this textbook principle from a new angle. We studied retinotopic activation in early visual cortex, {{as a reflection of}} attentional distribution, in a spatial working memory task with either a categorical or a coordinate instruction. Participants were asked to memorize a dot position, with regard to a central cross, and to indicate whether a subsequent dot position matched the first dot position, either categorically (opposite quadrant of the cross) or coordinately (same distance to the centre of the cross). BOLD responses across the retinotopic maps of V 1, V 2, and V 3 indicate that the spatial distribution of cortical activity was different for categorical and coordinate instructions throughout the retention interval; a more local focus was found during categorical processing, whereas focus was more global for coordinate processing. This effect was strongest for V 3, approached significance in V 2 and was absent in V 1. Furthermore, during stimulus presentation the two instructions led to different levels of activation in V 3 during stimulus encoding; a stronger increase in activity was found for categorica...|$|E
40|$|A task {{is set to}} {{determine}} dimensional tolerances of matching elements of a long line to meet requirements for transmission signal mode. The line {{is characterized by the}} standing wave ratio (SWR) while the matching element is characterized by the reactive conductivity. In full matching SWR is equal to unit. Changing conductivity of an element leads to SWR change. An approximate relationship between these changes in vicinity of full matching mode is derived. The approximation error is estimated. At the same time, the matching element design and dimensions define its conductivity. Therefore a SWR deviation from the unit can be expressed through the dimensional tolerances. The appropriate calculation is performed for a rectangular waveguide with a diaphragm as a matching element. Symmetric diaphragms of inductive and capacitor types are considered. Such diaphragms contain only one varied size, i. e. window width. Besides, an important condition for matching is the choice of a point where the matching element is installed in the line. Therefore a variation of the diaphragm coordinate in the waveguide also was taken into account. The paper derives a relationship of the SWR deviation from the unit with dimensional tolerance of window and error of <b>coordinate.</b> <b>Relation</b> analysis showed that the limiting values of tolerance and error drastically depend both on the initial value of SWR before matching, and on its final value after the installation of matching diaphragm. Both types of diaphragms are compared with each other. It is found that the inductive diaphragm is characterized by a greater dimensional tolerance of window than the capacitive one. The results of the work can be used in designing the microwave lines with high requirements for matching...|$|E
