40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{published}} reports {{have studied the}} epidemiology and magnetic resonance imaging findings associated with rotator cuff <b>contusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoulder in professional football players. PURPOSE: To determine a single professional football team 2 ̆ 7 s incidence, treatment, and magnetic resonance imaging appearance of players sustaining rotator cuff <b>contusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoulder. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: From 1999 to 2005, a North American professional football team 2 ̆ 7 s injury records were retrospectively reviewed for athletes who had sustained a rotator cuff <b>contusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoulder during in-season participation. Those patients who had magnetic resonance imaging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoulder with a 1. 5 -Tesla magnet were reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist and graded according to the appearance and severity of clinical injury.

500|$|<b>The</b> {{small head}} <b>of</b> Massospondylus was {{approximately}} half <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur. Numerous openings, or fenestrae, in <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> reduced its weight and provided space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. These fenestrae {{were present in}} pairs, {{one on each side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> At <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> were two large, elliptical nares, which were roughly half <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbits. The orbits were proportionally larger in Massospondylus than in related genera, such as Plateosaurus. The antorbital fenestrae, smaller than those seen in Plateosaurus, were situated between the eyes and the nose. At <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> were two more pairs <b>of</b> temporal fenestrae: <b>the</b> lateral temporal fenestrae immediately behind the eye sockets, which were shaped like an inverted [...] "T" [...] in Massospondylus, and the supratemporal fenestrae on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> Small fenestrae also penetrated each mandible. <b>The</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> is traditionally restored as wider and shorter than that of Plateosaurus, but this appearance may be due just to differential crushing experienced by the various specimens. Some features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> are variable between individuals; for example, <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit and <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior maxilla.
