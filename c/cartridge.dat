5|$|In 2002 and 2003, NATO {{conducted}} {{a series of}} tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW <b>cartridge</b> as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum <b>cartridge.</b> The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> and the 4.6×30mm <b>cartridge,</b> which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge,</b> citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> was {{designed}} {{in response to}} NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum <b>cartridge.</b> According to the NATO requirement, the new <b>cartridge</b> was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm <b>cartridge.</b> Additionally, {{it was to be}} capable of penetrating body armor. FN Herstal responded to the NATO requirement by developing the 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> and two associated weapons: the FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked <b>cartridge</b> it uses. The 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum <b>cartridge,</b> which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The <b>cartridge</b> has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30percent less recoil than the 9×19mm <b>cartridge,</b> improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E

50|$|Many {{fountain}} pen manufacturers have {{developed their own}} proprietary <b>cartridges,</b> for example Parker, Lamy, Sheaffer, Cross, Sailor, Platinum, Platignum, Waterman and Namiki. Fountain pens from Aurora, Hero, Duke and Uranus accept the same <b>cartridges</b> and converters that Parker uses and vice versa (Lamy <b>cartridges,</b> though not officially, are known to interchange with Parker <b>cartridges</b> also). <b>Cartridges</b> of Aurora are slightly different from <b>cartridges</b> by Parker.|$|R
5|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{originally}} planned {{as a single}} game. However, time was limited and the manufacturing costs of a 34-megabit <b>cartridge</b> with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Sonic Team split the game in half, giving the developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the cost between two cartridges. The <b>cartridge</b> has {{a small amount of}} non-volatile RAM built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the game <b>cartridge.</b> Sega planned to release a single <b>cartridge</b> version of both games titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition, though it was eventually cancelled for unknown reasons; a prototype ROM image of this version was leaked in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra {{ammunition}} less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm <b>cartridge</b> also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The <b>cartridge</b> has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm <b>cartridge,</b> improving controllability.

5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape <b>cartridge.</b> 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 <b>cartridge,</b> {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak <b>cartridge</b> was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac <b>cartridge,</b> which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E

5000|$|... "Compatible", [...] "generic", or [...] "alternative brand" [...] are <b>cartridges</b> {{manufactured}} by third party companies and sold under different brand names. Compatible <b>cartridges</b> may vary slightly in look, design and page yield to their OEM counterparts, sometimes due to patents or design copyrights. Generic <b>cartridges</b> are cheaper, often significantly so, than original manufacturer <b>cartridges.</b> They {{may be less}} reliable, depending upon the manufacturer. Some contain more toner than OEM <b>cartridges,</b> printing more pages. Some compatible toner <b>cartridges</b> may be of similar quality to their OEM competitors, but many are not.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of these}} <b>cartridges</b> (e.g. the [...]45-70) are {{developmental}} descendants of very early black-powder metallic <b>cartridges.</b> When metallic <b>cartridges</b> and lever-actions were first invented, very small, portable kits were developed for hand-reloading and bullet-molding (so called [...] "cowboy reloading kits"). These kits {{are still available}} for most low-pressure lever-action <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, Canon, Dell, HP, and Lexmark <b>cartridges</b> are not {{difficult}} to refill, though some Lexmark <b>cartridges</b> employ a built-in counter chip that can't be reset; Epson <b>cartridges</b> and some newer Brother <b>cartridges</b> also have a built-in counter chip, however {{it is possible to}} purchase a chip resetter for these models. Since older Brother <b>cartridges</b> generally lack any chip and consist of merely a sack of ink, they can be readily refilled.|$|R

Double-action revolvers are designed to use rimmed <b>cartridges,</b> and the extractors are incapable of removing rimless <b>cartridges.</b> Because of this fact, a different method of extraction must be used. Moon clips are a full circle, and hold a full cylinder of <b>cartridges,</b> while half-moon clips are semicircles that hold half a cylinder full of <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since 2012, Federal <b>Cartridge</b> Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this <b>cartridge</b> uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical {{in that it}} does not use a copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the <b>cartridge</b> relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the <b>cartridge</b> is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned <b>cartridge</b> and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with the}} actual console units, the game <b>cartridges</b> {{themselves}} evolved over {{the first year of}} the console's release. The first generation of <b>cartridges</b> were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called [...] "tabbed" [...] or [...] "ridged", used the same basic design as the original <b>cartridges</b> with the addition of two small tabs on the <b>cartridge's</b> underside to aid in removal. The original flat style <b>cartridges</b> could be stacked on top of the newer <b>cartridges,</b> but the newer <b>cartridges</b> could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the [...] "curved lip" [...] style was produced, and all official and third-party <b>cartridges</b> during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.|$|R

50|$|Since Camerica still lacked Nintendo's {{license to}} produce NES games, {{they had to}} create their own <b>cartridges</b> that would bypass Nintendo's {{lock-out}} chip. Like the circuit used in Color Dreams <b>cartridges,</b> Camerica's workaround generates glitch pulses that freeze the lock-out chip. The <b>cartridges</b> they made are shaped and colored slightly differently from Nintendo's official <b>cartridges,</b> though they still fit in the NES. All Camerica <b>cartridges</b> were originally produced gold colored, and later silver. They feature a switch for use with European NES consoles.|$|R
5|$|The {{creation}} of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle <b>cartridge</b> {{was introduced in the}} 1950s as a standard firearm <b>cartridge</b> among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO <b>cartridge,</b> was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO. Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.|$|E

5000|$|... ====Large printer <b>cartridges</b> ban==== After the October 2010 cargo planes bomb plot, {{in which}} cargo {{containing}} laser printers with toner <b>cartridges</b> filled with explosives were discovered on separate cargo planes, the U.S. prohibited passengers from carrying certain printer <b>cartridges</b> on flights. The TSA {{said it would}} ban toner and ink <b>cartridges</b> weighing over 16 ounces (453 grams) from all passenger flights. The ban applies to both carry-on bags and checked bags, and does not affect average travelers, whose toner <b>cartridges</b> are generally lighter.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{external}} bacterial contamination of local anaesthetic <b>cartridges</b> from newly opened and open containers was examined.

However, {{the total number of}} colonies grown from open containers was significantly higher than that from freshly opened ones. It was concluded that where local anaesthetic <b>cartridges</b> are bulk-packed in containers, strict infection control measures are to be instituted in clinical practice. We suggest that these include keeping containers tightly capped, removing <b>cartridges</b> only when needed, using forceps to handle <b>cartridges</b> and swabbing <b>cartridges</b> with alcohol prior to loading into syringes.
