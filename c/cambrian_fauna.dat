50|$|Stephen Jay Gould's book Wonderful Life, {{published}} in 1989, brought the Burgess Shale fossils to the public's attention.

40|$|Abstract – Based on rich {{material}} (381 specimens examined) {{from two}} <b>Cambrian</b> echinoderm <b>faunas,</b> the early <b>Cambrian</b> Balang <b>fauna</b> and middle <b>Cambrian</b> Kaili <b>fauna</b> in Guizhou Province, South China, the taphonomy of gogiid echinoderms {{is described in}} detail, and the preservation of stereomic microstructure and organic remains of Cambrian gogiid echinoderms is reported {{here for the first}} time. Taphonomic considerations include entombment patterns, decay sequences, individual-specific diagenetic histories, unusual burial postures, selective disarticulation patterns, and post-mortem elongation. In particular, five categories of gogiid entombment patterns are proposed to describe the multi-directional orientations recorded at the burial time of articulated gogiids. Gogiid-bearing slabs of Guizhou material primarily (70 %) display the type 2 entombment pattern (articulated gogiids preservedwith fan-shaped brachioles); thus, most Guizhou gogiids were buried with brachioles preserved in feeding posture during obrution events. Balang gogiid faunas contain the oldest evidence of palaeoecological interactions among echinoderms and other indigenous taxa. In addition to pre-burial and post-burial decay, other potential causes for unusual disarticulation patterns exhibited by the gogiids from the lower Cambrian Balang Formation include pre-burial bio-disturbance and post-burial bioturbation based on ichnogenera, including Rusophycus and Planolites.

5000|$|Preston Cloud was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to systematically recognise {{the importance of the}} rich fossils of the Cambrian rocks in evolutionary terms.

Although his innovative thinking was largely ignored at the time, extensive research on the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>fauna</b> since the late 1970s, such as the fossils of the Burgess Shale, has established that the bio-geological event is a true documentation of the evolutionary origins of the animals, especially the body plans of modern animals.|$|E
5000|$|In chapter 10, Sterelny {{discusses}} the fossil evidence of <b>Cambrian</b> <b>fauna,</b> {{and how this}} provides the basis for Gould's challenge to gradualistic orthodoxy. About 543 million years ago, {{at the base of}} the Cambrian, the Ediacaran fauna, characterised by small shelly fossils, fossilised tracks, and burrows, apparently disappeared. From available evidence, diversity of fauna was very limited at the beginning of the Cambrian Period. [...] "By the middle of the Cambrian, about 520 million years ago, animal life was rich and diverse", (p. 116) as demonstrated by the Maotianshan Shales fossils, in Chengjiang, China, which [...] "are as spectacular as the Burgess Shale fauna, and significantly older." [...] (p. 116) [...] "Thus the fossil record seems to show that most of the major animal groups appeared simultaneously. In the 'Cambrian explosion', we find segmented worms, velvet worms, starfish and their allies, molluscs (bivalves, snails, squid and their relatives), sponges, brachiopods and other shelled animals appearing all at once, with their basic organisation, organ systems and sensory mechanisms already operational." [...] (p. 116) [...] "This explosive evolutionary radiation of the Cambrian seems to be unique. Plants seem to have arisen somewhat more gradually ... nor was there a similar radiation when animals invaded the land ... the colonisation of the land saw no new ways of making an animal." [...] (p. 117) Despite adaptations, the basic body plans remain recognisable. One possibility is that the 'Cambrian explosion' is [...] "an illusion generated by the failure of earlier Precambrian fossils to survive to our times," [...] (p. 117) that there is a long history of hidden evolution preceding the appearance of multi-celled animals in the fossil record. [...] "This remains a live option. There are fossil embryos of animals from China dating to about 570 million years ago", (p. 120) and there are many animal lineages for which there is no fossil record, possibly due to being small and soft-bodied, so leaving no detectable traces. Certainly Precambrian animal life is evidenced by the Ediacaran fossils, but the relationship between fauna from these two periods remains unclear. Gould was inclined to support the view that the Ediacaran fauna became wholly extinct prior to the Cambrian, thus were not Cambrian ancestors, [...] "hence their existence does not extend the timeframe of animal evolution into the Precambrian".

40|$|A diverse fauna of helcionelloid molluscs, hyoliths, {{and other}} small shelly fossils is {{described}} from limestone layers within the Forteau Formation of the Bonne Bay region in western Newfoundland. The fauna is dominated by internal moulds of various molluscs and tubular problematica, but also includes hyolith opercula, echinoderm ossicles, and other calcareous small shelly fossils preserved by phosphatisation. Originally organophosphatic shells are comparatively rare, but are represented by brachiopods, hyolithelminths, and tommotiids. The fauna is similar to other late Early <b>Cambrian</b> <b>faunas</b> from slope and outer shelf settings along the eastern margin of Laurentia and may be of middle Dyeran age.

40|$|A recent {{discovery}} {{confirms the}} presence of damesellid trilobites in a late Middle <b>Cambrian</b> <b>fauna</b> from near Beaconsfield. Jago (1980) illustrated and briefly discussed a poorly-preserved late Middle <b>Cambrian</b> <b>fauna</b> from near Beaconsfield, which was discovered by Green (1959). In February 1980, Professor d. Green, Dr M. R. Banks and a party of geology students from the University­ of Tasmania collected further fossils from this locality. The fossils include the best preserved specimen (Plate 1, figs. 1 and 2) so far found at this locality.

Of the specimens figured in Jago (1980) the cranidium figured in pl. 1, fig. 17 and the pygidium figured in pl. 1, fig. 21 probably belong in the same species as the newly discovered cranidium. As far as can be deter­mined, the Beaconsfield specimens probably belong in a new genus of the Damesellidae, which is characterized by a substantial spine emerging from the posterior margin of the occipita 1 ring and a glabel 1 a, with a broadly rounded anterior, which stops well short of the anterior margin of the cranidium.

The ultrastructure of the tube in Sabelliditida recognized for the first time by Urbanek, 1976 (in press), reveals that the wall of the tube is composed of two almost homogenous layers- the outer one and the inner one, and of the middle distinctly laminar layer. Characteristic wrinkles on the outer surface of the tube are made solely of the outer layer which is almost homogenous or with faint traces of some lammiation. The tubes in all Pogonophora under study display an entirely laminar structure. Wrinkles observed on certain areas of the tube are due to foldings involving nu-merous layers of the tube wall.
