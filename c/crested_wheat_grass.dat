40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{find out}} the effect of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> on {{aluminum}} induced Alzheimer's disease in Wistar rats. MethodsMemory impairment was induced by aluminum chloride (4. 2 mg/kg, i. p.) for 28 d. Memory function was assessed by Morris water maze test. To study the activity of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (100 mg/kg, p. o.), Wistar rats were administered it for 28 d along with aluminum chloride. Biochemical parameters of oxidative stress were estimated in brain after the treatment. ResultsThe major {{finding of this study}} is that aluminum enhanced oxidative stress. <b>Wheat</b> <b>grass</b> showed a significant improvement in reduction of this oxidative stress by reduction of malondialdehyde levels and enhancement of superoxide dismutase and catalase levels. ConclusionsThe present study clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> that shows good antioxidant properties, and this remarkable effect of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> may act as a key to treat Alzheimer's disease...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{preservation}} of the mound's original shape is the lush, autochthonous vegetation which covers it. As the most of the land in Vojvodina is being used for extensive agriculture for centuries, Kinđa represents a genetic reserve for the original steppe and meadow flora. As the foothills of the mound are not being cultivated, the vegetation on top is not being nitrified, nor the weeds are invading it because of the pre-vegetation which grows slightly above the ground. On the top of the mound there are small turfs of <b>crested</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>grass,</b> the typical grass of the loess ledges. European feather grass also grows on the mound, though it is mostly extinct from other parts of Banat. Other plants include common couch and horehound. Vegetation on other mounds in the surrounding area is destroyed and turned into an agricultural land.|$|E

A lower level of protein (20 % - 6. 7 % NPN) /fat (15 % - 20 %) combination supplement also increased gain over controls, but the supplement response was less than the higher protein supplement. Gain responses were greater during {{the latter part of the}} grazing season when forage quality was poorest. Supplementation intake varied but tended to be greater during the latter part of the grazing season. The control summer grazing cattle that gained at a slower rate did not compensate and gain faster when finished after the summer grazing season.

40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} {{measurements were}} used to determine seasonal changes of water vapor flux in juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum) communities in the Great Basin over the entire growing seasons of 2002 and 2003. In both years there was variation in water vapor fluxes between the sites and across seasons. Sagebrush and juniper were able to continue to use water over the entire growing season, while crested wheatgrass became senescent and stopped transpiration early in the summer. Total LE values for the spring period of 2002 were very similar at all sites. Precipitation was lower during the spring of 2003 which resulted in significantly higher water fluxes from juniper and sage compared to crested wheatgrass, presumably due to better access to deep water by sagebrush and juniper compared to <b>crested</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>grass.</b> Evapo-transpiration fluxes decreased during the summer at all sites. However, the juniper and sagebrush communities remained physiologically active throughout the summer and into fall while crested wheatgrass senesced. The water vapor fluxes responded to intermittent rain events in the summer. The length of the responses was longer for juniper and sage, since they were physiologically active. Juniper and sage were able to respond to rain events in the fall. Although the general seasonal changes of evapo-transpiration showed some similarity at each site, the timing and details of water use varied among species...|$|E

Spectroradiometers can measure nitrogen and water stress, and subsequent adjustments in applications can improve crop yield and reduce over-application. Two portable spectroradiometers and their accompanying software were compared for accuracy and ease of use while conducting experiments to determine water and nitrogen stress in <b>crested</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> and soybean plants. The first unit was a higher priced ($ 40, 000) visible/NIR triple diodespectroradiometer (ASD FieldSpec Pro JR) with a range of 350 - 2500 nm. It uses ASD’sFieldSpec Pro RS 3 software. The second was a low-priced ($ 3600) visible/NIR fixed diode spectroradiometer (Apogee/StellarNet SPEC-PAR/NIR) with a range of 350 - 950 nm. It comes with StellarNet’s SpectraWiz software. The study focused on the software provided by the two manufacturers because the most noticeable differences were software-based. Comparisons were made to determine if the advantages of the ASD spectroradiometer and its software justified their substantially higher cost. The StellarNet SpectraWiz software was much more user-friendly and conveniently designed than the ASD software, which appeared outdated and time consuming to operate. However, results indicate that the ASD hardware is easier to use and simpler to configure than the Apogee/StellarNet model and that the FieldSpec Pro’s increased range was advantageous for water stress analysis. However, both spectroradiometers showed similar consistency within the 350 - 900 nm range...|$|E
40|$|Global {{climate change}} has drawn the {{attention}} of the public and professionals, alike, due to a host of human health and environmental implications. Researchers have studied, and continue to study, a wide variety of environmental implications, including effects on ecosystems and biodiversity, sea level rise, agriculture, and precipitation. How microbial life on earth is affected by global climate change is not well understood. The following research proposal represents an attempt to better understand the affects of global climate change, particularly precipitation changes, on microbial diversity. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has maintained soil plots of variable soil types, precipitation conditions, and vegetation cover for more than 15 years. We sampled a subset of these plots that encompassed three different precipitation regimes (ambient, 2 X summer, and 2 X fall/spring), across two different plant communities (native sagebrush mix consisting of a variety of shrubs, grasses, and forbs and <b>crested</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> monoculture), and at two different depths, 15 - 20 cm and 95 - 100 cm deep, all within the same soil type. Replicate samples were obtained from separate plots for each treatment to ensure sampling was representative of the microbial life present. We are utilizing terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (TRFLP) to analyze the soil microbial community composition to obtain insight into how global climate change, particularly altered precipitation patterns, impacts microbial diversity and plant-microbe interactions. This work is on-going and we expect to observe significant precipitation treatment effects in the shallow (i. e. 15 - 20 cm) samples and differences with respect to plant community type. These data will be evaluated along with a suite of other measures to assess how long-term alteration in precipitation patterns affects soil microbial community structure and function...|$|E
40|$|The {{operating}} costs for farms and ranches in the United States have increased 81 percent between 1970 and 1976. Calf prices over this same period have fluctuated dramatically and have fallen {{from a high}} of $ 58 /cwt in 1973 to a low of $ 2 6 / cwt in 1975. Since 1973, the increasing {{operating costs}} have exceeded the returns gene rated by the low calf prices and have left operators in a negative financial position. This case study has shown that the operator has increased both the scale and efficiency of his operation through improved lives tock husbandry and range improvements, yet has been unable {{to keep up with the}} increase in operating costs. A res t rot at ion grazing system and associated range improvements were implemented in 1970 on the summer mountain range. The resultant increase in forage prod uction allowed a 45 percent increase in the breeding herd. The meadow hayland and <b>crested</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> pastures were also improved to provide winter and spring forage for the increased number of cows. The calf crop weaned and average weaning weights increased from 86 percent and 347 pound s i n 1970 to 93 percent and 363 pounds i n 1976. The total pounds of calf weaned increased 60 percent between 1970 and 1976. The tremendous increase in beef production was offset by the rampant increase in op e rating costs. The net return in 1970 was $ 2, lOo but dropped to a loss of - $ 3, 671 i n 1976. However, had the operator not increased the level of production while the operating costs increased, his net loss in 1976 would have been - $ 24, 718. Although the net returns a re negative, the increase in returns over the base level of production is positive. The internal rate of return and net present worth of the grazing system and its associated improvements was 25 percent and $ 95, 027 respectively. TI 1 e operator has been successful in developing his range and livestock resource and increasing calf production. It is paradoxical that the increase in returns above the base production have rendered the improvements economically profit able yet the combination of increasing operating costs and low livestock prices have produced a negative return from 1974 through 1976...|$|E

By way of introduction, Isern notes that his musings are not intended 2 ̆ 2 to argue fine points or push grand theses. 2 ̆ 2 And while he hopes that 2 ̆ 2 careful readers will notice some strong themes threaded through the work, 2 ̆ 2 they are 2 ̆ 2 ancillary to the main purpose of the book. The main purpose of the book is not conversion, but delight. The Great Plains are a neat place. We need to remind one another of that now and then. 2 ̆ 2 Isern 2 ̆ 7 s celebration of the Great Plains is laced with a sense of optimism; survival, renewal, and a strong undercurrent of the spiritual beauty of this place we call home run through Dakota Circle. The volume, however, is not so much ethereal in the sense of Kathleen Norris 2 ̆ 7 s Dakota, as it is earthly and experiential in the form of John Steinbeck 2 ̆ 7 s Travels with Charley, William Least Heat Moon 2 ̆ 7 s Blue Highways, or Bill Bryson 2 ̆ 7 s A Walk in the Woods. Along the pathway to the understanding of place that Isern provides, we meet the likes of Ernie Zahn (Velva, North Dakota), skunk trapper and coyote hunter extraordinaire; Bill Krumwiede (Voltaire, North Dakota), collector of Rumely oil-pull tractors and threshing machines; Elmer and Ardy Wilhelm (Arthur, North Dakota), fence post decorators; the Kuehn clan (Glendive, Montana), harvesters of paddlefish caviar; and the residents of Lemmon, South Dakota, loving conservators of a village of petrified wood. Beyond the residents of the Great Plains, Isern presents the region’s physicality.

40|$|The {{educational}} program of agricultural extension {{was conducted in}} Cherry County during 1940 by the Cherry County Extension Service. 329 families and business firms subscribed 1529. 15 for support of the work. The county commissioners provided office quarters {{at a cost of}} 258. 00 for the year. Other income provided 80. 00 additional funds making a total operating fund of 1867. 15. Expenditures for the year were 255. 00 for office quarters, heat and light, 89. 60 finance committee expense, and 1824. 14 for conducting the general program. The program of work directed special emphasis to F-F-L, Beef Cattle, 4 -H and Project club work. Test plats of sorghum varieties showed Leoti as superior to other varieties with a green weight yield of 9. 5 tons. This compares with 8 tons for black amber, 7. 2 tons for early sumac with other varieties scaling considerably lower. Grain sorghums were again unsuccessful because of early freezing weather. Results obtained by the Valentine Experiment station do not show enough superiority of hybrid corn over local varieties to justify the added expense. One good stand of Hardistan alfalfa has survived dry weather and is a profitable seed crop. Experimental seedings of strawberry clover in alkali spots; red top, timothy, red and alsike clovers, reed canary grass in wet meadows; and <b>crested</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> for dry abandoned cropland areas are being conducted. Greater success with the vegetable garden has been reported by 150 farm and ranch homes due to this year 2 ̆ 7 s Extension program. Timely help for all gardeners in the county has been given. Yard beautification improvements were made in not less than 400 yards at the homes of Cherry County ranchers, farmers, and townspeople, {{as a result of the}} attention given to this phase of the Extension program during 1940. Records were made of some of these improvements. 89 homes followed recommendations for planting shrubs and trees. 98 homes planted new lawns or improved existing lawns according to recommendations made. 69 homes corrected walks, drives, and fences to improve the appearance of their home yards. 80 new yard fences were constructed. 50 yard fences were changed. 88 unsightly views were screened with hedges or constructed screens. 286 homes reported a general clean-up on their yards. These records were obtained as a part of the yard beautification demonstration for project clubs. In addition it is known that many other improvements were made of which no records were taken. 52 cooperators planted 23, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings to form windbreaks. 113 farmers planted trees as a part of their compliance with the Agricultural Conservation cropland program on 335 acres of windbreak. 81 homemakers reported planting trees for erosion control as a part of the home demonstration program for women 2 ̆ 7 s project clubs. 75 homes in the town of Valentine cooperated with a plan developed by the Junior Chamber of Commerce to stimulate interest in tree planting. There is some duplication in these reports obtained through the above mentioned sources. It is conservatively estimated that 265 different plantings of trees were made during 1940. This number compares with 140 for 1939 when estimated on the same basis. 108 homes were repaired. Major repairs were made in 8 homes; 1 water system was installed; 2 light plants placed; 2 poultry houses constructed; 1 complete new barn constructed; built-in kitchen cabinets were installed in 2 homes; 1 house was remodeled; copies were made of a feature of 40 hay equipment machines; 21 chicken feeders and mail boxes were completed as 4 -H projects. 4 meadows were drained; 1 meadow and 5 garden irrigation systems were installed. These reports of accomplishments are listed as those definitely assisted by the Extension program during 1940. Help with poultry rations was extended to 68 turkey growers and a few chicken growers. Regular monthly turkey bulletins prepared at the state office in Lincoln were forwarded by this office to the turkey growers in the county. 38 farm security clients were given assistance to increase production and improve the quality of milk and cream. The county fair, a spring and fall show sponsored by the Northwest Hereford Breeders 2 ̆ 7 Association, a district calf show at Mullen serving the south part of Cherry County, were exhibits for competitive quality improvement. These were the methods employed to bring to the attention of ranchers in the county the possibilities for beef cattle herd improvement. Nearly every rancher in the county was given information concerning control of Bang 2 ̆ 7 s Disease, hemorrhagic, and such specific troubles as calf diptheria, foul foot, retention of urine, grass tetany, white scours, and blackleg. Office interviews, discussion meetings, and circular mailings were the methods used. Assistance to the Sandhills Feeder Cattle Producers 2 ̆ 7 Association and other livestock organizations in the county was given both by the state office and the county Extension office. With over 42, 000 head of feeder cattle, and the offerings of purebred breeders, it is estimated that the total value of livestock sold by individuals participating in these organizations is in excess of 3, 500, 000. 00 for 1940. Rations and feeding practices came under discussion in office interviews, at meetings, and at farm and ranch visits. Soybean cake vs. cottonseed cake as a source of protein was given particular attention. Our recommendations were that soybean cake should be fed in preference to cottonseed cake when the latter is 4. 00 or more per ton higher in price than the former. When soybean cake is fed, phosphorus mineral should be offered ad lib. Sheep feed requirements for wintering, care of the ewe at lambing time, stomach worm control, and wool marketing information was given to 90 sheep growers in the county. 77 farmers and ranchers cooperated in the 1940 Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. Each contributed an outline of his methods. This program was conducted as a research or study of management methods as found on the ranches when visited. 243 weekly news stories concerning the Extension program in Cherry County were submitted to all or a part of 5 newspapers published in the county, and 6 published at stations outside the county borders. 55 circular letters announcing events or discussing subject matter were mailed. 1926 personal letters were written from the county office. 409 ladies enrolled in 31 project clubs for the year 1939 - 1940. Training centers for leaders were conducted at Valentine, Merriman, Gordon, Hyannis, Mullen, and Thedford. 15 clubs were represented at the Valentine Center, 7 at Merriman, 4 at Gordon, 3 at Hyannis, and 3 at Mullen. At Thedford, members from Cherry County enrolled in Thomas County clubs. The demonstrations given this year were Read for Facts and Sing for Fun, Company Dinners, Merry Christmas for the Home, Table Service, Care and Repair of Walls and Floors, and The Livable Home. 21 4 -H clubs were organized. 104 boys and 70 girls enrolled for 196 projects. In addition 29 associate members enrolled for as many projects. Of these associate members enrolled 13 were boys and 16 were girls. 62 boys and 39 girls finished their projects as achievement members. In addition 13 associate members earned achievement certificates. The county Extension office was given charge of the 4 -H, handicraft, floral, project club, foods and needlework divisions of the exhibit section of the county fair. Assistance was given by the Extension leaders in the crops and poultry divisions and in a general livestock exhibit. 22 communities participated in programs of entertainment, recreation, and discussion of timely economic topics. A series of 16 such community gatherings in 14 communities was conducted during the fall. The title 2 ̆ 2 Community Roundups 2 ̆ 2 was coined to designate a type of these special community events. A total attendance of 3700 was recorded for the events both spring and fall. In addition 4 project club achievement days with an attendance of 727; 2 rural youth meetings with an attendance of 300, and 1 recreation meeting sponsored by the Kennedy community with an attendance of over 100, were conducted. The question of 2 ̆ 2 Shall an appropriation be made annually from the general fund of the county for the support of Agricultural Extension work? 2 ̆ 2 received approval at the November 5 election. The final canvass of ballots totaled 2399 for and 1655 against. This method of financing will be much simpler than the method followed heretofore of soliciting for volunteer subscriptions. It will remove much of the difficulties which have confronted the directors and called for a great deal of their attention. This change will also eliminate the need for constant attention to finances by the office personnel...|$|E

Application of 250 and 500 g/h Trinexapac ethyl decreased plant height by 21. 23 percent and 31. 85 percent respectively. Application of Trinexapac ethyl improved plant height, tillering and chlorophyll level. In contrast, chlorophyll level was decreased substantially under traffic treatment and this treatment did not affect <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> density and tillering significantly. Under 500 g/h Trinexapac ethyl treatment, tillering was increased by 36 percent compared with under control condition one. Results showed that Trinexapac ethyl application and traffic increased dissolved carbohydrates of root and shoot significantly. As a result, {{it was found that}} <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> is a traffic resistant plant and it seems that the use of Trinexapac ethyl increases plant resistance to traffic stres...|$|R
50|$|A {{survey of}} the farm {{was carried out in}} 1794, and it is {{interesting}} to note that many of the fields had the same shape and the same name as they have today. The crops grown at this time were oats, barley, <b>wheat,</b> <b>grass,</b> clover and rape.|$|R

50|$|Along with {{associated}} species, {{like big}} sage and western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass,</b> rubber rabbitbrush {{is a significant}} source of food for browsing wildlife on winter ranges. Dense stands of this species often grow on poorly managed rangelands, in disturbed areas along roadways and on abandoned agricultural property.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>grass</b> can {{be traced}} back in history over 5000 years, to ancient Egypt and perhaps even early Mesopotamian civilizations. It is purported that ancient Egyptians found sacred the young leafy blades of wheat and prized them for their {{positive}} effect on their health and vitality.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Seven {{to eight}} days germinated plants of Triticum aestivum (<b>wheat</b> <b>grass)</b> are {{a rich source}} of vitamin A, C, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, sulphur, cobalt, zinc and protein. Traditionally the aqueous extract of T. aestivum was {{reported}} {{to be used as a}} health tonic in folk and ayurvedic medicine. We previously reported that aqueous extract of T. aestivum was found to reduce the blood transfusion requirement in iron overloaded Thalassemia and Myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Our objective was to extract and purify active ingredients from <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> and study their mode of action in stabilizing hemoglobin level in those patients. Design and Method: Active ingredients of <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> were extracted and purified by cation exchange column chromatography followed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. In vitro experiments with phenylhydrazine treated red blood cell hemolysate were carried out before and after treatment of purified fraction of T. aestivum to study iron chelating activity. Result: Purified fraction of T. aestivum treated red blood cell showed significant inhibition of free reactive iron production and formation of thio-barbituric acid reactive substances when compared to desferrioxamine treated hemolysate. Conclusion: Iron chelating activity of purified fraction of T. aestivum, an inexpensive, easily available source, is very promising for further clinical trial and development of oral iron chelator drug for Thalassemia, Myelodysplastic syndrome and other iron overloaded diseases...|$|R
25|$|There are {{numerous}} grasses and sedges in the fescue prairie. Gravelly and rocky terrain {{is a good}} location for parry oat grass. Dry areas favour June, porcupine and spear grass. Wet areas are often covered with slender <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> and timber oat grass. Prairie rose and snowberry are common shrubs found in these grasslands.|$|R
40|$|Many {{profound}} changes in mid-continental grasslands {{have resulted from}} the recent extended drought. In the prairies of eastern Nebraska, Kansas and South Dakota, the earlier continuous stands of bluestem (Andropogon scoparius and A. furcatus) have often been greatly fragmented and now occur as relict patches a few square feet to many square rods in extent. Loss of approximately 95 per cent of little bluestem has left the prairie cover very open. Over large areas, except for weeds and a few surviving grasses and forbs, the soil was bared (Weaver, Stoddart and Noll, 1935; Weaver and Albertson, 1939). Grasses more xerophytic than the bluestems have greatly increased, notably needle grass (Stipa spartea), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis) and western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> (Agropyron smithii). The <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> has entirely replaced other grasses in many prairies and is such a vigorous competitor for water that its invasion into countless relict areas of weakened bluestems has gradually resulted in their disappearance together {{with most of the}} accompanying forbs...|$|R
40|$|Selenium (Se) is a {{potential}} soil contaminant {{in many parts of}} the world where it can pose a health risk to livestock and wildlife. Phosphate ore mining in Southeast Idaho has resulted in numerous waste rock dumps revegetated with forages to stabilize the dumps and support grazing. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.), and western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass</b> [Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) A. Löve] are the dominant forage species on these lands. To demonstrate the feasibility of using sulfur (S) as a soil amendment to restrict plant Se uptake, 3 kg pots containing 50 : 50 w/w soil and waste shale were uniformly mixed with 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 Mg ha− 1 S as either elemental S or gypsum. Pots were seeded with alfalfa or western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass.</b> Dry mass and tissue Se were monitored over several clippings. Soils were sampled at the conclusion of the study and analyzed for water-soluble, oxalate-extractable, and total Se. Sulfur amendments as either elemental S or gypsum at 1. 0 Mg ha− 1 or greater equally suppressed Se uptake over 60 % in both forage species. Alfalfa accumulated more Se than western <b>wheat</b> <b>grass.</b> Plant removal via successive clippings resulted in lower tissue Se accumulation over time than the use of S soil amendments alone. Alfalfa-planted soils contained lower water-soluble and oxalate-extractable Se than did the non-planted controls while western wheat grass-planted soils contained lower water-soluble Se. Applying S to these shale-based soils may be an economically viable option for treating Se-impacted, revegetated lands...|$|R
