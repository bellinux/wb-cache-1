In a new spirit of cooperation, the Security Council established larger and more complex UN peacekeeping missions, often to help implement <b>comprehensive</b> <b>peace</b> agreements between belligerents in intra-State conflicts and civil wars. Furthermore, peacekeeping came to involve more and more non-military elements that ensured the proper functioning of civic functions, such as elections.

It set out broad principles to guide negotiations between Israel and the Arab states. It also established guidelines for a West Bank–Gaza transitional regime of full autonomy for the Palestinians residing in these territories, and for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. The treaty was signed 26 March 1979 by Begin and Sadat, with President Carter signing as witness. Under the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in April 1982. The final piece of territory to be repatriated was Taba, adjacent to Eilat, returned in 1989. The Arab League reacted to the peace treaty by suspending Egypt from the organization and moving its headquarters from Cairo to Tunis. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic fundamentalist members of the Egyptian army who opposed peace with Israel. Following the agreement Israel and Egypt became the two largest recipients of U.S. military and financial aid (Iraq and Afghanistan have now overtaken them).|$|E

50|$|The Dutch Republic {{made some}} limited {{territorial}} {{gains in the}} Spanish Netherlands but {{did not succeed in}} regaining the entire territory lost before 1590. The end result of the war therefore was a permanent split of the Habsburg Netherlands into two parts: the territory of the Republic roughly corresponds with present-day Netherlands and the Spanish Netherlands corresponds approximately with present-day Belgium, Luxembourg and Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Overseas, the Dutch Republic gained, through the intermediary of its two chartered companies, the United East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (WIC), important colonial possessions, largely at the expense of Portugal. The peace settlement was part of the <b>comprehensive</b> 1648 <b>Peace</b> of Westphalia, which formally separated the Dutch Republic from the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of the conflict, and as a consequence of its fiscal-military innovations, the Dutch Republic emerged as a Great Power, whereas the Spanish Empire lost its European hegemonic status.|$|R

40|$|Main question: "What are {{the main}} {{obstacles}} to a settlement of the Israeli-Syrian conflict and how can the US contribute as a mediator to its settlement?" Abstract: Middle East politics has drawn much attention {{from the rest of}} the world. Several wars have been fought between the Arab states and Israel since the formation of the Jewish State in 1948. The end of the Cold War opened a "window of opportunities" in favor of peace achievements in the Middle East. When Israel and the PLO signed a peace agreement, followed by an Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty the year after, it gave new hope to those who had longed for a <b>comprehensive</b> Arab-Israeli <b>peace.</b> But several difficult conflicts remain to be settled before this becomes a reality. The Israeli-Syrian conflict is often regarded the key to a <b>comprehensive</b> Arab-Israeli <b>peace.</b> The Israeli-Syrian negotiations were stalled just before the Israeli elections in 1996 and reentered a stalemate. If a solution to this conflict is found it may have significant spillover-effects on the Arab-Israeli relations in general. As in a doctor-patient situation, the illness must be diagnosed before the right treatment or cure can be given with regard to a conflict. Hence, a problem diagnosis should be carried out in order to identify the core issues and political factors hindering the settlement of the Israeli-Syrian conflict. The core conflict in the Israeli-Syrian conflict is in this study considered to be the Golan Heights and relevant issue linkages. Hence, four variables are analyzed in order to determine the problem type of this particular case: military-security, settlements, water resources and issue-linkages, e. g. the Palestinian issue and Lebanon. A problem diagnosis should not only aim to identify the problem type or the nature of the main obstacles in Israeli-Syrian conflict, but should also identify the international, regional and national context in which it operates. When the Israeli-Syrian conflict has been given the right diagnosis, it is also possible to analyze problem-solving measures. In this study the problem solving analysis is defined as the potential of the United States to contribute as a mediator to the settlement of the Israeli-Syrian conflict. Five aspects of US mediation are discussed: preconditions for mediation, mediator typology, mediator motivation, mediator impartiality or acceptability and finally; implementation and monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Persian Gulf region is, in all likelihood, {{going to remain}} crucial to American interests through the next several decades. The world depends on the petroleum reserves of the Gulf region to fuel its economic engine. The recent history of the region has been rife with conflict, and the U. S. has had to intervene militarily on several occasions to ensure its vital interests were protected. This thesis examines the strategic circumstances in the Gulf region and ways in which American political, diplomatic, and military policy can help shape the environment to conform to its interests. Several scenarios are developed which attempt to forecast the results of different environments on regional stability. The thesis reaches {{the conclusion that the}} United States must take a proactive role if its short- and long-term interests are to be protected. The short-term goal of U.
