50|$|While {{celestial}} navigation {{is becoming increasingly}} redundant {{with the advent of}} inexpensive and highly accurate satellite navigation receivers (GPS), it was used extensively in aviation until the 1960s, and marine navigation until quite recently. However; since a prudent mariner never relies on any sole means of fixing his position, many national maritime authorities still require deck officers to show knowledge of {{celestial navigation}} in examinations, primarily as a backup for electronic/satellite navigation. One of the most common current usages of celestial navigation aboard large merchant vessels is for <b>compass</b> <b>calibration</b> and error checking at sea when no terrestrial references are available.|$|E
5000|$|Employed at East Coast {{ports and}} {{operating}} areas, {{ranging from the}} Southern Drill Grounds to the Caribbean, Antares, like other naval vessels, occasionally gathered oceanographic data {{in the course of}} her voyages; she re-plotted landmarks for range finder and <b>compass</b> <b>calibration</b> charts, furnishing the Hydrographic Office with data needed to complete the calibration chart of Culebra, Puerto Rico, during the fiscal year 1924. During this time period, Antares participated in fleet concentrations and maneuvers in Cuban waters and in the Panama Canal Zone. Antares brought the planes of Utility Squadron 2 (VJ-2) back to Naval Air Station (NAS), Hampton Roads, following the winter maneuvers in 1925, and for the winter maneuvers of 1926, transported three assembled and one crated plane from VJ-2 to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, where they towed sleeve targets for the Scouting Fleet's cruisers. Antares then transported VJ-2 to Coco Solo, and from there back to Guantanamo Bay. She again served as an aviation transport that summer, returning to Cuban waters in company with the repair ship [...] From 1 January 1934, Antares served as a supply ship for the Special Service Squadron and, from January to March 1935, as a Mobile Base for the Fleet Marine Force. She then operated in the Caribbean until 1 June 1936 under orders of the Chief of Naval Operations. Placed in reduced commission as of 4 June, Antares served as receiving ship at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.|$|E

After participating in salvage operations, Grebe returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 22 July to resume radio <b>compass</b> station <b>calibration</b> and other duties. From there she made a round trip to Norfolk, Virginia, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone which occupied her from 1 December 1921 until 18 March 1922, {{when she returned to}} Portsmouth. There she decommissioned 12 May 1922.|$|R
40|$|Migratory birds use {{compass systems}} {{derived from the}} {{geomagnetic}} field, the stars, the sun and polarized light patterns. We tested whether birds use a single underlying reference system for <b>calibration</b> of these <b>compasses</b> and, specifically, whether sunset and sunrise polarized light cues from {{the region of the}} sky near the horizon are used to calibrate the magnetic compass. We carried out orientation experiments with Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, in Alaska during autumn migration 2005, and compared the magnetic orientations of individual birds before and after exposure to conflicting information between magnetic and celestial cues. Birds exposed to an artificially shifted polarization pattern (± 90 ° shift relative to the natural condition) for 1 h at local sunrise or sunset recalibrated their magnetic compass, but only when given access to the artificial polarization pattern near the horizon. Birds exposed to a 90 ° clockwise-shifted magnetic field for 1 h at solar noon did not recalibrate their magnetic compass. These results indicate that migratory birds calibrate their magnetic compass using the skylight polarization pattern vertically intersecting the horizon at sunrise and sunset. In conjunction with earlier work showing that sun and star <b>compass</b> <b>calibrations</b> are secondarily derived from magnetic and polarized light cues, our findings suggest that polarized light cues near the horizon at sunrise and sunset provide the primary calibration reference for the compass systems of migratory songbirds...|$|R

40|$|Cue-conflict {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} study the <b>compass</b> <b>calibration</b> of one predominantly diurnal migrant, the dunnock (Prunella modularis), and two species of nocturnal passerine migrants, the sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), and the European robin (Erithacus rubecula) during autumn migration in South Sweden. The birds ’ orientation was recorded in circular cages under natural clear and simulated overcast skies in the local geomagnetic field, and thereafter the birds were exposed to a cue-conflict situation where the horizontal component of the magnetic field (mN) was shifted + 90 ˚ or 290 ˚ at two occasions, one session starting shortly after sunrise and the other ca. 90 min before sunset and lasting for 60 min. The patterns of the degree and angle of skylight polarization were measured by full-sky imaging polarimetry during the cue-conflict exposures and orientation tests. All species showed orientation both under clear and overcast skies that correlated with the expected migratory orientation towards southwest to south. For the European robin the orientation under clear skies was significantly different from that recorded under overcast skies, showing a tendency that the orientation under clear skies {{was influenced by the}} position of the Sun at sunset resulting in more westerly orientation. This sun attraction was not observed for the sedge warbler and the dunnock, both orientating south. All species showed similar orientation after the cue-conflict as compared to the preferred orientation recorded before the cue-conflict, with the clearest results in the European robin and thus, the results did not support recalibration of the celestial nor the magnetic compasses {{as a result of the}} cue-conflict exposure.

40|$|Many {{animals can}} use the {{polarization}} of light in various behavioural contexts. Birds are well known to use information from the skylight polarization pattern for orientation and <b>compass</b> <b>calibration.</b> Still, there are few controlled studies of polarization vision in birds, {{and the majority of}} them have not been successful in convincingly demonstrating polarization vision. We used a two-alternative forced choice conditioning approach to assess linear polarization vision in male zebra finches in the "visible" spectral range (wavelengths> 400 nm). The birds were trained to discriminate colour, brightness, and polarization stimuli presented on either one of two LCD-screens. All birds were able to discriminate the colour and brightness stimuli, but they were unable to discriminate the polarization stimuli. Our results suggest that in the behavioural context studied here, zebra finches are not able to discriminate polarized light stimuli...|$|E

50|$|The site holds various facilities. The main Land Magnetic Range is {{a secure}} and {{magnetic}}ally stable environment, {{used to measure}} the magnetic fields found in Mine Counter Measure Vessel equipment. The range uses inbuilt coil systems which enable the Earth's magnetic field to be reduced to zero, simulate anywhere on the planet, or provide only the vertical or horizontal portion of the Earth field to pass through the item under test, which an equivalent Sea Range cannot do. The Compass Test Centre inspects and tests magnetic compasses, whilst also delivering them to RAF stations across the UK.

40|$|Electronic compass {{is often}} used to provide the {{absolute}} heading reference for tracking the user’s head and hands in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), especially for outdoor AR applications. However, compass is vulnerable to environment magnetism disturbance. Existing <b>compass</b> <b>calibration</b> methods require complex steps and true heading reference which is often impossible to be obtained in outdoor AR applications, and is useful only when compass is in horizontal plane. An autocalibration method without the need of heading reference and redundant sensors is proposed in this paper. First the compass error model based on physical principle is presented, then the algorithm to calculate the compensation coefficients with a set of sample measurements of the sensors in the compass is described. Because the influence of the environmental disturbance has been effectively compensated, the calibrated compass can provided accurate heading even when it is under large tilt attitude. 1.

40|$|Polarized light (PL) {{sensitivity}} {{is relatively}} well studied {{in a large}} number of invertebrates and some fish species, but in most other vertebrate classes, including birds, the behavioural and physiological mechanism of PL sensitivity remains one of the big mysteries in sensory biology. Many organisms use the skylight polarization pattern as part of a sun compass for orientation, navigation and in spatial orientation tasks. In birds, the available evidence for an involvement of the skylight polarization pattern in sun-compass orientation is very weak. Instead, cue-conflict and cue-calibration experiments have shown that the skylight polarization pattern near the horizon at sunrise and sunset provides birds with a seasonally and latitudinally independent <b>compass</b> <b>calibration</b> reference. Despite convincing evidence that birds use PL cues for orientation, direct experimental evidence for PL sensitivity is still lacking. Avian double cones have been proposed as putative PL receptors, but detailed anatomical and physiological evidence will be needed to conclusively describe the avian PL receptor. Intriguing parallels between the functional and physiological properties of PL reception and light-dependent magnetoreception could point to a common receptor system...|$|E
