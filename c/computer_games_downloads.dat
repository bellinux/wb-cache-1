The researcher-viewing picture of a youth club {{triggered}} the study; within this image there were four <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> playing spaces.

This is a small-scale research project utilising qualitative data from interviews with fifteen participants, drawn from within contemporary Scottish youth work practice. The study has three main questions; How do those active in the youth work task, define youth work within Scotland? How does Scottish youth work use <b>computer</b> <b>games?</b> What investigating the ethical and hermeneutical situations created by youth works use of <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> can reveal? The study found indications that youth work within Scotland is lacking confidence, is under supported {{and in need of}} additional resources in relation to <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> Youth workers are using <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> as a youth work tool without the resources or time to critique and assess them fully. Despite this <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> can provide vital youth work functions around emotions, safety, behaviour and relationship building for youth worker and young person. Theology provides insight, language and tools for youth work and <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> to establish a solid base for their uncertain relationship.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{account for more}} {{attention}} to <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> as a cultural phenomenon that can be taught about. Due to the overemphasis on <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> as either causes of aggression and addiction, or the new means to educate our curriculum content, an elaborated concept of <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> literacy education, i. e. teaching about <b>computer</b> <b>games,</b> has not been developed yet. Media education, to which {{the idea of the}} ‘constructedness’ of all media is central, can serve as a framework for teaching about <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> Its two pillars of critical reflection and personal media production can apply to <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> literacy education. However, since <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> are, next to media - with their own medium specificities - also ludic configurations, the theory needs to be adjusted. From the infant theory on <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> literacy education it becomes clear that the twofold nature of <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> as both representational media and rule-based systems {{is at the core of}} <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> literacy education. Furthermore, attention to the increased responsibility of players, as a result of the interactive nature of <b>computer</b> <b>games,</b> plays an important part. Both the small field of <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> literacy education and the broader field of new media literacies mostly stress the production part, while critical reflection receives less attention. For that reason, I argue for a particular kind of <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> that could teach critical reflection by commenting on its own built-in assumptions. I therefore look into the so-called epic theater of German theater practitioner and theorist Bertolt Brecht. He tried to accomplish a critical attitude to his audience by emphasizing the artificiality of his plays, rather than to present the depicted world as natural and unalterable. In order to bring about a critical distance, he employed so-called alienation effects, which were to accomplish a feeling of estrangement. Since both theater and <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> are representations of actions, and thereby have the ability to simulate, a translation from one domain to the other proves fruitful. Two of Brecht’s alienation effects, the break of the fourth wall and the separation of the elements, are particularly suitable for a translation to <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> I provide several examples of how these elements manifest themselves in <b>computer</b> <b>games,</b> elaborating on the effects these epic elements can bring about and how they can serve <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> literacy education...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes the {{implementation}} of educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> in Malaysian classrooms. Local {{research has found that}} Malaysian students are familiar with <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> but {{the implementation}} of <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> as teaching and learning aids in the classroom has yet to be carried out. In reviewing this topic, the authors refer to the chemistry classroom as the case in point. The paper examines the issues and challenges faced by education stakeholders in designing and implementing educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> for Malaysian classrooms. Three main issues to be discussed here are the issues of: (i) the available educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> in the market and whether they are suitable to be used in Malaysian classrooms, (ii) the factors that ought to be considered in adapting and designing an educational <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> to be used in Malaysian classrooms and (iii) the barriers which hinder {{the implementation of}} educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> in Malaysian classrooms.

This has been true for <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> focused on entertainment, but also for what for years seemed a sure winner, edutainment. This dissertation aims to be a modest contribution to understanding educational use of <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> by building a framework that goes beyond edutainment.
