For this, WiMedia-based wireless gateway is essential to support high-speed and multimedia data transmission with high quality and energy efficiency. This paper proposes the integrated <b>ship</b> <b>area</b> network architecture with WiMedia wireless gateway applying a cooperative transmission scheme with distributed MAC protocol. The performance evaluation {{results show that the}} proposed architecture can guarantee data throughput even under severe channel conditions. The proposed scheme would be a meaningful approach in implementing e-Navigation system combining with other wireless communication techniques such as ubiquitous sensor network (USN), 3 G-LTE, femto-cell, and cognitive radio...|$|R

Specific radio carriage requirements depend upon the <b>ship's</b> <b>area</b> of operation, rather than its tonnage.
