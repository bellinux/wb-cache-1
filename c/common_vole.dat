5|$|Orkney has an {{abundance}} of wildlife, especially of grey and common seals and seabirds such as puffins, kittiwakes, tysties, ravens, and bonxies. Whales, dolphins, and otters are also seen around the coasts. Inland the Orkney vole, a distinct subspecies of the <b>common</b> <b>vole</b> introduced by Neolithic humans, is an endemic. There are five distinct varieties, found on the islands of Sanday, Westray, Rousay, South Ronaldsay, and the Mainland, {{all the more remarkable}} as the species is absent on mainland Britain.|$|E
25|$|The diet is {{generally}} more diverse {{than any other}} co-existing owl but often focuses predominantly on a particular range of prey species, with two to four species often making {{up the majority of}} the diet. Studies conducted over the course of years has shown that the regional diet often changes dramatically from year to year. This is partially driven by the cyclical population trends of much of their prey as well as by habitat changes, which are often due to human activities. The primary prey species varies by region but is comprised mainly by small mammals such as voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. In Europe, the five main prey species are, in order of extent of reporting and numeric abundance in dietary studies: the brown rat (Rattus norvegius), which has now occupied edge habitats (although generally associated with man) in almost every part of Europe excluding the colder north; the <b>common</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus arvalis), often the most abundant native, small mammal in wild portions of Europe; the European hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), which occupies wooded edges across western Europe alongside the eagle-owls; the European water vole (Arvicola amphibius), a unique, large vole occupying the wetland edges often hunted by eagle-owls; and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which has a very close relationship with the eagle-owls found throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the massifs of France. As the distribution of the Eurasian eagle-owls moves west (and south), the primarily prey species gradually change but often continues to be dominated in number by small rodents and in biomass by slightly larger mammals such as hedgehogs and hares and rabbits.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{document}} the kinetics of bromadiolone in two rodent populations after a field control of water voles, and their implications for predator exposure. Water <b>voles</b> and <b>common</b> <b>voles</b> were trapped aboveground and underground from 1 to 135 days after bromadiolone {{treatment in the}} field. Livers, digestive tracts, and rests of the body were analyzed separately. Our results indicate that 99. 6 % of the water voles trapped underground and 41 % of the <b>common</b> <b>voles</b> trapped aboveground contain bromadiolone residues. Concentrations were maximal between 3. 3 and 6. 5 days after treatment, according to the tissues examined and the model applied for water voles, and after 1. 3 to 3. 7 days for <b>common</b> <b>voles.</b> Water voles appeared available almost exclusively for foraging predators. <b>Common</b> <b>voles,</b> found {{less likely to be}} poisoned and exhibiting weaker concentrations, were mainly sampled aboveground. The liver, primarily eaten by some predators and scavengers, contains a larger bromadiolone quantity (59 % of the total amount found in water voles). The rejection of the digestive tract by those species may lead to a subsequent consumption of voles with higher bromadiolone concentrations (from + 3. 8 to + 5. 8 % of concentration) and provide a moderate risk increase. After 135 days, eight of the ten water voles and one of the two <b>common</b> <b>voles</b> exhibited detectable residues. Additionally, one specimen presented higher concentrations than the others, and similar to those measured in Voles trapped between the first 15 - 20 days. This may have consequences on predator intoxications several months after treatment. These results integrate individual differences for the two main rodent species present in treated areas. Implications for predator exposure were investigated {{at the end of the}} study and suggest that, if the risk of secondary poisoning is maximal during the first 15 - 20 days when the rodent densities remain high, exposure conditions are maintained for at least 135 days...|$|R

In areas that have undergone more heavy development, the brown rat predominates, being the leading prey item in several parts of France including Côte-d'Or, Lozère and even the remote Pyrenees, Belgium, the Italian Alps, and Brașov, Romania. The brown rat is even the primary prey in Lebanon despite it being tied solely to human habitations as the environment is often too arid to allow it to survive further afield. Black rats (Rattus rattus), at , are also hunted but rarely in equal number to the generally more successful brown rats. In Norway and Finland, field voles were the most numerous prey species, per one study in the latter country it made up 30.1% of the food but only provided 3.3% of the prey biomass. The European water vole, averaging at , was the main prey species in Styria, Austria, although considerably secondary in biomass to hedgehogs, as well as in central Sweden. The water vole often the second or third most regularly found prey species in several other European studies. In Samara, Russia, the diet is dominated by the European water vole, although other species such as European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) and European hares (Lepus europaeus) (both also significant prey there) probably outweigh them in biomass contribution. The <b>common</b> <b>vole</b> and European water vole together made up roughly 80% of the prey by number in the High Tatras of Slovenia and more than 60% of the diet in bordering Poland.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring 2007 - 2014 has appeared, in the South part of Romania, a {{pandemic}} of <b>common</b> <b>voles</b> (field mice), which surprised farmers and authorities and which caused damages of 1, 200 - 2, 000 kg/ha on wheat and 1, 000 - 1, 700 kg/ha on rape. This enormous pest produced, at national level, damages of over 3 billion RON, i. e. 700 million EURO only in 2014. The {{knowledge of the}} problem and the pandemic control were obstructed by certain psycho-economic considerations, namely by the unawareness of the farmers, population and authorities regarding the statistical information arising from research.
