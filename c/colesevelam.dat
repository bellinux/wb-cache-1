50|$|<b>Colesevelam</b> {{is part of}} a {{class of}} drugs known as bile acid sequestrants. <b>Colesevelam</b> hydrochloride, the active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredient in Welchol, is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged.

We aimed to characterize the alterations in BA metabolism associated with T 2 DM and <b>colesevelam</b> treatment and to establish whether metabolic consequences of T 2 DM and <b>colesevelam</b> are related to changes in BA metabolism.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of <b>colesevelam</b> added to maximally tolerated, stable-dose combination treatment with a statin + ezetimibe. METHODS: This Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled patients aged 18 to 75 years with FH and an LDL-C concentration > 2. 5 mmol/L who were receiving a maximally tolerated and stable regimen of a statin + ezetimibe. Patients were randomly assigned to receive <b>colesevelam</b> 3. 75 g/d or placebo added to the statin + ezetimibe for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the difference in LDL-C between the <b>colesevelam</b> and placebo groups after 6 weeks. Secondary efficacy outcomes were between-group differences in LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, triglyceride (Tg), apolipoprotein (apo) B, and apoA-I concentrations, as well as apoB/apoA-I ratio after 12 weeks. Tolerability was assessed based on the prevalences of adverse events by organ system class in each treatment group. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were randomized (45 <b>colesevelam,</b> 41 placebo), of whom 84 (44 <b>colesevelam,</b> 40 placebo) were included in the primary analysis.

40|$|Diabetes is {{a global}} epidemic. The {{recommended}} goals for glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and blood pressure are achieved only {{in a very small}} minority of patients. In this supplement to Metabolic Syndrome and Related Disorders, we review the data showing that the bile acid sequestrant <b>colesevelam</b> lowers both HbA 1 c and LDL-C in patients with diabetes. These data make <b>colesevelam</b> an attractive therapy to get more patients to achieve their LDL-C and HbA 1 c goals...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Purpose In addition to lowering hemoglobin A 1 C, <b>colesevelam</b> {{has been shown}} to improve the atherogenic lipo-protein profile of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) when used in combination with metformin and/or sulfonylureas. A recent study evaluated the effects of <b>colesevelam</b> as antidiabetes monotherapy in adults with T 2 DM who had inadequate glycemic control (hemoglobin A 1 C ≥ 7. 5 to ≤ 9. 5 %) with diet and exercise alone; we report here the effects on lipoprotein particle subclasses. Methods Subjects were randomized to receive oral <b>colesevelam</b> 3. 75 g/day (n= 176) or placebo (n= 181) for 24 weeks. Changes in lipoprotein particle subclasses were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results At Week 24 with last observation carried forward, <b>colesevelam</b> produced a reduction in total low-density lipo-protein (LDL) particle concentration (baseline: 1, 611 nmol/L; least-squares [LS] mean treatment difference: − 143 nmol/L, p< 0. 0001) versus placebo; reductions were also seen in large, small, and very small LDL particle concentrations (all p< 0. 05). There was also a reduction in total very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron particle concen-tration (baseline: 88 nmol/L; LS mean treatment difference: − 1 nmol/L, p= 0. 82) that resulted from a lowering in small VLDL particle concentration (baseline: 45 nmol/L; LS mean treatment difference: − 5 nmol/L, p= 0. 03). In addition, with <b>colesevelam</b> there was an increase in total high-density lipo-protein (HDL) particle concentration versus placebo (baseline: 31 μmol/L; LS mean treatment difference: + 0. 6 μmol/L, p= 0. 20), due to increases in the large (baseline: 5 μmol/L; LS mean treatment difference: + 0. 5 μmol/L, p= 0. 007) and medium (baseline: 3 μmol/L; LS mean treatment difference: + 0. 8 μmol/L, p= 0. 02) HDL subclasses. Conclusions <b>Colesevelam</b> monotherapy in subjects with T 2 DM resulted in generally favorable changes in certain lipoprotein subclass profiles compared with placebo...|$|E
40|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (BAS) lower plasma low density lipoprotein {{levels and}} improve gly-cemic control. Colestimide, a BAS, has been claimed by computed tomography to reduce liver fat. Therefore, {{we examined the}} efficacy of <b>colesevelam,</b> a potent BAS, to decrease liver fat in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver fat was measured by a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, the proton-density-fat-fraction (PDFF), {{as well as by}} conventional MR spectroscopy (MRS). Fifty patients with biopsy-proven NASH were randomly assigned to either <b>colesevelam</b> 3. 75 g/day orally or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in liver fat as measured by MRI-PDFF in colocalized regions of interest within each of the nine liver segments. Com-pared with placebo, <b>colesevelam</b> increased liver fat by MRI-PDFF in all nine segments of the liver with a mean difference of 5. 6 % (P 5 0. 002). We cross-validated the MRI-PDFF-determined fat content with that assessed by colocalized MRS; the latter showed a mean difference of 4. 9 % (P 5 0. 014) in liver fat between the <b>colesevelam</b> and the placebo arms. MRI-PDFF correlated strongly with MRS-determined hepatic fat content (r 2 5 0. 96, P < 0. 0001). Liver biopsy assessment of steatosis, cellular injury, and lobular inflammation di...|$|E
40|$|<b>Colesevelam</b> HCl is a {{bile acid}} {{sequestrant}} (BAS) {{which has been}} specifically designed with a unique structure {{for the purpose of}} improving tolerability and reducing potential drug interactions compared to older BAS, such as cholestyramine and colestipol. As a class, BAS are known to reduce cholesterol and glucose levels, and to reduce atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD) risk as monotherapy, and in combination with other lipid-altering drug therapies. <b>Colesevelam</b> HCl has specifically been shown to reduce total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and has been approved as a cholesterol-lowering drug since year 2000. It has also been shown to reduce glucose levels. This discussion reviews mechanisms by which BAS lower cholesterol, and potential mechanisms by which BAS lower glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Finally this paper specifically reviews <b>colesevelam</b> HCl’s pharmacology, lipid and glucose efficacy, safety/tolerability, and clinical use...|$|E
