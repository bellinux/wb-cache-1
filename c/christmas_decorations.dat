5|$|Point Loma {{is noted}} for {{neighborhood}} <b>Christmas</b> <b>decorations.</b> Several blocks of Garrison Street near Chatsworth are particularly {{well known for}} elaborate decorations. There is also a neighborhood-wide lighting of luminarias on Christmas Eve in the Plumosa Park area. On two Sundays in December there is a Parade of Lights, with brightly decorated boats sailing on the Bay to be viewed from the shoreline.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate <b>Christmas</b> <b>decorations,</b> city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, after {{wrapping}} up the production and recording of their debut album, Into the Rush, Aly & AJ began recording their first Christmas album. Antonina Armato and Tim James {{who worked on the}} duo's debut album and several other Disney-related acts, were recruited to executive produce the effort. They anticipated finishing the album {{by the end of the}} summer, in order for it to be released for the holiday season. Aly & AJ thought it ironic that they were prepping a Christmas album during the hottest days of the year. Alyson Michalka told the Saginaw News that producers Armato and James filled the studio with <b>Christmas</b> <b>decorations,</b> Christmas cookies, and a tree with gifts to open after they were done, in order for them to get in the Christmas spirit.|$|E

5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she has {{sent a letter to}} Martha Stewart asking for her to help save the family's Christmas. Martha {{promptly}} arrives and fills the house with the <b>Christmas</b> <b>decorations</b> Marge has always dreamed of, but the other family members end up as part of the decorations instead of being able to enjoy the holiday with her. Marge quickly realizes that it is Homer and the children that make Christmas special for her, so Martha gets rid of all the decorations with a magic wand. Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find that her family has brought her the ingredients for breakfast in bed. Their attempts to cook it go awry, so they go out for breakfast instead.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, the city's <b>Christmas</b> <b>decorations</b> also {{included}} lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle. The 32 six-foot snowflake decorations cost just over $10,800, which were funded {{in part by}} a $6,000 Community Development Block Grant secured by the city. The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear that the Peace Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards. The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, twelve provinces, {{including}} some in Luzon, {{were placed on}} typhoon alert. Upon moving through the central Philippines, Typhoon Lee affected {{some of the same}} areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month, which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970. Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut-producing areas isolated. Railway services to and from Manila was suspended. Even though nine domestic flights were canceled, the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some <b>Christmas</b> <b>decorations</b> in hotels along the bay. The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon; 20casualties happened there because of flooding. In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were swept out at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces. In the latter, three villages were damaged. Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island, 5,600 houses were damaged, and 20,000persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home. Two fatalities were reported in the city. In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50thatched huts were flattened. Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed.|$|E
