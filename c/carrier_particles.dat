500|$|Due {{to their}} large mass (approximately 90GeV/c2) these <b>carrier</b> <b>particles,</b> termed the W and Z bosons, are {{short-lived}} with {{a lifetime of}} under 10−24seconds. The weak interaction has a coupling constant (an indicator of interaction strength) of between 10−7 and 10−6, compared to the strong interaction's coupling constant of 1 and the electromagnetic coupling constant of about 10−2; consequently the weak interaction is weak in terms of strength. The weak interaction has a very short range (around 10−17 to 10−16m). At distances around 10−18 meters, the weak interaction has a strength of a similar magnitude to the electromagnetic force, but this starts to decrease exponentially with increasing distance. [...] At distances of around 3×10−17 m, a distance which is scaled up by just {{one and a half}} decimal orders of magnitude from before, the weak interaction is 10,000 times weaker than the electromagnetic.|$|E

500|$|A {{series of}} {{conferences}} in New York from 1947 through 1949 saw physicists switch back from war work to theoretical issues. Under Oppenheimer's direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding {{problem of the}} pre-war years: [...] infinite, divergent, and non-sensical expressions in the quantum electrodynamics of elementary particles. Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Shin'ichiro Tomonaga tackled the problem of regularization, and developed techniques which became known as renormalization. Freeman Dyson was able to prove that their procedures gave similar results. The problem of meson absorption and Hideki Yukawa's theory of mesons as the <b>carrier</b> <b>particles</b> of the strong nuclear force were also tackled. Probing questions from Oppenheimer prompted Robert Marshak's innovative two-meson hypothesis: that there were actually two types of mesons, pions and muons. This led to Cecil Frank Powell's breakthrough and subsequent Nobel Prize for {{the discovery of the}} pion.|$|E
50|$|If a {{free-flowing}} powder {{is mixed}} with a cohesive powder an interactive mixture can be obtained. The cohesive particles adhere to the free-flowing particles (now called <b>carrier</b> <b>particles)</b> to form interactive units {{as shown in figure}} B. An interactive mixture may not contain free aggregates of the cohesive powder, which means that all small particles must be adhered to the larger ones. The difference from an ordered mixture is instead that all <b>carrier</b> <b>particles</b> {{do not need to be}} of the same size and a different number of small particles attached to each one. A narrow size range of the <b>carrier</b> <b>particles</b> is preferred to avoid segregation of the interactive units.

50|$|No {{external}} {{electric field}} across the semiconductor {{is required for}} a diffusion current to take place. This is because diffusion takes place due to the change in concentration of the <b>carrier</b> <b>particles</b> and not the concentrations themselves. The <b>carrier</b> <b>particles,</b> namely the holes and electrons of a semiconductor, move from a place of higher concentration {{to a place of}} lower concentration. Hence, due to the flow of holes and electrons there is a current. This current is called the diffusion current. The drift current and the diffusion current make up the total current in the conductor. The change in the concentration of the <b>carrier</b> <b>particles</b> develops a gradient. Due to this gradient, an electric field is produced in the semiconductor.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>carrier</b> <b>particle</b> size and simulated inspiratory flow increase rate on emptying from dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Several flow rate ramps were created using a computer-generated voltage signal linked to an electronic proportioning valve with a fast response time. Different linear ramps were programmed to reach 30, 60, 90, and 120 L/minute over 1, 2, or 3 seconds. At the lower flow rates, 100 -ms and 500 -ms ramps were also investigated. Three DPIs, Spinhaler, Rotahaler, and Turbuhaler, were used to test the effect of flow rate ramp on powder emptying. To test the effect of <b>carrier</b> <b>particle</b> size, anhydrous lactose was sieved into 3 particle sizes, and 20 mg of each was introduced into # 2 and # 3 hard gelatin capsules for Spinhaler and Rotahaler, respectively.

40|$|Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) are {{the result}} of the {{development}} of two technologies: powder technology and device technology. Particle deposition in the respiratory tract is affected by many aerosol particle properties such as particle size, shape, density, charge, and hygroscopicity. 1 In particular, particle size is of great importance as it is known that particleparticle interactions within DPI formulations are related to van der Waals forces. Therefore, particle size is the most important physical property and design variable of a DPI formulation. Several studies were reported on the effect of drug particle size on DPI performance, showing that the preferred drug particle size is between 1 - 5 μm. 2 However, in literature, the effect of <b>carrier</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution (PSD) on drug aerosolisation efficiency has received less attention and reported in dissimilar manner. 3 Nevertheless, {{it should be noted that}} there is rare studies aimed to show the effect of <b>carrier</b> <b>particle</b> size as a single variable factor on DPI performance.

30|$|The {{deposition}} of active components {{on the support}} by impregnation {{is an important step}} in the preparation of supported catalysts. Two techniques can be applied for impregnation via the liquid phase [7, 8, 9, 13]. “Dry” impregnation is employed in the case of weak adsorption strength, using a sufficient volume of precursor solution to fill the total pores of the carrier batch. In “wet” impregnation, which is commonly used in the case of strong adsorption strength, impregnating solution volume is much larger than the support pore volume. The metal compound diffuses from the solution into the <b>carrier</b> <b>particle</b> pores where it is adsorbed. In this case, capillary forces do not participate and the distribution of metal in the support is due to diffusion and adsorption.|$|R
