The <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act was strengthened in 1977 and 1990. According to the EPA, from 1970 to 2005, total emissions {{of the six}} principal air pollutants, including PMâ€™s, dropped by 53% in the US. In 1975, the masked effects of trapped greenhouse gases finally started to emerge and have dominated ever since.|$|E
5|$|The EPA has {{initiated}} several air quality requirements that help reduce ground-level ozone {{that leads to}} urban heat islands. In the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, one of the EPA's chief policies, there are certain regulations that are {{put in place to}} ensure the state's emissions stay below a certain level. Included in the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, all states must set forth a State Implementation Plan (SIP) which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E

5|$|The United States <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act had its intended impact.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E

In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E

BrÃ¤ck reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when a crew member dropped a wheel nut which cost him time.

40|$|While <b>clean</b> indoor <b>air</b> {{legislation}} at {{the state}} level is an evidence-based recommendation, only limited evidence exists regarding the impact of <b>clean</b> indoor <b>air</b> policies on state smoking prevalence. Using state smoking prevalence data from 1997 to 2010, a repeated measures observational analysis assessed the association between <b>clean</b> indoor <b>air</b> policies (i. e., workplace, restaurant, and bar) and state smoking prevalence while controlling for state cigarette taxes and year. The impacts from the number of previous years with any <b>clean</b> indoor <b>air</b> policy, the number of policies newly in effect during the current year, and the number of policies in effect the previous year were analyzed. Findings indicate a smoking prevalence predicted decrease of 0. 13 percentage points (p = 0. 03) for each additional year one or more <b>clean</b> indoor <b>air</b> policies were in effect, a predicted decrease of 0. 12 percentage points (p = 0. 09) for each policy newly in effect in the current year, and a predicted decrease of 0. 22 percentage points (p = 0. 01) for each policy in effect in the previous year on the subsequent year. <b>Clean</b> indoor <b>air</b> policies show measurable associations with reductions in smoking prevalence within a year of implementation above and beyond taxes and time trends. Further efforts are needed to diffuse <b>clean</b> indoor <b>air</b> policies across states and provinces that have not yet adopted such policies. ECU Open Access Fun...|$|R

The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E
