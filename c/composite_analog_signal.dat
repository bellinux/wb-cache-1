50|$|A keel-shaped needle with a {{titanium}} electrode layer rides {{in the groove}} with extremely light tracking force (65 mg) and an electronic circuit is formed through the disc and stylus. Like an audio turntable, the stylus reads the disc, starting at the outer edge and going towards the center. The video and audio signals are stored on the Videodiscs in a <b>composite</b> <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> which is encoded into vertical undulations {{in the bottom of}} the groove, somewhat like pits. These undulations have a shorter wavelength than the length of the stylus tip in the groove, and the stylus rides over them; the varying distance between the stylus tip and the conductive surface due to the depth of the undulations in the groove under the stylus directly controls the capacitance between the stylus and the conductive carbon-loaded PVC disc. This varying capacitance in turn alters the frequency of a resonant circuit, producing an FM electrical signal which is then decoded into video and audio signals by the player's electronics.|$|E

5000|$|There {{have also}} been several audio {{recording}} systems which used VHS video recorders as storage devices and video tape transports, generally by encoding the digital {{data to be recorded}} into an <b>analog</b> <b>composite</b> video <b>signal</b> (which resembles static) and then recording this to magnetic tape.

50|$|The dbx Model 700 Digital Audio Processor was a {{professional}} audio ADC/DAC combination unit, which digitized a stereo analog audio input into a bitstream, which was then encoded and encapsulated in an <b>analog</b> <b>composite</b> video <b>signal,</b> for recording to tape using a VCR as a transport. Unlike other similar pieces of equipment like the Sony PCM-F1, the Model 700 used a technique called Companded Predictive Delta Modulation, rather than the now-common pulse-code modulation.

50|$|A {{composite}} monitor is any analog {{video display}} that receives input {{in the form}} of an <b>analog</b> <b>composite</b> video <b>signal</b> to a defined specification. A composite video signal encodes all information on a single conductor; a composite cable has a single live conductor plus earth. Other equipment with display functionality includes monitors with more advanced interfaces and connectors giving a better picture, including analog VGA, and digital DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort; and television (TV) receivers which are self-contained, receiving and displaying video RF broadcasts received with an internal tuner. Video monitors are used for displaying computer output, closed-circuit television (e.g. security cameras) and other applications requiring a two-dimensional monochrome or colour image.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a device capable of performing the following tasks: it samples and decodes the <b>composite</b> video <b>analog</b> TV <b>signal,</b> it encodes the resulting RGB data into a MPEG- 4 stream and sends {{it over a}} WiMAX link.

The device can be a hand held device, such as a mobile phone or a PDA. The algorithms for the analog TV, WiMAX physical layer, WiMAX MAC and the MPEG encoder/decoder are executed entirely in software in real time, using the Sandbridge Technologies’ low power SB 3011 digital signal processor.

5000|$|The track ‘Higher Worlds’ {{is taken}} from the Vinyl Williams 2012 album, ‘Lemniscate’. Lionel {{directed}} a video for this song and was subsequently premiered on The FADER ahead of the album release. Lionel explained the concept behind the video, [...] "“The images in ‘Higher Worlds’ {{are made up of}} various religious aspects to form an idea of what it looks like to experience something extra-sensory, beyond the very limited one octave of our visual spectrum. The effect is amplified by degenerative processes, such as filming my computer screen as I’m building these 3D worlds, then transferring the footage of this digital environment into an <b>analog</b> <b>composite</b> <b>signal,</b> onto VHS, taking the VHS machine on a roller coaster as it’s laying over in real-time, to encounter natural distortions and imperfections. Through this project’s imperfections and fuzz, I feel like it created itself.

I obviously link it to something like teal treasure temples in a space lounge rainforest".|$|R
