5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with <b>Corsican</b> <b>pine,</b> to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|E

50|$|A {{high forest}} canopy and limited scrub were {{originally}} {{considered to be}} the best conditions to support and to spread the Martagon Lily.

25|$|The {{planting}} programme of the 1940s was principally of oak, {{but also}} larch, Scots pine and <b>Corsican</b> <b>pine.</b> Unlike in a coppice-with-standards rotation, Bedford Purlieus woodland {{is much more}} even in age. However, when an ancient woodland is cleared and planted the result {{is not just a}} monoculture of the newly planted trees. The canopy is now a mix of the planted trees, self-sown trees and shrubs, and regrowth of coppice stools, some probably of more recent origin, other stools clearly dating back to antiquity. The species diversity that characterises the woods was thus retained, and oak, lime, large-leaved elm, hazel, ash, field maple, English elm, sycamore, chestnut and birch are all to be found in substantial quantities.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, <b>Corsican</b> <b>pine</b> and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

These cached seeds are recovered during bad weather when the cones do not open as unlike crossbills, nuthatches are unable to extract seeds from closed cones. In the spring, during the breeding season, the birds feed mainly on arthropods. In May 1884 when Whitehead opened the gizzards of birds that he had shot, he found that they contained small beetles and other insects.|$|R

40|$|Discrimination of {{tree species}} with {{different}} ages is performed in three classifications using hyperspectral data. The first classification is between Broadleaves and pines; the second classification is between Broadleaves, <b>Corsican</b> <b>Pines,</b> and Scots Pines, {{and the third}} classification is between six tree species including different ages of <b>Corsican</b> and Scots <b>Pines.</b> These three classifications are performed by having single- and multiple-endmember and considering five different spectral measure techniques (SMTs) in combination with reflectance spectra (ReflS), first and second derivative spectra. The result shows that using single-endmember, derivative spectra are not useful for a more challenging classification. This is further emphasized in multiple-endmember classification, where all SMTs perform better in ReflS rather than derivative in all classifications. Furthermore, using derivative spectra, discrimination accuracy become more dependent {{on the type of}} SMTs, especially in single-endmember. By employing multiple-endmember, the within species variation is significantly reduced, thereby, the remaining challenge in discriminating tree species with different ages is only due to the between-species similarity.

50|$|Afforestation of the {{shifting}} sands {{on the north}} side of the Warren began in 1947, partly to protect the village. Artificial dunes were created and the area planted with <b>Corsican</b> and Scots <b>pine.</b> During the late 1970s and 1980s and mid-1990s there were concerns that the water levels within the forest and within neighbouring Warren were falling due to a greater potential evaporation demand caused by afforestation, with the result that winter flooding was not to the same depth and that dune slack pools were drying out sooner. However most UK Atlantic dune systems also reported low water tables, due mainly to low winter rainfall during these times. To address these concerns clearings have been created in the forest, and the forest bordering the warren was heavily thinned. Proposals where put forward in 2004 to remove large parts of the forest. The local community and some conservation groups objected and the forestry Commission and the Countryside council for Wales are currently carrying out a public consultation that will shape the future management of the Newborough woodland.|$|R
40|$|In this article, the {{capability}} of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to discriminate tree species with different ages using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing is investigated. The performance of DWT is compared against commonly used traditional methods, i. e. original reflectance and first and second derivatives. The hyperspectral data are obtained from Thetford forest of the UK, which contains <b>Corsican</b> and Scots <b>pines</b> with different ages and broadleaved tree species. The discrimination is performed by employing three different spectral measurement techniques (SMTs) including Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Spectral Information Divergence (SID), and a combination of SAM and SID. Five different mother wavelets {{with a total of}} 50 different orders are tested. The wavelet detail coefficient (CD) from each decomposition level and combination of all CDs plus the approximation coefficient from the final decomposition level (C-All) are extracted from each mother wavelet. The results show the superiority of DWT against the reflectance and derivatives for all the three SMTs. In DWT, C-All provided the highest discrimination accuracy compared to other coefficients. An overall accuracy difference of about 20 - 30 is observed between the finest coefficient and C-All. Amongst the SMTs, SID provided the highest accuracy, while SAM showed the lowest accuracy. Using DWT in combination with SID, an overall accuracy up to around 71. 4 is obtained, which is around 13. 5, 14. 7, and 27 higher than the accuracies achieved with reflectance and first and second derivatives, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to forest}} fragmentation, forest edges as ecotone {{boundaries}} between forest and open area such as heathland, pasture, or agricultural land are increasingly dominant features in landscapes around the world. In Flanders, {{the northern part}} of Belgium, forests are strongly fragmented: the relative amount of forest edge in the total forested area amounts to almost 60 % when considering an edge depth of only 50 m. Forest edges have a vast influence on the flux of nutrients or pollutants from the atmosphere towards the forest ecosystem. Due to these so-called edge effects, throughfall deposition of nitrogen (N) and potentially acidifying pollutants [sulfate (SO 42 -), nitrate (NO 3 -), and ammonium (NH 4 +) ] is enhanced {{from the front of the}} edge to up to more than 100 m from the edge, by up to a fourfold compared with the forest interior. On top of that, Flanders suffers from N and SO 42 - deposition levels that are among the highest in Europe. In the interior of forests, high levels of N (NHx + NOy) and sulphur (S, SOx) deposition are associated with N saturation, increased levels of nitrate seepage, soil acidification, and eventually vitality decreases, floristic shifts, and declines in forest biodiversity. These facts argue for mitigating measures that reduce the input of N and potentially acidifying pollutants in forest ecosystems. In order to formulate recommendations for the design and management of forest edges for the mitigation of edge effects, we tried to get insight into (i) the impact of forest type and edge structure on the extent of edge effects on throughfall deposition, and (ii) the impact of enhanced input of N and potentially acidifying pollutants on two ecosystem responses at edges, i. e., nitrate seepage and soil acidification. For this reason, we sampled throughfall deposition, soil solution, and soil and determined stand structure characteristics along transects perpendicular to edges of contrasting forest stands, from the edge front up to a distance of 128 m from the edge. We focused on forest ecosystems on sandy soils, which are most vulnerable to nitrate seepage and soil acidification, and in regions with intensive livestock breeding and consequently high NH 3 emissions. In addition, a wind tunnel study was performed in which we simulated edge effects in model forests with differing structure. Two field studies demonstrated that the throughfall deposition of N and potentially acidifying deposition in pine stands are subject to edge effects that penetrate the forest to a deeper extent and cause a higher level of deposition enhancement at the edge front than in deciduous oak and birch stands. The additional input of N and potentially acidifying pollutants in the oak and birch stands was 10 to 15 times lower than in the pine stands. The difference between a pine and an adjacent birch edge in additional input was higher for the potentially acidifying pollutants than for the so-called base cations. This indicates that the higher additional input of potentially acidifying pollutants in pine edges is not compensated by a higher input of ‘potentially neutralising’ base cations, so higher rates of soil acidification can be expected at pine edges in comparison with birch edges. By means of a wind tunnel study and two field studies, the impact of edge structure on edge patterns of (throughfall) deposition was explored. In the wind tunnel study, a gradual forest edge (i. e., a gradual transition of vegetation height in front of the forest edge) deflected the wind flow and decelerated wind speed in front of the forest. Consequently, it induced a decrease in the level of deposition enhancement at the edge front in comparison with a steep forest edge, particularly in sparse forest models. A field study, in which throughfall deposition patterns were measured in adjacent steep and gradual edges, confirmed the wind tunnel results on the lower level of deposition enhancement at gradual edges, but also pointed to a decrease in penetration depth of edge effects. With a steep transition, the additional N and S deposition induced by edge effects in the forest was, on average, three times higher than the additional N and S deposition in the forest and the gradual edge vegetation itself in the case of a gradual transition. In addition, the field study pointed to an important prerequisite in terms of shape and size of the gradual edge vegetation for the mitigation of edge effects on N and potentially acidifying deposition. In the wind tunnel study, edge effects penetrated further into a sparse model forest than in a dense forest, which was caused by the stronger deceleration of wind speed and turbulence in the dense forest. This effect of canopy density, expressed as leaf area index (LAI), was verified in a field study on <b>Corsican</b> and Scots <b>pine</b> stands with differing LAIs. LAI was found to be a key driver in the processes causing edge effects on deposition as it determined both the level of deposition enhancement at the edge front and the penetration depth of the edge effects. The overall increase in deposition in the entire edge zone of forests displayed an optimum at an intermediate LAI level, with small penetration depths in forests with high LAI and low levels of deposition enhancement in forests with low LAI. In both deciduous and coniferous forests, higher NO 3 - seepage fluxes occurred in forest edges to up to approximately 80 m from the edge. In the first 10 - 20 m from the forest edge, however, the NO 3 - seepage was no straightforward reflection of N input via throughfall deposition. The difference between N input and NO 3 - output via soil nutrient leaching of about 25 kg N per ha per year was partly attributed to the higher N uptake by the trees and the higher seepage fluxes of dissolved organic nitrogen, but mainly to the enhanced N retention in the soil. Higher pH values and higher levels of exchangeable base cations in the upper mineral soil at edges indicated that, in contrast with what was expected based on the higher input of potentially acidifying pollutants at edges, the rate of soil acidification was lower at edges than in interior zones. We presumed that edge gradients in microclimate, input of so-called base cations via throughfall deposition, and biomass production together with drift of agriculturally applied lime fertilizer were the main causes for the higher N retention in the soil and lower rates of soil acidification at edges. Based on the results this thesis, we provided edge layout and management suggestions for the purpose of mitigating edge effects on the deposition of N and potentially acidifying pollutants. We suggest, on a scale of increasing impact on the edge patterns of deposition but decreasing ease of implementation: (i) early and frequent thinning of forests, (ii) layout of gradual edge vegetation at steep edges, and (iii) conversion of coniferous pine plantations to deciduous forest types. Particularly at edges exposed to the prevailing wind directions (in Flanders, the south to westerly oriented edges), efforts should be made to reduce the extent of edge effects. It should be kept in mind, however, that mitigating measures, such as adjusted edge layout and management, do not provide the key solution for the environmental problem of air pollution. Instead, the achievement of vast emission reductions is the most fundamental prerequisite for full and sustainable protection and recovery of forest ecosystems and ecosystems in general...|$|R
