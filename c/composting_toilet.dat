25|$|The {{camp was}} {{situated}} between a main road and a railway line. The site {{consisted of a}} large communal area, a visitors centre and several personal dwellings. All buildings were made from re-cycled materials. The communal area featured seating, heating and a bookcase. The buildings were heated by wood burning fires and run off donated wood. Water was collected on a daily basis. Food was cooked on a calor gas oven {{and there was a}} <b>composting</b> <b>toilet.</b> A wind generator provided some of the evening lighting.|$|E
25|$|Since 1991 an {{outhouse}} at {{the back}} of the lodge has been maintained by Dundee University Rucksack Club as an open bothy – it is a good base for climbing Lochnagar. Equipped with a stove and a <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> (as well as a candelabra) it used to be a storeroom and is now available to anyone free of charge for overnight stays. However, there is no electricity, the water supply is from the Glas Allt very near by, and there is no fuel unless it has been left by previous users. When royal parties are visiting the lodge backpackers are still allowed to stay in the bothy but they are asked to keep discretely out of the way.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecological}} {{settlement in}} Hamburg-Allermöhe has had <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> since 1982. The settlement of 36 single-family houses with approximately 140 inhabitants uses <b>composting</b> <b>toilets,</b> rainwater harvesting and constructed wetlands. <b>Composting</b> <b>toilets</b> save about 40 litres {{of water per}} capita per day compared to a conventional flush toilet (10 liter per flush), which adds up to 2,044 m³ water savings per year for the whole settlement.|$|R
25|$|<b>Composting</b> <b>toilets</b> {{are more}} {{difficult}} to maintain than other types of dry toilets, like urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDT) with which they are often confused. This is due to the need to maintain a consistent and relatively high moisture content, as well as the relatively high complexity of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> compared to UDDTs. Apart from that, <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> are quite similar to UDDTs, sharing many of the same advantages and disadvantages.|$|R

50|$|Blackwater {{generation}} can {{be avoided}} by making use of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> and vermifilter toilets. In certain autonomous buildings, such as earthships, this is almost always present and allows the water requirements of the building (which, with earthships, are self-generated) to be heavily reduced. Besides saving water, <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> allow the user to reuse the nutrients found therein (e.g., for growing crops/trees).|$|R
2500|$|Composting toilets {{can be used}} to {{implement}} an ecological sanitation approach for resource recovery, and some people call their <b>composting</b> <b>toilet</b> designs [...] "ecosan toilets" [...] for that reason. However, this is not recommended as the two terms (i.e. composting and ecosan) are not identical.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} fresh water {{available}} {{in the world is}} a finite resource. Large quantities of the fresh water are located in remote locations, while more accessible sources {{of fresh water}} are disproportionately distributed around the world. Some populations lack reliable access to clean water for daily life, making the routine use of potable water in toilets of upper-income countries a questionable practice in terms of resource responsibility, energy use, and sustainable infrastructure. The innovative nature of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> offers potential solutions to the downfalls of conventional, waterborne toilets. However, the path to adoption of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> has encountered barriers of different types, impeding further development of a more acceptable system. This study identifies current barriers to the adoption of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> into use in urban and suburban locations in the United States. A purposeful sample of knowledgeable stakeholders in the industry of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets</b> was contacted for open-ended, semi-structured interviews to collect data. The interviews explored four major discussion topics; the perceptions of stakeholders of barriers to the adoption of <b>composting</b> <b>toilets,</b> the barriers in urban and suburban locations, the differences and similarities between the location types, and what project experiences of the stakeholders had taught them about the adoption process. Twelve barriers to adoption were determined, with seven of these barriers discussed in depth due to their perception by stakeholders as the most problematic, yet effective in encouraging adoption if overcome...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Composting</b> <b>toilets</b> {{differ from}} pit latrines and arborloos, which use less {{controlled}} decomposition {{and may not}} protect groundwater from nutrient or pathogen contamination or provide optimal nutrient recycling.
