40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2000, the United Nations (UN) has been developing a <b>Capital</b> <b>Master</b> <b>Plan</b> (CMP) to renovate its headquarters complex in New York City to bring it into compliance with current life safety and building codes. The planned renovation will also enable the UN to address technology and security needs. Since 2001, we have reported on the UN's efforts to develop the CMP. As we finalized our most recent report in November 2006, the UN Secretary-General released the latest progress report on the CMP and recommended that the UN General Assembly approve a scope, schedule, budget, and funding mechanism for the CMP. The Secretary-General's report also included an updated cost estimate of $ 1. 88 billion for the project. This estimate for the CMP is about $ 128 million higher than the previous estimate, which was released in 2005.

Regarding the projects scope, the CMP office may not renovate the Library and South Annextwo of the five buildings in its original scopedue {{to the lack of}} a workable design solution to address security concerns. Related to schedule, the CMP office expects to complete the CMP in 2014, but reports that previous schedule delays have reduced its ability to respond to unforeseen events without affecting the projects end date. According to the CMP office, the projects approximately $ 430 million in projected cost overruns are due to a number of factors, including about $ 266 million in direct project costs and over $ 164 million from scope additions authorized without a corresponding increase in budget by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. The CMP office has proposed financing options that could address a portion of these cost overruns. However, even if approved, an additional member assessment may be needed. One option for funding the U. S. portion of an additional member assessment is the use of credits attributable to the United States in the UN Tax Equalization Fund (TEF) a fund used to reimburse U. S. nationals working at the UN for taxes paid on their UN salaries. According to the UN, as of May 2012, the balance of TEF credits attributable to the United States stood at $ 120. 9 million. ...|$|E
25|$|On March 25, 1965, President Johnson issued Executive Order No. 11210, which {{established}} the Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Temporary Commission {{was charged with}} analyzing the engineering, financial, planning, and other relevant considerations essential to ensuring the adoption {{and implementation of the}} 1964 <b>master</b> <b>plan,</b> as well as recommending appropriate legislation to the President and Congress. The Temporary Commission was also instructed to coordinate its efforts with the National <b>Capital</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission's <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> for the city. The Temporary Commission was an interim measure designed to ensure that no buildings incompatible with the plan were built until legislation regarding the <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> was passed. Although certain aspects of the <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> were controversial among some groups, the District of Columbia enacted zoning changes to permit mixed-used development and buildings which conformed to the Owings plan in April 1965. Construction of the first private building under the <b>master</b> <b>plan,</b> 451 12th Street NW, began in August 1965. Legislation to make the Temporary Commission permanent and give it extensive powers was introduced in October 1965, but strong opposition to the proposed National Plaza emerged and hindered passage of the bill. The size of the plaza remained intact into late 1967, and a large new arts and office building (to be built between 11th and 13th Streets NW on E Street NW) was proposed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{disclosure}} quality of governance issues in {{annual reports of}} Malaysian PLCs. In recent years, the issue of corporate governance (CG) has received more attention than it would ordinarily have {{as a result of}} a series of corporate failures. Corporate collapses like Enron Corporation (US), Barings Empire (UK) and in Malaysia cases such as Perwaja and Pan Electric Inc. are all rooted in the lack of a proper governance system. As a result, the Finance Committee on Corporate Governance was established in 1998 to undertake a review of the legal and regulatory infrastructure, specifically to evaluate its effectiveness in promoting sound CG standards in Malaysia. Following this development, a few guidelines on CG have been released, particularly addressing the principles and best practices such as the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (the Code), the <b>Capital</b> Market <b>Master</b> <b>Plan,</b> and the Financial Sector <b>Master</b> <b>Plan.</b> The main purpose of these guidelines is to strengthen CG standards and practices in Malaysia by focusing on the role and responsibilities of various CG participants, mainly the management, board of directors, audit committee (AC), external and internal auditors. Secondary data is used in this study. A disclosure index is established following the Bursa Malaysia Governance Model, the Code’s guidelines and Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) guidelines. This study also aims to examine factors that possibly affect both the quality and quantity of disclosure. In general, it may be concluded that Malaysian companies have complied with the standards requirements. Only three factors under observation namely leverage, size and type of industry were found to have relationship with the quality of disclosure relates to governance issues. </p...|$|R
30|$|The Land Use Act of 1978 is the {{principal}} law guiding land acquisition, resettlement, and its allocation to all eligible Nigerians; private, government agencies and nongovernmental organisations. It provides for the Government to hold land in trust for the use and common benefit of all Nigerians, for the realisation of equity, fairness and justice in the control and management of land, resettlement and compensation purposes. This ideal cannot be achieved without adequate and efficient land administration tools. One of those tools of course is a reliable and up-to-date land records. Institutions involved include the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) and the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), which are responsible for maintaining manual record keeping right from inception (about 29 years.
