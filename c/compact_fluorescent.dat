25|$|A <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp (CFL), {{also called}} <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> light, {{energy-saving}} light, and <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> tube, is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs. The lamps use a tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into}} the space of an incandescent bulb, and a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{tropical}} {{green building}} also seeks to reduce power consumption through intelligent architecture, such as by allowing {{in lots of}} natural light so that electric lights aren't needed during the daytime, and at night, using white-painted roofs, ceilings and low-energy light bulbs such as <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescents</b> or LED lamps.|$|R
25|$|Fluorescent lamps come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. The <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp (CFL) is {{becoming}} more popular.

50|$|Incandescent versus Compact Fluorescent-Incandescents pass {{electricity}} {{through a}} small filament (wire) causing it to glow hot and produce lumens (light). Up to 90 percent of the energy used in this process is for heat, not light, production. This wasted energy is far offset by <b>Compact</b> <b>Fluorescents</b> as they process lumens through a gas charged tube; electricity passes through the tube to create a chemical reaction that yields light. This cooler source focuses almost all its energy on light production, itself.|$|R
5000|$|Philips Lighting ceased {{research}} on <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescents</b> in 2008 and began devoting {{the bulk of}} its research and development budget to solid-state lighting. On 24 September 2009, Philips Lighting North America became the first to submit lamps in the category to replace the standard 60 W A-19 [...] "Edison screw fixture" [...] light bulb, with a design based on their earlier [...] "AmbientLED" [...] consumer product. On 3 August 2011, DOE awarded the prize in the 60 W replacement category to a Philips' LED lamp after 18 months of extensive testing.|$|R
25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescents</b> above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation. For a given fluorescent tube, a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the {{efficacy of}} a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.|$|R

50|$|Another {{light source}} in reef aquariums today is metal halide lighting. These high output lights closely {{recreate}} the shimmering effect of bright tropical sun over {{a patch of}} coral reef. Metal halide bulbs {{come in a variety}} of spectra from 5000k on up to 20,000k and allow for a variety of light-hungry corals to survive under them. Many aquarists will use metal halide bulbs in conjunction with either power <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescents</b> or T5 fluorescents since halide lighting does not have the overall balanced effect of other light types. While very useful to reef aquarium keepers, halide lighting also uses a lot of electricity (150-400 watts being common) and produces copious amounts of heat. Most reef keepers mount halide bulbs at least one foot above their tank and some, due to the lights' heat output have had to add chillers to keep aquarium water cool.|$|R
40|$|Replacing {{incandescent}} light bulbs with <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescents</b> (CFLs) {{has traditionally been}} seen as a cost effective means of promoting energy conservation. Recently, however, the magnitude of energy savings associated with CFLs has been called into question. Specifically, recent findings suggest an "interactive effect" associated with the replacement of {{incandescent light}} bulbs with CFLs in the residential sector. In this scenario, the reduced wattage of CFLs, relative to incandescent bulbs, generates less heat, which in turn, requires additional natural gas usage during the heating season. Engineering studies suggest the magnitude of the effect is significant in energy terms, which implies that the energy savings associated with CFLs may be significantly overstated. In this paper, we use billing analysis to test for the presence of interactive effects. Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that includes monthly household electricity and natural gas usage, the number of CFL bulbs installed, the installation date, and a set of household characteristics. Our results suggest that CFLs do indeed save electricity. However, we do not find any support for the hypothesis that CFLs cause increased usage of natural gas.

40|$|Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a {{semiconductor}} technology whose application to generalpurpose lighting is rapidly growing, with significant potential for energy savings. LED devices perform exceptionally well in lab conditions, proving up to 10 times {{more efficient than}} incandescent lights. These impressive laboratory results can be diminished in actual use in a lighting fixture because of remaining technical and design challenges. However, LED lighting products are now available that are {{three to four times}} more energy efficient than incandescent bulbs and last up to five times longer than <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescents,</b> so far the longest-lasting lighting alternative. Several large, well established firms in the traditional lighting industry have been working to resolve performance issues related to lamp and fixture design. Yet to be resolved is the cost issue; while LED or “solid state ” lighting is rapidly dropping in price, it remains several times more expensive than traditional lights. The market for general-purpose LED lighting is currently very small, but it is growing rapidly as the technology improves and costs go down. In 2007 the global LED market was $ 4. 6 billion, and the general lighting portion represented only an estimated 7 % of these sales, behind LEDs for mobile appliances (44 %), signs and displays (17 %), and automotive uses (15 %).

40|$|Autofocusing is {{a routine}} {{technique}} in redressing focus drift {{that occurs in}} time-lapse microscopic image acquisition. To date, most automatic microscopes are designed on the distance detection scheme to fulfill the autofocusing operation, which may suffer from the low contrast of the reflected signal due to the refractive index mismatch at the water/glass interface. To achieve high autofocusing speed with minimal motion artifacts, we developed a <b>compact</b> multi-band <b>fluorescent</b> microscope with an electrically tunable lens (ETL) device for autofocusing. A modified searching algorithm based on equidistant scanning and curve fitting is proposed, which no longer requires a single-peak focus curve and then efficiently restrains the impact of external disturbance. This technique enables us to achieve an autofocusing time of down to 170 ms and the reproductivity of over 97 %. The imaging head of the microscope has dimensions of 12 cm x 12 cm x 6 cm. This portable instrument can easily fit inside standard incubators for real-time imaging of living specimens. (C) 2015 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the potential for}} electric power saving in Mexico that would follow the substitution of old, low efficiency domestic refrigerators with modern, high efficiency ones. Our results indicate that a total substitution of domestic refrigerators would save 4. 7 Â TWh/year, which represents 33 % of the annual total consumption of 14. 1 Â TWh. Assuming an average daily use of 14 Â h for domestic refrigeration, 900 Â MW of electricity would be saved. An annual substitution of 20 % over 5 years would save approximately 1 Â TWh a year and almost 180 Â MW would be released. It is recommended that this program of replacement should be supported by the Federal and State governments, beginning with the States (which have more direct influence), and with the oldest, least efficient refrigerators along the lines followed in programs that introduced <b>fluorescent</b> <b>compact</b> lamps.

25|$|Fluorescent lamps emit a {{small amount}} of {{ultraviolet}} (UV) light.

25|$|Fluorescent lamp {{fixtures}} {{are more}} costly than incandescent lamps because they require a ballast {{to regulate the}} current through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost. <b>Compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamps are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an energy-saving alternative in homes.|$|E
40|$|A single-chip class-E {{converter}} {{was developed}} for fluorescent lamp ballasts. The IC is based on SIMOX technology and includes a 1200 V DMOS transistor and a low voltage control part.

The functionality of the chip includes preheating, self-protection, temperature-protection, low temperature detection for increased preheating time, dimming or power control, by changing the supply voltage up to 50 per cent, and an input voltage independent power control of the lamp. The solution offers possibilities for applications with a reduced input charging capacitor for lower line voltages, or for bootstrap circuitry to achieve a high power facto r up to 0. 9, universal input, voltage- and capacity-reduced charging capacitors, and inrush-current limiting.

40|$|AbstractRare earth elements, key to many {{high-technology}} applications, {{are regularly}} making headlines, even in general public newspapers. Will the word run short of {{rare earth elements}} and of the many applications that rest on their use?In support to French and European Union policy making, {{as well as in}} support to industrial clients, BRGM is monitoring rare earth markets from the supply and the demand sides, as well as for technological shifts that drive them. Not every rare earth element is effectively rare and there are well over 400 ongoing rare earth exploration projects worldwide. Nevertheless, some rare earth elements such as dysprosium, europium and terbium are rare, in high and fast growing demand; as they either are indispensable to the production of Fe-B-Nd (Dy) permanent magnets, the highest performance magnetic material currently being available at industrial scale, or to the production of phosphors essential to the production of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>compact,</b> energy saving, light bulbs and video displays. At the current 10 % compound annual growth rate of the demand for these elements, the question arises of their the future availability. Among the many rare-earth bearing minerals apatite is of particular interest as a potential source of rare earth elements, as it is a widespread mineral, forming huge deposits such as the sedimentary and magmatic phosphate deposits. An overview of the potential of sedimentary phosphate deposits as an important source for future rare earth production is presented and discussed. In addition to knowledge about the distribution and concentration of individual rare earth elements in sedimentary phosphate deposits, it is also necessary to understand the partitioning of the individual elements between phosphogypsum and phosphoric acid in the fertilizer production process, as well as available technologies to recover and separate individual rare earth elements from these materials. This could pave the way to the generation of extra added-value for phosphate producers, and to the broadening of the international production base of rare earth elements in high demand by the global economy...|$|R
25|$|Fluorescent {{lights were}} first {{available}} to the public at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes (such as <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamps). Some high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.|$|E
25|$|A <b>compact</b> <b>{{fluorescent}}</b> lamp is {{a fluorescent}} lamp designed to replace an incandescent lightbulb. Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps {{and they are}} designed to produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer rated life. In 1941, George Inman devised the first practical fluorescent lamp while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp, but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.|$|E
25|$|PC {{lighting}} is also high-power fluorescent lighting, but the tubes are thinner {{and are often}} folded over one another to reduce size. Most spiral-shaped energy-efficient light bulbs commercially available for house lighting are power <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> bulbs. PC bulbs are recommended to be replaced every {{six months to a}} year to keep the desired light spectrum.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of energy efficiency innovation, including efficient water heaters; improved refrigerators and freezers; advanced building control technologies and advances in heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC); smart windows that adapt to maintain a comfortable interior environment; new building codes to reduce needless energy use; and <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lights. Improvements in buildings alone, where over sixty percent of all energy is used, can save {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} factor in reduced electrical demand {{in recent years has}} come from the phasing out of incandescent light bulbs and a switch to <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> and LED lighting. Research by the University of Oxford has shown that the average annual electrical consumption for lighting in a UK home fell from 720kWh in 1997 to 508kWh in 2012. Between 2007 and 2015, the UK's peak electrical demand fell from 61.5 GW to 52.7.GW.|$|E
25|$|T-5 HO {{lights are}} the newest {{variation}} on fluorescent lights. They are run at slightly higher power levels than standard fluorescent lamps, but are made significantly thinner than standard fluorescent bulbs, {{which allows for}} more efficient reflector designs that get more light into the aquarium. Higher quality T-5 systems often match or exceed the output of equivalent power <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> or VHO lighting fixtures. On the downside, T-5 lighting {{is the most expensive}} type fluorescent lighting available. Many times it is much cheaper per watt, especially in the long run with the multiple T-5 bulbs being replaced, to use an equivalent metal halide light setup over a T-5 setup if such high light output is required.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{activities}} defined under PRONUREE is the national program to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2011 in Argentina. The program, financed by the government, aims to replace incandescent bulbs with energy efficient <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamps (CFLs) in all households connected to the electricity grid and selected public buildings. The program, which has initially undergone a pilot phase and expects to replace 5 million incandescent lamps {{in the next six}} months, foresees the distribution of 25 million lamps overall. Staff from the distribution companies will visit each household to replace the incandescent lamps and to inform residential users on the advantages of replacing the bulbs and of the efficient use of energy in general.|$|E
