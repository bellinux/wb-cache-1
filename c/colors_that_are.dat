5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E
5|$|In the 1989 {{specifications}} {{issued to}} the Ecuadorian Military, the {{coat of arms}} has only eight <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used on the flag. The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (all from the national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold. There is also a nine piece instruction on how to draw the coat of arms, followed by a full color drawing and {{a black and white}} drawing of the arms. No size specifications have been laid out for the coat of arms except for when it is used on the national flag.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces strobilaceus {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} {{because of its}} rough scaly cap and lacerated margin, but may be distinguished from B.ananas by smooth stem without a ring, different spores, and flesh that is less tough. The Australian species Boletellus ananiceps has spores with narrow longitudinal ribs {{that do not have}} cross-striae. B.dissiliens has <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not red as in B.ananas, and pores that can become reddish in maturity. Further, the cap flesh of B.dissiliens turns blue upon exposure to air.|$|E

25|$|For {{traditional}} art, {{there is}} little difference between the way night and day are illustrated and the <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used. For instance in early Rajput (also called Rajasthani) paintings, {{the only way to}} read that the painting is a night scene is through the presence of torches or candles. Later in the Rajput period, both somewhat influenced by Western art, night scenes were painted dramatically with shadows and Mughal paintings used chiaroscuro for shading.|$|E
25|$|The Abney {{effect can}} be {{illustrated}} on chromaticity diagrams as well. If one adds white light to a monochromatic light, one will obtain a straight line on the chromaticity diagram. We might imagine that the colors along such a line are all perceived as having the same hue. In reality, this does not hold true, and a hue shift is perceived. Correspondingly, if we plot <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> perceived as having the same hue (and only differing in purity) we will obtain a curved line.|$|E
25|$|The makeup follows an {{accepted}} code, {{that helps the}} audience easily identify the archetypical characters such as gods, goddesses, demons, demonesses, saints, animals and characters of a story. Seven basic makeup types are used in Kathakali, namely Pacha (green), Pazhuppu (ripe), Kathi(knife), Kari, Thaadi, Minukku and Teppu. These vary with the styles and the predominant colours made from rice paste and vegetable <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> applied on the face. Pachcha (green) with lips painted brilliant coral red portrays noble characters and sages such as Krishna, Vishnu, Rama, Shiva, Surya, Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Nala and philosopher-kings.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{it would}} be quite {{difficult}} to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a psychophysical approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them S, M, and L. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (I'S, I'M, I'L) for the S, M, and L lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (I'S, I'M, I'L) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of S, M, L would have to be added with some intensity to the physical test color, and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.|$|E
