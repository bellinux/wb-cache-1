STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best <b>calibration</b> files available.

The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories.

40|$|Molecular dating {{techniques}} {{require the}} use of <b>calibrations,</b> which are usually fossil or geological vicariance-based. Fossil <b>calibrations</b> have been criticised because they result only in minimum age estimates. Based on a historical biogeographic perspective, I suggest that vicariance-based <b>calibrations</b> are more dangerous. Almost all analytical methods in historical biogeography are strongly biased towards inferring vicariance, hence vicariance identified through such methods is unreliable. Other studies, especially of groups found on Gondwanan fragments, have simply assumed vicariance. Although it was previously believed that vicariance was the predominant mode of speciation, mounting evidence now indicates that speciation by dispersal is common, dominating vicariance in several groups. Moreover, the possibility of speciation having occurred before the said geological event cannot be precluded. Thus, geological <b>calibrations</b> can under- or overestimate times, whereas fossil <b>calibrations</b> always result in minimum estimates. Another major drawback of vicariant <b>calibrations</b> is the problem of circular reasoning when the resulting estimates are used to infer ages of biogeographic events. I argue that fossil-based dating is a superior alternative to vicariance, primarily because the strongest assumption in the latter, that speciation was caused by the said geological process, is more often than not the most tenuous. When authors prefer to use a combination of fossil and vicariant <b>calibrations,</b> one suggestion is to report results both with and without inclusion of the geological constraints. Relying solely on vicariant <b>calibrations</b> should be strictly avoided [Current Zoology 57 (1) : 116 – 124, 2011]...|$|R

40|$|The Anti Coincidence Detector (ACD) on the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope {{provides}} {{charged particle}} rejection for the Large Area Telescope (LAT). We use two <b>calibrations</b> {{used by the}} ACD to conduct three studies {{on the performance of}} the ACD. We examine the trending of the <b>calibrations</b> to search for damage and find a timescale over which the <b>calibrations</b> can be considered reliable. We also calculated the number of photoelectrons counted by a PMT on the ACD from a normal proton. Third, we calculated the veto efficiencies of the ACD for two different veto settings. The trends of the <b>calibrations</b> exhibited no signs of damage, and indicated timescales of reliability for the <b>calibrations</b> of one to two years. The number of photoelectrons calculated ranged from 5 to 25. Large errors in the effect of the energy spectrum of the charged particles caused these values to have very large errors of around 60 percent. Finally, the veto efficiencies were found to be very high at both veto values, both for charged particles and for the lower energy backsplash spectrum. The Anti Coincidence Detector (ACD) on the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope is a detector system built around the silicon strip tracker on the Large Area Telescope (LAT). The purpose of the ACD is to provide charged particle rejection for the LAT. To do this, the ACD must be calibrated correctly in flight, and must be able to efficiently veto charged particle events while minimizing false vetoes due to 'backsplash' from photons in the calorimeter. There are eleven <b>calibrations</b> used by the ACD. In this paper, we discuss the use of two of these <b>calibrations</b> to preform three studies on the performance of the ACD. The first study examines trending of the <b>calibrations</b> to check for possible hardware degradation.

40|$|Divergence time {{estimation}} {{requires the}} reconciliation {{of two major}} sources of data. These are fossil and/or biogeographic evidence that give estimates of the absolute age of nodes (ancestors) and molecular estimates that give us estimates of the relative ages of nodes in a molecular evolutionary tree. Both forms of data are often best characterized as yielding continuous probability distributions on nodes. Here, the distributions modeling older fossil <b>calibrations</b> within the tree of placental (eutherian) mammals are reconsidered. In particular the Horse/Rhino, Human/Tarsier, Whale/ Hippo, Rabbit/Pika and Rodentia <b>calibrations</b> are reexamined and adjusted. Inferring the relative ages of nodes in a phylogeny also requires the assumption of a model of evolutionary rate change across the tree. Here nine models of evolutionary rate change, are combined with various continuous distributions modeling fossil <b>calibrations.</b> Fit of model is measured both relative to a normalized fit, which assumes that all models fit well {{in the absence of}} multiple fossil <b>calibrations,</b> and also by the linearity of their residuals.
