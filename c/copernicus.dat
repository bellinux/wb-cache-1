5|$|As {{noted by}} <b>Copernicus</b> himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before <b>Copernicus,</b> the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E

5|$|Nicolaus <b>Copernicus,</b> {{a son of}} a Toruń trader from Kraków, {{made many}} {{contributions}} to science and the arts. His scientific creativity was inspired at the University of Kraków, at the institution's height; he also studied at Italian universities later. <b>Copernicus</b> wrote Latin poetry, developed an economic theory, functioned as a cleric-administrator, political activist in Prussian sejmiks, and led the defense of Olsztyn against the forces of Albrecht Hohenzollern. As an astronomer, he worked on his scientific theory for many years at Frombork, where he died.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, in 1551, {{eight years}} after <b>Copernicus's</b> death, {{astronomer}} Erasmus Reinhold published, under the sponsorship of <b>Copernicus's</b> former military adversary, the Protestant Duke Albert, the Prussian Tables, a set of astronomical tables based on <b>Copernicus's</b> work. Astronomers and astrologers quickly adopted it in place of its predecessors.|$|R
50|$|De libris revolutionum <b>Copernici</b> narratio prima, usually {{referred}} to as Narratio Prima (First Account), is an abstract of Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric theory, written by Georg Joachim Rheticus in 1540. It is an introduction to <b>Copernicus's</b> major work, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, published in 1543, largely due to Rheticus's instigation. Narratio Prima is the first printed publication of <b>Copernicus's</b> theory.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{discussion}} of <b>Copernicus's</b> nationality and of whether, in fact, it is meaningful to ascribe {{to him a}} nationality in the modern sense. But there are some facts {{that should be considered}} when talking about <b>Copernicus's</b> nationality.|$|R
5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, <b>Copernicus</b> crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in <b>Copernicus</b> was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, Nicolaus <b>Copernicus</b> {{proposed}} a heliocentric {{model of the}} solar system. His work was defended, expanded upon, and corrected by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler. Galileo used telescopes to enhance his observations.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus <b>Copernicus</b> {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. <b>Copernicus</b> was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E
50|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the 1543 publication of <b>Copernicus's</b> book was only mild controversy. At the Council of Trent (1545-63) neither <b>Copernicus's</b> theory nor calendar reform (which would later use tables deduced from <b>Copernicus's</b> calculations) were discussed. It has been much debated why {{it was not until}} six decades after the publication of De revolutionibus that the Catholic Church took any official action against it, even the efforts of Tolosani going unheeded. Catholic side opposition only commenced seventy-three years later, when it was occasioned by Galileo.|$|R

50|$|Magini {{supported}} a geocentric {{system of the}} world, in preference to <b>Copernicus's</b> heliocentric system. Magini devised his own planetary theory, in preference to other existing ones. The Maginian System consisted of eleven rotating spheres, which he described in his Novæ cœlestium orbium theoricæ congruentes cum observationibus N. <b>Copernici</b> (Venice, 1589).|$|R
5|$|The Aristotelian {{model was}} {{accepted}} in the Western world for roughly two millennia, until <b>Copernicus</b> revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on its axis and if the sun were placed {{at the center of}} the Universe.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{development was}} in the process for discovery, the scientific method, focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics, while discarding Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included <b>Copernicus,</b> Galileo, and Francis Bacon. The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Cn and atomic number 112. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element, {{that can only be}} created in a laboratory.

5|$|In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union {{launched}} {{a process for}} giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were <b>Copernicus</b> for 55 Cancri A and Galileo, Brahe, Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot for its planets (b, c, d, e and f, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{also added}} {{a feature of}} special value to seamen: from the {{numerous}} compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles.

5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} ancient texts and the {{invention}} of printing democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the Italian Renaissance, humanists favoured the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe. Writing around 1450, Nicholas Cusanus anticipated the heliocentric worldview of <b>Copernicus,</b> but in a philosophical fashion.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first {{proposed}} by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism).

5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth {{was the center of}} the universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, following the death of <b>Copernicus</b> and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E

50|$|The {{second edition}} of Nicolaus <b>Copernicus's</b> De revolutionibus orbium coelestium had been printed in Basel.

It is a reconstruction of the Renaissance cultural debates that were either provoked by the impact of <b>Copernicus’s</b> work or that conversely reshaped and transformed the meaning of <b>Copernicus’s</b> achievements. Certain aspects of this reception and transformation are treated with particular attention: epistemology, cosmology, space conceptions, natural philosophy, the incipient classical physics, theology and anthropology. The treatment of the different authors, issues and debates is based on an extensive and up-to-date bibliography concerning both the primary sources and the secondary literature...|$|R
