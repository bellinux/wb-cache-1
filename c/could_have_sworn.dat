500|$|In {{the false}} {{breaking}} news story, Lester Holt references the 2007 monster movie Cloverfield. After {{learning about the}} toxic leaks in the building, in which Frank, Toofer, and Lutz need to strip down, Frank says [...] "So much of my life was wasted creating hats!" [...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. When Liz tells Floyd that she saw him on The Today Show, on which she learned he is getting married, Floyd says [...] "Dammit! I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> you watch The Early Show on CBS", to which Liz replies, [...] "The Early Show? What am I, in a hospital?". Liz reveals that she once participated in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted playing a woman who is strangled on a toilet. Jenna and Tracy, who are having strange dreams about Kenneth, decide they [...] "have to Elm Street this. We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams!" [...] This references the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which the movie's main character—Freddy Krueger—stalks and kills his victims in their dreams.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liner}} notes for the {{compilation}} album, Natural Selection (October 2003), Seymour described [...] "Back on the Breadline" [...] and wrote [...] "This song spearheaded the North American campaign of 1987. We were signed to I.R.S. Records, and What's a Few Men? would've been our second album with them. Unfortunately they couldn't hear a single. Stoically, we wrote more. 'Back on the Breadline' was one amongst several which {{went on a}} compile {{with the best of}} the rest from the What's a Few Men? album ... I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> this song had 'hit' written all over it. How wrong can you be? Just before getting on the plane, standing at the terminal gate, waiting to fly home after I'd been to what felt like every radio station in North America promoting the track, the managing director of the record company asked me, in all seriousness, 'Hey young fella, can you tell me, exactly what is the breadline?".|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> it," [...] said Oldbuck laughing, but {{obviously}} much relieved--"I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> it;--the lazy monkey {{did not care}} if we were all drowned together. Why did you say she went out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you know,' Stephen continued, 'I <b>could</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{that you}} would be married before this time, from what I saw?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it was frightfully disfigured, so {{that even}} I, who saw you only once, <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> it was NOT you," [...] said Randolph quickly.|$|R
60|$|Did Sampson start--did {{his eyes}} show a {{fleeting}} glint--did his face almost imperceptibly blanch? I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> to either. But {{there was a}} change, maybe from surprise.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that the faintest {{shadow of a}} smile flickered over the woman's lips.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{his face}} fell at the intelligence, but {{why he should}} be {{disappointed}} I could not conceive.|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” I answered, and she {{questioned}} no further, though I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{her eyes}} retained {{for some time}} a mocking, teasing expression.|$|E
60|$|Jav {{was a new}} man {{the moment}} his battalions stood between him and Tario. One <b>could</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> the man {{believed}} these creatures of his strange hypnotic power to be real flesh and blood.|$|R
60|$|The only facts {{concerning}} him {{to which}} Elizabeth <b>could</b> really <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{with a clear}} conscience {{at the end of}} the second week of their acquaintance were that he was very poor, and that this play meant everything to him.|$|R
6000|$|So I {{went up the}} big {{staircase}} to {{a part of the}} Castle that I did not remember, wondering who [...] "the others" [...] might be. Almost <b>could</b> I <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that the shade of Savage accompanied me up those stairs; I could feel him at my side.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> I {{had heard}} you moving in there {{not a moment}} ago. It's most extraordinary... very sorry, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|The Doctor's {{sleek and}} smiling head did not move, but they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards Syme.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> I {{had heard}} you moving in there {{not a moment}} ago. It's most {{extraordinary}} [...] . very sorry, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|High on {{the ridge}} above them, drawn in dark thin lines against the sky, was a figure looking so long and lean as to be almost spidery. The dark {{silhouette}} of the head showed two small tufts like horns; and they <b>could</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that the horns moved.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He hath not {{opened his}} mouth since we took him,' said {{the man who was}} called Dicon. 'Is he a mute, then? Find your tongue, my fine fellow, and let us hear what your name is. It would have been well for you if you had been born dumb, so that you <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> our comrade's life away.' ...|$|R
60|$|Had, as I said before, young Badman's wickedness {{had only}} a {{tendency}} to his master's advantage, as <b>could</b> he <b>have</b> <b>sworn,</b> lied, cozened, cheated, and defrauded customers for his master--and indeed sometimes he did so--but had that been all that he had done, he had not had, no, not a wry word from his master; {{but this was not}} always Mr. Badman's way.|$|R
60|$|This time Daughtry <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{to having}} sensed a change toward {{relief in the}} Ancient Mariner, whose eyes were again filmy with dreams.|$|E
60|$|SIR PEARCE [in great perturbation]. I really can't believe this, O'Flaherty. I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{your mother}} was as honest a woman as ever breathed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew it--I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> it!" [...] {{returned}} the girl warmly. [...] "And yet my father means well;--but {{do not let}} this matter disturb you, Jasper." ...|$|E
60|$|Had (as I said before) young Badmans wickedness, {{had only}} a {{tendency}} to his Masters advantage; as <b>could</b> he <b>have</b> <b>sworn,</b> lied, cousened, cheated, and defrauded customers for his Master, (and indeed sometimes he did so) but had that been all that he had done, he had not had, no not a wry word from his Master: But this was not always Mr. Badmans way.|$|R
60|$|They all answered, yes. I {{had little}} to tell them, but I was bound by my own proposal. Therefore, after looking for awhile at the spiral column of smoke wreathing up from my brown beauty, through which I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> almost <b>sworn</b> I saw the effigy of Master Richard Watts less startled than usual, I fired away.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer, and all {{was still}} behind him. It {{must have been}} a sudden gust of air, for there were crannies and cracks in the old turret. And yet he <b>could</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that he heard a {{footfall}} by his very side. He had emerged into the quadrangle, still turning the matter over in his head, when a man came running swiftly across the smooth-cropped lawn.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Curious,' {{said the}} young man. 'I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> to it, and I am {{positive}} {{that it was}} somewhere in New York. Do you come from New York?' ...|$|E
60|$|His {{hand went}} out to mine, and as I shook it heartily I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> I saw the mocking devil shine up {{for a moment in}} his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} that curious {{expression}} in her eyes, an expression almost of secret terror, this time not wholly concealed. He <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that her hands were cold.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, by the way," [...] {{he added}} aloud, [...] "did {{you happen to}} hear anybody moving in the house last night, Mr. Bingham, just when the storm was at its height? First of all a door slammed so violently that I got up {{to see what it}} was, and as I came down the passage I <b>could</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that I saw {{something}} white go into the spare room. But my candle went out and by the time that I had found a light {{there was nothing to be}} seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the same}} moment Stephen {{recognised}} them, as indeed he could scarcely help doing with {{the light of the}} powerful lamp shining full upon their faces. He shouted something to his sister, who also stared coldly at the pair. Then a kind of fury seemed to seize the little man; at any rate, he shook his clenched fist in a menacing fashion, and brought down the whip with a savage cut upon the horse. As the animal sprang forward, moreover, Morris <b>could</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that he heard the words [...] "kissing her," [...] spoken in Stephen's voice, followed by a laugh from Eliza.|$|R
6000|$|... "A man {{crept up}} to that corner opposite, Master Guy. I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> to him, it is so pesky dark, but I thought there was {{something}} moving there and shot almost at a venture, for I could scarce {{see the end of}} my arrow; but it hit there or thereabouts, for I heard him shout. A moment later he was on his feet and running. I could see him more plainly then, so I shot again, and over he went. I fancy that in the morning you will see my arrow sticking up somewhere between his shoulder-blades, though there is no saying precisely, for a nicety of shooting is not to be looked for in the dark," ...|$|R
60|$|For a second's space {{they searched}} each other's souls. And in that space Matt <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{he saw the}} faintest {{possible}} flicker or flutter in the man's eyes.|$|E
60|$|It was {{all true}} {{as she had}} pictured--she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> it. Lucetta had a {{heightened}} luminousness in her eye {{over and above the}} advanced colour of her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "We all <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> {{that we saw}} you, citizen Lalouët, {{also the}} citizen proconsul.... He got into his coach with you ... you ... that is ... they have driven off...." ...|$|E
50|$|The book follows Giraut Leones, {{a special}} agent {{who has been}} betrayed by those he thought he <b>could</b> trust. He <b>has</b> <b>sworn</b> off of working for the Office of Special Projects but is drawn back after {{discovering}} that a group has begun recording the personalities of the deceased and is using them for their own entertainment. This is considered an affront to Leones {{and many of the}} peoples of the Thousand Cultures, threatening to break the fragile balance in place.|$|R
6000|$|... "As long as {{you give}} me my beer each day, sir, I ain't goin' to be {{interested}} in your treasure-huntin'. It ain't no new tale to me. The South Seas is populous with treasure-hunters--" [...] Almost <b>could</b> Daughtry <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> that he <b>had</b> seen a flash of anxiety break through the dream- films that bleared the Ancient Mariner's eyes. [...] "And I must say, sir," [...] he went on easily, though saying what he would not have said {{had it not been for}} what he was almost certain he sensed of the ancient's anxiousness, [...] "that the South Seas is just naturally lousy with buried treasure. There's Keeling-Cocos, millions 'n' millions of it, pounds sterling, I mean, waiting for the lucky one with the right steer." ...|$|R
60|$|American private {{soldiers}} are not pleasant fellow-travelers. They are loud and noisy, and swear {{quite as much}} as the army <b>could</b> possibly <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> in Flanders. They are, moreover, very dirty; and each man, with his long, thick great-coat, takes up more space than is intended to be allotted to him. Of course I felt that if I chose to travel in a country while it had such a piece of business on its hands, I could not expect that everything should be found in exact order. The matter for wonder, perhaps, was that the ordinary affairs of life were so little disarranged, and that any traveling at all was practicable. Nevertheless, the fact remains that American private {{soldiers are}} not agreeable fellow-travelers.|$|R
