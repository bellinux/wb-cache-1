50|$|In 1770, Ebenezer Hawkes <b>constructed</b> <b>a</b> roughly made dam {{about five}} rods {{north of the}} old Saugus Iron Works dam.

Around 1796, Sweetser <b>constructed</b> <b>a</b> new chocolate factory about seventy feet northwest of the grist mill. Around 1800, he <b>constructed</b> <b>a</b> new residence north of the factory. From 1816 to 1820, the mill was rented to William Smith, who manufactured chocolate for Chase & Page of Salem, Massachusetts. From 1815 to 1822, the grist and saw mills were leased to Robert Eames, who manufactured dye woods.|$|R

A member of the survey team and 100 local workers recruited by ANGAU began <b>constructing</b> <b>a</b> jetty at Beli Beli Bay and improving the foot track to Vivigani.

5|$|After {{success with}} {{shooting}} down alien scout ships and securing the crash sites from surviving alien crews, {{as well as}} interdicting alien attempts to abduct human civilians for unknown purposes, XCOM manages to also obtain the corpses of various different alien troops. Autopsies reveal that all these types have been genetically and/or cybernetically altered, which seems to indicate they are merely foot-soldiers for unseen leaders. XCOM's head of research, Dr. Vahlen, requests that a live alien be captured for interrogation.
