60|$|The general {{principles}} of <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> now sketched out {{enable us to}} give some rational explanation of the wonderful amount of brilliant colour which occurs among tropical animals. Looking on colour as a normal product of organisation, which has either been allowed free play, or has been checked and modified {{for the benefit of}} the species, we can see at once that the luxuriant and perennial vegetation of the tropics, by affording much more constant means of concealment, has rendered brilliant colour less hurtful there than in the temperate and colder regions. Again, this perennial vegetation supplies abundance of both vegetable and insect food throughout the year, and thus a greater abundance and greater variety of the forms of life are rendered possible, than where recurrent seasons of cold and scarcity reduce the possibilities of life to a minimum. Geology furnishes us with another reason, in the fact, that throughout the tertiary period tropical conditions prevailed far into the temperate regions, so that the possibilities of <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> were still greater than they are at the present time. The tropics, therefore, present to us the results of animal development in a much larger area and under more favourable conditions than prevail to-day. We see in them samples of the productions of an earlier and a better world, from an animal point of view; and this probably gives a greater variety and a finer display of colour than would have been produced, had conditions always been what they are now. The temperate zones, on the other hand, have recently suffered the effects of a glacial period of extreme severity, with the result that almost the only gay coloured birds they now possess are summer visitors from tropical or sub-tropical lands. It is to the unbroken and almost unchecked course of development from remote geological times that has prevailed in the tropics, favoured by abundant food and perennial shelter, that we owe such superb developments as the frills and crests and jewelled shields of the humming-birds, the golden plumes of the birds of paradise, and the resplendent train of the peacock. This last exhibits to us the culmination of that marvel and mystery of animal colour which is so well expressed by a poet-artist in the following lines. The marvel will ever remain to the sympathetic student of nature, but I venture to hope that in the preceding chapters I have succeeded in lifting--if only by one of its corners--the veil of mystery which has for long shrouded this department of nature.|$|E
6000|$|The various {{facts and}} {{arguments}} now briefly set forth, afford {{an explanation of}} the phenomena of male ornament, as being due to the general laws of growth and development, and make it unnecessary to call to our aid so hypothetical a cause as the cumulative action of female preference. There remains, however, a general argument, arising from the action of natural selection itself, which renders it almost inconceivable that female preference could have been effective in the way suggested; while the same argument strongly supports the view here set forth. Natural selection, as we have seen in our earlier chapters, acts perpetually and on an enormous scale in weeding out the [...] "unfit" [...] at every stage of existence, and preserving only those which are in all respects the very best. Each year, {{only a small percentage of}} young birds survive to take the place of the old birds which die; and the survivors will be those which are best able to maintain existence from the egg onwards, an important factor being that their parents should be well able to feed and protect them, while they themselves must in turn be equally able to feed and protect their own offspring. Now this extremely rigid action of natural selection must render any attempt to select mere ornament utterly nugatory, unless the most ornamented always coincide with [...] "the fittest" [...] in every other respect; while, if they do so coincide, then any selection of ornament is altogether superfluous. If the most brightly coloured and fullest plumaged males are not the most healthy and vigorous, have not the best instincts for the proper construction and concealment of the nest, and for the care and protection of the young, they are certainly not the fittest, and will not survive, or be the parents of survivors. If, on the other hand, there is generally this correlation--if, as has been here argued, ornament is the natural product and direct outcome of superabundant health and vigour, then no other mode of selection is needed to account for the presence of such ornament. The action of natural selection does not indeed disprove the existence of female selection of ornament as ornament, but it renders it entirely ineffective; and as the direct evidence for any such female selection is almost nil, while the objections to it are certainly weighty, there can be no longer any reason for upholding a theory which was provisionally useful in calling attention to a most curious and suggestive body of facts, but which is now no longer tenable. The term [...] "sexual selection" [...] must, therefore, be restricted to the direct results of male struggle and combat. This is really a form of natural selection, and is a matter of direct observation; while its results are as clearly deducible as those of any of the other modes in which selection acts. And if this restriction of the term is needful in the case of the higher animals it is much more so with the lower. In butterflies the weeding out by natural selection takes place to an enormous extent in the egg, larva, and pupa states; and perhaps not more than one in a hundred of the eggs laid produces a perfect insect which lives to breed. Here, then, the impotence of female selection, if it exist, must be complete; for, unless the most brilliantly coloured males are those which produce the best protected eggs, larvae, and pupae, and unless the particular eggs, larvae, and pupae, which are able to survive, are those which produce the most brilliantly coloured butterflies, any choice the female might make must be completely swamped. If, on the other hand, there is this correlation between <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> and perfect adaptation to conditions in all stages, then this development will necessarily proceed by the agency of natural selection and the general laws which determine the production of colour and of ornamental appendages.[135] ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{theories}} about this curious change of appearance is that the young plant had to protect itself against browsing by the moa, the giant flightless bird that roamed New Zealand's bush in prehistoric times.

5000|$|Next, {{the film}} is {{developed}} to completion in the colour developer bath, which contains CD-3 as the colour developing agent. When film enters the colour developer, the reversal agent absorbed by the emulsion in the reversal bath chemically fogs (or [...] "exposes") the unexposed silver halide (if it has not already been fogged by light in the previous step). The colour developer acts on the chemically exposed silver halide to form a positive silver image. However, the metallic silver image formed in the first developer, which is a negative image, is {{not a part of}} the reaction that takes place in this step. What is being reacted in this stage is the [...] "leftover" [...] of the negative image, that is, a positive image. As the <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> progresses, metallic silver image is formed, but more importantly, the colour developing agent is oxidised. Oxidised colour developer molecules react with the couplers to form colour dyes in situ. Thus colour dye is formed at the site of development in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different couplers, which react with the same oxidised developer molecules but form different colour dyes. Next, the film goes into the pre-bleach (formerly conditioner) bath, which has a precursor of formaldehyde (as a dye preservative) and EDTA to [...] "kick off" [...] the bleach. Next, the film goes into a bleach solution. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds in the fixer. During bleaching, iron (III) EDTA is changed to iron (II) EDTA ({Fe+++ EDTA} + {Ag^\circ} + Br^- -> {Fe++ EDTA} + AgBr) before fixing, and final wash. The most common processing chemistry for such films is E6, derived from a long line of developers produced for the Ektachrome range of films.|$|E

40|$|Textile UV-radiation sensors {{has lately}} been {{introduced}} {{to the field of}} smart textiles. Inkjet printing has been used as means of application due to the effective and resource efficient process. UV-LED radiation curing has been used in combination with inkjet printing in favour of low energy requirements, solvent free solution and reduced risk of clogging in the print heads. The problems arising when exposing photochromic prints to UV-radiations are that oxygen inhibition during the curing and photo-oxidation in the print reduces the prints ability to develop colour. It is the oxygen in the air in combination with UV-radiation that gives the photo-oxidating behavior. The aim of the study is to with the aid of physical protection reduce the effect of oxygen inhibition and photo-oxidation in the prints. Three types of physical treatments were used, wax coating, protein based impregnation and starch based impregnation. Treatments were applied before curing as well as after curing and the <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> after activation during 1 min of UV-radiation was measured with a spectrophotometer. Multiple activations were also tested to see how the treatments affected the fatigue behaviour of the prints over time. The aim was to have as high <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> as possible reflecting reduced oxygen inhibition and photo-oxidation. Results showed significantly higher <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> for samples treated with wax and whey powder before curing, but reduced <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> for amylose impregnation.

40|$|Background and Aims: Accelerated berry sugar {{accumulation}} {{resulting in}} wines of excessive alcohol concentration, sub-optimal colour and atypical flavour {{has become increasingly}} frequent in warm growing districts, a trend induced by factors that include global warming. The application of a film-forming antitranspirant may be an effective way of reducing early sugar accumulation without affecting <b>colour</b> <b>development.</b> Methods and Results: An antitranspirant emulsion was applied in 2013 and in 2014 on field-grown cv. Barbera vines at pre-flowering (PF), pre-veraison (PV) and at both dates (PFPV), and compared with the unsprayed control. Post-treatment assessment included seasonal gas exchange, yield components, growth of berry organs and must composition. Although all treatments were effective in reducing gas exchange {{by as much as}} 46 % compared with that of the control, berry growth was not affected. Conversely, whereas PF slightly modified the ripening pattern, PV and PFPV markedly delayed accumulation of sugar in the warm 2013 season (- 2. 4 and - 3. 7 ° Brix, respectively, vs control) without detriment to <b>colour</b> <b>development</b> because the onset of anthocyanins occurred at lower TSS. In the cooler, wet 2014 season, PV and PFPV were again able to delay sugar accumulation without affecting <b>colour</b> <b>development.</b> Conclusions: Pre-veraison application of the antitranspirant alone or in combination with a PF spray proved effective in slowing sugar accumulation while avoiding concurrent delay of <b>colour</b> <b>development.</b> Significance of the Study: The use of antitranspirants is a practical and flexible way of regulating the sugar:anthocyanin ratio under conditions of excessively fast ripening. © 2016 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc...|$|E
