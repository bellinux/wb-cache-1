40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Treatment of tooth wear is increasing. Because no {{evidence-based}} {{guidelines are}} available, the clinician may have difficulties deciding which treatment option {{to choose to}} resolve complex situations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify similarities among treatment options for generalized tooth wear and to develop an approach to rehabilitation based on the best evidence available. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Medline and Cochrane search (for articles published from January 31, 2003, to January 31, 2013) was conducted. Minimally invasive and fully described treatments for generalized tooth wear with esthetically satisfying results were included. Five steps within the treatment procedures were analyzed: diagnostic waxing (DW), occlusal positioning (OP), vertical dimension increase (VDI), restoration, and follow-up. RESULTS: Common threads were established within the 5 treatment steps. Nine studies used DW, and 6 performed diagnostic tooth arrangement (DTA). Centric relation was used in 5 studies, and VDI was tested in 8 studies, 5 of which used a removable appliance. Seven studies implemented a provisional stage, and 5 used composite resin at that time. For definitive treatment, composite resin (6 studies) and glass ceramic (6 studies) were used. Seven studies applied a <b>protective</b> <b>appliance,</b> and 5 scheduled regular posttreatment evaluation as means of aftercare. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this systematic review, the present evidence is {{not strong enough to}} form conclusions, and the presented similarities cannot be substantiated with evidence.

40|$|Otitis media (OM) is {{the most}} common {{childhood}} illness for which medical advice is sought. Whilst the disease rarely results in death, there is a significant level of morbidity and economic burden on the community. Although the causes of OM are multifactoral, bacterial and viral infections are the single most important cause. Bacteria responsible for infections of the middle ear are predominantly, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antibiotics have been widely used to treat children who present to a medical clinic with OM. However, given the high prevalence of this disease and the increasing incidence of microbial resistance to antibiotics, {{there is a need to}} develop alternative therapeutic strategies such as vaccination. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination has produced disappointing results for effectiveness in preventing OM and there is evidence of an increased incidence of disease due to non-vaccine serotypes.

The main objective {{was to determine the}} effects of safety and health training on the reduction of accidents' /injuries among workers in chemical processing factories in Nairobi. The study was conducted in six factories in Industrial area and in three factories in Ruaraka. Data were collected using questionnaire, checklist, interviews, reviewing of curriculum, records, focus group discussion and none participatory observations. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Descriptive statistics were used to organize and summarize data into frequencies, percentages and presented in the form of tables and charts. Chi-Square tests were used to interpret results between these associations which were considered significant whenever p-value was < 0. 05. The statistical tests of association between {{training and}} studied variables were done. Variables that were significantly associated with training. were provision of safety policies (t= 13. 534 df=lp= 0. 001), policy formulation process (:(= 46. 146 df= 3 p=O.

It was revealed that adequate safety and health training creates safety culture within the workforce, failure of which workers may not only be injured but may end up with fatal injuries. The study concluded that there was significant association between the training and accidents/injuries' reduction, because the study found a 100 percent decline in major cases in factories with training and meager decline in major cases in those without training, table 4. 6 refers.

Here, we examined the <b>combined</b> <b>protective</b> effects of Chinese herbal formula Si-Wu-Tang and Er-Miao-San on hyperuricemia and renal impairment in rats. Methods: Rats were randomly divided into normal rats, hyperuricemic rats, and hyperuricemic rats orally administrated with benzbromarone (4. 5 mg·kg- 1 ·d- 1), Si-Wu-Tang (3. 78 g·kg- 1 ·d- 1) and Si-Wu-Tang plus Er-Miao-San (6. 48 g·kg- 1 ·d- 1) for 4 weeks. Hyperuricemic rats were orally gavaged with adenine (0. 1 g·kg- 1 ·d- 1) and potassium oxonate (1. 5 g·kg- 1 ·d- 1) daily for 4 weeks. Serum uric acid, creatinine, total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations, as well as urinary uric acid and microalbuminuria were measured weekly. Serum xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity and renal histopathology were also evaluated. The renal expression of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT 1) and organic anion transporter 3 (OAT 3) was detected by western blot.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} prescribing {{pattern in}} low-dose aspirin users and physician awareness of preventing aspirin-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury with <b>combined</b> <b>protective</b> medications. METHODS: A retrospective drug utilization {{study was conducted}} in the 2 nd Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The hospital has 2300 beds and 2. 5 million outpatient visits annually. Data mining was performed on all aspirin prescriptions for outpatients and emergency patients admitted in 2011. Concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RA) and mucoprotective drugs (MPs) were analyzed. A defined daily dose (DDD) methodology was applied to each MP. A further investigation was performed in aspirin users on combination use of GI injurious medicines [non-steoid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids and clopidogrel and warfarin] or intestinal protective drugs (misoprostol, rebamipide, teprenone and gefarnate). Data of major bleeding episodes were derived from medical records and adverse drug reaction monitoring records. The annual incidence of major GI bleeding due to low-dose aspirin was estimated for outpatients. RESULTS: Prescriptions for aspirin users receiving PPIs, H 2 RA and MPs (n = 1039) accounted for only 3. 46 % of total aspirin prescriptions (n = 30 015). The ratios of coadministration of aspirin/PPI, aspirin/H 2 RA, aspirin/MP and aspirin/PPI/MP to the total aspirin prescriptions were 2. 82 %, 0. 12 %, 0. 40 % and 0. 12 %, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in age between patients not receiving any GI protective medications and patients receiving PPIs, H 2 RA or MPs. The combined medication of aspirin and PPI was used more frequently than that of aspirin and MPs (2. 82 % vs 0. 40 %, P teprenone > sucralfate oral suspension > L-glutamine and sodium gualenate granules > rebamipide > sucralfate chewable tablets. The ratio of MP plus aspirin prescriptions to the total MP prescriptions was as follows: rebamipide (0. 47 %), teprenone (0. 91 %), L-glutamine and sodium gualenate granules (0. 92 %), gefarnate (0. 31 %), hydrotalcite (1. 00 %) and sucralfate oral suspension (0. 13 %). Percentages of prescriptions containing aspirin and intestinal protective drugs among the total aspirin prescriptions were: rebamipide (0. 010 %), PPI/rebamipide (0. 027 %), teprenone (0. 11 %), PPI/teprenone (0. 037 %), gefarnate (0. 017 %), and PPI/gefarnate (0. 013 %). No prescriptions were found containing coadministration of aspirin and other NSAIDs. Among the 3196 prescriptions containing aspirin/clopidogrel, 3088 (96. 6 %) prescriptions did not contain any GI protective medicines. Of the 389 prescriptions containing aspirin/corticosteroids, 236 (60. 7 %) contained no GI protective medicines. None of the prescriptions using aspirin/warfarin (n = 22) contained GI protective medicines. Thirty-five patients were admitted to this hospital in 2011 because of acute hemorrhage of upper digestive tract induced by low-dose aspirin. The annual incidence rates of major GI bleeding were estimated at 0. 25 % for outpatients taking aspirin and 0. 5 % for outpatients taking aspirin/warfarin, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prescribing pattern of low-dose aspirin revealed a poor awareness of preventing GI injury with <b>combined</b> <b>protective</b> medications.

40|$|We {{tested the}} impact of {{bacterial}} swimming speed on the survival of planktonic bacteria {{in the presence of}} protozoan grazers. Grazing experiments with three common bacterivorous nanoflagellates revealed low clearance rates for highly motile bacteria. High-resolution video microscopy demonstrated that the number of predator-prey contacts increased with bacterial swimming speed, but ingestion rates dropped at speeds of > 25 mum s(- 1) as a result of handling problems with highly motile cells. Comparative studies of a moderately motile strain (45 mum s- 1) further revealed changes in the bacterial swimming speed distribution due to speed-selective flagellate grazing. Better long-term survival of the highly motile strain was indicated by fourfold-higher bacterial numbers in the presence of grazing compared to the moderately motile strain. Putative constraints of maintaining high swimming speeds were tested at high growth rates and under starvation with the following results: (i) for two out of three strains increased growth rate resulted in larger and slower bacterial cells, and (ii) starved cells became smaller but maintained their swimming speeds. Combined data sets for bacterial swimming speed and cell size revealed highest grazing losses for moderately motile bacteria with a cell size between 0. 2 and 0. 4 mum(3). Grazing mortality was lowest for cells of > 0. 5 mum(3) and small, highly motile bacteria. Survival efficiencies of > 95 % for the ultramicrobacterial isolate CP- 1 (less than or equal to 0. 1 mum(3), > 50 mum s(- 1)) illustrated the <b>combined</b> <b>protective</b> action of small cell size and high motility.

In the present study, we have defined doses of human rIL- 1 alpha that enhanced the antilisteria resistance of mice. We then addressed the possibility that combined immunotherapy with rIL- 1 alpha and recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) might result in an additive or synergistic enhancement of antibacterial resistance. Simultaneous administration of rIL- 1 alpha and rIFN-gamma enhanced antilisteria resistance (at 3 days after infection) {{to a greater extent than}} did either cytokine alone, although the results did not imply a synergistic action between the two cytokines. Experiments which examined the effects of the timing of cytokine administration indicated that maximal protection was observed when rIL- 1 alpha and rIFN-gamma were administered together concomitantly with the L. monocytogenes challenge. When we compared the separate and <b>combined</b> <b>protective</b> effects of rIL- 1 alpha and rIFN-gamma throughout the course of a primary L. monocytogenes infection, we observed an additive effect of the two cytokines only at 3 days after challenge, the time at which the peak bacterial burden occurs in the spleens and livers of infected mice. Histopathological comparisons of livers and spleens from cytokine-treated and control listeria-infected mice verified that cytokine treatment reduced the severity of tissue damage in cytokine-treated listeria-infected mice. In an attempt to provide a potential mechanism for the protective effects of rIL- 1 alpha and rIFN-gamma administration, we compared levels of colony-stimulating activity in sera from cytokine-treated and control listeria-infected mice.

40|$|Today, about 1 {{billion people}} are {{estimated}} to live in ‘slums’ worldwide. This number will only grow and urban poverty worsen unless radical measures are taken. While it is generally acknowledged in the international development debate that breaking the circle of poverty requires multiple strategies, there is renewed attention for approaches that centre {{on the issue of}} tenure security. This means landholders are protected against involuntary removal from the land on which they reside, unless through due process of law and payment of proper compensation. The prevailing approach to the provision of tenure security is land registration. And while the land registration approach currently dominates policy, there has been little research into the effects of registration, particularly in urban areas. What research has been conducted, contests the benefits of this approach. As a result, we witness increasing interest in alternative approaches which generally <b>combine</b> <b>protective</b> administrative or legal measures against eviction with the provision of basic services and credit facilities. The author describes and analyses the extent to which formal, semiformal, and informal tenure arrangements that can be found in kampongs (typical low-income settlements) in Indonesia provide tenure security to the country’s urban poor, particularly since 1998, when Indonesia embarked on an ambitious political and legal reform programme. The author reviews the current legal framework that applies to urban land tenure in Indonesia. In addition, based on rich material that was acquired through empirical research in the city of Bandung, {{there are a number of}} case studies presented in which the urban poor’s tenure security was put to the test. Finally, drawing on statistical data, the author analyses the urban poor’s perceptions regarding their tenure security and whether and, if so, how this influences their housing investment behaviour. Following this analysis, the author evaluates the socio-economic benefits of current approaches to attaining tenure security. And with these findings, there are policy suggestions and contributions to theory formation presented to further the current international development debate on tenure security. Promotor: J. M.

Tennis players-defenders have a sense to hyperthymic, emotive and to ecstatic (100 %), anxious, to the cyclothymic (80 %) type of accentuation. Tennis players of the <b>combined</b> and <b>protective</b> style of game are in 80 % cases have {{a high level of}} intellectual capabilities. However more expressed motivation to success is for the tennis players of attacking style of game (60 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The Central Yangtze Ecoregion {{contains}} {{a large area}} of internationally important freshwater wetlands and supports {{a huge number of}} endangered waterbirds; however, these unique wetlands and the biodiversity they support are under the constant threats of human development pressures, and the prevailing conservation strategies generated based on the local scale cannot adequately be used as guidelines for ecoregion-based conservation initiatives for Central Yangtze at the broad scale. This paper aims at establishing and optimizing an ecological network for freshwater wetland conservation in the Central Yangtze Ecoregion based on large-scale gap analysis. A group of focal species and GIS-based extrapolation technique were employed to identify the potential habitats and conservation gaps, and the optimized conservation network was then established by <b>combining</b> existing <b>protective</b> system and identified conservation gaps. Our results show that only 23. 49 % of the potential habitats of the focal species have been included in the existing nature reserves in the Central Yangtze Ecoregion. To effectively conserve over 80 % of the potential habitats for the focal species by optimizing the existing conservation network for the freshwater wetlands in Central Yangtze Ecoregion, it is necessary to establish new wetland nature reserves in 22 county units across Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{inflammation}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and is involved in all stages of the ischemic cascade. Fullerene derivatives, such as fullerenol (OH-F) are radical scavengers acting as neuroprotective agents while glucosamine (GlcN) attenuates cerebral inflammation after stroke. We created novel glucosamine-fullerene conjugates (GlcN-F) to <b>combine</b> their <b>protective</b> effects and compared them to OH-F regarding stroke-induced cerebral inflammation and cellular damage. Fullerene derivatives or vehicle was administered intravenously in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) immediately after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Infarct size was determined at day 5 and neurological outcome at days 1 and 5 after tMCAO. CD 68 - and NeuN-staining were performed to determine immunoreactivity and neuronal survival respectively. Cytokine and toll like receptor 4 (TLR- 4) expression was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a significant reduction of infarct volume in both, WKY and SHR that were treated with fullerene derivatives. Treated rats showed an amelioration of neurological symptoms as both OH-F and GlcN-F prevented neuronal loss in the perilesional area. Cerebral immunoreactivity was reduced in treated WKY and SHR. Expression of IL- 1 β and TLR- 4 was attenuated in OH-F-treated WKY rats. In conclusion, OH-F and GlcN-F lead to a reduction of cellular damage and inflammation after stroke, rendering these compounds attractive therapeutics for stroke...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Worker Protection System (AWPS) is a liquid-air-based, {{self-contained}} {{breathing and}} cooling {{system with a}} duration of 2 hrs. AWPS employs a patented system developed by Oceaneering Space Systems (OSS), and was demonstrated at their facility in Houston, TX as well as at Kansas State University, Manhattan. The heart of the system is the life-support backpack that uses liquid air to provide cooling as well as breathing gas to the worker. The backpack is <b>combined</b> with advanced <b>protective</b> garments, an advanced liquid cooling garment (LCG), a respirator, and communications and support equipment. The prototype unit development and testing under Phase 1 has demonstrated that AWPS has the ability to meet performance criteria. These criteria were developed with an understanding of both the AWPS capabilities and the DOE decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) activities protection needs...|$|R
