Wages are determined by labor auctions and workers can continue to search on-the-job for better employment opportunities. The model is solved using two systems of linear equations- the 8 ̆ 5 rst gives a solu-tion for wages given a vacancy <b>creation</b> <b>rule</b> and the second uses {{the solution of the}} 8 ̆ 5 rst to solve for equilibrium vacancies. Consequently, the numeri-cal calculation of the decentralized equilibrium is both accurate and fast.

40|$|Abstract⎯In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the capability of}} the genetic programming approach for producing hierarchical, rule-based, classification trees. These trees {{can be seen as}} an extension to the machine learning decision trees concept, where the predicates here can be complex expressions rather than just simple attribute-value comparisons. In order to improve the search ability and to produce meaningful results, type-constraints are applied to the genetic programming procedure, expressed in a BNF grammar. The model is tested in two well-known domains. In the Balance-Scale data, the system achieves in revealing the data <b>creation</b> <b>rule.</b> In the E-Coli Protein Localization Sites data, the system realizes a competitive to the literature classification score, retaining the solution comprehensibility.

40|$|Replication of {{routines}} and capabilities {{has been largely}} neglected in recent research. In this paper we present {{the current state of}} research on replication and suggest conceptualizing replication as a social practice. Replication as a social practice goes beyond knowledge transfer between a replicator and a replicatee and involves how {{routines and}} capabilities as well as the process of replication itself are constructed and shaped by multiple actors in the organization. Moreover, this perspective acknowledges the role of artefacts in the process of replication. Based on recent literature on routines and organizational rules we differentiate replication into three interrelated sub-practices: rule (re-) <b>creation,</b> <b>rule</b> translation and rule performance. The theoretical framework suggested in this paper has several significant theoretical implications for research on replication. In addition, we point out important research design implications for future empirical research...|$|E

40|$|Database {{integration}} {{is one of}} the research areas that have gained a lot of attention from researcher. It has the goal of representing the data from different database sources in one unified form. To reach database integration we have to face two obstacles. The first one is the distribution of data, and the second is the heterogeneity. The Web ensures addressing the distribution problem, and for the case of heterogeneity there are many approaches {{that can be used to}} solve the database integration problem, such as data warehouse and federated databases. The problem in these two approaches is the lack of semantics. Therefore, our approach exploits the Semantic Web methodology. The hybrid ontology method can be facilitated in solving the database integration problem. In this method two elements are available; the source (database) and the domain ontology, however, the local ontology is missing. In fact, to ensure the success of this method the local ontologies should be produced. Our approach obtains the semantics from the logical model of database to generate local ontology. Then, the validation and the enhancement can be acquired from the semantics obtained from the conceptual model of the database. Now, our approach can be applied in the generation phase and the validation-enrichment phase. In the generation phase in our approach, we utilise the reverse engineering techniques in order to catch the semantics hidden in the SQL language. Then, the approach reproduces the logical model of the database. Finally, our transformation system will be applied to generate an ontology. In our transformation system, all the concepts of classes, relationships and axioms will be generated. Firstly, the process of class creation contains many rules participating together to produce classes. Our unique rules succeeded in solving problems such as fragmentation and hierarchy. Also, our rules eliminate the superfluous classes of multi-valued attribute relation as well as taking care of neglected cases such as: relationships with additional attributes. The final class <b>creation</b> <b>rule</b> is for generic relation cases. The rules of the relationship between concepts are generated with eliminating the relationships between integrated concepts. Finally, there are many rules that consider the relationship and the attributes constraints which should be transformed to axioms in the ontological model. The formal rules of our approach are domain independent; also, it produces a generic ontology that is not restricted to a specific ontology language. The rules consider the gap between the database model and the ontological model. Therefore, some database constructs would not have an equivalent in the ontological model. The second phase consists of the validation and the enrichment processes. The best way to validate the transformation result is to facilitate the semantics obtained from the conceptual model of the database. In the validation phase, the domain expert captures the missing or the superfluous concepts (classes or relationships). In the enrichment phase, the generalisation method can be applied to classes that share common attributes. Also, the concepts of complex or composite attributes can be represented as classes. We implement the transformation system by a tool called SQL 2 OWL in order to show the correctness and the functionally of our approach. The evaluation of our system showed the success of our proposed approach. The evaluation goes through many techniques. Firstly, a comparative study is held between the results produced by our approach and the similar approaches. The second evaluation technique is the weighting score system which specify the criteria that affect the transformation system. The final evaluation technique is the score scheme. We consider the quality of the transformation system by applying the compliance measure in order to show the strength of our approach compared to the existing approaches. Finally the measures of success that our approach considered are the system scalability and the completeness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{original}} {{definition of}} P-systems calls for rules {{to be applied}} in a maximally parallel fashion. However, in some cases a sequential model may be a more reasonable assumption. Here we study the computational power of different variants of sequential P-systems. Initially we look at cooperative systems operating on symbol objects and without prioritized rules, but which allow membrane dissolution and bounded <b>creation</b> <b>rules.</b> We show that they are equivalent to vector addition systems and, hence, nonuniversal. When these systems are used as language acceptors, they are equivalent to communicating P systems which, in turn, are equivalent to partially blind multicounter machines. In contrast, if such cooperative systems are allowed to create an unbounded number of new membranes (i. e., with unbounded membrane <b>creation</b> <b>rules)</b> {{during the course of the}} computation, then they become universal. We then consider systems with prioritized rules operating on symbol objects. We show two types of results: there are sequential P systems that are universal and sequential P systems that are nonuniversal. In particular, both communicating and cooperative P systems are universal, even if restricted to 1 -deterministic systems with one membrane. However, multi-membrane catalytic P systems with prioritized rules have NP-complete reachability problem and, hence, nonuniversal. ...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrical {{flexures}} (CFs), {{defined as}} flexures {{with only one}} finite radius of curvature loaded normal to the plane of curvature, present an interesting research direction in compliant mechanisms. CFs are constructed out of a cylindrical stock which leads to geometry, manufacturability, and compatibility advantages. Synthesis rules must be developed to design these new systems effectively. Current knowledge in flexure design pertains to straight-beam flexures or curved flexures loaded along the plane of curvature. CFs present a challenge because their mechanics {{differ from those of}} straight beams, and although their modelling has been researched thoroughly it has yet to be distilled into element and system <b>creation</b> <b>rules.</b> This paper uses models and finite element analysis to demonstrate that current design rules for straight-beam flexures are insufficient and inadequate for the design of CF systems. The presented discussion will show that CFs differ both at the element and systems levels, and therefore future research will focus on developing the three components of the building block approach: (i) reworking of element mechanics models to reveal the parameters which cause the kinematics of the curved beam to differ from those of the straight beam, (ii) development of a visual stiffness representation, and (iii) formation of system <b>creation</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R
