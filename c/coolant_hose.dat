50|$|A helping hand, {{also known}} as a third hand or X-tra Hands, is a type of {{extremely}} adjustable jig used in soldering and craftwork to hold materials near each other so that the user can work on them. A commonly produced version consists of a weighted base, a pair of twice-adjustable arms ending in crocodile clips, and optionally a magnifying glass, held together by flexible joints. The clips are used to hold a light workpiece in place while the joints allow the user to change the position or angle. Sometimes helping hands are augmented with modules from the adjustable <b>coolant</b> <b>hose</b> systems used with machine tools.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{standard}} training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to avoid handling swarf with bare hands. Similarly, {{it is also}} standard training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to minimize or entirely avoid handling swarf by blowing chips away with compressed air, but this practice is considered burdensome or impractical by some machinists - {{the rule of thumb}} is to reduce the potential hazard by trying to eliminate the problem as far as reasonably practicable this could simply be done by keeping a clean working environment. Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way wipers and bearing seals. Alternatives to blowing chips away include vacuuming them away with an industrial vacuum (shop vacuum); gently washing them away with a <b>coolant</b> <b>hose</b> discharging at typical garden-hose pressures; or preventing their generation in the first place (for example, forming threads instead of cutting them).|$|E

50|$|Initial {{problems}} with the locomotives were minor and varied, although a problem with cracking in the cylinder liner around the injector hole required the engine to be changed. By November 1959, seven engines had been changed and this reduced availability first raised comparisons with the better reliability of the British Rail Class 24 Type 2. The Type 2s were averaging 30-40,000 miles per failure, the Baby Deltic {{less than a quarter}} of this. Although they suffered {{problems with}} the cylinder liners that weren't dissimilar to those of the Class 55 Deltics, most of the Class 23's early problems were a variety of failures with the engine ancillaries. The auxiliary gearbox used to drive the compressor and cooling fans was a particular problem, suffering from vibration in its geartrain and a resonant whirling in the long drive shaft to it at particular rpm. Many engines seized because this shaft driving the auxiliaries snapped and then whipped round, rupturing <b>coolant</b> <b>hoses</b> and causing overheating.|$|R
50|$|The second-generation Toyota CT26 used a twin entry {{turbine housing}} with dual {{wastegate}} ports. It was fitted {{to the second}} generation ST185 Toyota Celica GT-Four {{as well as the}} SW20 MR2 Turbo. The intake charge is cooled by an air-to-air intercooler either top-mounted in the Celica or side-mounted in the MR2. The rally homologation Celica (known as Group A Rallye in Australia, RC in Japan and Carlos Sainz Limited Edition in Europe) used a top-mounted water-to-air intercooler and is distinguished by a hood vent rather than a hood scoop as found in the non-homologation ST185s. This generation retains the T-VIS intake manifold and the Air Flow Meter. A factory BPV is included in the SW20 MR2 Turbo but not on the Celicas. Compression ratio is 8.8:1 and produces 200-232HP and 200-224 lb-ft. This generation retains the injector size and throttle body size from the previous generation. However, boost is increased to 10-11psi in the ST185 and MR2 while it is increased to 16psi in the ST185RC. Intake and exhaust valve lift is significantly increased to 8.2mm. This generation also is known for the infamous Hose from Hell (HFH) and Hose from Hell on Earth (HFHOE) as two small <b>coolant</b> <b>hoses</b> are known to require replacement sometime after 100k miles and is sandwiched in all directions by components.|$|R
50|$|Since an engine's oil circulates at {{much higher}} {{pressures}} than its coolant, {{oil in a}} porous head {{has a tendency to}} gradually seep into the coolant galleries. A typical symptom of a porous head is usually a 'mayonnaise'-like substance forming somewhere inside the cooling system (usually, this can be found residing on the coolant reservoir cap). However, depending on the degree of porosity, symptoms of a porous head have a tendency to vary. Many C20XE operators have described the symptom as a curry-like residue or in more severe cases, a thick brown sludge which may overcome the entire cooling system. In such instances, engine oil will readily react with the sulfur in rubber components, hence quickly degrading <b>coolant</b> pipes and <b>hoses</b> to the point of failure. During the porous head debacle, GM faced bankruptcy - therefore dealers failed to recall affected models. Due in part, to the engine's immense prominence and demand, many businesses now specialize in the repair of porous GM C20XE/LET heads - by either sleeving the affected gallery or by injecting a polymer based substance into the porous region. Reportedly, a small number of total GM C20XE cylinder heads ever exhibited significant symptoms of porosity.|$|R
