5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of <b>controversy</b> <b>surrounding</b> cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved {{controversial}} {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist.
