40|$|Abstract The calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate fixed-combination gel {{is widely}} used for topical {{treatment}} of psoriasis vulgaris. It has been hypothesized that calci-potriol counteracts glucocorticoid-induced skin atrophy which is associated with changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). To elucidate the combined effects of <b>calcipotriol</b> and betamethasone on key ECM components, a compara-tive study to the respective mono-treatments was carried out. The effect on collagen I synthesis, matrix metallo-proteinase (MMP) secretion, and hyaluronic acid (HA) production was investigated in primary human fibroblast and keratinocyte cultures {{as well as in}} a human skin explant model. We show that <b>calcipotriol</b> counteracts betamethasone-induced suppression of collagen I synthesis. Similarly, <b>calcipotriol</b> and betamethasone have opposing effects on MMP expression in both fibroblasts and kerati-nocytes. Moreover, <b>calcipotriol</b> is able to restore beta-methasone-impaired HA synthesis in keratinocytes and prevent betamethasone-induced epidermal thinning in minipigs upon treatment with the calcipotriol/betametha-sone gel.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Calcipotriol</b> {{has become}} a {{first-line}} treatment for psoriasis. Its efficacy and safety have been shown in many comparative clinical trials carried out in outpatients. In a comparative study in patients visiting the outpatient department once every 14 days, it was shown that <b>calcipotriol</b> was more effective and better tolerated compared with dithranol. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical efficacy of <b>calcipotriol</b> ointment with that of dithranol cream in a supervised treatment regimen. METHODS: In a multicentre randomized controlled trial in six centres in the Netherlands, 106 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were included, 54 receiving <b>calcipotriol</b> ointment twice daily and 52 dithranol cream once daily. Patients were treated at the day-care centre, using the care instruction principle of daily visits {{during the first week}} and twice-weekly visits subsequently for up to 12 weeks. RESULTS: This study failed to prove that <b>calcipotriol</b> is as efficacious as dithranol when used in a day-care setting (noninferiority test). The mean percentage reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index from baseline to end of treatment was 57. 0 % in the <b>calcipotriol</b> group vs. 63. 6 % in the dithranol group. However, the two-sided test for superiority indicated no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups (P = 0. 39). At the end of treatment, 15 % of the patients treated with <b>calcipotriol</b> ointment and 25 % of those treated with dithranol cream did not require any further treatment. Although <b>calcipotriol</b> ointment appeared to be more effective during the first 8 weeks, a difference was no longer apparent at 12 weeks. In comparison with the high number of drop-outs due to cutaneous side-effects in the <b>calcipotriol</b> group, the frequency of a tolerable degree of irritation appeared to be higher in patients treated with dithranol. However, concomitant corticosteroid treatment of dithranol irritation in seven patients may have contributed to this difference between both treatments. Moreover, patients receiving therapy with <b>calcipotriol</b> ointment experienced fewer application-related skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders than patients treated with dithranol cream: 21 of 53 (40 %) and 37 of 52 (71 %), respectively.

40|$|Background <b>Calcipotriol</b> and {{betamethasone}} dipropionate are both widely used, effective treatments for psoriasis.

Objectives The present study was conducted in order to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of the combined ointment formulation used once daily with the vehicle ointment used twice daily, <b>calcipotriol</b> ointment used twice daily and the combined formulation used twice daily in psoriasis vulgaris. Methods This was an international, multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group, 4 -week study in patients with psoriasis vulgaris amenable to topical treatment.

Efficacy and safety were assessed. Results There was no statistically significant difference in the mean percentage change in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline to end of treatment between the two combined formulation groups, but the difference in PASI reduction was significantly higher in the combined formulation groups (68. 6 % once daily, 73. 8 % twice daily) than in both the twice daily <b>calcipotriol</b> group (58. 8 %) and the vehicle group (26. 6 %).

40|$|<b>Calcipotriol</b> {{is a new}} and {{effective}} topical treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis vulgaris. It is an analogue of calcitriol (1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D - the active metabolite of vitamin D), and so {{has the potential to}} affect systemic calcium metabolism even when used topically. Animal studies indicate that parenteral <b>calcipotriol</b> has a weaker effect on systemic calcium homeostasis than calcitriol. Extensive clinical trials using relatively small amounts of <b>calcipotriol</b> (50 mg/g) ointment (on average 30 - 40 g/wk) detected no effect on serum calcium in vivo provided that the recommended maximum weekly dose of 100 g was not exceeded. Cases of hypercalcaemia from <b>calcipotriol</b> ointment have been reported, both after excessive use and in relation to manufacturers recommendations. Short wave ultraviolet light (UVB) is commonly used to treat psoriasis in combination with topical agents such as dithranol and tar. The use of <b>calcipotriol</b> in combination with UVB is becoming common practice. UVB initiates synthesis of vitamin D in the skin and therefore might enhance the calciotropic effects of <b>calcipotriol</b> when used in combination. The aims of this study were to detect any alteration of calcium homeostasis in patients treated with topical <b>calcipotriol,</b> to identify the mechanism(s) of any detected effects and to determine whether the addition of UVB would enhance those effects. In summary, we have confirmed that topical <b>calcipotriol</b> does have an effect on systemic calcium homeostasis. Intestinal absorption of calcium, and probably phosphate, is increased, when large doses are applied (up to 360 g of the 50 mg/g ointment per week). Serum calcium and phosphate rise while serum PTH and 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 levels fell. Urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate are increased. The suppressive effects on PTH and endogenous 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 levels may be due to direct inhibition by <b>calcipotriol</b> as well as indirect effects of rising serum calcium and phosphate. At the upper limit of the recommended dose (100 g/wk), <b>calcipotriol</b> has a small but measurable effect on systemic calcium homeostasis as manifested by a small rise in 24 h urine calcium and serum ionized calcium. These changes are probably not of clinical significance. The addition of short wave ultraviolet light has no additive effect on systemic calcium homeostasis at recommended doses...|$|E

The results of our study show that in the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis, topical <b>calcipotriol</b> combined with Spa Rusanda balneotherapy is more effective than topical <b>calcipotriol</b> alone. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effects of balneotherapy as monotherapy in treatment of this type of psoriasis...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Calcitriol and <b>calcipotriol</b> {{are widely}} used in the topical {{treatment}} of psoriasis. However, studies comparing both treatment modalities are scarce. Especially, there are almost no studies comparing the effects on epidermal cell populations in a quantitative manner. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to quantitatively compare the effects of topical calcitriol and topical <b>calcipotriol</b> on clinical scores and epidermal subpopulations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From five patients with stable plaque psoriasis, skin biopsies were taken from two symmetrical regions on the trunk or extremities before and after treatment with either calcitriol or <b>calcipotriol.</b> Frozen sections were labelled immunofluorescently using direct immunofluorescence for beta- 1 integrin and the Zenon labelling technique for keratin (K) 6, K 10 and K 15. The digital photographs of the stained sections were quantitatively analysed and the results of both treatments were compared. RESULTS: The clinical SUM-score improved significantly for both the calcitriol- and the calcipotriol-treated lesions. In the calcipotriol-treated group the expression of K 10 and K 15 increased and the expression of K 6 decreased significantly. No changes were seen for the marker beta- 1 integrin. In the calcitriol-treated group none of the markers changed significantly. A tendency towards significance was seen for the changes in the expression of K 6 and K 15 in favour of <b>calcipotriol.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Both calcitriol and <b>calcipotriol</b> gave a significant improvement in clinical scores. However, treatment with <b>calcipotriol</b> resulted in a normalization of K 6, K 10 and K 15, whereas treatment with calcitriol did not. Comparison of both treatments showed a tendency towards significance for the above-mentioned markers for <b>calcipotriol</b> only...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTopical agents {{containing}} vitamin D 3 (VD 3) analogues such as <b>calcipotriol,</b> maxacalcitol and tacalcitol and {{the combination}} of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (betamethasone) are prescribed for patients with psoriasis. However, they are known to occasionally cause hypercalcemia, {{and the frequency of}} hypercalcemia is suggested to vary according to the VD 3 analogue used. In this study, to address the reason for these differences, the calcemic effects of maxacalcitol-, calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments in rats were evaluated. The serum calcium levels in rats treated with ointments containing maxacalcitol, but not <b>calcipotriol</b> or calcipotriol/betamethasone, were significantly elevated, which is consistent with clinical observations. The serum concentration of VD 3 analogue in rats treated with ointments containing <b>calcipotriol</b> and calcipotriol/betamethasone was lower than that in rats treated with maxacalcitol-containing ointment. Thus, the calcemic effects appear {{to be associated with the}} systemic exposure of VD 3 analogues in rats. To understand the mechanism underlying the different systemic exposures of VD 3 analogues, skin permeation and metabolic stability of VD 3 analogues were evaluated. The cumulative amount of <b>calcipotriol</b> permeated through rat skin was significantly lower than that of maxacalcitol. On the other hand, the metabolic clearance of <b>calcipotriol</b> in rat hepatocytes was higher than that of maxacalcitol. Similar results were obtained using human skin and human hepatocytes. The current study demonstrates that the lower calcemic effects of calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments are caused by the low systemic exposure of <b>calcipotriol</b> according to low skin permeability and rapid hepatic elimination after topical application...|$|E
