40|$|In June 2016, {{a climate}} and energy {{strategy}} for Oslo was {{enacted by the}} city council. The overall climate targets adopted for Oslo 2030 – 2050 were to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 % (2030) and to zero in 2050. To achieve these goals, several measures for the various municipal sectors have to be implemented. For the transport sector, the most important measure is to ensure transition from individual car transport to public transport, cycling and walking, green goods transportation. Having a fossil free society in 2050, then {{it is crucial to}} reverse trends to changing people’s behaviour. If car traffic inside the city centre will be banned, then the consequences need to be evaluated. The concern for the disabled, goods transportation, public transit and residents must be safeguarded. Through comparison with other cities that are partially car-free, we have described some consequences that {{must be taken into account}} when implementing the green policy. Several methods are used, a literature review and face-to-face interviews. A study-tour to Germany and France included city-walks, and interviews with urban and transport planners and politicians from the cities of Nuremberg, Freiburg, and Strasbourg. These cities were chosen because of their log experience with implementation of pedestrianized city centres. The provision of pedestrianized city centre in Oslo may at first glance seem like a political stunt from an inexperienced visionary political party. Drastic measures must be implemented, that requires thoughtful planning and participation. A <b>car-free</b> <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> cannot be completed at the expense of the population, and to have a good planning phase will be more important than the goal of implementing the measures within a certain time limit. Achieving good accessibility for all affected may potentially lead to a vibrant cityscape, suitable for many...|$|E

40|$|<b>City</b> <b>centres</b> are changing. More {{and more}} do they compete with {{suburban}} <b>centres</b> or other <b>cities.</b> Jan Gehl has proven that making historic <b>cities</b> <b>car-free</b> AND improving {{the conditions for}} pedestrians is a vital strategy (Hoeven et al, 2008). Since 2000 the City of Delft is implementing car-free zones in the historic <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> (with a lot of scepsis and opposition). In 2009 the results were evaluated.

40|$|A current {{problem is}} that <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> are {{suffering}} due to the intensified competition from other shopping places, such as neighbouring cities and external shopping malls. Previous research emphasize retail as the most contributing factor to an attractive <b>city</b> <b>centre.</b> However, other attributes {{have proved to be}} important as well. The purpose of the thesis is to develop a framework that explains different attributes for <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> attractiveness, and explain if residents and visitors differ in regard to satisfaction of <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> The attributes that will measure <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> attractiveness are retail, accessibility, amusement, activities and atmosphere. The research is done in an explaining context and the research philosophy is positivistic with a deductive approach. The quantitative method was face to face questionnaires conducted on 100 consumers in the Swedish <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> Kristianstad. The findings of the study revealed that <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> attractiveness is positively affected by retail, amusement, activities and atmosphere. Accessibility did not show any statistical significant impact on the attractiveness of <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> Moreover, residents and visitors did not differ in regard to satisfaction of Kristianstad <b>city</b> <b>centre.</b> The main limitation {{of this study is that}} only one <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> is examined. However, the contributions are that retail proved to be important in <b>city</b> <b>centres,</b> but not as important as amusement, activities and atmosphere. Furthermore, the study contributes by discovering that residents and visitors are equally satisfied with Kristianstad <b>city</b> <b>centre.</b> The findings can be useful for Kristianstad <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> as well as other Swedish municipalities...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of Internet use and b 2 c e-commerce led to many speculations about {{the impacts of}} ICT on society. In the Netherlands, {{there is a growing}} concern about the implications of b 2 c e-commerce for <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> retailing. Therefore, this dissertation has empirically investigated the implications of b 2 c e-commerce for retailing at <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> in the Netherlands. Approximately 1, 000 <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> retailers and 3, 200 internet users have been interviewed. So far, the large majority (around 80 %) of the Internet users indicate that they do not make fewer visits to the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> and purchases at <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> stores due to e-shopping. <b>City</b> <b>centre</b> shopping is still considered a pleasant activity. Internet users enjoy going to the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> and {{there is no indication that}} this will be different in the future. Nevertheless, consumers already frequently use the Internet as an information channel prior to purchasing in the <b>city</b> <b>centre.</b> The reverse behaviour where people acquire information in the <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> prior to purchasing online is also frequently observed. E-shopping also modifies <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> shopping, as it tends to shorten the shopping duration at <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> Finally, online searching also made consumers more aware of the prices of products at <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> Given the interconnection between e-shopping and in-store shopping at <b>city</b> <b>centres,</b> it came as no surprise that <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> retailers also employ the Internet in a complementary fashion. <b>City</b> <b>centre</b> retailers have responded to the changes in consumers' <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> shopping behaviour, by operating a website in addition to their physical store(s). Results have shown that following an Internet strategy mainly had positive impacts on retailers' performance. Positive effects of going online most often concerned receiving more in-store customers, customer relationship improvement, increased competitiveness, and overall sales growth. Claims that adopting an online selling strategy may cannibalise retailers' in-store sales and induce a shift from costly retail space to distribution space were not confirmed by this research. In addition, following an Internet strategy did not alter the functions of shops, leading to new retail formats at <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> Thus, in general b 2 c e-commerce does not seem to have a large detrimental impact on <b>city</b> <b>centre</b> retailing. In fact, consumers and retailers at <b>city</b> <b>centres</b> even benefit from exploiting new shopping and business opportunities as provided by the Internet. However, it should be noted that implications of b 2 c e-commerce largely vary among sectors and types of <b>city</b> <b>centres.</b> With e-shopping still rapidly expanding, city planners and property owners should be aware of the consequences of b 2 c e-commerce in relation with other trends that currently reshape the city centr...|$|R
