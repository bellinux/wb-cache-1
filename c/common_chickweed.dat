40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in the production [...] of successful forage/green manure legume [...] crops in Alaska is weed control.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to document the weeds that persisted in vineyards after weed control practices were complete. A particular interest was detection of weeds potentially resistant to glyphosate. The {{survey was conducted}} throughout the state of Ohio by visiting 31 vineyards in 2004. Each grower provided us with an area ranging from 0. 33 to several acres that they felt was representative of the general weed problems in the vineyards. Weed species and numbers were counted in 20 random drops of a 25 × 25 cm quadrat. Herbicide spraying history, grape varieties, vineyard locations, and grapevine age were collected by interviewing the growers and visiting the vineyards. Data were analyzed by SAS 9. 1 using GLM model, and means were compared according to Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) at the 0. 05 level. Crabgrass, dandelion, pigweed, foxtail, fall panicum, clover, <b>chickweed,</b> <b>common</b> ragweed, smartweed, and oxalis were the most prevalent weeds in Ohio vineyards with relative abundance values of 44. 2, 25. 4, 17. 7, 17. 1, 14. 3, 11. 6, 11. 3, 10. 6, 10. 3, and 9. 3, respectively. When glyphosate was the sole means of management control of crabgrass, dandelion, and oxalis was poor, relative to control with other herbicide management programs. These data suggest that glyphosate resistance may be a potential problem in these weeds. The survey also showed that weed problems were more severe in Vinifera vineyards than in Concord and French hybrid vineyards.

40|$|Introduction After {{detecting}} {{erythema multiforme}} due to contact with weeds, dandelion (Taraxacum offwinale, Compositae) and <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> (Stellaria media, Caryophyllaceae), which are ubiquitous plants in Vojvodina, and concerning properties of commercial screening allergens in detection of allergy to plants, we investigated contact allergy to dandelion and to common chick-weed, using their extracts. Material and methods Epicutaneous tests were performed using originally prepared ether extracts of these plants, 0. 1 % and 3 % pet., in 263 individuals: 43 with extrinsic atopic dermatitis, 55 with allergic contact dermatitis, 118 with non-allergic chronic inflammatory skin diseases and 47 healthy adults. Results Our results {{have shown that}} testing with both extracts (both concentrations) represents a safe method, since no irritation or sensibilization occurred. The overall prevalence of allergy to dandelion extract was 1. 14 %, and for <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> extract 2. 28 %. Discussion Plant allergies (especially Compositae) cannot always be detected by standard screening allergens. Additional testing with dandelion extract can detect most cases, which is in agreement with our results. Isolation of essential oil from common chick-weed proved the allergenic potential of this plant. The prevalence of detected allergy to dandelion {{as well as to}} <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> was higher than 1 %. Conclusion These ubiquitous weeds and high prevalence of detected allergies have included Vojvodina into a risk zone for getting contact sensitivity to dandelion and <b>common</b> <b>chickweed.</b> Dandelion extract should be considered for Compositae screening series and <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> extract for specific plant series in Vojvodina. ...|$|E

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportWeeds {{are a major}} {{constraint}} to {{crop production}} in NY State and can significantly reduce {{the quantity and quality}} of harvested crops. The management of weeds also incurs substantial costs for farmers and may have negative impacts on the environment. Thus, there is an urgent need to better predict the timing of weed emergence in cropping systems and to identify those factors affecting emergence. In this research, we studied the emergence pattern of agricultural weeds in two common central NY soil types and in response to biweekly soil disturbance. Seedling emergence data and weather data (i. e. growing-degree days and precipitation) were collected at two research locations in central NY throughout the 2016 growing season. The Musgrave Research Farm (Aurora, Cayuga County, NY) has moderately drained clay-loam soils (Honeyoe/Lima soils) where grain crops are studied, while the Homer Thompson Research Farm (Freeville, Tompkins County, NY) is on very well-drained sandy loam (Howard/Phelps soils) where both vegetable and grain crops are grown. The 2016 growing season was exceptionally dry; weed emergence rates were low at both sites, but emergence was lowest at the H. Thompson site in the better-drained soils despite similar rainfall and temperatures. Data from ten weed species were analyzed; of these, only pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) was common at both sites. At the Musgrave site, weed emergence for all species peaked in late May/early June, with a smaller flush in late summer; the exception was Venice mallow (Hibiscus trionum), which had its main emergence in mid-summer. At both sites, warm- and cool-season weeds were present, as well as an annual grass; but emergence patterns were more varied. The perennial grass Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) emerged only in the spring, while hairy galinsoga (Galinsoga quadriradiata) and <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> (Stellaria media) emerged mainly in the fall with a small preliminary flush in June; <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> had similar emergence rates in June and September.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} weed seed production in widely spaced spring wheat crops that received aggressive mechanical weed control (hoeing and harrowing) compared with that in narrowly spaced crops receiving less aggressive mechanical control (harrowing only). Three species (wild buckwheat [Polygonum convolvulus], ladysthumb [Polygonum persicaria], and <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> [Stellaria media]) were studied in three row-spacing treatments (10, 20, and 30 cm) and two sowing densities (140 and 180 kg ha− 1). Average seed production per surviving plant was up to three times higher in the 30 -cm treatments compared with the 10 -cm treatments. Taking into account the 40 50 eed mortality resulting from control in the 30 -cm treatments, seed production per seedling was still higher in the 30 -cm treatments than in the 10 -cm treatments. Differences in wheat yield were not found among treatments.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the potential of potash solution as a foliar herbicide with application to Malian agriculture. Potash samples were collected in Mali and analyzed for phytotoxicity and elemental composition. Aqueous potash solutions were applied as foliar sprays to seedlings of six plant species. All species were injured by the treatments, with 90 % visual injury to <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> at 84. 4 kg/ha potash. Broadleaf species showed greater injury {{in the absence of}} a surfactant, but addition of methylated soybean oil increased injury to most grass species. In all cases, injury was evident within three hours of treatment and approached maximum levels by 24 hrs. Elemental analysis of the potash showed the major component to be potassium (ranging from 454, 300 to 493, 310 ppm). Potash is a concentration of salts extracted from ash, and is readily available to Malian farmers as a byproduct of burning wood and crop residues. In light of the increasing interest in natural products, potash has potential to be an inexpensive, naturally-occurring herbicide that can fill needs for nonselective weed control in Malian agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Chemicals {{are being}} sought that can control weeds in lettuce under {{different}} environmental conditions, soil types and weed populations. The extensive or repeated {{use of a}} herbicide may lead to important changes in the weed population which call for new materials that {{can take care of}} the modified situation. In the search for new chemicals, RH 315 has appeared promising in some respects. Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine the tolerance of lettuce (crisphead type) to RH 315 in three types of soil. Its performance on weeds under different environmental conditions, its residual action on other vegetables, as well as pre and postemergence activity on weeds were also tested. Other herbicides were used in some experiments. Lettuce of the crisphead type proved to possess high tolerance to RH 315. The tolerance was greater in a silty clay loam and a muck soil than in a sandy soil. In all types of soil, the safety factor was greater than 2 X when susceptible weeds are considered. The degree of tolerance varied with the season in field experiments. RH 315 at 1. 5 to 2 lb/A in a silty clay loam and at 1 to 1. 5 lb/A in a sandy loam provided excellent control of annual bluegrass, Italian ryegrass, barnyardgrass, green foxtail, <b>common</b> <b>chickweed,</b> purslane, mouseear chickweed, lambsquarters, henbit, red dead-nettle, shepherspurse and bittercress. The control of pigweed and wild mustard required higher rates. No control of composite species was achieved with this compound. Delaying sprinkler irrigation after application caused reduction in RH 315 activity. It was more effective in controlling weeds in early fall than during the summer. Two months after application, RH 315 residues from rates which were effective in controlling susceptible weeds did not cause injury to bush beans, sweet corn, cucumbers, red beets, <b>common</b> <b>chickweed</b> and annual bluegrass, under summer conditions. When applied at the stage of two true leaves or before, under conditions of early fall, RH 315 proved to possess postemergence activity on weed species that are controlled by preemergence applications of this compound. From 17 to 2 O days were required for RH 315 to exert its effect in postemergence application. Trifluralin at 0. 75 lb/A provided excellent control of Italian ryegrass, barnyardgrass, pigweed and purslane both in a silty clay loam and a sandy loam. Benefin and EL 179 both at 1 lb/A gave good control of the same weeds in the silty clay loam, but their performance was inferior to that of trifluralin.

40|$|Management of {{volunteer}} horseradish {{is a major}} challenge in fields when horseradish {{is included in the}} crop rotation. Three field studies were conducted: 1) to evaluate the growth habit and density {{of volunteer}} horseradish, 2) to evaluate the efficacy of fall herbicide applications for control of volunteer horseradish, 3) to evaluate the tolerance of subsequent horseradish crops to persisting soil residues of halosulfuron. One year following horseradish production, field infestations of volunteer horseradish ranged from 0. 08 to 6. 60 plants/m 2 with the majority of plants emerging from established roots left below the depth of horseradish harvest and tillage. Fall herbicide applications provided effective control of volunteer horseradish compared to the nontreated control. Combinations of 2, 4 –D tank–mixed with glyphosate, iodosulfuron, halosulfuron, or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron achieved the greatest control of volunteer horseradish and reduced volunteer horseradish densities to less than 1 plant /m 2, while glyphosate alone provided the least control and density reduction. In addition to volunteer horseradish control, combinations of 2, 4 –D with glyphosate, iodosulfuron, halosulfuron, or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron also provided 97 % or greater control of winter annual weeds (henbit, <b>common</b> <b>chickweed,</b> and Carolina foxtail). Although the herbicide halosulfuron is very effective at controlling volunteer horseradish, {{it has the potential to}} injure future horseradish crops due to soil persistence. Field studies showed that after 4 months following a June halosulfuron application, horseradish can be replanted with no visual injury or reduction in root biomass. Tillage may provide temporary removal of volunteer horseradish plants, however, herbicide applications (e. g., 2, 4 –D with halosulfuron, iodosulfuron or rimsulfuron:thifensulfuron) provide the most consistent, complete control of volunteer horseradish...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{importance}} of phenoxy herbicides (hormone herbicides) in Scottish Agriculture with specific reference to the spring barley crop, the most important cereal crop in Scotland. In 2013 the agricultural census figures showed that to 296, 000 hectares of spring barley were planted in 2013. Of this area pesticide usage surveys estimate that 72 % of the spring barley crop was sprayed with a metsulfuron-methyl, (sulfonylurea/ALS inhibitor), the most common sulfonylurea in Scotland in 2012. There was a similar area of crop sprayed with a phenoxy herbicide, a figure that has remained fairly constant over the last 10 years. The phenoxy herbicides are important as standalone products {{but they also have}} an important use in resistance management of the sulfonylurea herbicide group. Sulfonylureas are the foundation of herbicide use in the spring barley crop in Scotland. The use of phenoxy herbicides in spring barley has not prevented the development of resistant to the sulfonylureas in the Stellaria media (<b>common</b> <b>chickweed)</b> population in the Scottish spring barley crop. Sulfonylurea resistant chickweed is not confined to the spring barley crop but is a problem in other crops in Scotland such as potatoes and maize where sulfonylureas are used. Resistance to the sulfonylurea group of herbicides {{has been shown to be}} target site occurring as result of a single mutation. The multi site mode of action of the phenoxy herbicides are useful anti-resistance options with the sulfonylureas offering control of sulfonylurea resistant Stellaria media. The phenoxy herbicides are also particularly useful in increasing the weed spectrum of the sulfonylureas and the use to control difficult weeds such as Fumaria officinalis (common fumitory) in spring barley crop...|$|E
40|$|The Broadbalk {{experiment}} {{was started in}} 1843 to investigate {{the relative importance of}} different plant nutrients (N, P, K, Na, Mg) on grain yield of winter wheat. Weeds were controlled initially by hand hoeing and fallowing, but since 1964, herbicides have been applied to the whole experiment {{with the exception of the}} 18 plots on Section 8. Approximately 130 weed species have been recorded on Broadbalk and about 30 of these are currently recorded annually on Section 8. Detailed weed surveys, conducted from 1930 to 1979, provide a unique 50 -yr record, but the relatively small number of frequency categories used (six) poses a limitation on the interpretation of these data for ecological studies. Weed surveys were restarted in 1991 on Section 8. The current assessment method records the presence of individual 2 weed species in 25 random 0. 1 -m(2) quadrats per plot, which is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots. A principal components analysis of the 1991 - 2002 survey data for 15 species showed clearly the influence of inorganic N fertilizer levels on the frequency of individual species. The frequency of one species (<b>common</b> <b>chickweed)</b> was greatly favored by increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizer from 0 to 288 kg N ha(- 1), others were strongly disadvantaged (e. g., black medic and field horsetail), some were slightly disadvantaged (e. g., common vetch and parsley-piert), and some showed little response to differing N rates (e. g., blackgrass and corn poppy). Other weed investigations include studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank, seed dormancy and persistence, agroecology, and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, which is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 160 yr after it was established...|$|E
