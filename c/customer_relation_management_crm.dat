50|$|As {{described}} in, The {{framework of}} e-maintenance machine network consists of sensors, data acquisition system, communication network, analytic agents, decision-making support knowledge base, information synchronization interface and e-business system for decision making. Initially, the sensors, controllers and operators with data acquisition {{are used to}} collect the raw data from equipment and send it out to Data Transformation Layer automatically via internet or intranet. The Data Transform Layer then employs signal processing tools and feature extraction methods to convert the raw data into useful information. This converted information often carries rich information about the reliability and availability of machines or system and is more agreeable for intelligent analysis tools to perform subsequent process. The Synchronization Module and Intelligent Tools comprise the major processing power of the e-maintenance machine network and provide optimization, prediction, clustering, classification, bench-marking and so on. The results from this module can then be synchronized and shared with the e-business system on for decision making. In real application, the synchronization module will provide connection with other departments at the decision making level, like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), <b>Customer</b> <b>Relation</b> <b>Management</b> (<b>CRM)</b> and Supply Chain Management (SCM).|$|E

Since the mobile cloudbased CRM service is a new business area, acceptance and adoption of mobile cloud-based CRM service is a domain requiring further academic research. On the basis of the literature review a research framework of acceptance and adoption of cloud and mobile-based CRM service was constructed. METHODOLOGY: Research data was collected in co-operation with a Finnish ICT company during May-October 2014. The B 2 B data consisted of two samples. The primary sample was received by interviewing five of the six B 2 B companies who attended the pilot project testing the new mobile cloud-based CRM service. The online questionnaire was sent to total of 9400 small size B 2 B customers, and the response rate was 1, 45 %. After the data collection phase the data was subjected to various statistical analyses to test the hypotheses presented in the research framework. FINDINGS: The results of the study highlight the importance of technological and organizational factors that are influencing the acceptance and adoption of mobile cloud-based CRM service. Especially the innovation characteristics concerning cost-savings, mobility, comprehensiveness, security, and personalization are influencing as technological features towards acceptance. Also, simplicity, compatibility, and triability are seen as important features to acceptance and adoption of mobile cloud-based service.

However, only a small number of companies have adopted it and according to surveys, their satisfaction is relatively low. On the contrary, <b>customer</b> <b>relation</b> <b>management</b> (<b>CRM)</b> is a marketing approach that still keeps its popularity. Is not therefore CRM a solution also for outsourcing of IT? How should it be applied in the field? This master's thesis is intended for providers of outsourcing of IT and it aims to find answers to the questions above. The first step towards the goal is to identify main characteristic features of outsourcing of IT, which consequently provide a guideline for a systematic approach to the solution. The thesis does not presume reader's familiarity with CRM, hence the second chapter offers a brief yet holistic view of the issue. A synthesis of the information from the first two parts leads to a conclusion that it is not possible to decide about suitability of CRM in outsourcing of IT on a general basis, but always in the particular situation. Therefore the work suggests a set of criteria for the choice. The consecutive chapters deal with the application of CRM. Firstly, an entire system of tools for evaluation of customers is proposed. It enables providers to determine the suitable level of individual approach to each customer with consideration of both business and technical factors. Consequently, a provider can start building a relationship with his customer taking advantage of number of recommendations and tools given by this paper. It includes measures not only for convincing customers but also for increasing their retention. The thesis discusses broad variety of aspects of marketing in outsourcing of IT.

40|$|Starting a new {{business}} is often done in a realm of improvisation if resources are scarce and the business horizon is far from clear. Strategic improvisation occurs when the design of novel activities unite. We conducted an investigation of so called ‘emergent collectives’ {{in the context of}} a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). Emergent collectives are networks of information nodes with minimal central control and largely controlled by a protocol specification where people can add nodes to the network and have a social incentive to do so. We considered here emergent collectives around an enterprise resources planning (ERP) software and a <b>customer</b> <b>relation</b> <b>management</b> (<b>CRM)</b> software in two open source software (OSS) communities. We investigated how the use of bricolage {{in the context of a}} start-up microenterprise can facilitate the adoption of an information system (IS) based on emergent collectives. Bricolage is an improvisational approach that allows learning form concrete experience. In our case study we followed the inception of a {{new business}} initiative up to the implementation of an IS, during a period of two years. The case study covers both the usefulness of bricolage for strategic improvisation and for entrepreneurial activity in a knowledge-intensive new business. We adopted an interpretative research strategy and used participatory action research to conduct our inquiry. Our findings lead to the suggestion that emergent collectives can be moulded into a usable set of IS resources applicable in a microenterprise. However the success depends heavily on the ICT managerial and technological capabilities of the CEO and his individual commitment to the process of bricolage. Our findings also show that open ERP and CRM software are not passing delusions. These emergent collectives will not take over proprietary ERP and CRM software all of a sudden, but clearly the rules of the game are slowly changing due to the introduction of new business models. The study contributes to the research of OSS as emergent collectives, bricolage and IS adoption in SMEs...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine empirically the challenges facing admission management and the perceptions of students and staff on the admission process. A thorough literature study of management processes was done and a survey method was used to gather data. The subjects of the study were 57 students and 15 admission staff members (manager academic services, admissions officer, administration officers, senior administration officers, faculty secretaries, examination officer, accounts and finance personnel). The empirical investigation conducted has shown that students, the very customers of collegiate education, regard staff attitude as one of the important attributes that reflects on good management and that in their view admission staff at UNW is lacking in terms of their on-the job attitude. The findings also revealed that admission staff, on the other hand, finds their attitude to be normal and acceptable. It is for this reason that management faces a challenge of having to come up with a solution that will best address the matter to restore good student-staff relations on campus. As a possible solution to this problem, a staff induction course on <b>customer</b> <b>relations</b> <b>management</b> (<b>CRM)</b> was recommended for all staff involved with student affairs and admissions~ This would help clear misunderstandings between students and staff, thus creating an environment of mutual respect and trust.

5000|$|An {{illustration}} of the conceptual framework of a predictive manufacturing system is shown in Figure 1. [...] The system starts out with a data acquisition system that can either be built-in by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a third party provider. Using appropriate sensor assemblies, various signals such as vibration, pressure, temperature, etc. can be recorded. The types of signals and data acquisition parameters {{are determined by the}} application and the failure modes of the asset being monitored. Communication protocols, such as MTConnect and OLE-DB Process Control or OPC, can help users to acquire process or controller signals. Such data can provide context as to the type of action/function the machine was performing when sensor data was being collected. Imagine when all data are gathered and combined with all the assets in a facility. When all the data are aggregated, this phenomenon is called “Big Data” because of the volume of data collected, velocity by which data is being received and variety of data that are being collated. Such phenomenon requires new paradigms and approaches for analysis instead of statistical process control or other traditional statistical analysis techniques. The new transforming agent then consists of several components: an integrated platform, predictive analytics and visualization tools. The deployment platform is naturally selected based on several factors such as speed of computation, investment cost, ease of deployment for scaling purposes and update, etc. The actual processing or transformation of big data into useful information is performed by utilizing predictive analytics such as the tools found in the Watchdog Agent® toolbox that has been developed by researchers at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Research Cooperative Center (I/UCRC) for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) since 2001. There are also other predictive analytic providers such as IBM, Hadoop, SAS, SAP, etc. The algorithms found in the Watchdog Agent® can be categorized into four sections namely, signal processing and feature extraction, health assessment, performance prediction and fault diagnosis. By utilizing visualization tools, health information such as current condition, remaining useful life estimation, root cause, etc., can be effectively conveyed using radar charts, fault maps, risk charts and even health degradation curves. The calculated health information can then be forwarded or made available to existing company management systems such as enterprise resource planning system (ERP), manufacturing execution system (MES), supply chain <b>management</b> system (SCM), <b>customer</b> <b>relation</b> <b>management</b> system (<b>CRM),</b> product lifecycle <b>management</b> system (PLM) to achieve overall enterprise control and optimization. With manufacturing transparency, management then has the appropriate information (such as actual condition and state of machines, not just cycle times) to determine factory-wide overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). By knowing when assets will fail, equipment can then be managed more effectively with just-in-time maintenance. Finally, if historical health and failure modes can be compiled, such information can then be fed back to the equipment designer for closed loop lifecycle redesign ...|$|R
