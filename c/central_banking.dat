40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{theory of}} money, developed by Basil Moore, {{argues that the}} supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money in modern economies is not {{under the control of}} the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> According to this view, a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> typically supplies cash reserves automatically on demand at its minimum lending rate, resulting in a clearly horizontal money supply function. While the paper agrees with Moore that the supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money cannot be determined exogenously by the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> it wonders whether the supply is determined completely by the demand of the commercial banks. The paper suggests that the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> has some exogenous power to control the quantity of its supply by rationing.
