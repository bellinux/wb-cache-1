500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} principles behind them, in some ways Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or the <b>compression</b> <b>stroke</b> of the vacuum pump, should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling coil, compressor and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as the 'grandfather of refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|E
2500|$|... {{diesel engines}} have no {{detonation}} because diesel fuel is injected at or {{towards the end}} of the <b>compression</b> <b>stroke</b> and is ignited solely by the heat of compression of the charge air. Because of this, diesel engines can use a much higher boost pressure than spark ignition engines, limited only by the engine's ability to withstand the additional heat and pressure.|$|E
2500|$|To {{simplify the}} engine and reduce costs, the V-twin {{ignition}} was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor. This {{is known as a}} dual fire ignition system, causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its <b>compression</b> <b>stroke,</b> with the other spark plug firing on its cylinder's exhaust stroke, effectively [...] "wasting a spark".

50|$|Internal-combustion {{engines are}} {{feedback}} systems, which, once started, {{rely on the}} inertia from each cycle to initiate the next cycle. In a four-stroke engine, the third stroke releases energy from the fuel, powering the fourth (exhaust) stroke and also the first two (intake, <b>compression)</b> <b>strokes</b> of the next cycle, as well as powering the engine's external load. To start the first cycle {{at the beginning of}} any particular session, the first two strokes must be powered in some other way than from the engine itself. The starter motor is used for this purpose and is not required once the engine starts running and its feedback loop becomes self-sustaining.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the effect of}} compression ratio {{on the performance of}} a direct injection diesel engine. One aspect of engine performance is considered in great detail, namely the combustion performance at increased clearance volume. This aspect was of particular interest because variable compression ratio (VCR) systems normally operate by varying the clearance volume. The investigation relied upon results obtained both from experimental and computer simulating models. The experimental tests were carried out using a single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine, under simulated turbocharged conditions at a reduced compression ratio. A number of one-dimensional computer models were developed; these simulate the induction and <b>compression</b> <b>strokes,</b> and the fuel spray trajectories in the presence of air swirl.

The two-dimensional velocity vector fields are analyzed on a vertical plane passing through the axis of the cylinder. To quantify the tumble flows, tumble ratio (TR) and average turbulent kinetic energy (ATKE) are estimated from the ensemble average velocity vectors obtained from PIV measurements. It is found that, the TR and ATKE are higher for pentroof-offset-cavity piston than pentroof-central-cavity piston. The present study will be useful in understanding the effect of piston-cavity and shape {{on the nature of}} the in-cylinder tumble flows in real engine conditions...|$|R
5000|$|VEB The Volvo Engine Brake is a {{compression}} type {{engine brake}} first introduced on D12A and since used on later designed OHC engines from 9 to 16 litre displacement. The brake operates on a principle where exhaust valve cam followers acts on secondary cam profile when engine brake is activated. Engine oil pressure {{is used to}} eliminate extra valve clearance thus this action forces the follower against secondary lobes and unseating exhaust valves temporarily to achieve so-called compression bleeding as employed by similar systems from Jacobs, Cummins and Mack however Volvo system has an extra cam lobe thus giving two openings of the exhaust valves and is designed to work in conjunction with an exhaust brake so two of the engine's four strokes are used to raise engine braking effect - Exhaust and <b>Compression</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{temperature}} {{at the top}} of the <b>compression</b> <b>stroke</b> depends on many factors, particularly the compression ratio of the cylinder and the starting temperature of the inducted air.

50|$|When the {{transfer}} is complete, the piston {{is on the}} <b>compression</b> <b>stroke</b> but the exhaust port is still open, an unavoidable problem with the two stroke piston port design. To help prevent the piston pushing fresh mixture out the open exhaust port the strong acoustic wave (produced by the combustion) from the expansion chamber is timed to arrive during {{the beginning of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>stroke.</b> The port blocking wave is created by reducing the diameter of the chamber. This is called the convergent section (or baffle cone). The outgoing acoustic wave hits the narrowing convergent section and reflects back a strong series of acoustic pulses to the cylinder. They arrive in time to block the exhaust port, still open during the beginning of the <b>compression</b> <b>stroke</b> and push back into the cylinder any fresh mixture drawn out into the header of the expansion chamber. The convergent section is made to converge at 16 to 25 degrees, depending on requirements.|$|E
50|$|In the Miller-cycle engine, {{the piston}} begins to {{compress}} the fuel-air mixture {{only after the}} intake valve closes; and the intake valve closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total piston travel of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the fuel-air mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the <b>compression</b> <b>stroke.</b> During the initial part of the <b>compression</b> <b>stroke,</b> the piston pushes part of the fuel-air mixture through the still-open intake valve, {{and back into the}} intake manifold.|$|E
