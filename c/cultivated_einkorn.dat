50|$|The dog, sheep, {{goats and}} {{possibly}} cattle and pigs were introduced, {{as well as}} numerous wild animals such as foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos) and <b>cultivated</b> <b>einkorn</b> and emmer. Pigs, sheep, goat and cattle were kept but remained, for the most part, behaviourally wild.

5000|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} wild einkorn and <b>cultivated</b> <b>einkorn</b> is {{the method of}} seed dispersal. In the wild variety the seed head usually shatters and drops the kernels (seeds) of wheat onto the ground. This facilitates {{a new crop of}} wheat. In the domestic variety, the seed head remains intact. While such a mutation may occasionally occur in the wild, it is not viable there in the long term: the intact seed head will only drop to the ground when the stalk rots, and the kernels will not scatter but form a tight clump which inhibits germination and makes the mutant seedlings susceptible to disease. But harvesting einkorn with intact seed heads was easier for early human harvesters, who could then manually break apart the seed heads and scatter any kernels not eaten. Over time and through selection, conscious or unconscious, the human preference for intact seed heads created the domestic variety, which also has slightly larger kernels than wild einkorn. Domesticated einkorn thus requires human planting and harvesting for its continuing existence. [...] This process of domestication might have taken only 20 to 200 years with the end product a wheat easier for humans to harvest.|$|E
5000|$|Early Neolithic (Linear Pottery): The primary discoveries {{dating back}} to this period include {{the remains of a}} {{settlement}} with its iconic banded ceramics in the northern and eastern areas of the district. Such settlements developed at the southern edge of the Long Field, where good loess was available. Since crop rotation was a yet unknown practice, early settlements and their residents had to practice Shifting cultivation (as evidenced by the aforementioned Linear Pottery culture) as the nutrients in the soil became depleted. Even with the practice of shifting cultivation, archaeological evidence shows that dimensions of the fields and the settlements were too large. After about three years of use, the field would deplete and require decades to regain the lost fertility (longhouses typically would stand for about 30 to 50 years). Due to the existence of such types of soils it is implied that {{there used to be a}} warmer climate and open wooded steppes during the Holocene period that were suitable for clearing and could be found in valleys. A few [...] "Stool tombs" [...] from this period have been discovered in hollow ditches, complete with grave goods. One of these graves contained one of the oldest examples of prepared food (legumes, toasted bread, hazelnuts and flaxseed), which was intended likely for provision in the afterlife journey and allow conclusions regarding their religious ideas which probably included ancestor worship. They <b>cultivated</b> <b>einkorn,</b> emmer and wheat, but only after the cutting down and incineration of nearby mixed oak forests by early settlements in need of new lands for crops.|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} from hunter/gathering to farming in the Near East some 10 000 years ago, was largely {{controlled by the}} biological attributes of the wild plants. Their domestication occurred {{as a result of}} a coevolution with man. Domestication was an unconscious process resulting from cultivation which was invented by man, but entailed almost no material change. Archaeobotanical finds indicate that morphologically wild plants are present at least 2000 years before their domestication. Estimations to determine when cultivation began, or how long the period of pre-domestic agriculture lasted, are based on theoretical models. In order to test these models, which indicate that domestication was extremely rapid, we are <b>cultivating</b> wild <b>einkorn</b> under experimental conditions. The first results appear to indicate that at least one variable has under estimated but it is too early to draw firm conclusions. Willcox George.

50|$|The oldest {{evidence}} of neolithic settlement is dated to 8800-8600 BC. The first settlers were already agriculturalists (PPNB), {{but did not}} yet produce pottery (aceramic Neolithic). They introduced the dog, sheep, goats and maybe cattle and pigs as well as numerous wild animals like foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos, Tenta) and <b>cultivated</b> <b>einkorn</b> and emmer.

The daily life of the people in those Neolithic villages was spent in farming, hunting, animal husbandry and the lithic industry, while homesteaders (likely women) were engaged in spindling and weaving cloths, in addition to their probable participation in other activities. The lithic industry was the most individual feature of this aceramic culture and innumerable stone vessels made of grey andesite have been discovered during excavations. The houses had a foundation of river pebbles, the remainder of the building was constructed in mudbrick. Sometimes several round houses were joined together to form a kind of compound. Some of these houses reach a diameter of up to 10 m. Inhumation burials are located inside the houses.|$|E

Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) confirmed the 1 D/ 1 A chromosome substitution. The presence or absence of einkorn high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits and the wheat Glu-D 1 d locus encoding the 5 + 10 subunits was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), capillary zone electrophoresis, and allele-specific molecular markers. Significant differences were found among physicochemical properties (with the exception of the Hagberg falling number) of all introgressive Triticale/T. monococcum lines and the secondary triticale lines. The wheat 1 D/ 1 A chromosome substitution also affected these properties. The results showed that in all introgressive triticale lines, the protein and gluten content, Zeleny sedimentation value, and water absorption capacity, were increased. The rheological parameters estimated using micro-farinograph, reomixer, and Kieffer dough extensibility systems also showed an appreciable increase in dough-mixing properties, maximum resistance to extension (Rmax), and dough extensibility. Introgressive Triticale/T. monococcum lines with 5 + 10 subunits have particularly favorable rheological parameters. The results obtained in this study suggest that the <b>cultivated</b> <b>einkorn</b> genome Am, in the context of hexaploid secondary triticale lines and with a wheat 1 D/ 1 A substitution, has the potential to improve gluten polymer interactions and be a valuable genetic resource for triticale quality improvement...|$|E

5000|$|Schmidt also {{interpreted}} it {{in connection}} with the initial stages of the Neolithic. It is one of several sites in the vicinity of Karaca Dağ, an area which geneticists suspect may have been the original source of at least some of our <b>cultivated</b> grains (see <b>Einkorn).</b> Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on Karaca Dağ 30 km away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated. Such scholars suggest that the Neolithic revolution, i.e., the beginnings of grain cultivation, took place here. Schmidt believed, as others do, that mobile groups in the area were compelled to cooperate with each other to protect early concentrations of wild cereals from wild animals (herds of gazelles and wild donkeys). Wild cereals may have been used for sustenance more intensively than before and were perhaps deliberately cultivated. This would have led to early social organization of various groups in the area of Göbekli Tepe. Thus, according to Schmidt, the Neolithic did not begin on a small scale in the form of individual instances of garden cultivation, but developed rapidly in the form of [...] "a large-scale social organization".|$|R

The genetic diversity of high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits and the gliadin proteins in 10 landrace populations of <b>cultivated</b> <b>einkorn</b> wheat, originating from Turkey, was investigated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and ammonium lactic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE), respectively. For glutenins, the mean number of alleles, the mean number of effective alleles, the mean value of genetic diversity and the mean value of average genetic diversity were detected as 3. 50, 2. 98, 0. 65 and 0. 28, respectively. The genetic differentiation was 0. 57, while gene flow was 0. 19 between populations. For gliadins, the mean number of alleles, the mean number of effective alleles, the mean value of total genetic diversity and the genetic diversity within population were detected as 2. 00, 1. 21, 0. 17 and 0. 15, respectively. The genetic differentiation was 0. 08, whereas gene flow was 6. 15 between populations. STRUCTURE is a software package program for population genetic analysis, was used to infer population structures of landraces populations. The optimum value for K was obtained as 10.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The Polycomb group (PcG) {{of genes}} of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen are {{involved}} in developmental regulation through chromatin remodeling. Homologs of PcG genes {{have been identified in}} both plant and animal species. In this study, we detail the identification and characterization of Triticum enhancer of zeste 1 (Tez 1), a homolog of the Drosophila PcG gene Enhancer of zeste [E(z) ], from <b>cultivated</b> <b>einkorn</b> wheat (Triticum monococcum L.). Tez 1 encoded a 2, 670 - nucleotide transcript for an 890 -amino acid (99 -kDa) predicted protein. The TEZ 1 predicted protein contained protein-protein, DNA binding, nuclear localization, and histonemethyltransferase domains typically found in E(z) homologs. The transcript of Tez 1 was found in both reproductive and vegetative tissues suggesting that it is involved in global biological processes. Using common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) aneuploid stocks, two Tez 1 homologous loci, Xorw 9 (Tez 1) - 4 A and Xorw 10 (Tez 1) - 4 D, were localized to chromosomes 4 A and 4 D. Linkage mapping showed that Xorw 9 (Tez 1) - 4 A was localized in the terminal end of the short arm of chromosome 4 A. Chromosome deletion bin mapping showed that Xorw 9 (Tezl) - 4 A (on bin 4 AS- 0. 20 - 0. 63) and Xorw 10 (Tez 1) - 4 D (on bin 4 DL- 0. 31 - 0. 56) were located in homoeologous regions on chromosomes 4 A and 4 D, respectively. Furthermore, comparative mapping suggested that the E(z) homologs Tez 1 from wheat (T. aestivum), OsiEZ 1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.), and Mez 2 from maize (Zea mays L.) were orthologous genes. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that TEZ 1 of T. monococcum most closely resembled OsiEZl of rice followed by MEZ 2 and MEZ 3 of maize.
