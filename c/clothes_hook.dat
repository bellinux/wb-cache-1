2500|$|Deer antlers {{are also}} used for {{decorative}} purposes and {{have been used for}} artwork, furniture and other novelty items. Deer antlers were and still are the source material for horn furniture. Already in the 15th century trophies of case were used for <b>clothes</b> <b>hook,</b> storage racks and chandeliers, the so-called [...] "lusterweibchen". In the 19th century the European nobility discovered among others the red deer antlers as perfect object for fashioning their manors and hunting castles. This fashion trend splashes over to upper- and middle-class households in the mid of the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|People under suicide watch are {{put into}} an {{environment}} {{where it would be}} difficult for them to hurt themselves. In many cases, any dangerous items will be removed from the area, such as sharp objects and some furniture, or they may be placed in a special padded cell, which has nothing outcropping from the walls (e.g., a <b>clothes</b> <b>hook</b> or door closing bracket) to provide a place for a ligature to be attached, and with only a drain-grill on the floor. They may be stripped of anything with which they might hurt themselves or use as noose, including shoelaces, belts, neckties, bras, shoes, socks, suspenders and bed sheets. In extreme cases the inmate may be undressed entirely.|$|E

Michael pays Tina (Kobe Tai), a stripper/prostitute, for sex in the bathroom who dies during sex after her head is accidentally impaled by a <b>clothes</b> <b>hook</b> on a door. Soon thereafter, a security guard comes to investigate the ruckus and discovers Tina's corpse. In desperation, Boyd stabs the guard to death. Boyd convinces the group to dismember the bodies, bury them in the desert, and never speak of it again.|$|E
5000|$|Dey Mansion is {{a colonial}} house where General George Washington took {{residence}} during the Revolutionary War. The house gives tours {{of all the}} artifacts and furniture left there and has a genuine blacksmith shop that makes <b>clothes</b> <b>hooks</b> and horseshoes for visitors. It is located on 199 Totowa Road, Wayne. Even though located in Wayne, Totowa residents {{believe that it is}} truly located in Totowa because it is barely past the border of the two towns.|$|R
2500|$|Today {{the home}} is owned by Winchester Investments LLC, a privately held company {{representing}} the descendants of John and Mayme Brown. The home retains unique touches that reflect Mrs. Winchester's beliefs and her reported preoccupation with warding off malevolent spirits. These spirits {{are said to have}} directly inspired her as to the way the house should be built. The number thirteen and spider web motifs, which carried spiritual significance for her, occur throughout the house. For example, an expensive imported chandelier that originally had 12 candle-holders was altered to accommodate 13 candles, wall <b>clothes</b> <b>hooks</b> are in multiples of 13, and a spider web-patterned stained glass window contains 13 colored stones. The drain covers on the sinks also have 13 holes. In tribute, the house's current groundskeepers have created a topiary tree shaped like the numeral 13. Also, every Friday the 13th, the large bell on the property is rung 13 times at [...] "1300 hours" [...] (13:00 PT, 1:00 PM) in tribute to Winchester.|$|R
5000|$|In {{vehicles}} with side airbags, {{it is dangerous}} for occupants to lean against the windows, doors, and pillars, or to place objects between themselves and {{the side of the}} vehicle. Articles hung from a vehicle's <b>clothes</b> hanger <b>hooks</b> can be hazardous if the vehicle's side curtain airbags deploy. [...] A seat-mounted airbag may also cause internal injury if the occupant leans against the door.|$|R
50|$|The Pioneer Helmet (also {{known as}} Wollaston Helmet or Northamptonshire Helmet) is a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon boar-crested helm found by archaeologists from Northamptonshire Archaeology at a quarry site {{operated}} by Pioneer Aggregates. This helmet {{is very similar}} in its basic design to the Coppergate Helmet, although it is much larger, and was likely to have had two cheek plates (of which only one remained) and a nasal (which was bent inwards {{at the time of}} deposition to render the piece unwearable). A simple iron boar crest adorns the top of this helmet associating it with the Benty Grange helmet and the Guilden Morden boar from the same period, and descriptions in the poem Beowulf. The helmet accompanied the burial of a young male, possibly laid on a bed with a pattern welded sword, small knife, hanging bowl, three iron buckles and a copper alloy <b>clothes</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Antlers {{were already}} {{used in the}} late 15th century as a source {{material}} for <b>clothes</b> <b>hooks,</b> storage racks and chandeliers, the so-called [...] "lusterweibchen". Furniture made by antlers have been invented in the 19th century and can therefore be assigned to the Biedermeier period. They were exclusively made for the European nobility to decorate their hunting castles and various manors. Historically mentioned horn furniture {{was developed in the}} year 1825 for a hunting castle of the count William of Nassau near Wiesbaden, Germany, A photograph of 1890 is the single existing evidence as the castles was destroyed in World War II and the interior furniture is regarded as lost. Further known collections of historic horn furniture are credited with the hunting room in the country estate of the Brandhof of the Archduke Johann of Austria or the antler collection of count Arco in Munich, Germany. Many other examples of horn furniture of that time can only be found with drawings and pictures, e.g. Joseph Danhauser (1780-1829) an Austrian furniture manufacturer left hundreds of drawing and another well-known aquarelle is the dressing room of Ferdinand Baron von Hildprandt.|$|R
40|$|Testimony at the Swiss Security Policy hearings, April 17, 2009. In Switzerland, {{terms such}} as 2 ̆ 7 {{integral}} neutrality 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 active neutrality 2 ̆ 7 have been adopted in political discourse. However, I am not sure this is helpful in clarifying the meaning of neutrality and, to an outsider at least, {{this appears to be}} hanging political policies on legal <b>clothes</b> <b>hooks.</b> Everyone in Switzerland seems to agree that neutrality is important and vital, but everyone seems to understand the term differently. Speaking as a lawyer, I would therefore separate the legal concept of neutrality from political policies which we might term, for example, 2 ̆ 7 isolationism 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 engagement 2 ̆ 7. For your security you should have a security policy and not a neutrality policy. I would accept that international armed conflict in Europe is unlikely, but to rule it out completely seems to be a mistake. An important part of conflict resolution and peacebuilding is a military component. Given the extensive involvement of Switzerland in mediation and humanitarian assistance, these efforts would be best supported by robust military support. From an efficiency perspective, it would therefore seem to make sense for Switzerland {{to play a role in}} that, so that its efforts are not wasted...|$|R

50|$|A low-growing stem is {{bent down}} to touch a hole dug in the ground, then pinned in place using {{something}} shaped like a <b>clothes</b> hanger <b>hook</b> and covered over with soil. However, {{a few inches of}} leafy growth must remain above the ground for the bent stem to grow into a new plant. Removing a section of skin from the lower-facing stem part before burying may help the rooting process. If using rooting hormone, the stem should be cut just beneath a node. The resultant notch should be wedged open with a toothpick or similar piece of wood and the hormone applied before burying.|$|R
50|$|They {{found that}} some {{children}} were preyed upon by pimps who may slowly gain their trust, befriend them and provide them with food, accommodation and <b>clothes</b> before <b>hooking</b> them on drugs and alcohol and forcing them into sexual service. However, only a small proportion {{were found to be}} controlled in this manner, and older girls frequently introduced younger ones into the trade. Some pimps were considered as boyfriends, the report found. Pimps may use romantic techniques to seduce young girls. Where pimps appeared to be involved in recruitment, they worked in areas where young people congregate such as food courts in malls, community centres and schools, preferring unsupervised venues including fast food restaurants and bus stops but also supervised locations including drop-inprograms, group homes, juvenile detention centres, youth shelters and treatment centres. Runaway children are easily spotted by pimps at the bus and train stations of major Canadian cities.|$|R

TagTansu consists of hook sensors and capture components attached inside the doors of a tansu (a wardrobe). Using TagTansu, users can easily take pictures of clothes and add annotations (e. g. types and weight of clothes) to the pictures just by hanging the <b>clothes</b> on a <b>hook.</b> In this paper, we describe the concepts {{and implementation of the}} system. 1...|$|R
500|$|Skinner {{tries to}} keep the {{children}} under control, forcing them to stay together in the cafeteria and eat apples, relish and (only if they behave well enough) mayonnaise and will not let them go home until the snow melts. After Nelson tries to escape, Skinner unearths his U.S. Army memorabilia and is reminded of {{the days when he}} commanded respect from his troops. Skinner tries to command respect from the students, and briefly succeeds after threatening to hang them in their <b>clothes</b> on <b>hooks</b> on the wall if they rebel. Bart tries to tunnel his way out, but Skinner stops him, and after Willie refuses to destroy the tunnel, Skinner does so himself, but is stuck in the resulting cave-in. The students rebel and eventually tie Skinner up in a dodge ball bag. They then set about [...] "going nuts" [...] such as racing trolleys in the school hallway, even burning numerous books in the school's library.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Pan in Scarlet is {{centered}} around the idea of [...] "clothes making the man". This theme first appears when the adult Darlings don their children's clothing {{in order to become}} children themselves (this is exaggerated in the case of Tootles, who puts on a dress and becomes a girl). Later, Peter Pan discovers Captain Hook's second-best coat, and decides to wear it; Peter then morphs into a form of Captain Hook, even growing long dark curls and inheriting his temper. Only when Peter removes the coat does he become himself again. Later, it is revealed that Ravello, who is clad in unravelling <b>clothes,</b> is really <b>Hook.</b> When Ravello again wears his second-best coat, he is hardened and returns to the form of Captain Hook.|$|R
5000|$|Captain Hook is also {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} Wii game, [...] "Epic Mickey", wherein he has been converted into an animatronic, cyborg version of himself (referred to in the game as a Beetleworx) and is waging an attack against the non-converted pirates. Smee requests that Mickey Mouse {{find a way to}} save Hook. Players can either fight Hook by themselves and earn a thinner upgrade (and a [...] "bad ending"), or free the Sprite and have Peter Pan defeat him and earn a paint upgrade (and a [...] "good ending" [...] showing Peter Pan and Captain Hook in a duel). In Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, Hook has disappeared entirely, leaving his crew leaderless and having been run out of Tortooga by Blackbeard and Pete Pan having joined up with the Mad Doctor after losing his purpose. Some of <b>Hook's</b> <b>clothes</b> and items have been left behind in Ventureland, which the crew members seek to assert their authority to take over leadership of the other pirates and lead them to take back their home.|$|R

50|$|In 1928, {{with only}} a few minor film roles to his credit, Brophy was working as a junior {{production}} executive for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when he was chosen to appear with Buster Keaton in one sequence of Keaton's film The Cameraman. As two clients in a bath-house, Brophy and Keaton attempt to undress and put on bathing suits while sharing a single tiny changing room. Each time Keaton attempts to hang his <b>clothes</b> on one <b>hook,</b> Brophy removes the clothes and hands them back to Keaton and gestures to the other hook. He manhandles the smaller, more slender Keaton, at one point picking him up by the feet and dumping him out of his trousers. Appearing only in this one brief scene, Brophy attracted enough attention to receive more and better roles. Though he did appear in a few theatre roles, most of his long and prolific career was in film and was spent at the studio's of MGM.He played the main character's loyal manager in The Champ (1931), a Rollo Brother circus proprietor, with Matt McHugh in the movie Freaks (1932), Joe Morelli from The Thin Man (1934) and Nick Charles' friend Brogan from The Thin Man Goes Home (1944). Brophy made a lasting impression on Disney fans as the voice of Timothy the mouse in Dumbo, even though he was uncredited for this role. He also made several appearances in the films of director John Ford.|$|R
