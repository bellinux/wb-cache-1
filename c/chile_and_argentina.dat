5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can {{be traced}} to the {{numerous}} naval arms races between <b>Chile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina,</b> which in turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for <b>Chile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina</b> sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E

5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} <b>Chile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina.</b> Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine in moderation, and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, {{an increasing number of}} wines are imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, <b>Chile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central <b>Chile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina.</b> It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in <b>Chile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina,</b> the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured {{and held in}} a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in <b>Chile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina.</b> He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, {{a group of women}} whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.|$|E
5|$|The Beagle {{conflict}} {{was still an}} unresolved problem with Chile, despite the 1978 Papal mediation. The military, troubled by {{the trial of the}} juntas, called for rejection of the proposed agreement and a continuation of the country's claim over the islands. Alfonsín called for a referendum to settle the dispute. Despite opposition from the military and the Justicialist party, who called for abstention, support for the resolution referendum reached 82%. The bill passed in the Senate by a single vote majority, as the PJ maintained its resistance. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between <b>Chile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Argentina</b> was signed the following year, ending the conflict. The human rights violations committed by the Chilean president Augusto Pinochet remained a contentious issue, as well as the revelation of Chilean help to British forces during the Falklands War. The Argentine church invited Pope John Paul II for a second visit to Argentina in 1987, to celebrate his successful mediation. He celebrated World Youth Day next to the Obelisk of Buenos Aires, and gave a mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Luján.|$|E
