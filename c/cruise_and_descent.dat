In order to store a profile, for a reciprocating engine aircraft, a user must enter airspeeds for climb, <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent,</b> rates of climb and descent, and fuel consumption for all three stages of flight.

30|$|The VarMission {{software}} considers taxiing on the ground, take-off, climb, <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> flight phases. The {{fuel consumption}} of a flight is calculated iteratively, reducing the aircraft mass (due to fuel burn) in each calculation step. Since the take-off mass of a flight is initially unknown, the program performs the calculation process “backwards”, i.e. {{starting with the}} aircraft’s empty weight plus payload, considering reserve fuel quantities and analysing all flight phases in reverse order. The flight distance of each flight was estimated by applying an empirical “inefficiency” factor to the great-circle distance between origin and destination airports. The factor ranges from 1.06 on short-range flights (up to 500  km) to around 1.03 on long-range missions.|$|E

The method has been applied to conflicts occurring 6 to 25 minutes in the future in climb, <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> phases of flight. The conflict resolution approach separates the detection, trajectory generation and flight rules function from the resolution algorithm.

40|$|The {{complete}} flightpath {{optimization problem}} for minimum fuel consumption from takeoff to landing including the initial and final turns from {{and to the}} runway heading is solved. However, only the initial and final segments which contain the turns are treated, since the straight-line climbout, <b>cruise,</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> problems have already been solved. The paths are derived by generating fields of extremals, using the necessary conditions of optimal control together with singular arcs and state constraints. Results show that the speed profiles for straight flight and turning flight are essentially identical except for the final horizontal accelerating or decelerating turns. The optimal turns require no abrupt maneuvers, and an approximation of the optimal turns could be easily integrated with present straight-line climb-cruise-descent fuel-optimization algorithms. Climbout at the optimal IAS rather than the 250 -knot terminal-area speed limit would save 36 lb of fuel for the 727 - 100 aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Necessary {{conditions}} of optimality are derived for trajectories whose structure {{is limited to}} climb, steady <b>cruise,</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> segments. The performance function consists of the sum of fuel and time costs, referred to as direct operating cost (DOC). The state variable is range to go and the independent variable is energy. In this formulation a cruise segment always occurs at the optimum cruise energy for sufficiently large range. At short ranges (500 n. mi. and less) a cruise segment may also occur below the optimum cruise energy. The existence of such a cruise segment depends primarily on the fuel flow vs thrust characteristics and on thrust constraints. If thrust is a free control variable along with airspeed, it is shown that such cruise segments will not generally occur.

The vehicle is also consistent with a point-to-point medium range hypersonic trip, within the "urgent business travel" market segment. The design of such a hypersonic airplane is based on the concept of integrating available technologies developed for aeronautical and space atmospheric re-entry systems. The vehicle, characterized by high aerodynamic efficiency and low wing loading, is able to provide aerodynamic stability and manoeuvrability along the flight path and to produce a reduced sonic boom during <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> supersonic <b>descent</b> approach, ensuring a very limited environmental impact. HyPlane, powered by Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) engines plus a throtteable Rocket, is able to perform Horizontal Takeoff and Horizontal Landing (HTHL) on runways.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} cost-optimized flight procedures for a commuter jet, ERJ 145 LU. The aim was to provide the operator, Finnish Commuter Airlines Oy, for whom this investigation was done, with documentation to improve cost efficiency in their ERJ 145 LU flight operations. Knowledge of company cost structure and cost drivers is of significant value in determining the airline strategy in cost optimization. For this purpose, this thesis reviews operating costs, cost drivers and cost reduction potential. In the performance calculations, Embraer performance programs were used. Validation of the programs was done as comparison between program performance data and actual aircraft performance. Actual aircraft performance data was obtained through performance monitoring on flights. The cost optimization of flight procedures was divided into vertical and lateral flight path optimization.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} coupled aerostructural {{optimization}} procedure {{for the design of}} a fuel-efficient regional aircraft configuration. A detailed mission analysis is performed on an optimized flight mission profile to accurately compute the mission range, fuel burn, and flight time. The mis-sion analysis procedure is designed to allow flexible mission profiles including those with a variety of <b>cruise,</b> climb <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> segments in the profile. The direct operating cost (DOC) is computed based on the mission characteristics (fuel weight, range, and time), and is then used as the objective func-tion in the optimization problem. We use a coupled aerostructural solver comprised of a high-fidelity structural solver and medium-fidelity aerodynamic solver to solve for the static aeroelastic shape of the lifting surfaces. Due to the large computational cost associated with these solvers, “kriging with a trend ” surrogate models are employed to approximate the aerodynamic force and moment coef-ficients required in the mission analysis. This approach is demonstrated in two DOC minimization cases: a mission profile optimization with a fixed geometry, and an aerostructural optimization with fixed, previously optimized mission profiles for a 100 -passenger regional jet aircraft.

40|$|Two flight {{experiments}} (Phase 1 in October 1992 and Phase 2 in September 1994) {{were conducted}} to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) trajectory prediction process. The Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV) Boeing 737 based at Langley Research Center flew 57 arrival trajectories that included <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> segments; at the same time, descent clearance advisories from CTAS were followed. Actual trajectories of the airplane were compared with the trajectories predicted by the CTAS trajectory synthesis algorithms and airplane Flight Management System (FMS). Trajectory prediction accuracy was evaluated over several levels of cockpit automation that ranged from a conventional cockpit to performance-based FMS vertical navigation (VNAV). Error sources and their magnitudes were identified and measured from the flight data. The major source of error during these tests was found to be the predicted winds aloft used by CTAS. The most significant effect related to flight guidance was the cross-track and turn-overshoot errors associated with conventional VOR guidance. FMS lateral navigation (LNAV) guidance significantly reduced both the cross-track and turn-overshoot error. Pilot procedures and VNAV guidance were found to significantly reduce the vertical profile errors associated with atmospheric and airplane performance model errors...|$|E
40|$|With the {{objective}} of reducing the flight cost {{and the amount of}} polluting emissions released in the atmosphere, a new optimization algorithm considering the climb, <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> phases is presented for the reference vertical flight trajectory. The selection of the reference vertical navigation speeds and altitudes was solved as a discrete combinatory problem by means of a graph-tree passing through nodes using the beam search optimization technique. To achieve a compromise between the execution time and the algorithm’s ability to find the global optimal solution, a heuristic methodology introducing a parameter called “optimism coefficient was used in order to estimate the trajectory’s flight cost at every node. The optimal trajectory cost obtained with the developed algorithm was compared with the cost of the optimal trajectory provided by a commercial flight management system(FMS). The global optimal solution was validated against an exhaustive search algorithm(ESA), other than the proposed algorithm. The developed algorithm takes into account weather effects, step climbs during cruise and air traffic management constraints such as constant altitude segments, constant cruise Mach, and a pre-defined reference lateral navigation route. The aircraft fuel burn was computed using a numerical performance model which was created and validated using flight test experimental data...|$|E

That is, for the same engine type and known fuel flow rates, emission quantities can be calculated using the developed models. A breakdown of emissions by flight phase is obtained, and the findings agree well for flights on both routes. Accordingly, the highest CO and HC emissions are found in the descent phase followed by the taxi phases (in and out). The highest NO x [...] emissions are found in the climb phase followed by the <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> phases. There are less but not negligible NO x [...] emissions in the taxi phase due to the high taxi duration. The mean total flight emissions are calculated as 8 kg of HC, 75 kg of HC, and 31 kg of NO x [...] for the AYT route and 6 kg of CO, 60 kg of HC, and 28 kg of NO x [...] for the ADB route. Lastly, the average ground time of the flights are calculated as 22 % to 25 % of the total flight time for both routes. Since the HC and CO emissions are mostly produced at the lower power settings of the engine, decreasing the taxiing time provides significant abatement of those two emissions.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares fuel {{consumption}} of alternative descent trajectories from cruise altitude to meter fix when the required {{time of arrival}} is later than the nominal time of arrival at the meter fix. The required delay, which {{is the difference between}} the nominal and the required times of arrival, is achieved by either slowing down the aircraft in the <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> phases or flying a longer route at a constant altitude. Performance models for ten different Boeing and Airbus aircraft, obtained from Base of Aircraft Data, are employed for generating the results. It is demonstrated that the most fuel-efficient speed control procedure for absorbing delay is reducing descent speed as much as possible and then reducing cruise speed. This is a common finding for all ten aircraft considered. It is also shown that when delay is entirely absorbable by speed control, {{fuel consumption}} of the resulting trajectory is less than that of the nominal trajectory. For some aircraft, flying at a fixed flight path angle and constant Mach/calibrated-airspeed results in lower fuel consumption compared to standard descents at idle-thrust and constant Mach/calibrated-airspeed.

40|$|NASA is {{studying}} far-term {{air traffic management}} concepts that may increase operational efficiency through a redistribution of decisionmaking authority among airborne and ground-based elements of the air transportation system. One component of this research, En Route Free Maneuvering, allows trained pilots of equipped autonomous aircraft to assume responsibility for traffic separation. Ground-based air traffic controllers would continue to separate traffic unequipped for autonomous operations and would issue flow management constraints to all aircraft. To evaluate En Route Free Maneuvering operations, a human-in-the-loop experiment was jointly conducted by the NASA Ames and Langley Research Centers.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on {{utilizing}} a mean line compressor flow analysis code coupled to an engine system thermodynamic code, to estimate the effects of ice accretion on the low pressure compressor, and quantifying its effects on the engine system throughout a notional flight trajectory. In this paper a temperature range in which engine icing would occur was assumed. This provided a mechanism to locate potential component icing sites and allow the computational tools to add blockages due to ice accretion in a parametric fashion. Ultimately the location and level of blockage due to icing would be provided by an ice accretion code. To proceed, an engine system modeling code and a mean line compressor flow analysis code were utilized to calculate the flow conditions in the fan-core and low pressure compressor and to identify potential locations within the compressor where ice may accrete. In this study, an "additional blockage" due to the accretion of ice on the metal surfaces, has been added to the baseline aerodynamic blockage due to boundary layer, as well as the blade metal blockage. Once the potential locations of ice accretion are identified, the levels of additional blockage due to accretion were parametrically varied to estimate the effects on the low pressure compressor blade row performance operating within the engine system environment. This study includes detailed analysis of compressor and engine performance during <b>cruise</b> <b>and</b> <b>descent</b> operating conditions at several altitudes within the notional flight trajectory.
