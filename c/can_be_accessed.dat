40|$|ABSTRACT: Block {{argues that}} {{relevant}} data in psychology and neuroscience shows that <b>access</b> consciousness <b>is</b> not constitutively necessary for phenomenality. However, a phenomenal state <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>access</b> conscious in two radically different ways. Its content <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>access</b> conscious, or its phenomenality <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>access</b> conscious. I’ll argue that while Block’s thesis is right {{when it is}} formulated {{in terms of the}} first notion of <b>access</b> consciousness, there <b>is</b> an alternative hypothesis about the relationship between phenomenality and access in term of the second notion that is not touched by Block’s argument. Ned Block in a series of papers (Block, 1990, 1995, 2002) has made a conceptual distinction between the phenomenality of a mental state (aka its phenomenal character or the quale it instantiates) and access consciousness of the same state. There is a view – Block calls it “epistemic correlationism ” – according to which the metaphysical relationship between these two is not scientifically tractable. While cognitive accessibility is intrinsic to our knowledge of phenomenology, it might or might not be constitutive of the phenomenal facts themselves. According to the epistemi...|$|R
