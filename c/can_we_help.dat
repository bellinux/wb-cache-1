Inspired by {{what is called a}} noble emulation, some people grasp at honours and win them; others, too weak or mean, blindly admire and grovel before those who have gained them; others, not being able to acquire them, furiously hate, abuse, and envy. There are only a few bland and not-in-the-least-conceited philosophers, who can behold the state of society, viz., Toadyism, organised:--base Man-and-Mammon worship, instituted by command of law:--Snobbishness, in a word, perpetuated,--and mark the phenomenon calmly. And of these calm moralists, is there one, I wonder, whose heart would not throb with pleasure if he could be seen walking arm-in-arm with a couple of dukes down Pall Mall? No it is impossible in our condition of society, not to be sometimes a Snob.|$|E

This love of the common people may please an earl's granddaughter and a {{university}} professor; but I have been a common man and a poor man; and it has no romance for me.

60|$|And now--can we {{pass over}} this new metaphysical school of Alexandria? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>help</b> inquiring {{in what the}} {{strength}} of Islamism lay? I, at least, cannot. I cannot help feeling that I am bound to examine in what relation the creed of Omar and Amrou stands to the Alexandrian speculations of five hundred years, and how it had power to sweep those speculations utterly from the Eastern mind. It is a difficult problem; to me, as a Christian priest, a very awful problem. What more awful historic problem, than to see the lower creed destroying the higher? to see God, as it were, undoing his own work, and repenting Him that He had made man? Awful indeed: but I can honestly say, that it is one from the investigation of which I have learnt--I cannot yet tell how much: and of this I am sure, that without that old Alexandrian philosophy, I {{should not have been}} able to do justice to Islam; without Islam I should {{not have been able to}} find in that Alexandrian philosophy, an ever- living and practical element.|$|E

Sensibly, or insensibly, we tune our songs to earn the nuts of our twilight forest. We tune them, not to the key of: [...] "Is it good?" [...] but to the key of: [...] "Will it pay?"

6000|$|I {{say that}} there is in them the very deepest and surest ground for hope. [...] "Yes," [...] some of you may say, [...] "to be sure when we see the {{innocent}} suffering for the guilty, it is a plain proof that another world must come some day, in which all that unfairness shall be set right." [...] Well, my friends, it does prove that, but I should be very sorry if it did not prove a great deal more than that--this suffering of the innocent for the guilty. I have no heart {{to talk to you about}} the next life, unless I can give you some comfort, some reason for trusting in God in this life. I never saw much good come of it. I never found it do my own soul any good, to be told: [...] "THIS life and THIS world in which you now live are given up irremediably to misrule and deceit, poverty and pestilence, death and the devil. You cannot expect to set this world right--you must look to the next world. Everything will be set right there." [...] That sounds fine and resigned; and there seems to be a great deal of trust in God in it; but, as I think, there is little or none; and I say so from the fruits I see it bear. If people believe that this world is the devil's world, and only the next world God's, they are easily tempted to say: [...] "Very well, then, we must serve the devil in this world, and God in the next. We must, of course, take great care to get our souls saved when we die, that we may go to heaven and live for ever and ever; but as to this world and this life, why, we must follow the ways of the world. It is not our fault that they have nothing to do with God. It is not our fault that society and the world are all rotten and accursed; we found them so when we were born, and we must make the best of a bad matter and sail as the world does, and be covetous and mean and anxious--how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>help</b> it?--and stand on our own rights, and take care of number one; and even do what is not quite right now and then--for how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>help</b> it?--or how else shall we get on in this poor lost, fallen, sinful world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>help</b> it, if {{during the}} course of the performance, Mr. Lambert would make his jokes and mar the solemnity of the scene? At first, as the reader of the tragedy well knows, the {{characters}} are occupied in making a number of explanations. Lady Randolph explains how it is that she is so melancholy. Married to Lord Randolph somewhat late in life, she owns, and his lordship perceives, that a dead lover yet occupies all her heart; and her husband is fain to put up with this dismal, second-hand regard, which is all that my lady can bestow. Hence, an invasion of Scotland by the Danes is rather a cause of excitement than disgust to my lord, who rushes to meet the foe, and forgets the dreariness of his domestic circumstances. Welcome, Vikings and Norsemen! Blow, northern blasts, the invaders' keels to Scotland's shore! Randolph and other heroes will be on the beach to give the foemen a welcome! His lordship has no sooner disappeared behind the trees of the forest, but Lady Randolph begins to explain to her confidante the circumstances of her early life. The fact was, she had made a private marriage, and what would the confidante say, if, in early youth, she, Lady Randolph, had lost a husband? In the cold bosom of the earth was lodged the husband of her youth, and in some cavern of the ocean lies her child and his! ...|$|E
