The issue has been answered based on a comparative study of English law and Chinese law. The paper scrutinises the current law regarding the civil liabilities that may be imposed on the crew and the ship, and any defences or limitation of liability that avails to the crew under both jurisdictions at issue. It is also to analyse the impact of crew negligence on the allocation of risks of losses between the carrier and the cargo owner and the trends in law on this matter...|$|E

40|$|At the {{international}} level, conventions on the contracts for the {{carriage of goods}} by sea were gradually developed and four major legal regimes have been emerged, namely, the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading 1924 (the Hague Rules); the Hague Rules as Amended by the Brussels Protocol 1968 (the Hague-Visby Rules); the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea 1978 (the Hamburg Rules); and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea 2008 (the Rotterdam Rules). There were concerns over lack of uniformity among the previous legal regimes governing {{the international}} carriage of goods by sea, i. e., the Hague Rules, the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules. There was also no universal regime to govern contracts of carriage involving various modes of transport in connection with contracts of <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea.</b> In addition, they do not provide any legal basis for modern transport practices such as containerisation, the use of electronic transport documents and door-to-door transport contracts (see the Preamble of the Rotterdam Rules) ...|$|E

After an analysis of the travaux prepraratoires of the Hague and Hague/Visby Rules, and a comparison with the Hamburg Rules, the thesis focuses on the English common law and the relevant statutory provisions. The thesis advocates a new, alternative approach in order to overcome the current interpretive problems with the application of the common law doctrine of estoppel. The analysed provisions are those of the <b>Carriage</b> of Goods <b>by</b> <b>Sea</b> Act, 1971 (U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to offer an {{overview}} of current legislative situation in international carriage of goods. Special attention is dedicated to carrier's liability in international transport of goods. In a global world, {{it is vital to}} keep balance between the rights and duties of both the carrier and the shipper. Otherwise, international trade would become next to impossible to perform. Therefore, dealing with the topic of carrier's liability might clarify certain aspects and possibly bring benefits to both contracting parties. This thesis consists of nine chapters. The three initial chapters present private international law and its methods. Next, the question of liability is briefly introduced. Finally, basic terms such as the carrier and the shipper are defined. In one of its subdivisions, the third chapter also mentions national regulations relevant to the topic discussed. On the contrary, the thesis as a whole addresses rules contained in international treaties. The following chapters are targeted on individual modes of transport, in order of appearance: carriage by rail, carriage by road, carriage by air, <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> carriage by inland waterways. However, not all of them are granted equal attention. The chapters covering carriage by road and by sea are essential. The reason for [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{transportation}} {{from the}} Arctic will pose new {{challenges to the}} design and operation of vessels. Many technology innovations are being studied and implemented to respond to these challenges, and extensive research and development is needed for managing risk associated with operating oil and gas carriers in the Arctic. Year-round <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> will place extreme challenges on the ships and their crews. This paper discusses those ship design and operation challenges for this trade. There are two related perspectives of this paper: • Winterization of vessels operating in the arctic environment • Implications for design, winterization, and operations due {{to the needs of}} humans operating under arctic conditions. From the first perspective, traditional consideration is given to winterization issues such as: de-icing, ice effects mitigation (such as sea chest designs), interaction between ice breakers and their escorted ships, piping arrangements, fire fighting arrangements and main/auxiliary machinery. The second considers the implications on ship design, winterization, and operation to meet the requirements and needs of the crew. These include concerns related to: environmental controls, cold weather clothing, crew support and habitability, human performance in cold weather, safety and medical issues, personnel characteristics, and machinery operation and maintenance. The paper presents and summarizes the ABS Guide for Vessels Operating in Low Temperature Environments providing standards for the winterization and human support and operation of vessels operating in arctic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Documentary {{sanctity}} is the norm; {{the backbone}} of the international sale transactions particularly when it involves contract of <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea.</b> Under this norm, the trader is able to rely on the statements in the bill of lading as conclusive since the bill of lading is regarded as an essential part of shipping documents where sea carriage is envisaged. Hence, the bill of lading {{in the hands of the}} consignee or endorsee representing goods to have been shipped on board a vessel shall be conclusive evidence of such shipment as against the master or other person signing it, regardless of the fact that the goods may not have been shipped on board. However, the decision in the common law rule in Grant v Norway seems to defeat the object of a bill of lading and effectively derogates the sanctity of the bill of lading. Since Malaysia inherited the common law principle from the colonial, this paper seeks to examine to what extent the courts in Malaysia would be willing to uphold the sanctity of documents in cases of fraudulent misstatements as to quantity of goods in the bills of lading? Whether the diverse methods by which the English and other commonwealth judges have conferred protection on the holder of the bills of lading be seen as strands that may influence the local court...|$|E

40|$|The back bone of {{international}} trade has always been international transport. Without good transport networks, the movement {{of goods and services}} from one frontier to another would be an uphill task, and would greatly hinder development in international trade. The impact of such poor transport networks would reflect negatively on economies that rely on international trade for the growth of their nations. Nevertheless, perfect transport networks would be useless if the performance of the business of carriage was not regulated by a law developed to meet the standards established by time, and that would regulate the relationship of the parties under contracts of carriage, mainly the carrier, consignor and consignee, so as to ensure certainty and equality in the allocation of risks between the parties thereunder. This research focuses on the carriage of goods by sea. Like most other modes of transport, one of the major issues that arises in the business of carriage of goods by sea is the conflict between the carrier, consignor and consignee, with regards to the allocation of risk in the carriage. Over the years, early rules that were developed to regulate the relationship of the parties under contracts of carriage of goods by sea placed the carrier in a dominant position over the consignor. The carrier issued a standard bill of lading which exempted him from almost all liability for damage or loss of the goods in his care. The consignors and bona fide third parties, not satisfied with the terms of carriage contracts brought {{a lot of pressure to}} bear on their governments to enact legislation protecting their interests in the transaction. The United States of America were the first to pass such national law revising the position of the parties under contracts of carriage. In 1893 the United States of America passed the Harter Act. This Act aimed at imposing limits of liability on the carrier to which no derogation could be brought. However, this was a dangerous precedence which was going to hinder international trade rather than improve on it, as different nations developing local legislation on carriage meant conflict of laws. In order to avoid the extensive nationalisation of carriage laws, the international maritime community set to develop rules that would regulate <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea.</b> Over the years convention has succeeded convention such that today four international regimes (The Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules, Hamburg Rules and Rotterdam Rules), exist regulating carriage of goods by sea. This research takes an in-depth look at these regimes that were developed to regulate <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> and the author aims to identify a particular regime that meets the standards of modern day practice of carriage of goods, and advocate for the ratification of this regime, to the exclusion of all others so as to foster uniformity, certainty and equality in the business of carriage of goods by sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{dangerous}} goods {{as it pertains}} to <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> is of growing importance and concern because it impacts on safety as well as environmental issues. Both involve liability associated with maritime transportation and liability in respect of dangerous goods is a complex area of law both from an international as well as a domestic perspective. China is a rapidly emerging economic power and a major world player in shipping and seaborne trade including import and export of hazardous substances. Furthermore, China is undergoing remarkable reform and transformation in all respects, and legal regimes, especially in the maritime field, {{are in a state of}} evolution. This thesis presents a two-fold area of concentration, that is, the international regime and the domestic Chinese law, looking at the safety as well as the environmental dimensions of international carriage of dangerous goods by sea. In order to carry out a comparative analysis of the international and Chinese legal regimes pertaining to the issues of contractual and tortious liability, a relatively detailed analytical examination of the international regime has been completed. Following this, the legal regime under Chinese law concerning the sea carriage of dangerous goods is critically evaluated in terms of the evolution of the domestic maritime law and the issues of application of international law and domestic law from the perspectives of regulatory law and civil liability. The discussion on the existing issues liability is centered on the principles of liability in tort and contract borne by private parties and state responsibility in respect of damage arising from the maritime transportation of dangerous goods. Conclusions are drawn from the summaries of chapters highlighting the critical issues in light of the findings of the research; the appropriate recommendations and suggestions for improvements to the international regimes; and proposals for law reform in the form of new legislation or amendments to existing legislation with the aim of improving the domestic regime to bring it into closer alignment with international law on the carriage of dangerous goods by sea...|$|E
40|$|The Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (the “Rotterdam Rules”) is {{the latest}} convention, even though not yet in force, {{governing}} <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea.</b> ”The project is ambitious {{in that it is}} not confined to the familiar territory of the sea carrier’s liability for cargo. ” ”It also covers multimodal carriage involving sea carriage, which raises difficult issues of how the new Convention will interact with existing carriage conventions such as United Nations Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (“CMR”). The convention will come into force one year after the twentieth ratification by a UN member state. Currently only two UN member states have ratified the Rotterdam Rules even though 24 states has signed the convention. However, it is not a far-fetched thought that the Convention would come into force in the coming years thus possibly considerably extending the period of responsibility for the sea carrier from today’s port-to-port approach to the Rotterdam Rules’ door-to-door approach. Despite the Rotterdam Rules’ much broader approach than its predecessors’ the main focus of the Rotterdam Rules is to regulate the carrier’s liability for lost or damaged cargo or goods as it may be named. Even though with a broader approach the new convention builds directly on the previous conventions for carriage of goods by sea: the Hague Rules, the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules. This thesis will focus on examining some of the implications of this possibly extended period of responsibility and potential conflicts with other conventions governing, or aiming to govern, other legs of the carriage. More precisely the thesis will examine the possible liability of the sea carrier in relation to secondary failure and evolving, un-localised damage occurring during one or more legs of carriage during a multimodal transport for which the sea carrier might become responsible even though the goods is not in the sea carrier’s custody under the Rotterdam Rules. The main goal of the thesis is to present and high light possible conflicts along the way in the text...|$|E
