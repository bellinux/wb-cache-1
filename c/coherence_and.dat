At the 83rd Academy Awards, Alice in Wonderland won Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and was also nominated for Best Visual Effects.

Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E
5|$|Early in March 1676, a Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but {{experienced}} adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm {{to join with}} a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another {{in the battle of}} Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of <b>coherence</b> <b>and</b> organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.|$|E

The methods described are frequency-domain extensions of current techniques from the statistical iterature and are applicable in cases where section-averaging methods would be used with data that are contaminated by local nonstationarity or isolated outliers. The paper begins with a review of robust estimation theory, emphasizing statistical principles and the maximum likelihood or M-estimators. These are combined with section-averaging spectral techniques to obtain robust estimates of power spectra, <b>coherences,</b> <b>and</b> transfer functions in an automatic, data-adaptive fashion. Because robust methods implicitly identify abnormal data, methods for monitoring the statistical behavior of the estimation process using quantile-quantile plots are also discussed.

The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise.

5|$|Hoag's Object, located 600 {{million light-years}} from Earth, {{is a member}} of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. The outer ring is largely {{composed}} of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's <b>coherence</b> <b>and</b> therefore detached. Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies NGC 5953 and NGC 5954. In this case, both are active galaxies, with the former a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, <b>coherence,</b> <b>and</b> status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{transfer}} between chromophores in photosynthesis proceeds with near unity quantum efficiency. Understanding {{the precise}} mechanisms {{of these processes}} is made difficult by {{the complexity of the}} electronic structure and interactions with different vibrational modes. Two-dimensional spectroscopy has helped resolve some of the ambiguities and identified quantum effects that may be important for highly efficient energy transfer. Many questions remain, however, including whether the coherences observed are electronic and/or vibrational in nature and what role they play. We utilise a two-colour four-wave mixing experiment with control of the wavelength and polarization to selectively excite specific coherence pathways. For the light-harvesting complex PC 645, from cryptophyte algae, we reveal and identify specific contributions from both electronic <b>and</b> vibrational <b>coherences</b> <b>and</b> determine an excited state structure based on two strongly-coupled electronic states and two vibrational modes. Separation of the coherence pathways also uncovers the complex evolution of these <b>coherences</b> <b>and</b> the states involved...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of quantum}} {{coherence}} in photochemical functions of molecular {{systems such as}} photosynthetic complexes is a broadly debated topic. Coexistence and intermixing of electronic <b>and</b> vibrational <b>coherences</b> has been proposed {{to be responsible for}} the observed long-lived <b>coherences</b> <b>and</b> high energy transfer efficiency. However, clear experimental evidence of coherences with different origins operating at the same time has been elusive. In this work, multidimensional spectra obtained from a six-porphyrin nanoring system are analyzed in detail with support from theoretical modeling. We uncover a great diversity of separable electronic, vibrational, <b>and</b> mixed <b>coherences</b> <b>and</b> show their cooperation in shaping the spectroscopic response. The results permit direct assignment of electronic and vibronic states and characterization of the excitation dynamics. The clear disentanglement of coherences in molecules with extended π-conjugation opens up new avenues for exploring coherent phenomena and understanding their importance for the function of complex systems...|$|R
