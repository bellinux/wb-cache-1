5000|$|Maturity {{is after}} {{the time of}} {{occlusion}} when the storm has completed strengthening and the cyclonic flow is at its most intense. [...] Thereafter, {{the strength of the}} storm diminishes as the cyclone couples with the upper level trough or upper level low, becoming increasingly cold core. The spin-down of cyclones, also known as <b>cyclolysis,</b> can be understood from an energetics perspective. As occlusion occurs and the warm air mass is pushed upwards over a cold air airmass, the atmosphere becomes increasingly stable and the centre of gravity of the system lowers. [...] As the occlusion process extends further down the warm front and away from the central low, {{more and more of the}} available potential energy of the system is exhausted. This potential energy sink creates a kinetic energy source which injects a final burst of energy into the storm's motions. After this process occurs, the growth period of the cyclone, or cyclogenesis, ends, and the low begins to spin down (fill) as more air is converging into the bottom of the cyclone than is being removed out the top since upper-level divergence has decreased.|$|E
5000|$|The Eady Model yields {{stable and}} {{unstable}} modes. Unstable modes have height, vorticity, vertical velocity, {{and several other}} atmospheric parameters with contours that tilt westward with height, though temperature contours tilt eastward with height for unstable modes. A poleward heat flux is observed in unstable modes, yielding the positive feedback necessary for cyclogenesis. Low pressure, high vorticity regions are then “stretched”, and high pressure and low vorticity regions are “squashed”, yielding higher and lower vorticity, respectively. In contrast, the opposite is observed in decaying modes: height, vorticity, etc. contours tilt eastward with height, except temperature which tilts westward with height. An equatorward heat flux is induced, decreasing potential vorticity and pressure anomalies and yielding <b>cyclolysis.</b> Making Fourier decompositions on the linearized Eady model equations and solving for the dispersion relation for the Eady Model system allows one to solve for {{the growth rate of}} the modes (the imaginary component of the frequency). This yields a growth rate that increases with increasing wavenumber for small wavenumbers, reaches a maximum growth rate at roughly , where κ is the wavenumber and [...] is the Rossby radius of deformation. As wavenumber increases from here, growth rate decreases, reaching zero growth rate around [...] Beyond here, modes will not grow under the Eady Model, so too large of wavenumbers (too small of scales) do not yield unstable modes in the Eady Model.|$|E

Simulations with high resolution air/sea coupled models and several case studies have {{lead to the}} hypothesis that friction parameterizations could have a profound affect on the accuracy of numerical analysis and prediction of decaying cyclones. In this study, analyzed and forecast characteristics of decaying cyclones over the North Pacific Ocean {{are related to the}} hypothesized importance of friction induced cyclone spin down. Many characteristics of <b>cyclolysis,</b> which include gale area size and decay rate, were found to vary according to the synoptic-scale conditions in which the cyclone exists. Furthermore, the hypothesized relationship between <b>cyclolysis</b> and frictionally forced spin down was not found to exist in the analyzed and forecast model data. This result might be expected since friction spin down is parameterized based on analyzed and forecast winds over synoptic space and time scales. Therefore, it is concluded that over these scales other factors, which may include energy transfers due to barotropic processes, contribute in a major way to cyclone decay as portrayed in a global-scale numerical model[URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|E
40|$|Two {{regional}} local energetics composites of tropospheric-deep cyclone decay {{were constructed}} based upon 49 cyclones in the Gulf of Alaska region and 18 cyclones in the Bering Sea region whose decay {{was marked by}} rapid surface <b>cyclolysis.</b> Both composites indicate that surface drag is only a secondary sink of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) during the decay. This result holds even when a generous accounting is made for uncertainty in the surface drag calculation. The subordinate role of surface drag in the Gulf of Alaska region composite is particularly interesting, given that the cyclones in this composite decay {{in close proximity to}} rugged and extensive high-elevation terrain. Both composites also display two of the fundamental characteristics of the downstream development model of cyclone decay: the role of radiative dispersion as the chief sink of EKE during decay, and the occurrence of prominent downstream EKE dispersion. Furthermore, the two composites illustrate that an unusually pronounced decline in baroclinic conversion occurs simultaneously with the intense radiative dispersion. Taken together, these results suggest that the energetic decay of cyclones marked by rapid surface <b>cyclolysis</b> is driven from the upper troposphere, not from the surface. Some notable differences also emerge from the two composites. Considerable downstream development occurs in the immediate vicinity of the decaying cyclone in the Bering Sea region composite, but not in th...|$|E
40|$|Employing {{output from}} a {{successful}} numerical simulation, piecewise potential vorticity inversion {{is used to}} diagnose a rapid surface <b>cyclolysis</b> event that occurred south of the Aleutian Islands in late October 1996. The sea level pressure minimum of the decaying cyclone rose 35 hPa in 36 h as its associated upper-tropospheric wave quickly acquired a positive tilt while undergoing a rapid transformation from a nearly circular to a linear morphology. The inversion results demonstrate that the upper-tropospheric potential vorticity (PV) anomaly exerted the greatest control over {{the evolution of the}} lower-tropospheric height field associated with the cyclone. A portion of the significant height rises that characterized this event was directly associated with a diminution of the upper-tropospheric PV anomaly that resulted from negative PV advection by the full wind. This forcing has a clear parallel in more traditional synoptic/dynamic perspectives on lower-tropospheric development, which emphasize differential vorticity advection. Additional height rises resulted from promotion of increased anisotropy in the upper-tropospheric PV anomaly by upper-tropospheric deformation in the vicinity of a southwesterly jet streak. As the PV anomaly was thinned and elongated by the deformation, its associated geopotential height perturbation decreased throughout the troposphere in what is termed here PV attenuation. The analysis reveals that neither surface friction nor latent heat release played a primary role in this case of rapid surface decay. It is suggested, therefore, that rapid surface <b>cyclolysis</b> is unlikely to occur except in large-scale environments that promote rapid erosion of the upper-tropospheric PV anomalies associated with synoptic-scale short waves. 1...|$|E

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward to explain the anomalously deep trough in winter sea-level pressure in the northwestern Atlantic sector during the AD 1790 – 1820 period. One relates it {{to an increase in}} <b>cyclolysis</b> in this area, the other to a change in the general planetary circulation. In an attempt to distinguish between these hypotheses, storminess and cold air outbreaks (CAO) in the northeastern USA during 1790 – 1820 are studied, based on a record of daily pressure and temperature observations at Salem (Massachusetts, USA). Frequency changes of CAO act as proxy for planetary circulation changes. It is found that CAO in the early period were both more persistent and severe than those in the modern control period. No evidence of elevated levels of storminess in the 1790 – 1820 period was found. This suggests that the anomalously deep trough can be attributed mainly to a change in the planetary circulation...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that sea-ice in the Sea of Okhotsk can be {{affected}} by local storms; in turn, the resultant sea-ice changes can affect the downstream development of storm tracks in the Pacific and possibly dampen a pre-existing North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) signal in late winter. In this paper, a storm tracking algorithm was applied to the six hourly horizontal winds from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data from 1978 (9) to 2007 and output from the atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) ECHAM 5 forced by sea-ice anomalies in the Sea of Okhotsk. The life cycle response of storms to sea-ice anomalies is investigated using various aspects of storm activity—cyclone genesis, lysis, intensity and track density. Results show that, for enhanced positive sea-ice concentrations in the Sea of Okhotsk, there is a decrease in secondary cyclogenesis, a westward shift in <b>cyclolysis</b> and changes in the subtropical jet are seen in the North Pacific. In the Atlantic, a pattern resembling the negative phase of the NAO is observed. This pattern is confirmed by the AGCM ECHAM 5 experiments driven with above normal sea-ice anomalies in the Sea of Okhots...|$|E
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of a central Pacific cyclone, {{characterized}} by a 48 -h interval of rapid fluctuation in its intensity, is examined. The cyclone of interest underwent a period of explosive cyclogenesis from 1200 UTC 4 November to 1200 UTC 5 November 1986, followed 12 h later by a period of unusually rapid decay. Output from a numerical simulation of this event, run using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM 5), is used to perform a piecewise potential vorticity (PV) inversion in order to diagnose the {{life cycle of}} this unusual cyclone. The analysis reveals that the presence of lower-tropospheric frontogenetic forcing in an environment char-acterized by reduced static stability (as measured by high values of the K index) produced a burst of heavy precipitation during the development stage of the cyclone’s life cycle. The associated latent heat release produced a substantial diabatic PV anomaly in the middle troposphere that was, in turn, responsible {{for the majority of the}} lower-tropospheric height falls associated with the explosive cyclogenesis. Subsequent height rises during the rapid <b>cyclolysis</b> stage resulted from the northward migration of the surface cyclone into a perturbation geopotential ridge associated with a negative tropopause-level PV anomaly. This feature devel-oped rapidly in response to the southeastward migration of a preexisting, upstream negative PV anomaly an...|$|E
40|$|The {{speed of}} Atlantic surface depressions, {{occurred}} during the autumn and winter seasons and that lead to intense precipitation over Italy from 1951 to 2000, was investigated. Italy was divided into 5 regions as documented in previous climatological studies (based on Principal Component Analysis). Intense precipitation events were {{selected on the basis}} of in situ rain gauge data and clustered according to the region that they hit. For each intense precipitation event we tried to identify an associated surface depression and we tracked it, within a large domain covering the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions, from its formation to <b>cyclolysis</b> in order to estimate its speed. 'Depression speeds' were estimated with 6 -h resolution and clustered into slow and non-slow classes by means of a threshold, coinciding with the first quartile of speed distribution and depression centre speeds were associated with their positions. Slow speeds occurring over an area including Italy and the western Mediterranean basin showed frequencies higher than 25 %, for all the Italian regions but one. The probability of obtaining by chance the observed more than 25 % success rate was estimated by means of a binomial distribution. The statistical reliability of the result is confirmed for only one region. For Italy as a whole, results were confirmed at 95 % confidence level.

40|$|Wilkes Land annual snow {{accumulation}} variability is explored {{together with}} ice core chemistry data as proxies for circumpolar atmospheric circulation in the 110 °E– 135 °E {{sector of the}} circumpolar trough. Four accumulation time series spanning 1930 – 1985 show a pattern of accumulation related to maritime air mass incursions over the East Antarctic ice sheet slope, which is regionally consistent on interannual and interdecadal timescales. The temporal accumulation pattern in Wilkes Land shows decadal fluctuations of ± 10 %. Both these fluctuations and the overall trend of increasing accumulation since the middle 1960 s are consistent with a poleward shift and intensification of the circumpolar trough. This {{is consistent with a}} shift toward the high index state of the southern annular mode. Interannual variability of snow accumulation rate throughout Wilkes Land was found to be dependent upon shifts in the preferred tracks of cyclones along or across the coast and in the location of <b>cyclolysis</b> regions. Significant differences in this temporal accumulation pattern over Wilkes Land can occur {{as a result of the}} time-varying location of atmospheric ridging and the circumpolar long-wave structure south of New Zealand and Australia. Snow accumulation at an additional site (GD 09) displays a well-defined interdecadal pattern, and the mean annual nitrate (NO₃⁻) concentration of snow is correlated to the winter sea level pressure gradient between East Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic and the upper geopotential height and zonal wind data over East Antarctica.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. A rapidly intensifying wintertime cyclone {{impacted}} the Hawaiian Islands from 11 to 15 December 2008. A detailed {{case study}} {{of the evolution of}} this meteorology “bomb” is conducted using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data. The focus is on the dynamic forcing and large-scale settings between the deepening and decaying stages. Model sensitivity simulations are conducted using the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model to diagnose the roles played by latent heat release on the evolution of the storm. Feedbacks of latent heat release contribute to the rapid cyclogenesis. Latent heat release enhances vertical motion in the eastern flank of the surface cyclone, which 1) increases the potential vorticity (PV) advection aloft; 2) causes surface pressure falls underneath with stronger cyclonic flow; 3) strengthens the low-level frontogenesis as cold and warm air are brought into juxtaposition and 4) brings moisture from the tropics into the warm sector with increased southerly winds. With a westward tilted vertical structure, the feedback of latent heat release further increases the upper-level forcing as the enhanced low-level horizontal temperature advection deepens the upper-level trough and intensifies the upper-level ridge. During the decaying stage, latent heat release slows down the <b>cyclolysis</b> with similar processes, but the impact and feedbacks of latent heat release are less significant as compared to the deepening stage due to 1) decreasing moisture and low-level instability as the cyclone moves northwestward, and 2) less significant westward tilted structure. The enhanced rising motion associated with PV advection aloft is in the northeast quadrant of the upper-level low, thus the feedback of latent heat release weakens the upper-level low. Furthermore, without a westward tilt of the trough axis, the enhanced horizontal temperature advection neither deepens the upper-level trough and intensifies upper-level ridge nor increases the upper-level forcing...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{imagery of}} the Antarctic Peninsula, Bellingshausen Sea, and Weddell Sea region, {{together}} with operational meteorological analyses, are used to investigate the development, tracks, and structure of synoptic-scale weather systems within the Antarctic Peninsula sector of the circumpolar trough, which rings the Southern Hemisphere between the latitudes of 60 ° and 70 °S. A number of previous {{studies have shown that}} more cyclogenesis events take place within this zone than in any other region of the Southern Hemisphere, although the mechanisms behind these developments have not been investigated previously. This study confirms the large number of cyclogenesis events taking place within the circumpolar trough and, in the year examined, the mean latitude of cyclogenesis within the sector was 64 °S. During the year, 504 lows were observed, with 281 developing in the area and 223 moving in. The diameters of the systems observed ranged from 300 to 3500 km, with the smallest vortices being mesocyclones that later grew into synoptic-scale lows. The mean distance travelled by the depressions was only 1377 km (standard deviation 1205 km), reflecting the fact that the systems observed ranged from small quasi-stationary lows to large, very mobile depressions. The mean meridional movement of the lows during their existence was very small. The greatest number of cyclogenesis events were observed over the Bellingshausen Sea, where more than 0. 48 events 10   000 km− 2 year− 1 were found, with a secondary maximum in the lee of the Antarctic Peninsula. The mean lifetime of the systems observed was 22 h, with over half the vortices existing for less than 24 h. A maximum of <b>cyclolysis</b> was found just {{to the west of the}} Antarctic Peninsula, with a secondary maximum in the South Atlantic. Of the systems that formed within the area, 36 % were developments within pre-existing large areas of low pressure, which were similar to the ‘merry-go-round’ formations of mesocyclones. A further 39 % of developments consisted of waves on major frontal bands. The remaining developments comprised lee lows and some cyclogenesis events in synoptically isolated regions...|$|E
