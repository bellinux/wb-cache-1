25|$|Since the 2007–08 {{financial}} crisis {{there is a}} renewed interest in Hayek’s core explanation of boom-and-bust cycles, which serves as an alternative explanation to that of the savings glut as launched by Bernanke. Economists at the Bank of International Settlements, e.g. William White, emphasize the importance of Hayekian insights and the impact of monetary policies and <b>credit</b> <b>growth</b> as root causes of financial cycles. A. Hoffmann and G. Schnabl provide an international perspective and explain recurring financial cycles in the world economy as consequence of gradual interest rate cuts led by the central banks in the large advanced economies since the 1980s. N. Cachanosky outlines the impact of US monetary policy on the production structure in Latin America.|$|E

2500|$|The UK {{property}} market boomed {{for the seven}} years up to 2008, and in some areas property trebled in value over that period.

2500|$|In May 2011, the IMF country report {{assessment}} of the economy of Kiribati is that “After two years of contraction, the economy recovered {{in the second half}} of 2010 and inflation pressure dissipated.

Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base. Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. <b>Credit</b> <b>growth</b> in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled.
