From the results in TablesÂ  2 and 3, the ratio of the first cracking load of the <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> beams to that of the X 8 expanded steel mesh beams was 1.12, 1.33, 1.4, 1.2, 1.19 for (WSC/ESC), (WDC/EDC), (WSB/ESB), (WSS/ESS), and (WSR/ESR) respectively. The better performance of the beams reinforced with <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> could be attributed to the material properties of the two types of steel meshes which resulted in higher tensile strength of the mortar-mesh composite for the case of <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded steel mesh as explained in Eqs.

40|$|Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls {{restrain}} hillslopes to unnatural gradients using reinforced soil. Traditional MSE {{walls are}} constructed of large reinforced concrete panels bolted to steel strips for soil reinforcement. Segmented Retaining Walls (SRWs) are {{a form of}} MSE walls composed of precast concrete modular blocks that incorporate geosynthetic soil reinforcement. In comparison, traditional MSE walls have faster construction times and are typically stronger, but SRWs have increased in popularity because they are much cheaper to build. There are many precast companies that produce different SRW block designs, these blocks have facing areas that range from 1 to 13. 75 sq. ft. and can weigh approximately 90 to 2, 000 lbs. There are advantages to both block types {{that must be addressed}} during design. Typically construction costs are lower for small blocks because they can be placed by hand rather than using equipment. Large blocks require less construction time but are usually more expensive to fabricate. Oldcastle is a precast company that has several modular block designs. The newest model called the Mega Wall block is 5. 5 feet wide, 2. 5 feet tall and weighs approximately 2, 000 lbs. The block is designed to accommodate both <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> and geosynthetics soil reinforcement. Prior to being released to the market design strengths must be determined through laboratory testing. This report presents the results of the Mega Wall block <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> connection capacity. Three tests were performed by pulling the <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> to failure under simulated overburden pressures. Results of the testing show that <b>welds</b> in the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> failed well below the yield strength of the steel. As the wires were pulled, the mesh applied stress concentrations to edges of the concrete grooves. Conical concrete failures were observed in the concrete after each test. After the concrete failed, the mesh was allowed to bend considerably, which began to apply a bending to the welds already experiencing shear stress. This excessive bending deformation caused premature failure in the welds during testing. In order to achieve higher connection capacities, several modifications to the Mega Wall block design were presented to Oldcastle. These suggestions were acknowledged but not implemented. Oldcastle was not interested in testing modifications to the block and testing was terminated. It is assumed that the Mega Wall block design will not be modified and that Oldcastle will not recommend using the <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> connection...|$|R

Comparing the results of specimens (WSC) with (ESC), (WSS) with (ESS), and (WSR) with (ESR) shows that the ultimate load was higher by 18, 12, and 19 Â % respectively. This could be attributed to the higher ultimate strength of the <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded steel mesh as mentioned in Sect. 2.1. The slight variation in the percentage of increase in the ultimate load could be attributed to the slight difference in the ultimate strength of the concrete and mortar of the different beams. For the case of double reinforcing layers, the ultimate load of specimen (WDC) was higher than that of (EDC) by about 35 Â %. The ultimate load of specimen (WSB) was higher than that of (ESB) by about 88 Â %. This large percentage of increase in the ultimate load for this type of core material {{is due to the fact}} that specimen (ESB) failed due shear as X 8 expanded steel mesh was insufficient for providing the shear strength together with the weak lightweight brick while specimen (WSB) reached its ultimate flexural strength.|$|R

40|$|Although {{concrete}} masonry is {{a composite}} material, its gross properties are used in structural design.

To improve the compressive strength of masonry, the authors examined the effectiveness of inserting rolled fine <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> or <b>welded</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> into the voids of the hollow concrete masonry prior to grouting. This inexpensive method of confining the grout increased the compressive strength of the masonry up to 38 %. Simple and refined equations have been fitted to the stress-strain data of the masonry with the refined form of the equation being found more appropriate. The stress-strain curves appear to predict the peak and postpeak characteristics of the unconfined and confined prisms accurately. The appropriateness of the refined equation is demonstrated by predicting the moment curvature relations of short masonry piers tested under axial and lateral loading...|$|R
