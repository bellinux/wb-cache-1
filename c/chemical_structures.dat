5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The <b>chemical</b> <b>structures</b> of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} <b>chemical</b> <b>structures,</b> viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E

40|$|In chemical/biological research, the <b>chemical</b> <b>structure</b> {{database}} {{is widely}} used to find the detailed information of molecules of interest. However, current <b>chemical</b> <b>structure</b> database does not provide link to the relevant literature which may contain more up-to-date information. Hence, by annotating each molecule in the database {{with one or more}} relevant links to the scientific literature, the database would be a more useful resource to bio/chemical research scientists [1]. In general, the <b>chemical</b> <b>structure</b> diagram in a scientific article can be considered as keywords representing the main content of the article. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automated system for extracting and recognizing <b>chemical</b> <b>structure</b> diagrams. In this project, we plan to develop an efficient method to extract <b>chemical</b> <b>structure</b> diagrams using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a first step towards constructing such system. 2. Problem Statement In this project, the main objective is to devise a classification algorithm which accurately identifies <b>chemical</b> <b>structure</b> diagrams. <b>Chemical</b> <b>structure</b> diagrams have some unique topological characteristics such as lines, hexagons, and pentagons while other images do not share those characteristics as shown in Fig. 1. Based on this observation, we define a feature vector where each element represents the unique characteristics of <b>chemical</b> <b>structure</b> diagrams. Then, thus defined feature vector may include following feature information. • Color histogra...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel <b>chemical</b> <b>structures</b> that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and {{have the potential to}} be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of <b>chemical</b> <b>structures</b> and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{organometallic}} chemistry includes the 19th-century discoveries of Zeise's salt and nickel tetracarbonyl. These compounds posed {{a challenge to}} chemists as the compounds did not fit with existing chemical bonding models. A further challenge arose {{with the discovery of}} ferrocene, the iron analogue of rhodocene and the first of the class of compounds now known as metallocenes. Ferrocene was found to be unusually chemically stable, as were analogous <b>chemical</b> <b>structures</b> including rhodocenium, the unipositive cation of rhodocene and its cobalt and iridium counterparts. The study of organometallic species including these ultimately {{led to the development of}} new bonding models that explained their formation and stability. Work on sandwich compounds, including the rhodocenium-rhodocene system, earned Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer the 1973 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) <b>chemical</b> <b>structures,</b> so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 <b>chemical</b> <b>structures.</b> Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E
5|$|In drug design it is {{important}} to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have <b>chemical</b> <b>structures</b> that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E

25|$|This {{is because}} many biologically active natural {{products}} are secondary metabolites often with complex <b>chemical</b> <b>structures.</b> This has {{an advantage in}} that they are novel compounds but this complexity also makes difficult the synthesis of such compounds; instead the compound may need to be extracted from its natural source– a slow, expensive and inefficient process.
