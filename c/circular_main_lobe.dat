30|$|The main propose of {{this paper}} is to design a robust {{monopulse}} algorithm which can form the anti-jamming sum and difference beam patterns pointing to the assumed direction while maintaining the pattern <b>main</b> <b>lobes</b> against distortion with fewer additional degrees of freedom. The constraint for <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> maintenance is set approximating to the SOI steering vector. Thus, it can achieve good performance and cost only one DOF. Inspired by the steering vector estimation in [20], we use signal subspace projection to obtain the constraint for <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> maintenance and subspace tracking to update the time-varying signal subspace of the data snapshots.|$|R
40|$|Without any {{relative}} moves or beam scanning, {{the novel}} Orbital-Angular-Momentum- (OAM-) based radar targets detection technique using uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs) shows the azimuthal estimation ability, which provides new perspective for radar system design. However, the main estimation method, that is, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), under this scheme suffers from low resolution. As a solution, this paper rebuilds the OAM-based radar targets detection model and introduces the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm {{to improve the}} resolution for detecting targets within the <b>main</b> <b>lobes.</b> The spatial smoothing technique is proposed to tackle the coherent problem brought by the proposed model. Analytical study and simulation demonstrate the superresolution estimation capacity the MUSIC algorithm can achieve for detecting targets within the <b>main</b> <b>lobes.</b> The performance of the MUSIC algorithm to detect targets not illuminated by the <b>main</b> <b>lobes</b> is further evaluated. Despite the fact that MUSIC algorithm loses the resolution advantage under this case, its estimation is more robust {{than that of the}} FFT method. Overall, the proposed MUSIC algorithm for the OAM-based radar system demonstrates the superresolution ability for detecting targets within the <b>main</b> <b>lobes</b> and good robustness for targets out of the <b>main</b> <b>lobes...</b>|$|R
