25|$|In June 2008, {{researchers}} at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who had previously succeeded in hacking the OV-chipkaart (the Dutch public transport <b>chip</b> <b>card),</b> hacked an Oyster card, which is also based on the MIFARE Classic chip. They scanned a card reader to obtain its cryptographic key, then used a wireless antenna attached to a laptop computer to brush up against passengers on the London Underground and extract the information from their cards. With that information {{they were able to}} clone a card, add credit to it, and use it to travel on the Underground for at least a day. The MIFARE chip manufacturers NXP Semiconductor sought a court injunction to prevent the publication of the details of this security breach, but this was overturned on appeal.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>chipped</b> <b>card,</b> {{language}} {{used on the}} form is Serbian (in Cyrillic script) and English, however, personal data is printed only in Serbian Cyrillic. This has caused some controversy, since obviously national ID card {{will be difficult to}} use as a valid ID document abroad, except in those countries which also use Cyrillic script. Nevertheless, the chip-less version of the ID card uses Latin and Cyrillic scripts and has the holder's name printed in Latin script. This was done probably {{due to the fact that}} the name of the ID card holder is stored in Latin script inside the chip of a <b>chipped</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upon {{entering}} a restaurant, guests receive a <b>chip</b> <b>card</b> that {{keeps track of}} all the meals and drinks ordered. Antipasti, pasta and pizza have always been divided up into various price categories. All the meals are made to order before {{the eyes of the}} guests (Front Cooking). Once the meals are prepared, the guest can bring them to any of the free-seating tables. For pizza, guests receive a portable disc that blinks and vibrates as soon as the order is ready to be picked up at the counter. Guests pay for meals and drinks when leaving the restaurant, after handing in their <b>chip</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E

The smallest CCID form is a standard USB dongle and may contain a SIM card or Secure Digital card inside the USB dongle. Another popular device is a USB smart card reader keyboard, which in addition to being a standard PC USB keyboard, has an additional slot for accepting a smartcard.|$|E

50|$|The third {{system of}} stored-value phonecards is <b>chip</b> <b>cards,</b> first {{launched}} {{on a large}} scale in 1986 in Germany by Deutsche Bundespost after three years of testing, and in France by France Télécom. Many other countries followed suit, including Ireland in 1990 and the UK circa 1994-1995, which phased out the old green Landis+Gyr cards in favor of the <b>chip</b> (smart) <b>cards.</b> The initial microchips were easy to hack, typically by scratching off the programming-voltage contact on the card, which rendered the phone unable to reduce the card's value after a call. But by the mid-to-late 1990s, highly secure technology aided the spread of chip phonecards worldwide.|$|R
