5000|$|Critics of TSSI, {{including}} David Laibman (see Criticism section, below), {{argue that}} Marx intended to present what they <b>characterize</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a structurally consistent" [...] model of value formation in a capitalist economy with competitive profit-rate equalization. They claim that Marx's formulations {{fail to do}} this. But they claim that what they <b>characterize</b> <b>as</b> his fundamental insights can be revealed, and extended, by means of models and concepts that emerged after his time. Instead of trying to defend the consistency of Marx's original statements, non-TSSI Marxist theorists pursue what they <b>characterize</b> <b>as</b> ever-more effective versions of what they {{claim to be the}} core theory. They also claim that they believe that Marx himself would have done this.|$|R

5|$|Despite the canonic {{status of}} Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin is often <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> an under-recognized {{or even as}} a {{forgotten}} author; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) {{over the last few}} decades, he is much less well known by the reading public than other representatives of German modernism such as Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, or Franz Kafka.|$|E

All this suggests these formations were initially deposited in an oceanic environment, possibly as seamounts or an island arc.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are areas}} of relatively low {{pressure in the}} troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment {{near the center of}} tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> “warm core” systems.|$|E

2500|$|A {{different}} response {{comes from}} transhumanist personhood theorists who object {{to what they}} <b>characterize</b> <b>as</b> the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research, which science fiction writer Isaac Asimov termed the [...] "Frankenstein complex". For example, Woody Evans argues that, provided they are self-aware, human clones, human-animal chimeras and uplifted animals would all be unique persons deserving of respect, dignity, rights, responsibilities, and citizenship. They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so-called monsters, but what they <b>characterize</b> <b>as</b> the [...] "yuck factor" [...] and [...] "human-racism", that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous.|$|R

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E
