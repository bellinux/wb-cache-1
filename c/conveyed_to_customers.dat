50|$|When {{heading for}} a product, {{consumers}} (in)directly seek objective as well as subjective satisfaction. Adequate packaging can increase the consumer's feeling of identification with a product by, e.g., promoting a certain life-style or by conveying high quality, enhancing the product's ability of serving as a status symbol. Another important consumer type {{is the one that}} values health and a high quality of life above everything else. The proportion of packaging that promotes health benefits of the product and that <b>conveys</b> <b>to</b> the <b>customer</b> a certain feeling of doing something good for their health is steadily increasing. Another trend involves packaging that turns products into collectibles and make the packaging more valuable <b>to</b> the <b>customer</b> than the actual product itself. A good example of this trend is the Share a Coke marketing campaign by Coca-Cola, that was launched in Brazil in 2015, four years after the first campaign was launched in Australia. Colors transmit esthetics, yet post 2010 developments in the Brazilian packaging market show a rising preference of simple styles by customers.|$|R
40|$|Public {{transport}} system {{is an important}} part of cities, and the quality of public transport service [...] passengers' perceived performance [...] is a key urban indicator. Customer satisfaction surveys has been the traditional methods and metrics for monitoring and evaluating public transport service quality, but they come with a number of weaknesses. They are administered too infrequently and ask subjects to provide only general ratings. The infrequency results in potential delay for agencies to receive feedback, and the abstractness reduces the possibilities of associating satisfaction levels to specific trips and their attributes, as well as using the data to inform service improvement decisions. Given these shortcomings with conventional surveying practices, there is great value in engaging riders as additional sources of information. This reflects the concept of "co-monitoring" [...] agencies using public feedback to supplement the official monitoring and regulation. This is aided by the growing ubiquity of Internet-connected mobile devices, which enables citizens to generate and submit feedback without time or geographic constraints. From the data collection perspective, this would make the process more dynamic, low-cost, and in real-time. Equally importantly, it is poised to enhance public transport agencies' relationship with their <b>customers</b> [...] <b>conveying</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> that their experience and feedback are valued. The service sector today is increasingly striving to be more responsive to the customers' needs and experiences, seeking to strengthen the relationships with customers. The benefits of co-monitoring may help public transport agencies adapt to these current service paradigm shifts towards "real-time" and "on-demand. "by Corinna Lubin Li. Thesis: M. C.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{circumstances}} in which manufacturers provide inputs <b>to</b> wholesale <b>customers</b> only <b>to</b> subsequently compete with these wholesale customers in the retail realm. Such dual distribution arrangements commonly suffer from excessive encroachment in that the manufacturer's ex post retail aggression is harmful ex ante because it undercuts potential wholesale profits. This paper demonstrates that with dual distribution, a manufacturer can benefit from decentralized control {{and the use of}} transfer prices above marginal cost. Although these arrangements often create coordination concerns, a moderate presence of such concerns permits the manufacturer <b>to</b> credibly <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> its wholesale <b>customer</b> that it will not excessively encroach on its retail territory. This, in turn, permits the manufacturer to reap greater wholesale profits. We also note that this force can point to a silver lining in arm's-length (parity) requirements on transfer pricing in that they can solidify commitments to a particular retail posture. decentralization, supply chains, transfer pricing...|$|R

Existing retail rate tariffs for commercial customers do not align with utilities’ wholesale market purchases of energy, ancillary services, and capacity guarantees, nor do they efficiently <b>convey</b> resource scarcity <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> <b>to</b> alter their consumption and DER deployment decisions. This report seeks to understand the effects that real time pricing has on electricity costs and incentives for DER deployment for small commercial building owners. Our analysis uses historical load data from multiple commercial building types throughout New Jersey to (i) evaluate the relationship between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and consumptive patterns, and (ii) explore the potential benefit of new electrical rate structures with increased granularity in the temporal and geographic dimensions. This assessment of potential savings for customers and utilities {{can be used to}} inform future rate design. Our key findings are as follows: (1) retail rates based on LMPs can benefit both distribution utilities and their customers; (2) any new rate introduced must be optional, as varying load attributes at specific sites result in very different experiences under these rates (i. e., almost half of subject sites are worse off); (3) utilities can reduce risk by implementing a retail rate with a real-time price signal...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{employees can}} help their organization build service brands. For service brands, employees {{play a big}} role in communicating the brand meaning and the brand values <b>to</b> the <b>customers.</b> Based on the employee-customer interaction, customers form attitudes about the brand and thus decide to choose the company and remain loyal. Many organisations train employees <b>to</b> interact with <b>customers,</b> but often never specify how they want employees to deliver the brand promise. This study aims to uncover how employees deliver the brand’s values <b>to</b> <b>customers.</b> The research question is “How do service employees facilitate the creation of successful service brands for an organisation?” The research question is answered using semi-structured interviews of 12 employees of a fitness centre in Auckland City Centre. These interviews are then examined using content analysis which provides answers as <b>to</b> how employees <b>convey</b> brand values <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> and create brand equity. The categories of content analysis are achieved by a series of coding and grouping words found in the interview answers. The analysis found five categories by which the employees created brand equity. These categories are: ‘Employee Behaviour’, ‘Social Connection’, Customer Satisfaction’, ‘Branding’, and ‘Employee Commitment’. The findings suggest that employees believed they had significant influence on customers when it came to communicating the brand values <b>to</b> <b>customers.</b> The approaches they employed were focused on the customer as a priority. Customer loyalty and brand retention are achieved through customer satisfaction and establishing social connections with the customers. Superior interpersonal skills were also seen as an important way <b>to</b> gain <b>customers</b> respect and ensure brand loyalty. The employees also felt it was necessary for the management to empower them with training and support, and create a positive working environment for them to commit to building brand equity. Employees expressed reasonable knowledge on branding, and believed they created brand equity by providing customers with the best gym experience and reaching their fitness and health goals. It was interesting to note that while the three interviewed branches, operating under the parent brand, shared the same brand guidelines, exercise programs and brand philosophy, they demonstrated obvious differences in branches’ culture, way of doing things and approach <b>to</b> <b>customer</b> service. This dissertation provides the marketing discipline with evidence on the perspectives of service brand employees, and their significant role towards branding and creating brand equity for a fitness company. While these insights are not exhaustive by themselves, they also provide knowledge on the delivery of brand promise, marketing programs and employee recruitment for the fitness industry in specific and for the service sector in general...|$|R

40|$|Although little {{empirical}} evidence exists {{to support this}} contention, the extant literature suggests that firms can potentially achieve two types of benefits from developing a CRM orientation: (1) increased efficiency in the allocation of resources destined for relationship building and maintenance activities, and (2) enhanced exchange relationship outcomes through the provision of superior customer value (Zablah, Bellenger, and Johnston 2004). This effort focused on the latter of these purported benefits and sought {{to answer the following}} two fundamental questions: (1) does a CRM orientation influence the outcome of customer-provider relationships and, if so, how; and (2) does CRM technology {{have an effect on the}} relative success of CRM initiatives? In an attempt to address these questions, a conceptual model of 2 ̆ 2 CRM success 2 ̆ 2 was advanced and tested utilizing data from, both, customers and their providers. The conceptual model, which is based on interactive communications theory, posits that a CRM orientation has a positive effect on the quality of the product, service and planned interaction messages providers <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> their <b>customers.</b> The model also suggests that the quality of these messages directly influences customer-perceived relationship value which, in turn, drives other relationship attitudes, perceptions and, ultimately, customers’ behavioral intentions. Finally, the model proposes a moderating role for CRM technology: the association between CRM orientation and message quality is expected to increase (decrease) as the assimilation of CRM technology within firms increases (decreases). The model was tested utilizing (multi-level) SEM techniques. The results provide partial support for the proposed model and suggest the following: 1. As firms’ level of CRM orientation increases, customer-perceived message quality decreases. This inverse relationship between CRM orientation and message quality does not hold true across accounts of different sizes. For large accounts, message quality tends to increase as firms’ level of CRM orientation increases while the opposite holds true for small and medium-sized accounts. 2. The relationship between CRM orientation and message quality is not contingent upon the extent to which firms have assimilated CRM technology. Rather, firms’ level of CRM technology assimilation appears to exert a direct effect upon message quality. 3. Customer-perceived relationship value (CPRV) mediates the effect that product, planned and service messages exert upon customers’ relationship attitudes, perceptions and, ultimately, behavioral intentions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of our {{thesis is}} {{to study and}} analyze the {{components}} and features a brand should have to provide a solid foundation for brand building. Furthermore, we show how brands can make use of trends in a brand establishment. This paper is written from a qualitative approach. Through both structured and semi structured interviews, we obtained valuable information from our respondents. Our frame of reference and empirical foundation are linked together through an abductive approach which has resulted in our analysis and conclusions. A trend brings {{with a set of}} emotional characteristics, which companies can’t influence but must adapt to. This means that brands {{can take advantage of the}} force created by a trend in the form of a lever, if the companies adapt their businesses into what the trend represents. This leads to a decreased distance between the brand and the <b>customer,</b> due <b>to</b> that the emotional characteristics conveyed by the brand are already held by the customer. The company does not need <b>to</b> teach the <b>customer</b> about the emotional values carried by the brand, and we then see a trend as a carrier of information that <b>conveys</b> knowledge <b>to</b> the <b>customers.</b> The critical moment in establishing a brand during a trend, is that the launch of the brand takes place at the right time. It can be devastating for companies investing a lot of time and money to adapt their brand to a trend if the establishment takes place too late. This might result in a high competition where companies can experience difficulties in taking market shares...|$|R
