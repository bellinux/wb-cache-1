40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} polysaccharides, {{including}} xyloglucan from Hymenaea courbaril (XG), galactomannans from Schizolobium parahybae (GMSP) and Mimosa scabrella (GMMS), xanthan gum (XT), sodium hyaluronate (HNa) and Fucogel® (FG), on the rheological behavior of cosmetic emulsions were evaluated. These incorporations {{gave rise to}} six emulsified systems, denoted XGE, GMSPE, GMMSE, XTE, HNaE and FGE, respectively. The emulsion consistency was found to follow the trend GMSPE>XGE>HNaE>FGE>XTE>GMMSE. In general, the addition of polysaccharides increased the viscoelastic properties of the emulsions and decreased the creep <b>compliance.</b> The <b>neutral</b> polysaccharides (GMSPE, GMMSE) led to better stability of the emulsions after storing for 20 days relative to charged polymers. It was found that polysaccharides XG, GMSP and GMMS, which come from the seeds of native Brazilian plant species, {{might be used to}} modify the flow properties and stabilities of oil–water emulsions...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in next-generation sequencing have enhanced {{the resolution of}} population genetic studies of non-model organisms through increased marker generation and sample throughput. Using double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), we investigated the population structure of the commercially important southern rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii, in Australia and New Zealand {{with the aim of}} identifying a panel of SNP markers {{that could be used to}} trace country of origin. Four ddRADseq libraries comprising a total of 88 individuals were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and demultiplexed reads were used to create a reference catalog of loci. Individual reads were then mapped to the reference catalog, and variant calling was performed. We have characterized two single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels comprised in total of 656 SNPs. The first <b>panel</b> contained 535 <b>neutral</b> SNPs and the second, 121 outlier SNPs that were characteristic of being putatively under selection. Both neutral and outlier SNP panels showed significant differentiation between the two countries, with the outlier loci demonstrating much larger F(ST) values (F(ST) outlier SNP panel = 0. 134, P < 0. 0001; F(ST) <b>neutral</b> SNP <b>panel</b> = 0. 022, P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the protections afforded by the Free Exercise Clause when {{government}} regulation impacts the religious practices of individuals, and if one looks for guidance from the Supreme Court, the rules are fairly clear. Prior to 1990, the Supreme Court had long employed a balancing approach that afforded—at least in theory—significant relief. Under this approach individuals were entitled to exemptions from laws which substantially burdened religious conduct unless enforcement was justified by a compelling state interest. In 1990, in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court abandoned this balancing test for all but a few categories of cases. Under the Court’s new rule, the Free Exercise Clause does not excuse individuals from <b>compliance</b> with <b>neutral,</b> generally applicable laws that are not intended to burden religious exercise. Relief is only appropriate where laws are designed to thwart religious exercise. The judicial landscape is much different when one turns to the free exercise rights of religious organizations. Government regulation frequently impacts the activities of religious groups, and clashes between religious organizations and regulators are common. Surprisingly, however, the Supreme Court has never directly addressed the scope of free exercise protections when government regulation interferes with the internal affairs of religious groups. There are cases involving religious organizations, to be sure, but in none of these cases has the Court addressed neutral government regulation that directly impinges upon internal church affairs. This article begins by identifying three possible approaches to such regulation, all of which can be supported indirectly by Supreme Court precedent. The article then examines the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith for guidance in choosing from among them. For some courts and scholars, the meaning of Smith for religious groups is simple: religious groups, just like religious individuals, are not entitled to special exemptions from neutral state action. For others, however, Smith is not relevant at all to the free exercise rights of religious groups, and they look to other lines of Supreme Court precedent for appropriate standards. My examination of Smith reveals that Smith is not only relevant to an analysis of religious group rights but is also very helpful for choosing among the available options. The opinion in Smith raises a number of issues that clarify what is at stake in making this choice, and its lessons are surprising. When read carefully, Smith supports a broad right of “church autonomy” that prohibits government interference with internal church affairs regardless of whether the interference is intentional and regardless of whether the activities affected are religious in nature or more mundane matters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Neonatal {{screening}} for Pompe disease {{has been introduced}} in Taiwan and a few U. S. states, while other jurisdictions including some European countries are piloting or considering this screening. First-tier screening flags both classic infantile and late-onset Pompe disease, which challenges current screening criteria. Previously, advocacy groups have sometimes supported expanded neonatal screening more than professional experts, while neutral citizens' views were unknown. This study aimed to measure support for neonatal {{screening for}} Pompe disease in {{the general public and}} to compare it to support among (parents of) patients with this condition. The study was done in the Netherlands, where newborns are not currently screened for Pompe disease. Newborn screening is not mandatory in the Netherlands but current uptake is almost universal. Methods A consumer <b>panel</b> (<b>neutral</b> group) and (parents of) patients with Pompe disease (Pompe group) were sent information and a questionnaire. Responses were analyzed of 555 neutral and 58 Pompe-experienced informants who had demonstrated sufficient understanding. Results 87 % of the neutral group and 88 % of the Pompe group supported the introduction of screening (95 % CI of difference - 10 to 7 %). The groups were similar in their moral reasoning about screening and acceptance of false positives, but the Pompe-experienced group expected greater benefit from neonatal detection of late-onset disease. Multivariate regression analysis controlling for demographics confirmed that approval of the introduction of screening was independent of having (a child with) Pompe disease. Furthermore, respondents with university education, regardless of whether they have (a child with) Pompe disease, {{were more likely to be}} reluctant about the introduction of screening than those with less education, OR for approval 0. 29 (95 % CI 0. 18 to 0. 49, p Conclusions This survey suggests a rather high level of support for newborn screening for Pompe disease, not only among those who have personal experience of the disease but also among the general public in the Netherlands. Optional screening on the basis of informed parental consent is probably unrealistic, underlining the need for new guidelines to help policymakers in their consideration of newborn screening for broad phenotype conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{attention has}} focused on soybean-based adhesives because of increased phenolic resin prices and adhesive demand. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the adhesive properties of crosslinked soy flour and/or soy hydrolyzate with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins for use in structural <b>panels.</b> <b>Neutral</b> phenolic soy (NPS) and alkaline phenolic soy (APS) resins were prepared and used to bond southern pine plywood. Adhesive bond quality of the soybean-based phenolic resins was evaluated by glueline shear test following the procedure detailed in Product Standard PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. Within the range of variable levels investigated, the following conditions produced higher wet wood failure than a control glue mix. For NPS resins best results were obtained with a 160 cps PF, a 30 minute assembly time, and no extender. For APS resins best results were obtained with a 50 cps PF, a 200 °C press temperature, 19 % corn-cob powder, and a 60 minute assembly time. Comparable results were obtained with either a 40 % or 50 % PF level in the resins. Under these conditions, the wet wood failure of plywood bonded with both resins approached the requirement of PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. The APS resins were also used to fabricate homogeneous hybrid poplar flakeboards with different resin solid levels (5 %, 7 %, and 9 %), press temperatures (175 and 200 °C), and press times of 8 and 10 minutes. Internal bond strength, wet modulus of rupture, and dimensional stabilities of flakeboard improved with increased press time, press temperature, and PF level in the resins. In particular, increased press time can be used to offset the poor internal bonding associated with high resin content and the excessive moisture present in the mat. However, APS resin-bonded flakeboards provided higher mechanical and better dimensional stability properties compared to the Canadian Standard Association O 437 standard, except for modulus of elasticity, which could be easily improved by flake alignment. Optimum production condition for flakeboard bonded with the APS resins are a 5 % resin level, a 50 % PF level, a 200 °C press temperature, and an 8 minute press time. Although NPS and APS resins can be competitive with other conventional adhesives, further improvements are required to reduce press times for industrial applications...|$|R
