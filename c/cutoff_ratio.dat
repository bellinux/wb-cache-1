40|$|Fan noise {{including}} its generation, radiation characteristics, and suppression by acoustic treatment is studied. In fan noise generation, results from engine and fan experiments, using inflow control measures to suppress noise sources related to inflow distortion and turbulence, are described. The suppression of sources related to inflow allows the experiments {{to focus on}} the fan or engine internal sources. Some of the experiments incorporated pressure sensors on the fan blades to sample the flow disturbances encountered by the blades. From these data some inferences can be drawn about the origins of the disturbances. Also, hot wire measurements of a fan rotor wake field are presented and related to the fan's noise signature. The radiation and the suppression of fan noise are dependent on the acoustic modes generated by the fan. Fan noise suppression and radiation is described by relating these phenomena to the mode <b>cutoff</b> <b>ratio</b> parameter. In addition to its utility in acoustic treatment design and performance prediction, <b>cutoff</b> <b>ratio</b> was useful in developing a simple description of the radiation pattern for broadband fan noise.

Methods: This study included 13 patients (24 eyes) who wore orthokeratology lenses for the first time. Visual quality was as-sessed with the optical quality analysis system (OQAS) using the double-pass technique. The value of modulation transfer func-tion (MTF) <b>cutoff,</b> Strehl <b>ratio,</b> and objective scatter index (OSI) were measured at baseline and 4 weeks after wearing the lenses. Results: The mean spherical equivalent decreased from- 2. 70 ± 1. 03 diopters (D) to 0. 03 ± 0. 36 D after 4 weeks of wearing ortho-keratology lenses and uncorrected visual acuity improved from log MAR 0. 88 ± 0. 17 to log MAR 0. 03 ± 0. 04. The MTF cutoff de-creased from 38. 20 ± 11. 01 to 34. 79 ± 10. 30 and the Strehl ratio decreased from 0. 24 ± 0. 07 to 0. 21 ± 0. 07 but without statistical significance. The OSI significantly increased from 0. 38 ± 0. 19 to 0. 72 ± 0. 40 after wearing orthokeratology lenses. Conclusions: Orthokeratology lenses were effective for correction of myopia and astigmatism.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of two minimally invasive methods of blood collection and a reference method. Materials and methods: Blood {{samples were collected}} from 30 pigs at 7 and 8 weeks of age. Fifteen pigs were then inoculated with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) VR- 2332 and 15 remained uninoculated. Pigs were sampled weekly for 7 weeks post inoculation (PI) using a reference sample (jugular vein sample) and two index samples (whole blood from the auricular vein collected either with a sterile polyester swab or using a capillary tube system). All samples were tested by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using established protocols. Continuous sample data for the three sampling methods were compared by analysis of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of qPCR testing for all samples ranged from 93 % to 100 % for weeks 1 through 3 PI. Results of ELISA testing depended on cutoff selection. Optimized ELISA sample: positive (S:P) <b>ratio</b> <b>cutoffs</b> for swab-sample data were significantly lower (mean S:P <b>ratio</b> <b>cutoff</b> = 0. 08, SD = 0. 05) than the industry standard (0. 4). When the industry standard cutoff of 0. 4 was utilized, swabsample sensitivity ranged from 20. 0 % to 55. 6 % over weeks 2 through 7 PI.

Modes with similar cutoff ratios propagate similarly in the duct and in addition propagate similarly to the far field.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} ultrasound elastography as an additional technique in differentiating US indeterminate thyroid nodules in order to decrease the number of tissue biopsies. Methods: We evaluated 30 patients with 36 indeterminate thyroid nodules based on US, criteria, by US elastography, using both the elastography score and strain ratio. Baseband US data were downloaded for off-line analysis. Elastographic maps (color coding) and thyroid stiffness index (strain ratio) were calculated for all nodules, with histopathological results being the standard reference. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve {{analysis was used to}} determine the optimal <b>cutoff</b> strain <b>ratio</b> for separating benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Results: Malignant nodules had a higher degree of color and strain ratio compared to benign nodules, with a statistically significant difference (p <  0. 05). Nodules with an elastography score of 2 were benign, while those with an elastography score of 4 and 5 were mostly malignant. Malignancy could not be excluded using ultrasound elastography criteria only, in nodules with a score of 3. The sensitivity and specificity of the US-elastography strain color coding for thyroid cancer diagnosis were 91 % and 72 % respectively. Using ROC analysis, the optimal <b>cutoff</b> strain <b>ratio</b> for separating benign and malignant thyroid nodules was found to be 1. 6 with a calculated 89 % sensitivity and 70 % specificity. The overall accuracy of strain color was slightly better than strain ratio, 91 % compared to 86 % respectively. Conclusion: Ultrasound elastography is an easy, non-invasive and rapid technique that can be routinely used in thyroid US scans to select cases for FNAC, and decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies, and consequently decrease the hazards and costs.

A comparison of the and ratio for high breakdown and standard breakdown voltage devices is made. Geometrical scaling data show that the SiGe HBT with = 0 5 2 5 m 2 has the lowest and ratio compared to other device geometries.

40|$|This paper models the {{borrowing}} {{decision of}} a small firm seeking a bank loan when it can optionally hire, at a cost, an independent external auditor to convey its risk characteristics to lenders. The analysis shows that {{a necessary condition for}} a potential borrower to prefer having an audit to not having an audit is that the borrower 2 ̆ 019 s debt to equity ratio must be above a certain minimum cut-off value. For observed audit cost functions, this cut-off debt-equity ratio is higher for smaller initial size firms. Such firms will forego an audit even if they are of low risk, and potentially face loan denial and higher interest rate. Additionally, the <b>cutoff</b> debt-equity <b>ratio</b> is an increasing function of audit cost. Hence smaller audit costs may allow more high quality small firms to reveal their types to the banks, thus leading to a more partially separating equilibrium.

40|$|Recently, we have {{developed}} a formalism to evaluate QCD loop diagrams with a single virtual gluon using a running coupling constant at the vertices. This corresponds to an all-order resummation of certain terms (the so-called renormalon chains) in a perturbative series and provides a generalization of the scale-setting prescription of Brodsky, Lepage and Mackenzie. In its original form, the method is applicable to Green functions without external gluons and to euclidean correlation functions. Here we generalize the approach {{to the case of}} cross sections and inclusive decay rates, which receive both virtual and real gluon corrections. We encounter nonperturbative ambiguities in the resummation of the perturbative series, which may hinder the construction of the operator product expansion in the physical region. The origin of these ambiguities and their relation to renormalon singularities in the Borel plane is investigated by introducing an explicit infrared <b>cutoff.</b> The <b>ratios</b> R e + e − and Rτ are discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|A {{previously}} reported closed form solution is expanded to determine effects of isentropic mean flow on mode propagation in a slowly converging-diverging duct - a circular cosh duct. On {{the assumption of}} uniform steady fluid density, the mean flow increases the power transmission coefficient. The increase {{is directly related to}} the increase of the <b>cutoff</b> <b>ratio</b> at the duct throat. With the negligible transverse gradients of the steady fluid variables, the conversion from one mode to another is negligible, and the power transmission coefficient remains unchanged with the mean flow direction reversed.

We evaluated an alternative strategy for diagnosis in which initial screening was performed with an enzyme immunoassay (Chlamydiazyme) followed by a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test on specimens in which the Chlamydiazyme optical density (OD) reading fell in an intermediate zone. Lowering the Chlamydiazme OD ratio (specimen to control) used to define a positive test from 1. 0 (the ratio suggested by the manufacturer) to 0. 3 raised the sensitivity of Chlamydiazyme from 73 to 83 %.

(2) once a month for 3 months with nine patients fulfilling CFS criteria (mean age standard deviation 43. 1 10. 4 years). The accuracy of this ratio in the diagnosis of CFS was also tested and correlated with a clinica...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Although CD 49 d is an {{unfavorable}} prognostic marker in {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL), definitive validation evidence is lacking. A worldwide multicenter analysis was performed using published and unpublished CLL series to evaluate the impact of CD 49 d as an overall (OS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) predictor. Patients and Methods: A training/validation strategy was chosen to find the optimal CD 49 d <b>cutoff.</b> The hazard <b>ratio</b> (HR) for death and treatment imposed by CD 49 d was estimated by pooled analysis of 2, 972 CLLs; Cox analysis stratified by center and stage was used to adjust for confounding variables. The importance of CD 49 d over other flow cytometry–based prognosticators (eg, CD 38, ZAP- 70) was ranked by recursive partitioning. Results: Patients with ≥ 30...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} {{the population of}} the third (n= 3) two-dimensional electron subband of InGaAs/ InAlAs modulation-doped structures with very dense sheet carrier density by means of Fourier transform photoluminescence (PL). Three well-resolved PL peaks centered at 0. 737, 0. 908, and 0. 980 eV are observed, which are attributed to the recombination transitions from the lowest three electron subbands to the n= 1 heavy-hole subband. The subband separations clearly exhibit the features of the stepped quantum well with triangle and square potential, consistent with numerical calculation. Thanks to the presence of the Fermi <b>cutoff,</b> the population <b>ratio</b> of these three subbands can be estimated. Temperature and excitation intensity dependence of the quantum well luminescence intensity is also analyzed. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Although {{positive}} emotions undoubtedly confer benefits, one {{can have}} too much of it. There is probably a point beyond which enjoyment interferes with real-ism, yet it is unclear where that point is. The original “States of Mind ” (SOM) model (Schwartz and Garamoni, 1986; 1989) proposed that a ratio of [positive] to [positive plus negative] affective/cognitive states [P/(P + N) ] of about 0. 62 is optimal, but previous research indicated that higher ratios may go with good mental health. The revised “balanced states of mind ” (BSOM) model (Schwartz, 1997) suggests a higher <b>cutoff,</b> with <b>ratios</b> above 0. 90 being dysfunctional. This paper reports a study of 72 very positive subjects (mean ratio = 0. 85) and assessed possible dysfunction by means of questionnaires, role-plays, and physiological responses to induced stress. Signs of dysfunction were no more frequent among the most positive subjects (ratios of 0. 90 and above) than among moderately positive subjects. This {{suggests that there is}} nothing wrong with the high levels of happiness in present day society. As yet, it is still not established how much more happiness will be too much. One possibility is that standard cognition/emotion measures need to be revised in order to detect trul...|$|R
