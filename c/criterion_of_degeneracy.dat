40|$|The {{qualitative}} {{rules for}} the existence of high-spin ground states in extended systems and molecular crystals are examined here on a firmer theoretical footing. Extended systems have been categorized into three groups, namely, type I, type II, and type Ill, {{depending on the type of}} bonding interactions. The general form of the spin Hamiltonian operators have been written down. The active spaces have been restricted to the minimum size for each of these three types of spin systems. The zeroth-order state vectors and the Hartree-Fock ground-state energies have been identified for unit species of each type. The extended system Hamiltonian operators are further truncated in such a way that only the nearest-neighbor interactions are retained. Expressions have been derived for the energy gap from a molecular orbital approach. The relatively small effects of electron correlation on the energy gaps have been estimated for the type I systems, which belong to the systems of solid-state physics. In particular, it has been shown that for the type I systems the singlet-triplet gap, and hence the ferromagnetic coupling constant, primarily depends upon the difference of one-electron kinetic energies and not on the two-electron exchange integrals. This result agrees with the concept of kinetic exchange that was introduced in the context of a resonating valence-bond formalism. Type II systems are exemplified by extended systems that can be prepared from conjugated molecules while organic molecular crystals form examples of type III species. For these systems, however, the Coulomb exchange interaction has been shown to dominate the energy gap. A quick review of the Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian for the H- 2 molecule is sufficient to point out that the sign of the calculated ferromagnetic coupling constant depends on the method of calculation, the nature of the basis set, and the bond length This is amply supported by ab initio calculations on this species. Numerical data have also been obtained from computations on m-phenylene-coupled nitroxy radicals and stacks of alpha-nitronyl nitroxide, but these calculations have been based on a semiempirical quantum chemical methodology (INDO) since some of the species involved are exceedingly large. Computed energy gaps are in good agreement with experimental and other theoretical (AM 1, PM 3) results. Nevertheless, for the dimer, trimer, tetramer, and pentamer of the type EI specimen, the important pi orbitals are far from being degenerate. The quantitative results clearly deviate from the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> that was suggested from qualitative theories {{for the existence of}} a high-spin ground state. Therefore, the criteria for the existence of high spins have been reformulated in terms of the monomer orbitals. (C) 2000, Inc...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{description}} of entanglement in composite quantum systems in terms of symplectic geometry. We provide a symplectic characterization of sets of equally entangled states as orbits of group actions {{in the space of}} states. In particular, using Kostant-Sternberg theorem, we show that separable states form a unique Kaehler orbit, whereas orbits of entanglement states are characterized by different degrees <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> <b>of</b> the canonical symplectic form on the complex projective space. The degree <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> may be thus used as a new geometric measure of entanglement and we show how to calculate it for various multiparticle systems providing also simple <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> separability. The presented method is general and can be applied also under different additional symmetry conditions stemming, eg. from the indistinguishability of particles.

40|$|The general expressions, {{based on}} the Fermi {{distribution}} of the free electrons, are applied for calculation of the kinetic coefficients in donor-doped silicon at arbitrary degree <b>of</b> the <b>degeneracy</b> <b>of</b> electron gas under equilibrium conditions.

40|$|Often {{relegated to}} the methods section of genetic {{research}} articles, the term "degeneracy" is regularly misunderstood and its theoretical significance widely understated. Degeneracy describes the ability of different structures to be conditionally interchangeable in their contribution to system functions. Frequently mislabeled redundancy, degeneracy refers to structural variation whereas redundancy refers to structural duplication. Sources <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> include, {{but are not limited}} to, (1) duplicate structures that differentiate yet remain isofunctional, (2) unrelated isofunctional structures that are dispersed endogenously or exogenously, (3) variable arrangements of interacting structures that achieve the same output through multiple pathways, and (4) parcellation of a structure into subunits that can still variably perform the same initial function. The ability to perform the same function by drawing upon an array of dissimilar structures contributes advantageously to the integrity of a system. Drawing attention to the heterogeneous construction of living systems by highlighting the concept <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> valuably enhances the ways scientists think about self-organization, robustness, and complexity. Labels in science, however, can sometimes be misleading. In scientific nomenclature, the word "degeneracy" has calamitous proximity to the word "degeneration" used by pathologists and the shunned theory of degeneration once promoted by eugenicists. This article disentangles the concept <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> from its close etymological siblings and offers a brief overview of the historical and contemporary understandings <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> in science. Distinguishing the importance <b>of</b> <b>degeneracy</b> will hopefully allow systems theorists to more strategically operationally conceptualize the distributed intersecting networks that comprise complex living systems. 10 page(s...|$|R
