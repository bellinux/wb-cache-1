5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual <b>circling</b> <b>approach,</b> a {{simplified}} landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} procedure in use for this flight {{in the low}} clouds and low visibility conditions that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly out over the water, descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, then make a left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop procedure turn), and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time would have made a <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|E
2500|$|While Flight 202 was {{descending}} to Islamabad, the Captain {{decided to}} change the instrument landing approach to a visual <b>circling</b> <b>approach.</b> The Captain checked the weather apprehensively, and asked the First Officer to feed unauthorized 04 waypoints in the FMS. The First Officer did not challenge the Captain for his incorrect actions (which may {{have been caused by}} the [...] "lecturing session" [...] earlier). The Captain then briefed the First Officer that he would turn the aircraft in the direction of Runway 30, later to abeam 5 miles from the runway and then land.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flight crew}} {{exercised}} poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> to runway 18R, which {{led them to}} fly outside of the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captain’s intention to make a timely base turn.|$|E

50|$|Pilots {{should be}} aware that there are {{significant}} differences in obstacle clearance criteria between procedures designed in accordance with ICAO PANS-OPS and US TERPS.

50|$|The Korea Aviation Accident Investigation Board {{published}} {{the final report}} in March 2005 {{and concluded that the}} cause of the crash was due to pilot error. The final report stated that the crew was inadvertently flying below the minimum safe altitude. Detailed information from the report also revealed that the pilots were trained to conduct the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> in the airline's simulator only for Beijing International Airport and never conducted a simulation for the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> to Gimhae Airport's runway 18R. Subsequently, the report also blamed the tower controllers in Gimhae Airport for not using the tower BRITE and MSAW systems when losing visual contact with the flight 129 aircraft.|$|E

50|$|One {{instrument}} approach is available, an NDB or GNSS <b>circling</b> <b>approach.</b> Approach minimums {{are higher than}} average (2,000 feet MSL, 1,982 AGL) due to high terrain in the area.

A large overnight parking area is available, but crew must bring their own tiedown anchors.|$|E

50|$|Investigators interviewed Captain Wu.

50|$|The flight {{took off}} at 08:37 local time (0037 UTC). After nearly 2 hours in flight, it arrived near Gimhae Airport in light rain and mist. At 11:16 local time (0216UTC), CA129 {{received}} clearance to use ILS approach to runway 36L then circle to runway 18R (the same runway {{from the opposite}} direction) from Gimhae tower. During the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> to land on runway 18R, the crew exercised poor crew resource management and {{lost sight of the}} runway while delaying the base turn and flying outside of the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> area, and crashed into a hill at 11:21 local time (02:21UTC). The aircraft made an initial contact with terrain when its right wing clipped a tree. It then impacted the ground, and the force of the impact broke the airplane apart. The right wing, empennage, left wing, parts of the fuselage and two engines separated. The plane then burst into flames, engulfing the cockpit and forward fuselage. The aircraft slid and destroyed several trees and 12 graves. 37 of those on-board survived, including the Captain. The post impact fire was so hot that it melted the aluminum and other metals of the fuselage. The front part of the fuselage was completely destroyed, making it difficult for investigators to recognize it.|$|E

50|$|Approach Rate is {{a number}} (from 0 to 10) that {{indicates}} how long the hit circles stay on the screen, {{from the moment they}} appear until the time that the <b>approach</b> <b>circles</b> zoom in on the hit <b>circles.</b> Higher <b>approach</b> rates mean that hit circles will be shown for a shorter period of time, giving players less time to react. Inversely, lower approach rates mean that the hit circles will be shown on the screen for a longer time, with the <b>approach</b> <b>circles</b> zooming in slowly. This gives players more time to react to each circle, but can result in an excessive number of circles on the screen if the AR is too low.|$|R

[...] The Learjet 23, operated by Executive Jet Aviation and registered as N434EJ, crashed into trees and caught fire short of the runway.

For example, the perimeter of a regular polygon inscribed in a <b>circle</b> <b>approaches</b> the circumference with increasing numbers of sides (and decrease in the length of one side). In geometric measure theory such a smooth curve as the circle that can be approximated by small straight segments with a definite limit is termed a rectifiable curve.|$|R
