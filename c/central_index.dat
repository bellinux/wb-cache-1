In Los Angeles County v. Humphries, Craig and Wendy Humphries fought to have their names removed from the CCACI after the courts had cleared them completely of abuse charges brought by a rebellious child. Because the state of California had no system in place for removing names that did not belong on the CCACI, the Court held that the CCACI violated the due process rights of those who had been falsely accused but could not get their names removed from the CCACI.|$|E
6000|$|This is by {{no means}} an {{impossible}} demand. The total population of the world is, on the most generous estimate, not more than 1,500,000,000, and the effectual indexing of this number of people, the record of their movement hither and thither, the entry of various material facts, such as marriage, parentage, criminal convictions and the like, the entry of the new-born and the elimination of the dead, colossal task though it would be, is still not so great as to be immeasurably beyond comparison with the work of the post-offices in the world of to-day, or the cataloguing of such libraries as that of the British Museum, or such collections as that of the insects in Cromwell Road. Such an index could be housed quite comfortably on one side of Northumberland Avenue, for example. It is only a reasonable tribute to the distinctive lucidity of the French mind to suppose the <b>central</b> <b>index</b> housed in a vast series of buildings at or near Paris. The index would be classified primarily by some unchanging physical characteristic, such as we are told the thumb-mark and finger-mark afford, and to these would be added any other physical traits that were of material value. The classification of thumb-marks and of inalterable physical characteristics goes on steadily, and there is every reason for assuming it possible that each human being could be given a distinct formula, a number or [...] "scientific name," [...] under which he or she could be docketed. [Footnote: It is quite possible that the actual thumb-mark may play only a small part in the work of identification, but it is an obvious convenience to our thread of story to assume that it is the one sufficient feature.] About the buildings in which this great main index would be gathered, would be a system of other indices with cross references to the main one, arranged under names, under professional qualifications, under diseases, crimes and the like.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—Increased aortic {{stiffness}} (measured by carotid–femoral {{pulse wave}} velocity) and <b>central</b> augmentation <b>index</b> {{have been shown}} to independently predict cardiovascular events, including stroke. We studied whether pulse wave velocity and <b>central</b> augmentation <b>index</b> predict functional outcome after ischemic stroke. Methods—In a prospective study, we enrolled 99 patients with acute ischemic stroke (age 63. 712. 4 years, admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 6. 66. 6, meanSD). Carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity and <b>central</b> augmentation <b>index</b> (SphygmoCor) were measured 1 week after stroke onset. Functional outcome was evaluated 90 days after stroke using the modified Rankin Scale with modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 considered an excellent outcome. Results—In univariate analysis, low carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (P 0. 000001) and low <b>central</b> augmentation <b>index</b> (P 0. 028) were significantly associated with excellent stroke outcome. Age, severity of stroke, presence of previous stroke, diabetes, heart rate, and peripheral pressures also predicted stroke functional outcome. In multivariate analysis, the predictive value of carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (9. 4 m/s) remained significant (OR, 0. 21; 95 % CI, 0. 06 – 0. 79; P 0. 02) after adjustment for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission, and presence of previous stroke. By contrast, <b>central</b> augmentation <b>index</b> had no significant predictive value after adjustment. Conclusions—This study indicates that aortic stiffness is an independent predictor of functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. (Stroke. 2012; 43 : 00 - 00. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on FORS 2 -VLT long-slit spectroscopy, the {{analysis}} of the <b>central</b> absorption line <b>indices</b> of 9 S 0 galaxies in the Fornax Cluster is presented. <b>Central</b> <b>indices</b> correlate with <b>central</b> velocity dispersions (σ 0) as observed in ellipticals (E). However, the stellar population properties of these S 0 s indicates that the observed trends are produced by relative differences in age and α-element abundances and not in metallicity ([Fe/H]) as previous studies have found in E galaxies. The observed scatter in the line indices versus σ 0 relations can be partially explained by the rotationally-supported nature of many of these systems. The presence of tighter line indices vs. maximum (circular) rotational velocity (VMAX) relations confirms this statement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The annual {{death rate}} of {{patients}} with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is high (3 %). Many deaths of children are sudden and unexplained. Sleep apneas have been suggested {{to play a role}} in sudden deaths. Recently, we discovered that 60 % {{of patients with}} PWS suffer from central adrenal insufficiency (CAI) during stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the relationship between CAI and sleep-related breathing disorders. DESIGN: In 20 children with PWS who underwent a metyrapone test (30 mg/kg at 2330 h), sleep-related breathing was evaluated by polysomnography before the metyrapone test. In addition, we recorded sleep-related breathing in 10 children with PWS during their metyrapone test. CAI was diagnosed when ACTH levels during the metyrapone test were below 33 pmol/liter at 0730 h. All tests were performed during healthy condition. Setting: The study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit and specialized sleep center. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) age was 8. 4 yr (6. 5 - 10. 2). After metyrapone administration, median (interquartile range) <b>central</b> apnea <b>index</b> (number/hour) increased significantly from 2. 2 (0. 4 - 4. 7) to 5. 2 (1. 5 - 7. 9) (P = 0. 007). The increase tended to be higher in children with CAI [2. 8 (2. 0 - 3. 9) vs. 1. 0 (- 0. 2 to 2. 6); P = 0. 09]. During polysomnography before the metyrapone test, sleep-related breathing was worse in children with CAI, who had a significantly higher <b>central</b> apnea <b>index</b> and tended to have a lower minimum oxygen saturation compared to those without CAI (P = 0. 03 and P = 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: In children with PWS, the <b>central</b> apnea <b>index</b> increased significantly after metyrapone administration, particularly in those with CAI during stress. In addition, children with CAI had a higher <b>central</b> apnea <b>index</b> compared to those without several months before the metyrapone test...|$|R
