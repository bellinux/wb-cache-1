6000|$|The last {{occasion}} {{on which}} I saw the pampa grass in its full beauty {{was at the}} close of a bright day in March, ending in one of those perfect sunsets seen only in the wilderness, where no lines of house or hedge mar the enchanting disorder of nature, and the earth and sky tints are in harmony. I had been travelling all day with one companion, and for two hours we had ridden through the matchless grass, which spread away for miles on every side, the myriads of white spears, touched with varied <b>colour,</b> <b>blending</b> in the distance and appearing almost like the surface of a cloud. Hearing a swishing sound behind us, we turned sharply round, and saw, not forty yards away in our rear, a party of five mounted Indians, coming swiftly towards us: but at the very moment we saw them their animals came to a dead halt, and at the same instant the five riders leaped up, and stood erect on their horses' backs. Satisfied that they had no intention of attacking us, and were only looking out for strayed horses, we continued watching them for some time, as they stood gazing away over the plain in different directions, motionless and silent, like bronze men on strange horse-shaped pedestals of dark stone; so dark in their copper skins and long black hair, against the far-off ethereal sky, flushed with amber light; and at their feet, and all around, the cloud of white and faintly-blushing plumes. That farewell scene was printed very vividly on my memory, but cannot be shown to another, nor could it be even if a Ruskin's pen or a Turner's pencil were mine; for the flight of the sea-mew is not more impossible to us than the power to picture forth the image of Nature in our souls, when she reveals herself in one of those [...] "special moments" [...] which have [...] "special grace" [...] in situations where her wild beauty has never been spoiled by man.|$|E

50|$|The {{nomenclature}} of begonias can be {{very complex}} and confusing. The term 'picotee' refers to an edging on the petals that {{is in contrast to}} the colour of the main petal, if the <b>colours</b> <b>blend.</b> If they do not, then the term 'marginata' is used, but sometimes these terms are used simultaneously. 'Non-Stop' refers to a camellia tuberous hybrid that under certain conditions will bloom 'non-stop' all year round.|$|R

50|$|ArtRage {{offers a}} {{realistic}} <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> option {{as well as}} standard digital RGB based blending. It is turned off by default as it is memory intensive but can be turned on from the Tools menu. The most noticeable effect is that green is produced when yellow and blue are mixed.|$|E
50|$|ArtRage is {{designed}} to be as realistic as possible. This includes varying thickness and textures of media and canvas, the ability to mix media, and a realistic <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> option as well as the standard digital RGB blending. It includes a wide array of real life tools, as well as Stencils, scrap layers to use as scrap paper or mixing palettes and the option to integrate reference or tracing images. The later versions (Studio, Studio Pro and ArtRage 4) include more standard digital tools, such as Select, Transform, Cloner, Symmetry, Fill and custom brushes ("Sticker").|$|E
50|$|The {{light at}} the back of the {{raindrop}} does not undergo total internal reflection, and some light does emerge from the back. However, light coming out the back of the raindrop does not create a rainbow between the observer and the sun because spectra emitted from the back of the raindrop do not have a maximum of intensity, as the other visible rainbows do, and thus the <b>colours</b> <b>blend</b> together rather than forming a rainbow.|$|R

Yellow head and body with black and white feathers, red markings on end of body, its <b>colour</b> <b>blends</b> well in the bush. They have a distinct trill.|$|R
60|$|I {{should not}} have quoted the {{following}} case had not the author of 'Des Jacinthes' (11/107. Amsterdam 1768 page 124.) impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive knowledge, but of his truthfulness: he says that bulbs of blue and red hyacinths may be cut in two, {{and that they will}} grow together and throw up a united stem (and this I have myself seen) with flowers of the two colours on the opposite sides. But the remarkable point is, that flowers are sometimes produced with the two <b>colours</b> <b>blended</b> together, which makes the case closely analogous with that of the <b>blended</b> <b>colours</b> of the grapes on the united vine branches.|$|R
50|$|C'rizz first {{appears in}} the play The Creed of the Kromon (2004), encountering the Doctor and Charley when they entered the Eutermes zone on Bortresoye. The Doctor had been exiled to Bortresoye's {{universe}} from his own, and had also been deprived of his TARDIS. In addition, a sinister entity known as the Kro'ka has been sending the Doctor and Charley across the various zones that Bortresoye was divided into for reasons that, at the time, were still unexplained. The Eutermesans are a race of reptilian humanoids, exoskeletal, with vestigial bone structures on their heads. They also {{have the ability to}} change their skin <b>colour,</b> <b>blending,</b> like chameleons, with their surroundings. The Eutermesans are the slave force of another race, the termite-like Kromon, and are mostly farmers.|$|E
50|$|Halicampus {{species are}} mainly found in shallow {{tropical}} or subtropical {{waters of the}} Pacific, Indian and South-east Atlantic Oceans. When fully grown they vary from 50 to 200 mm in length. They are generally secretive and often well camouflaged so although quite rarely seen; some species may be quite common. Halicampus zavorensis, for example, is known only from three specimens from the North-west Indian ocean {{but it is not}} known if this reflects rarity or is the result of behaviour (e.g. swimming into clumps of weed when threatened), mimesis (e.g. shape resembling some algae) or crypsis (e.g. mottled and banded brown <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> into the background). Adults are usually found in less than 100m of water, but juveniles are pelagic and may be found deeper than this.|$|E
50|$|Direct3D is a {{graphics}} {{application programming interface}} (API) for Microsoft Windows. Part of DirectX, Direct3D is used {{to render}} three-dimensional graphics in applications where performance is important, such as games. Direct3D uses hardware acceleration if it {{is available on the}} graphics card, allowing for hardware acceleration of the entire 3D rendering pipeline or even only partial acceleration. Direct3D exposes the advanced graphics capabilities of 3D graphics hardware, including Z-buffering, W-buffering, stencil buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, alpha blending, <b>colour</b> <b>blending,</b> mipmapping, texture blending, clipping, culling, atmospheric effects, perspective-correct texture mapping, programmable HLSL shaders and effects. Integration with other DirectX technologies enables Direct3D to deliver such features as video mapping, hardware 3D rendering in 2D overlay planes, and even sprites, providing the use of 2D and 3D graphics in interactive media ties.|$|E
50|$|Tartan is {{made with}} {{alternating}} bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both warp and weft {{at right angles to}} each other. The weft is woven in a simple twill, two over—two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new <b>colours</b> <b>blended</b> from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a sett.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 26 mm. The forewings are rather shining, white, with a smoky greyish fuscous suffusion along the dorsal half, dilated upward {{to the apex}} and mottled throughout with a darker shade of the same colour. This darker mottling is reproduced on the whiter costal half in a costal spot at one-third, almost connected obliquely by a paler shade to the upper edge of the cell, in a paler, outwardly oblique, shade {{from the middle of}} the costa to the upper angle of the cell, and in another costal spot a little beyond it, on the outer side of which some white scaling is continued in an outwardly curved line through the fuscous suffusion to the tornus. There is no clear definition of the suffused portion of the wing, the white ground <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> with it and to some extent contributing to its mottled appearance. The hindwings are pale brownish fuscous.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Karelina left Lucinda Ellery {{to set up}} Tatiana Hair Extensions {{from her}} 1-bedroom house in Barnet. Over {{the next few years}} she built her {{reputation}} as one of the UK's premier hair extensionist by combining the micro ring attachment technique and high quality Russian hair together with her approach to <b>colour</b> <b>blending.</b> But it was on the back of a 2008 British Broadcasting company (BBC Three) documentary Jamelia: Whose Hair Is It Anyway? that she rose to prominence. [...] Following the BBC documentary at the height of the financial crisis she opened her first salon in Kensington. Her second salon quickly followed, with Manchester opening in 2010. In 2011, Sky UK’s Moscow correspondent, Amanda Walker accompanied Karelina to film a new piece on the hair extension industry in Russia. In 2015, the company rebranded from Tatiana Hair Extensions to Tatiana Karelina as a precursor for their expansion into the United States. On 1 August 2017 Tatiana Karelina will open a new salon in West Hollywood.|$|E
5000|$|A small [...] shy greyish-brown bird, the redthroat is {{most often}} seen swiftly darting through low {{branches}} and shrubs or hopping mouse-like on the ground. Only adult males have the distinctive small rusty brown throat patch which gives the species its namesake. Which makes the identification of females and juveniles more difficult. The {{upper part of the}} head, body, wings, and tail are a dark-brownish grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail is dark-brownish grey with prominent white patches on the tips of the outer tail feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. May be confused with the some thornbill species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat. Unlikely to be mistaken for fieldwrens or heathwrens, which have a more strongly upturned tail at rest.|$|E
50|$|With the enmeshed <b>colour</b> <b>blend</b> of the {{accordion}} and strings, and the consistent high-energy pulsation and repetitions, this piece {{is given a}} fresh modern sound. It is written in a ¾ waltz tempo, which {{is typical of the}} music for the dance-hall or cabaret. It also employs traditional harmonies and melodies. Reflecting on the composer’s musical heritage, {{as well as on the}} Italo-Slovene weddings and banquets of his childhood, this work is one of nostalgia. Concerning the title, Mozetich felt that it instinctively corresponded to the piece, though he had no intention in mind.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13.5 mm. The forewings are brownish ochreous along the costal half and tawny-brown along the dorsal half, without any dividing line, the two <b>colours</b> <b>blending</b> beyond the middle. There {{is a dark}} chocolate-brown shade from the costa at the base, which curves downwards and outwards, ending in a conspicuous dash along the lower edge of the cell before the middle, its upper edge narrowly margined with whitish throughout, a minute dot of the same dark colour at the lower angle of the cell. The whole wing is suffused with a rich vinous gloss. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|In {{a drawing}} or painting, the dots {{are made of}} pigment of a single colour, applied with a pen or brush; the denser the dots, the darker the {{apparent}} shade—or lighter, if the pigment is lighter than the surface. This is similar to—but distinct from—pointillism, which uses dots of different <b>colours</b> to simulate <b>blended</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of 3 D reconstruction, we present a static multi-texturing system {{yielding}} a seamless texture atlas calculated by combining the colour information from several photos from the same subject covering most of its surface. These pictures can be provided by shooting just one camera several times when reconstructing a static object, or a set of synchronized cameras, when dealing with a human or any other moving object. We suppress the colour seams due to image misalignments and irregular lighting conditions that multi-texturing approaches typically suffer from, while minimizing the blurring effect introduced by <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> techniques. Our system is robust enough {{to compensate for the}} almost inevitable inaccuracies of 3 D meshes obtained with visual hull–based techniques: errors in silhouette segmentation, inherently bad handling of concavities, etc...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} design {{technique}} for colours that lower the energy {{consumption of the}} display device. Our approach relies on a screen space variant energy model. Guided by perceptual principles, we present three variations of our approach for finding low energy, distinguishable, iso-lightness colours. The first {{is based on a}} set of discrete user-named (categorical) colours, which are ordered according to energy consumption. The second optimizes for colours in the continuous CIELAB colour space. The third is hybrid, optimizing for colours in select CIELAB colour subspaces that are associated with colour names. We quantitatively compare our colours with a traditional choice of colours, demonstrating that approximately 45 percent of the display energy is saved. The colour sets are applied to 2 D visualization of nominal data and volume rendering of 3 D scalar fields. A new <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> method for volume rendering which preserves hues further improves colour distinguishability...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{technological}} advances in the last ten years, which has resulted in the amount of data generated in organisations increasing by more than 200 % during this period. This rapid increase in data means that if financial institutions are to derive significant value from this data, they need to identify new ways to analyse this data effectively. Due to the considerable size of the data, financial institutions also need to consider how to effectively visualise the data. Traditional tools such as relational database management systems have problems processing large amounts of data due to memory constraints, latency issues and the presence of both structured and unstructured data The aim of this research was to use data analysis and information visualisation techniques (IV) to support the effective analysis of large financial data sets. In order to visually analyse the data effectively, the underlying data model must produce results that are reliable. A large financial data set was identified, and used to demonstrate that IV techniques can be used to support the effective analysis of large financial data sets. A review of the literature on large financial data sets, visual analytics, existing data management and data visualisation tools identified the shortcomings of existing tools. This resulted in the determination of the requirements for the data management tool, and the IV tool. The data management tool identified was a data warehouse and the IV toolkit identified was Tableau. The IV techniques identified included the Overview, Dashboards and <b>Colour</b> <b>Blending.</b> The IV tool was implemented and published online and can be accessed through a web browser interface. The data warehouse and the IV tool were evaluated to determine their accuracy and effectiveness in supporting the effective analysis of the large financial data set. The experiment used to evaluate the data warehouse yielded positive results, showing that only about 4 % of the records had incorrect data. The results of the user study were positive and no major usability issues were identified. The participants found the IV techniques effective for analysing the large financial data set...|$|E

There {{is at least}} one {{literary}} model to illustrate the perfect sense of smell: that of the perfumer and murderer Jean Baptiste Grenouille in Patrick Süsskind's world-famous novel Perfume. But I know of no-one in the arts and sciences that has thought of applying this gift to vision. Peter Dreher has the gift of [...] "perfect vision". His ability to fragment <b>colours,</b> their <b>blends</b> and nuances, make him an astounding master of illusionism. In this domain Peter Dreher, a pupil of Karl Hubbuch and Erich Heckel, is a phenomenal talent. Conversations with him about his painting often contain combinations of verbs and nouns which are immediately comprehensible, but which would not normally be used. If a <b>colour</b> <b>blend</b> has been unsuccessful, he may remark that [...] "this red doesn't resonate". Peter Dreher is a synaesthetic; he hears colours, and searches for their absolute coherency and harmony. Seeing is not pure mechanistic reproduction, but a highly complex cognitive process. What, then, constitutes the difference between perfect and normal vision? Putting it simply, one could call it the capacity for extremely sensitive fragmentation. Someone with perfect vision can analyse what he sees into its component parts and reconstitute these into the shade he has in mind without having to test, compare or correct it. What distinguishes him from those with [...] "normal vision" [...] is his blind assurance." ...|$|R
