The motor shaft included integrally cut gear teeth forming a pinion that meshes {{with a larger}} adjacent driven gear to provide a gear reduction ratio of 3.75:1. This permitted {{the use of a}} higher-speed, lower-current, lighter and more compact motor assembly while increasing <b>cranking</b> <b>torque.</b> Variants of this starter design were used on most rear- and four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Chrysler Corporation from 1962 through 1987. It makes a unique, distinct sound when cranking the engine, which led to it being nicknamed the [...] "Highland Park Hummingbird"—a reference to Chrysler's headquarters in Highland Park, Michigan.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{electromagnetic}} design of a synchronous machine suited for a belt-driven alternator and starter (BAS) in a micro hybridisation of a mid-size passenger car. The BAS needs to provide a high <b>cranking</b> <b>torque</b> to start the combustion engine, especially in a cool condition where the requirements are highest. Besides the high <b>cranking</b> <b>torque</b> it is desirable to have high power performance over a wide speed range. This thesis compares four potential excitations of a synchronous machine: the permanently magnetised (PMSM), the electrically magnetised (EMSM), the EMSM with series magnetisation (SMSM), and the hybrid magnetised (HMSM). These are treated both theoretically and with numerical analyses, where the numerical calculations use finite element analyses (FEA). The fundamental boundary conditions, as current density set by thermal limitations, {{are based on a}} deep analysis of an existing Lundell alternator. This is presented with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and finite volume analysis (FVA) in order to explain the heat dissipation of the alternator. A complete loss separation of the alternator is discussed and presented, both by calculations and experimental work. The SMSM is a new configuration of an electrically excited synchronous machine with the field winding in series with the phase windings via a rectifier. This thesis shows the relationship between the magnetical and the electrical connection to the stator and the rotor. The power and torque characteristics are highlighted. This thesis presents an electromagnetic design and experimental evaluation of a compact HMSM. A relatively simple and compact slip ringless rotor with EM and PM excitation is proposed, analysed and tested. A series of 3 D FE dynamic computations are made in order to estimate efficiency at different operation points and with different types of rotor core materials: solid iron and powder composite core. A rotor with the solid iron core is built and tested, including different aspects of torque and power loss production...|$|E

In the first stage, leg dimensions are optimized with respect to three design objectives: minimize (i) leg size, (ii) vertical actuating force, and (iii) peak <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> for an entire walking cycle. Following the optimization of leg dimensions, in the second stage, spring elements with various placement configurations are considered for further reduction of the actuating force and <b>crank</b> <b>torque.</b> Several tradeoff solutions are obtained and a comparison between variously spring configurations is made.

This study examined whether relatively stiffer cyclists were more effective at sprinting under fatigued conditions, as occurs during endurance cycling competitions. METHODS: MA stiffness of the quadriceps was assessed in 21 trained male cyclists (28. 7 ± 9. 5 yr, 1. 74 ± 0. 08 m, 67. 5 ± 7. 2 kg). Participants also performed a maximal 6 -s sprint on a cycle ergometer to assess peak power output (POpeak), peak <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> (CTpeak), and peak rate of <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> development (RCTDpeak).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relationships between heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO 2) and mechanical Peak <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> (PCT) and Average <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> (ACT 60) variables in response to submaximal exercise employing a cycling race ergometer (RE), treadmill cycling (TC) and cycling in the field (FC). The work intensities identified as sub LT, LT and supra LT were equated on the basis of HR. Voltage signals from the crank arm were recorded as FM signals for subsequent representation of peak crank force (PCT) and average <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> (ACT 60). Field VO 2 measures were done by Douglas bag procedure while an open circuit method was used for all laboratory testing. Heart rates were recorded with a Polar Electro Sport Tester PE 3000. The observed results of field cycling demonstrated that laboratory conditions would overestimate the oxygen consumption in the field while force measurements suggested that laboratory conditions would underestimate mechanical work expenditures in the field. These differences become reduced at work intensities approximating VO 2 max. It was concluded that HR can not always be used as an indicator of work stress when attempting to equate similar work loads performed under different conditions. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Cyclists seek to {{maximize}} performance duringcompetition, and gross efficiency {{is an important}} factor affectingperformance. Gross efficiency is itself affected by pedal rate. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} factors that affect freely chosen pedal rate. Crank inertial load varies greatly during road cycling based on the selected gear ratio. Nevertheless, the possible influence of crank inertial load on freely chosen pedal rate and gross efficiency has never been investigated. This study tested the hypotheses that during cycling with sub-maximal work rates, a considerable increase in crank inertial load would cause (1) freely chosen pedal rate to increase, and as a consequence, (2) gross efficiency to decrease. Furthermore, that it would cause (3) peak <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> to increase if a constant pedal rate was maintained. Subjects cycled on a treadmill at 150 and 250 W, with low and high crank inertial load, and with preset and freely chosen pedal rate. Freely chosen pedal rate was higher at high compared with low crank inertial load. Notably, the change in crank inertial load affected the freely chosen pedal rate as much as did the 100 W increase in work rate. Alongwith freely chosen pedal rate being higher, gross efficiency at 250 W was lower during cycling with high compared with low crank inertial load. Peak <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> was higher during cycling at 90 rpm with high compared with low crank inertial load.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine both the freely chosen cadence (FCC) and the {{physical}} variables associated with cadence selection in non-cyclists. Eighteen participants pedalled at 40, 50, and 60 % of their maximal power output (determined by a maximal oxygen uptake test, Wmax), whilst cadence (50, 65, 80, 95, 110 rpm, and FCC) was manipulated. Gross efficiency, was used to analyse the most economical cadence whilst central and peripheral ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were used to measure the most comfortable cadence and the cadence whereby muscle strain was minimised. Peak (Tpeak), mean <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> (Tmean) and the <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> profile were analysed at 150 and 200 W at cadences of 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 rpm in order to determine the mechanical load. FCC was found to be approximately 80 rpm at all workloads and was significantly higher than the most economical cadence (50 rpm). At 60 % Wmax, RPE peripheral was minimised at 80 rpm which coincided with the FCC. Both Tpeak and Tmean decreased as cadence increased and, conversely, increased as power output increased. An analysis of the <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> profile showed that the crank angle at both the top (DPtop) and the bottom (DPbot) dead point of the crank cycle at 80 rpm occurred later in the cycling revolution when compared to 50 rpm. The findings suggested that the FCC in non-cyclists was more closely related to variables that minimise muscle strain and mechanical load than those associated with minimising metabolic economy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur aim was {{to compare}} an SRM® torque {{analysis}} system with a strain gauge instrumented pedals system for right and left peak <b>crank</b> <b>torque,</b> <b>crank</b> angle of peak torque and power output. Seven competitive cyclists performed an incremental test to exhaustion on a stationary cycle ergometer equipped with an SRM® torque analysis system and a strain gauge instrumented pedals system (SGI pedals). The SRM® torque analysis system measured net torque while the SGI pedals measured the normal and anterior-posterior force applied on the pedal surface. Forces on the pedal surface were resolved into forces on the cranks (tangential and radial). <b>Crank</b> <b>torque</b> {{was measured by the}} pedals using the tangential force on the cranks and crank length. Power output was calculated from <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> and angular velocity of the crank (calculated from pedalling cadence). All data were acquired between the 20 th and the 40 th seconds of each stage of the incremental test. Magnitudes of differences between outputs from the SGI pedals and the SRM® torque analysis system were assessed by effect sizes. Power output was higher for the SRM® torque analysis system than the SGI pedals. Peak torques were lower for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The angle of the right and left peak torque increased for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The SRM® torque analysis system overestimated power output, underestimated peak torque and increased the angle of peak torque compared to the SGI pedals. Where possible a strain gauge instrumented pedals system should be used to measure performance variables of cyclists rather than the SRM® torque analysis system...|$|R

Reducing internal work, <b>crank</b> peak <b>torque,</b> and time spent at the top and bottom dead centres (12 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions, respectively) were among the various targets of noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interface design. Changes in joint kinematics without effects on muscle activation were observed when cyclists were assessed using noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interfaces.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if inter-individual differences in <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> production and/or pedalling effectiveness influence the variations of muscular efficiency observed among subjects in cycling. Eleven subjects performed a 5 minutes steady state cycling at 160 Watts at 80 revolutions per minute. Gross (GE) and net (NE) muscular efficiency, angular impulses and pedalling effectiveness during the whole pedal revolution (IF 360) and during the downstroke phase (IE 180) were investigated. Angular impulses were not related to either VO 2 or the muscular efficiency. IE 360 was not correlated with either VO 2 or muscular efficiencies, while IE 180 was significantly negatively correlated with VO 2 (r(2) = 0. 51) and positively related with NE (r(2) = 0. 49). The inter-individual differences in <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> production, as investigated by angular impulse values, did not explain inter-individual differences in muscular efficiency. The lack of relationships between VO 2 or muscular efficiencies and IE 360 could be due to the fact that IE 360 is equally influenced by both low and high pedal forces produced during the upstroke and downstroke phases, respectively, while metabolic energy is mainly consumed during high pedal forces of the downstroke phase. Finally, when measured during the downstroke phase, inter-individual differences in pedalling effectiveness could partly be related to the variations of muscular efficiency observed among subjects in cycling. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors tested whether heavy {{strength}} training, including hip-flexion exercise, {{would reduce}} {{the extent of the}} phase in the crank revolution where negative or retarding <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> occurs. Negative torque normally occurs in the upstroke phase when the leg is lifted by flexing the hip. Eighteen well-trained cyclists either performed 12 wk of heavy strength training in addition to their usual endurance training (E+S; n = 10) or merely continued their usual endurance training during the intervention period (E; n = 8). The strength training consisted of 4 lower body exercises (3 x 4 - 10 repetition maximum) performed twice a week. E+S enhanced cycling performance by 7 %, which was more than in E (P -. 02). Performance was determined as average power output in a 5 -min all-out trial performed subsequent to 185 min of submaximal cycling. The performance enhancement, which has been reported previously, was here shown to be accompanied by improved pedaling efficacy during the all-out cycling. Thus, £+ 5 shortened the phase where negative <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> occurs by - 16 °, corresponding to - 14 %, which was more than in E (P =. 002).

There were no significant changes in TT time, power output, cardiorespiratory variables or <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> kinetics as a function of saddle angle (P> 0. 05).

Eighteen trained male cyclists (VO(2 peak) 60 +/- 1 ml kg(- 1) min(- 1)) were grouped into the weight training (WT n = 9) or the isokinetic training group (IT n = 9) matched for training background and sprint power (P (max)), assessed from five maximal sprints (5 s) on an isokinetic bicycle ergometer at cadences between 40 and 120 rpm. <b>Crank</b> <b>torque</b> was measured (1 kHz) to determine the torque distribution during pedaling. Endurance performance was evaluated by measuring power, heart rate and lactate during a graded exercise test to exhaustion and a 30 -min performance test. All tests were performed on subjects' individual race bicycle. Knee extension torque was evaluated isometrically at 115 degrees knee angle and dynamically at 200 degrees s(- 1) using an isokinetic dynamometer. P (max) at 40 rpm increased in both the groups (~ 15 %; P < 0. 05). At 120 rpm, no improvement of P (max) was found in the IT training group, which was possibly related to an observed change in <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> at high cadences (P < 0. 05).

Sixteen male endurance-trained cyclists completed a series of submaximal rides at 60 % maximal power (Wmax) at cadences of 50, 70, 90, and 110 r·min− 1, and their FCC to determine their preferred cadence, gross efficiency (GE), rating of perceived exertion, and <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> profile. Performance was measured via a 15 -min time trial, which was preloaded with a cycle at 60 % Wmax. Following the testing, the participants were randomly assigned to a high-cadence (HC) (20 % above FCC) or a low-cadence (LC) (20 % below FCC) group for 18 interval-based training sessions over 6 weeks. The HC group increased their FCC from 92 to 101 r·min− 1 after the intervention (p = 0. 01), whereas the LC group remained unchanged (93 r·min− 1). GE increased from 22. 7 % to 23. 6 % in the HC group at 90 r·min− 1 (p = 0. 05), from 20. 0 % to 20. 9 % at 110 r·min− 1 (p = 0. 05), and from 22. 8 % to 23. 2 % at their FCC. Both groups significantly increased their total distance and average power output following training, with the LC group recording a superior performance measure.

40|$|Design and {{optimization}} of planar leg mechanisms featuring symmetrical foot-point paths {{are presented}} in this study. These leg mechanisms are designed {{in such a way}} that a corresponding walking machine has the flexibility required for walking on a rough terrain, while it can achieve fast locomotion, is easy to control, and requires minimal actuation for walking on a flat ground. In addition, such leg mechanisms are compact in size with respect to a specified horizontal stride. Based on a set of functional requirements, the concept generation of a set of leg mechanisms is accomplished via a systematic methodology. By temporarily excluding the degree-of-freedom (DOF) associated with the up-and-down motion of the leg, and based on a set of evaluation criteria, six admissible one-DOF planar four-, six-, and eight-bar leg mechanisms are found to have the desirable features to be used as a leg mechanism. It is argued that a symmetrical foot-point path can be advantageous in reducing the maximum driving torque and making the motion control of the leg easier. While the four- and eight-bar compound mechanisms have been studied, a new class of six-bar linkages with an embedded (skew-) pantograph featuring a symmetrical foot-point path is introduced. Construction and design limitations for six-bar mechanisms are explored. The guidelines to prevent double point(s) are derived and the conditions to select between the propelling and non-propelling portions of the path are established. For the dimensional synthesis, the admissible mechanisms with and without an adjustable pivot are investigated. For those mechanisms with an adjustable pivot, one DOF is used for normal walking to provide an ovoid path which emulated that of humans, while the other (the motion of the adjustable pivot) is used only when necessary to walk over obstacles. For those mechanisms without an adjustable pivot, the sole DOF provides a large D- shaped path, with which the leg mechanisms are capable of performing the up-and-down as well as the back-and-forth motions, To exploit these to the fullest, a multi-objective optimization-based design problem formulation is developed to minimize the following three design objectives: (i) peak <b>crank</b> <b>torque,</b> (ii) maximum actuating force, and (iii) leg size. Results from the optimization model show that an eight-bar compound mechanism with an adjustable pivot and a six-bar mechanism without an adjustable pivot are the two best leg designs among those studied here. Finally, further reduction of the actuating force and <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> is successfully demonstrated by placing tension spring elements onto an already optimized eight-bar leg mechanism...|$|R

In this work a musculoskeletal model of a handcyclist is developed in the software AnyBody using kinematic data from a previous study of handcycling of one male elite handbiker (class: H 3. 2). The on- and offset timing of several muscles of the upper body (left and right of: m. pectoralis, m. deltoideus, m. biceps brachii and m. triceps brachii) were calculated with different thresholds and compared to results from surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements recorded during the previously mentioned subject study. It could be shown, that the mean overlap of muscle activation times was between a satisfying 64 % and 75 % depending on the threshold used. However, especially for m. deltoideus a very different on- offset behaviour was observed in the simulation than in the sEMG measurements resulting from the positioning of the electrodes in the subject study on one specific branch of the m. deltoideus and insufficient knowledge about the actual course of the <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> for this specific athlete.

Decreases in Symmetry Index were observed for average power output in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s patients as workload increased. Maximum power Symmetry Index showed a significant difference in symmetry between performance at both the 20 W and 60 W stage and the maximal resistance stage. Minimum power Symmetry Index did not show significant differences across the stages of the test. While lower extremity asymmetries were present in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s patients during pedaling, these asymmetries did not correlate to postural instability and gait dysfunction Unified Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease Rating Scale scores. This pedaling analysis allows for a more sensitive measure of lower extremity function than the Unified Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease Rating Scale and may help to provide unique insight into current and future lower extremity function...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} a new set of biomechanical parameters for performance assessment in laboratory sprint cycling. Two groups of seven cyclists, one at elite level, the other at regional level, performed sprint tests in seated and standing positions against 0. 8 N/kg resistive loads on the T 1670 Basic ergo-trainer (Tacx, Netherlands). A classic racing bicycle was equipped with an SRM Training System (Schoberer, Germany). Two sets of biomechanical parameters were defined: one “classical ” and one “new ” set of parameters. The relation between <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> and <b>crank</b> angle was carefully studied and a selection of characteristic criteria for assessing the cycling performance was proposed. In order to quantify the differences in the pedalling technique, new criteria were introduced, such as the time interval during which the instantaneous power exceeded 90 % of the maximal power output as a proportion of the pedal downstroke (RMPD 90). The results show 1) that the cyclo cross cyclists can generated high level of power output during sprint test (close to 18 W/kg) and 2) there is no significant difference between regional level and elite level concerning the set of biomechanical parameters classically employed. However, the new set of biomechanical parameters (RMPD 90) revealed differences between the pedalling characteristics of the elite level and regional level groups. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that the analysis of the sprint test performed with classical set of biomechanical parameters can be completed using the RMPD 90 as a supplementary fitness criterion...|$|R

Several {{components}} had design changes, longer rods (152 mm c-c, 7 mm longer), pistons {{with a lower}} compression height, lower friction bearings (smaller in size), a crankshaft with 8 counterweights (instead of 4 on the older Bxx engines) and a heavy harmonic balancer (aka damper) in the crank pulley. 1989 saw an upgrade to the crankshaft, with a relocated axial thrust bearing back to the number 5 journal, bigger main bearings, rods were enlarged to 13 mm from 9 mm in 1990. Also introduced in 1989 were 16 valve, twin-cam variants of the B200 and B230, dubbed the B204 and B234 respectively. The B204 was also available in turbo form in some markets (such as Italy) where large displacement motors were taxed heavily. It came in two versions: The B204GT turbo motor operates with a lead resistant lambda probe and generates approximately [...] The B204FT has a catalytic converter and generates [...] Both were the first redblocks standard equipped with oil squirters for piston cooling. Crankshaft, conrods and pistons all forged. Exhaust valves were sodium filled for cooler operation. It has smaller valves and stiffer valve springs than n/a 16V. <b>Crank</b> <b>torque</b> is 290 Nm at 2950 rpm for the GT, and 280 Nm for the FT. Other differences from the normal 16V redblock engine are that it uses a remote mounted oil filter (Away from block on exhaust side engine mount) and a windage tray.|$|R
40|$|The track sprint cyclist is {{a unique}} athlete, and uncharacteristic of any other sprint athlete, they perform a portion of submaximal work prior to sprinting in most events. The nature and {{implications}} of this submaximal work are not well understood {{and there has been}} little investigation in elite athlete populations. An inertial load ergometer was constructed to investigate this prior work and also to track the responses and progression of training and fatigue. This ergometer was shown to be both reliable (CV elite participants: peak power = 0. 7 % (90 % CI, 0. 5 - 1. 0), optimal cadence = 1. 6 % (90 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 7) and valid (CV elite male participants, peak power = 4. 6 %, 90 % CI 4. 0 - 5. 4 %, r = 0. 81). Smallest worthwhile changes in peak power (53 Watts) and optimal cadence (1. 4 RPM) were determined for this ergometer test. An opportunity to track and monitor a group of internationally successful track sprint cyclists through two pinnacle events allowed for {{a better understanding of the}} structure and consequence of their training. Application of a novel training stimulus using a counterweighted single legged modality at two contrasting cadences, in an attempt to confer a greater resistance to fatigue, also provided some interesting and unexpected results. It was found that the impact of the simulated prior work in the keirin on peak power was approximately 54 % of that in the sprint (keirin - 5. 68 %, ES = 0. 23, sprint - 10. 52 %, ES = 0. 44) while optimal cadence only dropped 60 % as much in the keirin (ES = 0. 61) compared to the sprint (ES = 0. 86). The duration and intensity of this prior work was determined to be responsible for the magnitude of degradation in peak power and optimal cadence. Importantly it can be interpreted that the change in optimal cadence reflects the net result of intrinsic muscle changes and optimisation to output the highest power capable. Single legged ergometer training at contrasting training cadences (70 and 130 rpm) appeared to have positive impacts on T 0 (maximal torque) identified during inertial testing and on mean <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> during longer duration testing (30 s), but not resistance to fatigue. The effect likely related to changes in muscle coordination as a result of the training stimulus. The improvements in T 0 appear to be greater in elite male athletes following the higher training cadence. It is likely this improvement in <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> through these race specific ranges will enhance the athlete?s ability to accelerate. In summary, inertial ergometry is a reliable, valid and useful tool for assessing change over time in the track sprint cyclist. Understanding and management of acute and chronic fatigue and determining the appropriateness of the training stimulus are important in achieving the greatest impact on performance. Improving resistance to fatigue will potentially have a concomitant (negative) impact on optimal cadence which is contradictory to what has been hypothesised in the literature with respect to optimising performance. The nature of the relationship that optimal cadence has to performance is questioned as it would appear that optimal cadence is the net result of intrinsic optimisation of muscle properties to achieve a maximal power output (either peak or for a given duration) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{developed}} a comprehensive full-body three dimensional kinematic model and then determined {{the effects of}} workload, Upper Body Posture, and Saddle Setback on the leg, trunk, and arm kinematics of the cyclist. Competitive cycling has an extremely high aerobic component, and yet ironically {{there have been few}} studies investigating how workload or riding position affect lower limb blood flow haemodynamics. By using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy a cycling specific technique was developed to enable tissue oxygenation status of the lower limbs to be determined during cycling, which was then used to assess the effects of workload, trunk and hip angle, and saddle set-back on lower limb blood flow haemodynamics. It is unclear to what extent saddle setback affects lower limb and trunk muscle activity and cycling performance, and yet the sub-disciplines of cycling use markedly different bicycle set-ups. By using a custom cycle ergometer developed by the author this Thesis systematically assessed the effects of saddle setback on muscle recruitment and activation magnitude. When investigating the effects of bicycle set-up on cycling performance {{it is important to consider}} all the physiological and biomechanical determinants of success in unison, and how they inter-relate. To date there are no studies that have comprehensively studied the kinematic, haemodynamic, electromyographic, and associated crank kinetics simultaneously. As such this Thesis {{developed a}} methodology to evaluate the effects of changing workload, upper body posture, and saddle setback on full-body three-dimensional kinematics, lower limb blood flow haemodynamics, leg and trunk electromyography, and <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> profiles, in order to arrive at the optimum riding position and highlight that compromises required when aiming to maximise cycling performance.

40|$|Optimising body {{position}} on the bicycle may improve performance and reduce overuse injury risk. However, effectiveness of bicycle configuration in preventing overuse injuries is unknown as methods to assess {{body position}} on the bicycle (usually via static assessment) lack accuracy and are limited to road cyclists. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) assess validity and reliability of methods for determining body position (kinematics) and pedalling kinetics in cycling; and 2) to analyse effects from changes in saddle height and horizontal position on pedalling kinetics and kinematics of cyclists and triathletes. Pedal force effectiveness, <b>crank</b> <b>torque,</b> joint angles and joint mechanical work during cycling on an ergometer were measured for recreational and competitive road cyclists and competitive triathletes, with and without lower limb pain, in five experimental studies. Analysis of static 6 o’clock crank position was not valid therefore body {{position on the}} bicycle should be measured using video from cycling motion. Instrumented pedals {{should be used for}} pedalling kinetics assessment as bilateral asymmetry was underestimated using the SRM® torque analysis system. Reliability of pedal forces from instrumented pedals computed seven days apart was high. Technique training using feedback from instrumented pedal forces at training workloads and high pedalling cadence improved power output. Using improved knee joint modelling, cyclists with and without pain had similar adaptations to changes in saddle height. Saddle height changes of 5 % of the self-selected preferred saddle height did not result in substantial changes in pedalling kinetics. Moving forward or backward on the saddle affected joint mechanical work but not knee joint forces. Saddle position changed pedalling technique similarly in cyclists and triathletes. To optimise cyclists and triathletes body position on the bicycle and their technique, instrumented pedals should be used to assess pedalling kinetics and video analysis should be used to assess kinematics...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry (FES-LCE) {{has been}} shown to provide therapeutic benefits for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its 2 ̆ 2 one-size-fits-all 2 ̆ 2 design is faced with a number of shortcomings. Purpose. To study strategies to improve FES-LCE exercise for individuals with SCI. Specific aims were to (1) compare pedaling dynamics of persons with SCI with able-bodied individuals; (2) identify stimulation patterns that minimize individual muscle force requirements; (3) measure force contribution of thigh and shank muscles involved in pedaling at different stimulation intensities and crank positions; and (4) develop, test, and compare a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model as a predictor of thigh muscle strength sufficient for FES-LCE with other well-known statistical methods. Methodology. Six male SCI subjects between ages 20 [...] 54 years (mean 32 ± 12 years) participated in FES-LCE. Twelve able-bodied subjects between ages 18 [...] 50 years (mean 27 ± 12 years) participated in LCE without FES. Subjects performed variable resistance leg cycling at a relatively constant cadence of 50 revolutions per minute. Motion capture system recorded joint kinematics of hip, knee, ankle, pedal, and crank. Orthogonal pedal forces were recorded using a piezoelectric force sensor. Surface electromyography (EMG) was measured electrical activity of shank (gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior) and thigh (hamstrings, quadriceps, and gluteus maximus) muscles in able-bodied subjects. PAC model was developed to identify thigh muscle strengths associated with FES-LCE performance. Results. EMG activities were different from the FES-LCE stimulation scheme. Comparisons in joint kinematics between able-bodied and SCI subjects showed dissimilar ankle motions at flywheel resistances greater than zero. Stimulation of quadriceps in SCI subjects produced greatest net positive <b>crank</b> <b>torque</b> across fixed <b>crank</b> positions and stimulation intensities (27. 8 Nm) and gluteus maximus produced smallest (1. 9 Nm).
