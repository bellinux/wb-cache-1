5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of <b>control</b> <b>has</b> led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth <b>control</b> <b>has</b> been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E

5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological <b>control</b> <b>has</b> had limited success, so most preventative methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals.

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth <b>control</b> <b>has</b> been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest <b>control</b> <b>has</b> received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Our study aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of other treatment methods for burn related scarring and to determine the possibility of their routine administration in similar clinical settings. Methods: Through a prospective study, 66 patients were enrolled to receive either the conventional pressure garment therapy (PGT) and Silicone (control group) or exercise and physiotherapy (case group). Patients were visited regularly to be examined for the status of their scars' regression, limbs' dysfunction, and joint motion. Then, these two groups were compared to determine the efficacy of exercise and physiotherapy {{as an alternative to}} the conventional treatment with PGT. Results: After about 20 months follow-up, decreased articular range of motion (ROM) was: 16 (51. 5 %) cases compared to 5 (15 %) of <b>controls</b> <b>had</b> mild, 11 (35. 5 %) of the cases compared to 13 (39. 5 %) of the <b>controls</b> <b>had</b> moderate; and 4 (13 %) of the cases compared to 15 (45. 5 %) of the <b>controls</b> <b>had</b> severe decreased ROM which revealed statistically significant difference (P< 0. 01).
