5|$|After sending Stewie out {{for more}} paper, Paul finds several news {{articles}} in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a serial killer. Just then, the local sheriff (Joe) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun. The sheriff then complains that he will now {{have to spend the}} rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 1905, {{before the}} start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart was {{suspended}} from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals. A big man with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.|$|E
5|$|Zoe {{is found}} not guilty of Sarah's murder, due to the court believing Sarah {{committed}} suicide. After Lydia catches Mike kissing Zoe, she goes to Amy and tells her what she saw, and tells her she believes Zoe {{is trying to get}} Mike on her side {{to make it look like}} she is innocent. Lydia expresses her doubts with Mike, still trying to blame Zoe for Sarah's death. However, after realising she <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get Zoe on her side, she pleads with her to forgive her and move into the Barnes family home. An angry Zoe throws her out. Zoe then approaches Lydia and apologises. The pair slowly become friends. However, Zoe is only pretending in order to get a confession. Lydia and Zoe kiss as part of Zoe's plan to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Mike throws Zoe out of the flat.|$|E

5|$|Headley's {{success for}} Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and {{commentators}} began {{to discuss his}} availability for the 1954 series against England. A public subscription to finance his travel to Jamaica, opened by the Daily Gleaner, raised over £1,000, and despite his reservations, Headley returned to Jamaica. Playing in a fund-raising match, he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC, a short ball from Fred Trueman struck Headley's arm. The latter injury {{kept him out of}} the first-class match between Jamaica and the MCC, but he played in the second where, although hampered by his injury, he scored 53 not out. The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test. Reaction among critics was mixed, and Headley, nearing his 45th birthday, remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies. Headley batted at number six, and it appeared that England, under the captaincy of Len Hutton, let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings, which Hutton later confirmed to be the case. However, Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting {{at the beginning of the}} next over, so that England <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get him out before he settled down.|$|E
5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{go back to work}} and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E

Haig was explaining what he and Nixon’s staff thought were Nixon’s only options. He <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try and settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon’s staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.|$|E
500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

500|$|A 2007 report {{concluded}} that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind {{as the largest}} potential source of renewable energy. Scotland's forests, which made up 60% of the UK resource base, were forecast {{to be able to}} provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up {{report concluded}} that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." [...] A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy. £6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had [...] "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." [...] A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems. These boilers might be cheaper to run and, by using locally produced wood fuel, <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be as carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation.|$|E

The banks <b>could</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> collect on the collateral (land), but due to reduced real estate values, this would not pay off the loan.

At a meeting in October 1907, SBTA President Kirby suggested that the AFL charter the SBTA, just as it would any central labor body. The idea was an old one. [...] In 1903, AFL vice president John P. Frey had advocated that the AFL create an organization that would enable the federation to coordinate the jurisdictions, work assignments, wages, work rules and other aspects of work of its construction unions. Gompers had resisted such suggestions for several years, but Kirby's idea now seemed timely. Building and construction trade unions made up 20 percent of the AFL's membership, and Gompers could not afford to alienate them.|$|E
