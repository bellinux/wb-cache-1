40|$|<b>Chaff</b> is {{currently}} authorized {{for use in}} the existing airspace and under the Proposed Action, training <b>chaff</b> would continue to be employed in the airspace. The <b>chaff</b> used during training consists of extremely small strands (or dipoles) of an aluminum-coated crystalline silica core. When released from an aircraft, <b>chaff</b> initially forms a sphere, then disperses in the air and eventually drifts to the ground. The <b>chaff</b> effectively reflects radar signals in various bands (depending on the length of the <b>chaff</b> fibers) and forms a very large image or electronic “cloud” of reflected signals on a radar screen. When the aircraft is obscured from radar detection by the cloud, the aircraft can safely maneuver or leave an area. <b>Chaff</b> is made as small and light as possible so that it will remain in the air long enough to confuse enemy radar. The <b>chaff</b> fibers are approximately the thickness of a human hair (i. e., generally 25. 4 microns in diameter), and range in length from 0. 3 to over 1 inch. The weight of <b>chaff</b> material in the RR- 170 or RR- 188 shaft cartridge is approximately 95 grams or 3. 35 ounces (Air Force 1997). Since <b>chaff</b> can obstruct radar, its use is coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

40|$|Air Combat Command (ACC) on the {{environmental}} effects of using self-protection <b>chaff</b> and flares in military aircraft training. <b>Chaff</b> and flares are defensive mechanisms employed from military aircraft to avoid adversary air defense systems. <b>Chaff</b> are fibers that reflect or mask radar signals, and flares are high temperature heat sources that decoy heat seeking missiles. (Illumination and signaling flares {{are not included in}} this study.) The objective {{of the study was to}} identify and document environmental, health, and safety effects associated with <b>chaff</b> and flare use. For potential effects that were identified, this report provides guidelines that can be used by ACC units to assess potential impacts and develop procedures that can be implemented to reduce those impacts. The steps followed in performing the study were: Review regulatory and policy issues related to <b>chaff</b> and flares use. Collect information on how <b>chaff</b> and flares are used in aircraft training. Review available data, literature, and studies pertaining to <b>chaff</b> and flares and their impacts on the environment.

The fish were divided into two groups; then processed using paddy <b>chaff</b> and coconut shell liquid smoke.

Permeability was improved significantly by the blend of charcoal <b>chaff.</b> It is possible to grow the crops because drip irrigation can supply the water to the root zone under the condition of draining salinity. It is harmful for the crops to stop the irrigation because the capillary rise of salinity cannot be prevented. In the root zone at the reclaimed land, mixing the charcoal <b>chaff</b> is proved to be effective to make mature field earlier to grow crops. lt would be recommendable to use the charcoal <b>chaff</b> as the <b>chaff</b> is easy to get in the harvest time. 新規干拓地土壌に焼き籾殻を混入し，土壌物理性の変化を調べると共に点滴潅漑による除塩効果を調査した．その結果，①破砕粘土に焼き籾殻を混入することで透水性の改善が見られた，②点滴灌概により，根群域周辺のみ集中的に少量の水で除塩を行いながら，作物を生育させることが可能である，③灌概が停止すれば塩の上昇を抑えることが困難になり作物にとって危険な状態になることがわかった．根群域のみに注目して，入手容易な焼き籾殻を土壌改良剤として作土層に混入し，点滴灌概を行い，作物を育てながら除塩を行うことは，海成粘土の早期畑地化実現のために有効である...|$|R
