5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s <b>crazy</b> <b>for</b> it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E

Richard Carpenter's college instructor and choir director Frank Pooler inspired him in choral arrangement, and both Karen and Richard participated in Pooler's choir. Pooler also introduced Richard to fellow undergraduate and future song-writing collaborator John Bettis. Another undergraduate, Wesley Jacobs, would join the Carpenters as a musical instrumentalist. The Carpenters sold over 100 million records, won three Grammy Awards out of eighteen nominations, and created numerous gold and platinum albums. One of Pooler's personal poems formed the basis for Merry Christmas Darling, which went to No. 1 on the Billboard charts for three years. Bettis, who later would win an Primetime Emmy Award himself, also successfully collaborated on songs with other artists, such as Human Nature performed by Michael Jackson, <b>Crazy</b> <b>for</b> You performed by Madonna, and One Moment in Time performed by Whitney Houston.|$|E

500|$|According to the singer, {{the clip}} portrays [...] "a {{day in the}} life of the earth to show that we are rushing forward to the end of the 1900s century at full speed. I think Jonas made an {{excellent}} interpretation of the song, although he forced me to dance like <b>crazy</b> <b>for</b> two days. He's a tough director". Inspiration came from the 1982 American experimental film, Koyaanisqatsi, which showed time-lapse footage of cities. Madonna's scenes were shot in early April 1998 at MTV's Times Square studios in New York and Los Angeles. Background scenes were shot in various cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London, Las Vegas, and Stockholm. Test shots taken in Stockholm were presented to Madonna, for conveying the idea behind the clip, but they were deemed good to be used in the final product.|$|E

Frank Schaeffer and his associate, Jim Buchfuehrer provided a private, five-hour screening of Whatever Happened to the Human Race? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that, according to Frank Schaeffer's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book <b>Crazy</b> <b>for</b> God, led to both the Schaeffers and Koop obtaining [...] "...access to everyone in the Republican Party".

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning between the high note of C5 to the low note of G3. The song has a basic sequence of E–A–B–A as its chord progression. Unlike her previous singles, the chord sequence does not repeat itself and the chorus slowly unravels to the climax of the song. Lyrically, the song talks about extreme love for one another. It contains innuendos similar to The Crystals' 1963 song [...] "Then He Kissed Me". According to scholar Dave Marsh, the lyrics talk about frank sexual desire among two teenagers. He believed that the line [...] "I'm <b>crazy</b> <b>for</b> you, Touch me once and you'll know it's true" [...] was not ambiguous and it helped Madonna to capitalize on such disambiguation.|$|E

"Crazy for You" [...] reached {{number one}} in Australia and {{displaced}} another Madonna release, [...] "Angel"/"Into the Groove", from the top spot on the Kent Music Report chart, making Madonna {{one of the few}} acts in Australian chart history to replace themselves at the number-one spot. After the song was released in the United Kingdom on June 8, 1985, it debuted at number 25 and peaked at number two. In February 1991, the song was re-released and again reached a peak of number two. [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 500,000 copies across United Kingdom. Such was Madonna's popularity that when Vision Quest was released in home video in the UK, it was renamed as <b>Crazy</b> <b>for</b> You, to cash in on her success. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 781,900 copies there as of August 2016. [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was also a number-two hit in Ireland and New Zealand.

The instrumentation is provided by a keyboard, synthesizers, percussion and a drum machine. According to Nadeska Alexis of MTVs Rapfix, Brown sings in a falsetto tone, which she found to be reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush described the ballad as [...] "very Michael Jackson and neo-Bieber". JusMusic of Singersroom noted that [...] "Sweet Love" [...] is inspired by Silk's [...] "Freak Me" [...] (1993).

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{came along}} {{late into the}} {{production}} of Fearless. Swift wrote [...] "Love Story" [...] {{about a man who}} was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him. [...] "His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care", said Swift. Swift also felt like {{it was the first time}} she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, [...] "The only people who wanted them to be together were them." [...] She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: [...] "I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it matters—it's not simple or easy but it's real'." [...] She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the [...] "Love Story"'s second refrain. All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "I feel like they had such promise and they were so <b>crazy</b> <b>for</b> each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy." [...] Instead, she chose to write a happy ending. She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved. She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself. [...] "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." [...] Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about. Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.|$|E

500|$|While these {{preparations}} were underway, Fox kept wavering in {{its commitment}} to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron [...] "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," [...] so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof-of-concept to then-chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to {{less than half of}} the film's official $237million budget.
