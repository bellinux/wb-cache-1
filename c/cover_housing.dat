50|$|The {{changes in}} housing benefit have been criticised {{for having a}} disproportionate effect on {{disabled}} families. Two-thirds of individuals affected by the under-occupancy penalty are registered as disabled. Historically, most care and support for disabled individuals was provided by local councils, and their predecessors, rather than central government; in consequence there is an expectation from the government that costs arising out of care needs - including extra bedroom space - should be met by local council budgets. However, over the 20th century, central government took over the cost of providing benefits that <b>cover</b> <b>housing</b> costs; therefore, the government provided a new annual grant to councils, {{so that they can}} make discretionary housing payments for disabled people in this situation. The government has recently merged this grant into the general funding provided to councils.|$|E

This paper attempts to fill this knowledge gap through a screening-level risk assessment. Urban land use was compared within hydrodynamic subregions in 1990, 2000, and 2006. Ancillary data were then used to quantify secondary measures such as impervious <b>cover,</b> <b>housing</b> density, road density and road crossings. Despite the rapid growth of the Bay Area, Sacramento, and Stockton metropolitan areas, the percentage of urban area and rates of change in the subregions are generally low to moderate when compared to other estuaries in the United States.

This suggests that at any given density, there is substantial scope for maximising ecological performance. The social status of residents was related to measures of tree <b>cover.</b> <b>Housing</b> type {{was significantly associated with}} some types of ecosystem service provision, indicating that the type of development may be important independent of its density.

40|$|The {{increase}} of global urbanization can have effects on wildlife species, including carnivores such as coyotes (Canis latrans). As coyotes continue {{to settle in}} more urban areas, reports of human-coyote conflicts, such as attacks on humans or pets, may also increase. Understanding environmental variables that might influence whether or not coyotes and human-coyote conflicts will occur in certain urban areas may assist wildlife officials in creating management plans for urban wildlife. We conducted a survey of 105 urban areas in the United States requesting information on the occurrence of coyotes and human-coyote conflicts. We analyzed the responses with data on human population size, geographic region, land <b>cover,</b> <b>housing</b> density, and precipitation. Larger urban areas {{were more likely to}} contain both coyotes and human-coyote conflicts, and {{were also more likely to}} have greater numbers of conflicts. Urban areas in the western regions with larger amounts of high-intensity development and less forested and agricultural areas were more likely to have conflicts. Most urban areas considered the management of conflicts to be of low priority and emphasized education of citizens rather than removal of individual coyotes. Our results may assist urban wildlife managers in understanding the geographic and demographic factors correlated with the occurrence of coyotes and human-coyote conflicts. Practices such as education campaigns and landscape design incorporating wildlife habitat modifications (e. g., reducing dense cover) may reduce human-carnivore conflicts in urban ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of migration behaviour is of key importance for regional population forecasting. This paper studies the phenomenon empirically, {{the results are}} to be applied in a regional labour market model that forecasts the spatial distribution of employment and labour force in the long term. Therefore, we {{pay particular attention to}} the impact of local labour market developments. Population forecasting demands for a macro approach to migration. However, certain relations that appear evident from microanalyses are difficult to trace in aggregate data. There are two ways in which we deal with this problem. We distinguish seven age groups. Since some migration motives (like education) are associated with particular age groups, we get a clearer picture of underlying mechanisms. Secondly, we expect that the share of labour motivated migrations in the flow between two regions increases with the distance between them. We therefore consider the impact of explanatory variables both on short and on longer distances. We split the migration decision into a decision to move and a choice of destination. For each age group, we propose a generation model based on population characteristics, that projects the total number of movers per region. The distribution of these migrants is determined by means of a production constrained spatial interaction model. Explanatory variables <b>cover</b> <b>housing,</b> labour market and study motives. Housing market related variables dominate short distance moves. Our estimation results show that labour market variables indeed {{play a significant role in}} describing long distance moves of young adults. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of migration behaviour is of key importance for regional population forecasting. This paper studies the phenomenon empirically, {{the results are}} to be applied in a regional labour market model for long-term scenarios of the spatial distribution of employment and labour force. The model takes the interdependence of regional population development and local economic growth into account explicitly. Therefore, we {{pay particular attention to}} the effect of local labour market developments on migration. Population forecasting demands for a macro approach to migration. However, certain relations that appear evident from microanalyses are difficult to trace in aggregate data. We deal with this problem in two ways. Instead of net migration we consider interregional migration flows. These contain more information and allow for a clear identification of underlying mechanisms. Secondly, we distinguish age groups and short versus long distances in our model. It has been shown using micro data that dominant migration motives differ significantly over these categories. The generation- distribution approach is chosen as a modelling framework. For each age group, we propose a generation model based on population characteristics that projects the total number of movers per region. In a production constrained spatial interaction model, region-specific pull factors determine the distribution of these migrants. Explanatory variables <b>cover</b> <b>housing,</b> labour market and study motives. Housing market related variables dominate short distance moves.
