25|$|The {{genesis of}} the MP3 {{technology}} is fully described in a paper from Professor Hans Musmann, who chaired the ISO MPEG Audio group for several years. In December 1988, MPEG called for an audio <b>coding</b> <b>standard.</b> In June 1989, 14 audio coding algorithms were submitted. Because of certain similarities between these coding proposals, they were clustered into four development groups. The first group was MUSICAM, by Matsushita, CCETT, ITT and Philips. The second group was ASPEC, by AT, France Telecom, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, Deutsche and Thomson-Brandt. The third group was ATAC, by Fujitsu, JVC, NEC and Sony. And the fourth group was SB-ADPCM, by NTT and BTRL.|$|E
25|$|Charles Simonyi, {{who worked}} at Xerox PARC in the 1970s and later oversaw the {{creation}} of Microsoft's Office suite of applications, invented and taught the use of Hungarian Notation, one version of which uses the lower case letter(s) {{at the start of}} a (capitalized) variable name to denote its type. One account claims that the camel case style first became popular at Xerox PARC around 1978, with the Mesa programming language developed for the Xerox Alto computer. This machine lacked an underscore key, and the hyphen and space characters were not permitted in identifiers, leaving camel case as the only viable scheme for readable multiword names. The PARC Mesa Language Manual (1979) included a <b>coding</b> <b>standard</b> with specific rules for upper and lower camel case that was strictly followed by the Mesa libraries and the Alto operating system.|$|E

This group of glyphs is referred to as [...] "V0." [...] In 1994, the Ideographic Rapporteur Group agreed to include Nom characters as part of Unicode. A revised standard, TCVN 6909:2001, defines 9,299 glyphs. About half of these glyphs are specific to Vietnam. Nom characters not already encoded were added to Unicode Extension B. (These characters have five-digit hexadecimal codepoints. The characters that were encoded earlier have four-digit hex.) ...|$|E

30|$|Note that {{although}} H. 264 /AVC {{was used in}} the implementation for evaluating the performance of the proposed method, it can be readily extendable to other video <b>coding</b> <b>standards</b> such as H. 263 or MPEG- 1, 2, 4. With different quantization methods in various <b>coding</b> <b>standards</b> such as H. 263 and H. 264 /AVC, only minor modification in (10) is required to obtain the quantization constraint sets for different video <b>coding</b> <b>standards.</b> Nevertheless, the proposed method may not be readily applicable in the case of multicodecs involving both H. 264 /AVC and the existing <b>coding</b> <b>standards</b> such as H. 263. This is due to the different types of transformation used in different <b>coding</b> <b>standards</b> (i.e., integer transform in H. 264 /AVC and DCT transform in H. 263 and MPEG- 1, 2, 4). However, in the case of multi-codecs involving only the old <b>coding</b> <b>standards</b> (e.g., multiple compressed videos encoded by H. 263 and MPEG- 1, 2, 4), the proposed method can still be applicable.|$|R
