40|$|Abstract: Introduction: Anti-oxidant {{activities}} of adrenergic �-blockers are proposed in various organs. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of <b>carteolol</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> an adrenergic �-blocker, on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the viable cell number after ultraviolet irradiation of cultured lens epithelial cell...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical effect of trabeculectomy combined with amniotic membrane transplantation {{in the treatment}} of neovascular glaucoma(NVG). METHODS: Forty-two cases(42 eyes) with NVG were performed trabeculectomy combined with amniotic membrane transplantation. The vision acuity, intraocular pressure(IOP), anterior chamber depth, hyphema, iris neovascularization and filtering bleb after operation were observed. All patients were followed up for 6 - 12 months. RESULTS: IOP were controlled in less than 21 mmHg in 34 cases postopeartively. Symptoms of 6 cases were alleviated, and the IOP were controlled in less than 21 mmHg with treatment of <b>carteolol</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> eye drops 6 - 12 months after operation. CONCLUSION:Trabeculectomy combined with amniotic membrane transplantation is an ideal treatment for NVG...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a case in}} which Descemet's membrane interfered with aqueous humor drainage through an ExPRESS mini shunt. This problem was successfully solved by Nd:YAG laser membranotomy. Case Report: A 70 -year-old male, diagnosed with corticosteroid-induced glaucoma in his right eye, presented to our hospital. Topical betamethasone treatment was discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous D-mannitol and acetazolamide, followed by oral acetazolamide, oral potassium L-aspartate, topical dorzolamide hydrochloride, topical <b>carteolol</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and topical latanoprost. However, his right intraocular pressure (IOP) remained elevated. We performed ExPRESS shunt surgery in the patient's right eye. His postoperative IOP was initially within the normal range, but it reincreased 1 month after surgery. We found that the Descemet's membrane was interfering with both the primary (axial) and reserve orifices {{at the tip of the}} ExPRESS mini shunt. Nd:YAG laser membranotomy was performed and the patient's IOP again improved without any other medical treatment. Conclusion: Descemet's membrane interfered with aqueous humor drainage via ExPRESS mini shunt, causing an increased IOP, which was resolved by Nd:YAG laser membranotomy...|$|E
