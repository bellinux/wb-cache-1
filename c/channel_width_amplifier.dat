40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the fact that, since the flow rate in {{parallel}} channels relies strongly on the <b>channel</b> <b>width,</b> the combination may lead to inaccurate results if errors in the fabrication process lead to an uneven distribution of <b>channel</b> <b>widths.</b> Parallel <b>channel</b> enzyme reactors were designed with <b>channel</b> <b>widths</b> distributed normally with different degrees of standard deviation. The reactors were then evaluated with regard to dispersion and to catalytic effect of the immobilised enzyme. It was shown that for lower concentrations the catalytic efficiency decreased significantly even for small variations {{in the distribution of}} <b>channel</b> <b>widths</b> and reactors with poor homogeneity in <b>channel</b> <b>widths</b> also diluted the sample more than the others...|$|R

40|$|The present work connects {{transport}} {{properties of}} simple fluids flowing in nanochannels: the diffusion coefficient, the shear viscosity and the thermal conductivity. We used non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of liquid argon flowing in a nanochannel formed by krypton walls, macroscopically {{equivalent to the}} planar Poiseuille flow, at constant temperature. All properties approach bulk values as the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> increases. As the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> decreases, the transport properties change dramatically: the diffusion coefficient decreases with the <b>channel</b> <b>width,</b> the shear viscosity increases with the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> and the thermal conductivity increases with the <b>channel</b> <b>width.</b> The novel result of this work is that, if the size effect {{of one of the}} transport properties (say the diffusion coefficient) is known, then all the others can be estimated from results that apply to classic fluid mechanics.

50|$|Aggradational {{channels}} commonly form {{where the}} slope is “below grade”. This {{results in the}} deposition of broad, amalgamated and highly sand rich channels which are significantly affected by the slope morphology. (Gee and Gawthorpe, 2006) The <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> versus slope relationship is control by the Froude number of flows along the channel. When Froude numbers are low (<1.0) <b>channel</b> <b>widths</b> remain constant, however when Froude number oscillate around unity, <b>channel</b> <b>widths</b> fall rapidly with channel-floor slope. This provides a mechanism for generating <b>channel</b> <b>widths</b> capable of maintaining near-critical flow by channel narrowing and enhanced sedimentation. This behaviour is controlled by an unknown constant {{that could not be}} found experimentally.|$|R

While the Phase Noise due to white noise increases with <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> increase, that due to flicker noise decreases, thereby setting up the conditions for optimization.

30|$|Literature [4] first {{systematically}} {{studied the}} issues of <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation. Using commodity 802.11 hardware, it gave a method to generate signals of different <b>channel</b> <b>widths</b> by changing {{the frequency of the}} reference clock that drives the frequency synthesizer of the radio front end circuitry, which can be configured dynamically purely in software. And through detailed measurements in controlled environments, it then preliminarily identified several benefits of <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation in many metrics of wireless networks: range and connectivity, power consumption, network capacity and fairness. Finally, it proposed a <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation algorithm, called SampleWidth, for two communicating nodes. In [5], three centralized <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation algorithms using ILP, LP-based packing and greedy raising were proposed for WLAN to improve network capacity and per-client fairness. Literature [6] designed a dynamic <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> allocation protocol called b-SMART for cognitive radio networks. Using the concept of time-spectrum block, the spectrum allocation is reduced into the problem of packing time-spectrum blocks into a two-dimensional time-frequency space. The algorithm of [6] resided in the MAC layer and required advanced radio hardware with fast switching and <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation ability on a packet-by-packet basis, significantly increasing the signaling overhead due to the fast coordination. In our architecture, <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation is on a long-term basis (e.g., every several minutes or hours), hence does not require resynchronization of interfaces for every packet and the modification of IEEE 802.11 MAC protocols, and thus becomes more practical for current available commercial hardware and easy to be used in wireless backbone mesh networks.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system level {{technique}} for mapping large, multiple-IP-block designs to channel-width constrained FPGAs. Most FPGA clustering tools [2, 3, 11] aim {{to reduce the amount}} of inter-cluster connections, hence reducing <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> needs. However, if this exceeds the FPGA’s <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> (a hard con-straint), then the circuit still cannot be routed. Previous work [11, 12] depopulates logic clusters (CLBs) to reduce <b>channel</b> <b>width.</b> By depopulating non-uniformly, i. e. depopulate more in hard-to-route regions, we show a graceful trade-off between <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> and CLB count. This makes it possible to target specic channel-width constraints during clustering with minimal CLB ination. Results show <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> decreases of up to 20 % with a 5 % increase in area. Further decreases of nearly 50 % are possible at 3. 3 times the original area.

At a greater distance, up to 802 m away from the nesting site, there was no relationship with <b>channel</b> <b>width.</b> Managers and regulators should use these results to aid decisions pertaining to habitat creation and assessing impacts of future projects.

3000|$|Motivated by {{the above}} example, we {{strongly}} advocate the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptable network architecture. Briefly speaking, {{the advantages of}} <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation are two-fold. On one hand, we can distribute the traffic as evenly as possible across the spectrum in a fine granularity to achieve channel load balance. On the other hand, in a scenario with many interfering links, by [...] "creating" [...] more small-width orthogonal channels, we can greatly reduce the phenomena of contention and collision, and therefore improve throughput {{as a result of}} fewer back-offs and reduced interference. Another motivation for the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptable network architecture is the recent open spectrum effort [7] made by the spectrum regulation authority such as FCC. Because of the variable widths of [...] "white space" [...] unoccupied by licensed users, we believe <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> adaptation will {{become one of the most}} important functions for cognitive radio networks in future open spectrum environment.|$|R

Chronological change in urbanization, stream network, and downstream <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> were observed, employing GIS, orthophotos over thirty years, and field measurements.

The relationship between the chronological change in downstream <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> and the urbanization pattern in the watersheds was assessed using an index named Stream Based Urbanization Index that indicates spatial distribution of urbanization in watersheds in relation to streams.

40|$|Abstract—This is {{the first}} paper to discuss the ON-state drain–current of a special {{thin-film}} transistor structure with a wide <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> and a narrow source/drain width in the linear region. The experimental results indicate that when the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> is wider than the source/drain width, the side-channel current effect is generated. This effect increases the ON-state drain–current due to the additional current-flow paths exist-ing in the side-channel regions and low channel resistance. As the side-channel width increases, the ON-state drain–current ini-tially increases and then gradually becomes independent of the side-channel width when the side-channel width {{is larger than the}} effective side-channel width, which depends on the <b>channel</b> <b>width</b> and is largely independent of the source/drain width. This paper also demonstrates that the ON-state drain–current gain is directly proportional to the channel length and the ratio of the channel length to the source/drain width and dependent on the side-channel width.
