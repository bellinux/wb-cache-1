40|$|In {{this paper}} we present high {{resolution}} 4. 7 µm spectra of the isolated Herbig Be star HD 100546. HD 100546 {{has been the}} subject of intense scrutiny because it is a young nearby star with a transitional disk. We observe the ∆v= 1 ro-vibrational CO transitions in order to clarify the distribution of warm gas in the inner disk. Modeling of the CO spectrum indicates that the gas is vibrationally excited by collisions and UV fluorescence. The observed emission extends from 13 - 100 AU. The inner edge of the molecular gas emission is consistent with the inner edge of the optically thick dust disk indicating that the inner hole is not simply a hole in the dust opacity but is likely <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> as well. The rotational temperature of the CO is ∼ 1000 K – much hotter than the ∼ 200 K CO in the otherwise similar transitional disk surrounding HD 141569. The origin of this discrepancy is likely linked to the brighter PAH emission observed toward HD 100546. We use the excitation of the CO to constrain the geometry of the inner disk and comment on the evolutionary state of the system...|$|E

In traditional models {{for the evolution of}} hot interstellar gas (cooling flows) in ellipticals, the galaxies are assumed to have been <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> by SNII-driven winds at some early time then gas is subsequently replenished by mass loss from an evolving population of old stars. To test this, we accurately determine the stellar and dark halo mass of NGC 4472 using hydrostatic equilibrium, then solve the standard time-dependent cooling flow equations to recover the observed hot gas temperature and density distributions when evolved to the present time. This procedure fails: the computed gas density gradient is too steep, the total gas mass is too low, and the gas temperatures are much too low. All variants on this basic procedure also fail: increasing the SNIa rate, using the mass dropout assumption, arbitrarily adjusting uncertain coefficients, etc. However, agreement is achieved if the galaxy is supplied with additional, spatially-extended hot gas early in its evolution. This old ``circumgalactic'' gas can be retained to the present time and may be related to cosmological ``secondary infall''.

40|$|Context. A {{region of}} {{roughly half of}} the solar system scale around the star HD 100546 is known to be largely <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> and dust, in {{contrast}} to the outer disc that extends to about 400 AU. However, some material is observed in the immediate vicinity of the star, called the inner disc. Studying the structure of the inner and the outer disc is a first step to establishing the origin of the gap between them and possibly link it to the presence of planets. Aims. We answer the question of how the dust is distributed within and outside the gap, and constrain the disc geometry. Methods. To discern the inner from the outer disc, we used the VLTI interferometer instrument MIDI to observe the disc in the mid-infrared wavelength regime where disc emission dominates in the total flux. Our observations exploited the full potential of MIDI, with an effective combination of baselines of the VLTI 1. 8 m and of 8. 2 m telescopes. With baseline lengths of 40 m, our long baseline observations are sensitive to the inner few AU from the star, and we combined them with observations at shorter, 15 m baselines, to probe emission beyond the gap at up to 20 AU from the star. We modelled the mid-infrared emission using radial temperature profiles, informed by prior works on this well-studied disc. The model is composed of infinitesimal concentric annuli emitting as black bodies, and it has distinct inner and outer disc components. Results. Using this model to simulate our MIDI observations, we derived an upper limit of 0. 7 AU for the radial size of the inner disc, from our longest baseline data. This small dusty disc is separated {{from the edge of the}} outer disc by a large, ≈ 10 AU wide gap. Our short baseline data place a bright ring of emission at 11 ± 1 AU. This is consistent with prior observations of the transition region between the gap and the outer disc, known as the disc wall. The inclination and position angle are constrained by our data to i = 53 ± 8 ° and PA = 145 ± 5 °. These values are close to known estimates of the rim and disc geometry and suggest co-planarity. Signatures of brightness asymmetry are seen in both short and long baseline data, unequivocally discernible from any atmospheric or instrumental effects. Conclusions. Mid-infrared brightness is seen to be distributed asymmetrically in the vicinity of the gap, as detected in both short and long baseline data. The origin of the asymmetry is consistent with the bright disc wall, which we find to be 1 - 2 AU wide. The gap is cleared of micron-sized dust, but we cannot rule out the presence of larger particles and/or perturbing bodies...|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{observed}} transition discs with inner <b>gas</b> holes <b>of</b> radii {{greater than}} ~ 50 AU implies that protoplanetary discs dispersed {{from the inside}} out must remove gas from the outer regions rapidly. We investigate the role of photoevaporation in the final <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> from low mass discs with inner holes. In particular, we study the so-called "thermal sweeping" mechanism which results in rapid <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> the disc. Thermal sweeping was originally thought to arise when the radial and vertical pressure scale lengths at the X-ray heated inner edge of the disc match. We demonstrate that this criterion is not fundamental. Rather, thermal sweeping occurs when the pressure maximum at the inner edge of the dust heated disc falls below the maximum possible pressure <b>of</b> X-ray heated <b>gas</b> (which depends on the local X-ray flux). We derive new critical peak volume and surface density estimates for rapid radiative clearing which, in general, result in rapid dispersal happening less readily than in previous estimates. This less efficient <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> discs by X-ray driven thermal sweeping leaves open the issue of what mechanism can clear gas from the outer disc sufficiently quickly to explain the non-detection <b>of</b> cold <b>gas</b> around weak line T Tauri stars.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) activity ultimately sweeps galaxies <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> their <b>gas.</b> We work out the observable properties required to achieve this. Large-scale AGN-driven outflows should have kinetic luminosities ~η L Edd/ 2 ~ 0. 05 L Edd and momentum rates ~ 20 L Edd/c, where L Edd is the Eddington luminosity of the central black hole and η ~ 0. 1 its radiative accretion efficiency. This creates an expanding two-phase medium in which molecular species coexist with hot gas, which can persist after the central AGN has switched off. This picture predicts outflow velocities ~ 1000 - 1500 km s– 1 and mass outflow rates up to 4000 M ☉ yr– 1 on kpc scales, fixed mainly by the host galaxy velocity dispersion (or equivalently black hole mass). All these features agree with those of outflows observed in galaxies such as Mrk 231. This strongly suggests that AGN activity is what sweeps galaxies <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> their <b>gas</b> on a dynamical timescale and makes them red and dead.

40|$|Tidal {{interaction}} between a gaseous disk {{and a massive}} orbiting perturber is known to result in angular momentum exchange between them. Understanding astrophysical manifestations of this coupling such as gap opening by planets in protoplanetary disks or <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> by binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) embedded in accretion disks requires knowledge of the spatial distribution of the torque exerted on the disk by a perturber. Recent hydrodynamical simulations by Dong et al (2011) have shown evidence for the tidal torque density produced in a uniform disk to change sign at the radial separation of ≈ 3. 2 scale heights from the perturber's orbit, in clear conflict with the previous studies.

40|$|Gravitational {{coupling}} {{between a}} gaseous disk and an orbiting perturber leads to angular momentum exchange between them which {{can result in}} gap opening by planets in protoplanetary disks and <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> by binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) embedded in accretion disks. Understanding the co-evolution of the disk and the orbit of the perturber in these circumstances requires knowledge of the spatial distribution of the torque exerted by the latter on a highly nonuniform disk. Here we explore disk-satellite interaction in disks with gaps in linear approximation both in Fourier and in physical space, explicitly incorporating the disk non-uniformity in the fluid equations. Density gradients strongly displace the positions of Lindblad resonances in the disk (which often occur at multiple locations), and the waveforms of modes excited close to the gap edge get modified compared to the uniform disk case. The spatial distribution of the excitation torque density {{is found to be}} quite different from the existing prescriptions: most of the torque is exerted in a rather narrow region near the gap edge where Lindblad resonances accumulate, followed by an exponential fall-off with the distance from the perturber. Despite these differences, for a given gap profile the full integrated torque exerted on the disk agrees with the conventional uniform disk theory prediction at the level of ~ 10 %. The nonlinearity of the density wave excited by the perturber is shown to decrease as the wave travels out of the gap, slowing down its nonlinear evolution and damping. Our results suggest that gap opening in protoplanetary disks and gas clearing around SMBH binaries can be more efficient than the existing theories predict. They pave the way for self-consistent calculations of the gap structure and the orbital evolution of the perturber using accurate prescription for the torque density behavior.

40|$|Supermassive {{black holes}} (SMBHs) have been {{gradually}} recognised as {{important elements of}} galaxy and cosmic structure evolution. Their connection with the large-scale environment is maintained via feedback processes – communication of {{a fraction of the}} accretion luminosity to the host galaxy. Feedback is conjectured to expel gas from galaxies, quench star formation and establish the observed correlations between SMBH mass and host galaxy properties. Efficient feedback requires rapid gas accretion and is therefore usually investigated within the context of quasar activity phases in SMBH evolution. In this Thesis, I investigate several implications of an SMBH wind feedback model, advancing our understanding of feedback processes and the immediate environment of SMBHs. I consider analytically the large-scale outflows and their observable properties. I find that rapidly accreting SMBHs may sweep galaxies <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> turning them into red-and-dead spheroids. I apply the same feedback model to our Galaxy. Its SMBH, Sgr A∗, is currently exceptionally quiescent, although it must have been more active in the past in order to have grown to its present size. I investigate, both analytically and numerically, a short burst of activity which may have occurred ∼ 6 million years ago, producing an outflow which formed two large γ-ray emitting bubbles perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The results show that dynamical footprints of outflows may persist {{for a long time and}} provide evidence of past AGN activity in quiescent galaxies. I also present a model for the short-timescale flares observed daily in Sgr A∗, based on tidal disruption and evaporation of asteroids in the vicinity of the SMBH. The model explains some observed flare properties, and thus improves our understanding of the processes occurring close to the SMBH. It also provides predictions for observable effects as the quiescent luminosity of Sgr A∗ varies on long timescales. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The spectral resolving power is 20 times higher than CCDs over the 0. 5 – 10 keV energy band.

50|$|StreetPass Quest II / Find Mii II became {{available}} in December 2011 for players {{who had played}} through the first game at least twice. The sequel includes tougher enemies, multiple paths, and new hats. In addition to wanderers, players can now use Play Coins to hire up to three previously encountered Miis. In battle, similarly colored Miis can form teams to perform stronger combo attacks and spells. Play Coins can also be spent to use potions for various uses, such as <b>clearing</b> a room <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> There is also a third secret quest that adds more difficulty to the StreetPass Quest II / Find Mii II maps that provides an additional set of hats that the player can win.|$|R
30|$|To achieve {{both high}} speed and {{separation}} efficiency in {{the separation of}} a mixture of nerve and blister agent simulants, a high-aspect-ratio micro-fabricated multi-capillary column (MCC, a 50 -cm-long, 450 -μm-deep, and 60 -μm-wide four-capillary column) was fabricated by {{the application of the}} microelectromechanical system (MEMS) techniques. Mixtures of chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants - dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), triethyl phosphate (TEP), and methyl salicylate - were used as samples. The fabricated MCC allowed for the separation of all the components of the gaseous mixture within 24  s, even when the difference in boiling point was 4 °C, {{as in the case of}} TEP and methyl salicylate. Furthermore, interfering agents - dichloromethane, ethanol, and toluene - were also included in the subsequent gaseous mixture samples. The boiling point of these six components ranged from 78 °C to 219 °C. All six components were clearly separated within 70  s. This study is the first to report the <b>clear</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures <b>of</b> components with close boiling points. The column efficiency was experimentally determined to be 12, 810 plates/m.|$|R
50|$|In Manchester, he {{continued}} to work with alpha radiation. In conjunction with Hans Geiger, he developed zinc sulfide scintillation screens and ionisation chambers to count alphas. By dividing the total charge they produced by the number counted, Rutherford decided that the charge on the alpha was two. In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube. As they sparked the tube into discharge, the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube. Eventually, the <b>clear</b> spectrum <b>of</b> helium <b>gas</b> appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei.|$|R
40|$|The Astro-E 2 high {{resolution}} X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) {{is expected to}} provide a major enhancement in study of clusters of galaxies. Astro-E 2 is the fifth Japanese X-ray astronomy observatory, which is scheduled for launch in early 2005. The XRS instrument, developed under a Japan-US collaboration, is an X-ray microcalorimeter with a capability of observing extended objects, and a high energy resolution of about 6 eV at 6 keV. The spectral resolving power is 20 times higher than CCDs over the 0. 5 - 10 keV energy band. We have obtained several new results of clusters with Chandra and XMM, which show that high-resolution imaging spectroscopy can clarify some outstanding questions. New sciences from Astro-E 2 include the first <b>clear</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> velocities, determination <b>of</b> ion and electron temperatures, and electron densities based on the resolved line features. We will describe the XRS instrument design, and present simulations of the expected performance. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{wide-angle}} powerful outflows from AGN, both on parsec and kpc scales, {{have been detected}} in many galaxies. These outflows are widely suspected {{to be responsible for}} sweeping galaxies <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> their <b>gas.</b> We present the analytical model describing the propagation of such outflows and calculate their observable properties. Large-scale AGN-driven outflows should have kinetic luminosities ∼ηL_Edd/ 2 ∼ 0. 05 L_Edd and momentum rates ∼ 20 L_Edd/c, where L_Edd is the Eddington luminosity of the central black hole and η∼ 0. 1 its radiative accretion efficiency. This creates an expanding two-phase medium in which molecular species coexist with hot gas, which can persist after the central AGN has switched off. This picture predicts outflow velocities ∼ 1000 - 1500 km/s and mass outflow rates up to 4000 M_/yr on kpc scales, fixed mainly by the host galaxy velocity dispersion (or equivalently black hole mass). We compare our prediction with recent observational data, finding excellent agreement, and suggest future observational tests of this picture. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

40|$|Mismatched or shadowed {{individual}} {{cells in}} a module can {{operate in the}} reverse bias (RB) regime. We investigate and identify key mechanisms for RB operation and degradation in dye solar cells (DSCs). Currentvoltage characteristics in RB {{are sensitive to the}} type of dye utilised and to TiCl 4 substrate treatment. Subjecting the cell to a RB of 0. 4 V over 740 h has little effect on conversion efficiency whereas a significant lowering is observed for the harsher stress tests at 0. 6 V and by forcing a constant current equal to its ISC. For more prolonged reverse biases at ISC (> 740 h), we show that depletion of [I 3 -] inside the DSC can lead the reverse bias potentials across the cells to considerably increase in time. Electrochemical impedance measurements show that the overpotentials at the counter electrodes (CEs) can eventually reach values high enough to cause hydrogen evolution. <b>Clear</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> bubbles forming inside a complete dye solar cell under reverse bias stress, leading to severe device degradation, is presented. We also show that reactions of iodine with water present in the electrolyte can {{play an important role in}} [I 3 -] depletion and in the formation of hydrogen at the Pt CE...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo {{international}} inter-comparison exercises {{devoted to}} dissolved gases and isotope analyses in groundwater, used as tools for groundwater dating were organized in 2012 in France (IDES- Université Paris Sud - CNRS and OSUR - Université Rennes 1 - CNRS). The {{goal was to}} compare sampling and analytical protocols through results obtained by the community of groundwater dating laboratories. The two exercises were: GDAT 1 on three supply boreholes in a homogeneous sand-aquifer of Fontainebleau (Paris Basin, France) and GDAT 2 on two supply boreholes (shallow and deep) in a fractured rock aquifer in French Brittany. This twostep exercise is the first exercise which included a large number <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> and isotopes usually used in groundwater as dating tools and also permit to discuss the uncertainties related to sampling protocols issuing from each laboratory methods. The two tests allowed 31 Laboratories from 14 countries to compare their protocols for both sampling and analyses. This paper presents the participants and parameters measured, and focuses on the validation of the sampling strategy. Two laboratories analyzed CFC and SF 6 samples collected at regular intervals during the sampling operations in order to verify water homogeneity. The results obtained by the two "reference" laboratories along with monitoring of field parameters showed no <b>clear</b> trend <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> concentration or physic-chemical properties. It can be concluded that the pumped groundwater composition remained constant during sampling. This study also shows the potential for relatively constant pumped groundwater composition from a specific well despite the complexity and/or mixing processes that may occur at a larger scale in the aquifer...|$|R
