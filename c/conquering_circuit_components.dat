40|$|Abstract. Delay of VLSI <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> can be {{controlled}} by varying their sizes. In other words, performance of VLSI circuits can be optimized by changing the sizes of the <b>circuit</b> <b>components.</b> In this paper, we define a special type of geometric program called unary geometric program. We show that under the Elmore delay model, several commonly used formulations of the <b>circuit</b> <b>component</b> sizing problem considering delay, chip area and power dissipation {{can be reduced to}} unary geometric programs. We present a greedy algorithm to solve unary geometric programs optimally and efficiently. When applied to VLSI <b>circuit</b> <b>component</b> sizing, we prove that the runtime of the greedy algorithm is linear to the number of <b>components</b> in the <b>circuit.</b> In practice, we demonstrate that our unary-geometric-program based approach for circuit sizing is hundreds of times or more faster than other approaches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a design methodology of an electromagnetic transient analysis program {{based on an}} objectoriented approach. Two important features of the object oriented programming are (i) abstraction of data and their procedures using classes and (ii) derivation of a new class from an existing class using the concept of inheritance. In the proposed design methodology, first the base class, from which all kinds of <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> are derived using inheritance, is defined. When a specific <b>circuit</b> <b>component</b> {{is derived from the}} base class, the parameters, the internal variables, and the behavior of the component are defined and described in the code defining the derived class. This means that each <b>circuit</b> <b>component</b> manages its data and knows how to initialize and update itself, that is, the circuit solver does not have to manage and know them. In this way, we can separately write the code of the circuit solver and that of <b>circuit</b> <b>components,</b> and thus, coding is simplified and code maintainability is enhanced. Especially, adding a new component does not require modifications in the circuit solver code. Using the proposed approach, a new transient analysis program named “XTAP ” (eXpandable Transient Analysis Program) has been created. Some practical implementation issues are also presented in the paper. Index Terms — Circuit simulation, Electromagnetic transient analysis, Object oriented programming, Power systems, an...|$|R

40|$|A new switch-level fault {{simulation}} method for MOS circuits is presented that combines compiled switch-level simulation techniques and functional fault modeling of transistor faults {{with the new}} {{fault simulation}} algorithm of differential fault simulation. The fault simulator models both node stuck-at- 0, stuck-at- 1 faults and transistor stuck-on, stuck-open faults. Prior to simulation, the switch-level <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> are compiled into functional models. The effect of transistor faults on {{the function of the}} <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> is modeled by functional fault models that execute very fast during simulation. Every compiled <b>circuit</b> <b>component</b> is assigned a dominance attribute, which abstracts relative strength information in the circuit. Dominance is used during simulation to resolve the X-state due to fighting pull-up and pull-down transistor paths and also to deduce transistor fault detectability and fault equivalencies prior to simulation. The differential fault simulation algorithm developed for gate-level circuits is adapted for use at the switch-level. Differential fault simulation provides excellent performance with minimum memory requirements, although it incurs a higher overhead at the switch-level than at the gate-level due to the dynamic memory properties of MOS circuits...|$|R
