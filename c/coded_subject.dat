40|$|Dance has for a {{long time}} been {{regarded}} as a feminine domain, which has resulted in a pitiable number of dancing boys. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to investigate what kind of attitude boys have to the dance subject. The premises of the study are gender theories where the hegemonic masculinity dominates and where the femininely coded appearances generates lower status, as well as the influence and previous knowledge the students of lower ages gets, and how it effects their choices. Qualitative interviews were made with eight high school students of male gender. Half of them studies dance at school, half of them does not. The results show that the image of dance as a femininely <b>coded</b> <b>subject</b> still remains. However, the boys' experience is that this is a common perception in society in general. Personally they are of a completely different opinion, and several of them present a positive attitude to dance. The experience of dance in elementary school that the respondents picture is based on folk dancing and couple dancing, which offers a quite narrow and old fashioned image of what dance truly is. Almost no one of them has experienced any modern dance, stage dance, free movement or creation of dance. The four students with dancing on their schedule in high school declares to have completely changed their perception of the subject, which shows the importance of the position and value the school provides dance education. My conclusion is that the gender barriers still hold peoples minds in a firm grip, but that the individual opinions contradicts that. Based on the answers of the respondents, I find that the school in general is the instance that has the highest prospect of influencing the students in the right course concerning dance. Since the dance education in school in many ways is inadequate, it signals that the subject has no legitimate value, which can be read from the answers of the respondents. The school has to take dance seriously, let educated dance teachers in and offer all students a qualified education. In that way dance will become a natural element and will receive a value for both girls and boys...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{continuation}} of my licentiate thesis from 2007 “Dansens plats i skolan. Tradition, utveckling och lärande i Skellefteå kommun” [‘The place of dance in schools. Tradition, development and learning and teaching in the Municipality of Skellefteå’]. The overarching aim of the thesis is to interpret and understand dance as a form of expression and phenomenon in schools, which comprises dance teaching, learning in dance, and dance teachers’ attitudes, experiences and ideas. Dance teachers’ experiences and conceptions of dance teaching are at the centre of this thesis. The aim is to interpret and understand dance teachers’ attitude to gender as well as dance as an area of knowledge from dance teachers’ perspective. In the thesis the following will be answered: How do dance teachers describe their experiences and conceptions of gender in the dance teaching of preschools and schools? What is dance teaching in schools from dance teachers’ perspective? The empirical material is principally based on a questionnaire study implemented in the spring of 2008 and answered by 154 dance teachers but also on observations of dance teaching in schools from 2006. The thesis takes a hermeneutic approach. Gender theories and phenomenological theories have been of major importance for the understanding of the result. The thesis deals with central concepts such as ‘gender structures’, ‘masculinities’, ‘relations’, ‘the lived body’, ‘the lifeworld’ and ‘transcendence’. Dance teachers perceive marked differences between girls and boys in three respects. There are fewer boys than girls that are favourably disposed to dance, that clearly try to imitate the dance teacher’s movements and that give full expression to lyrical, peaceful exercises. There is a connection here to dance as a femininely <b>coded</b> <b>subject,</b> homophobic conceptions and the distinction between masculine and feminine movements. As regards wealth of ideas in improvisation exercises, a majority of dance teachers think that there is no difference between boys and girls. Nearly all dance teachers think that they work with the same types of movements for boys and girls, {{while at the same time}} they conceive of sex and gender in different ways. This study shows many experiences of dance where gender does not play any role but also that dance in schools may imply a gender-stereotyped attitude. There is also a common view among dance teachers of what dance teaching is. Dance has an existential dimension where the lived body is emphasized. In the thesis the so-called “boy problem” is questioned, since boys’ verbal deprecation is not visible in the dance teaching itself...|$|E

5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object <b>code</b> <b>subject</b> to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object <b>code</b> <b>subject</b> to copyright law are still controversial.
