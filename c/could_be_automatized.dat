40|$|Abstract—Consumption of (business) {{processes}} {{provided in}} form of Web sites have {{become a part of}} our daily life for attending our personal and business needs. In order to obtain the best solution for a particular task, users often combine several Web processes. However, the coordination of the execution of such Web process compositions is com-pletely manual demanding the user to enter same or logical dependent data multiple times. We argue that a part of such coordination effort <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>automatized</b> by swapping out the uncreative coordination tasks to the Web browser. Our solution allows users to compose Web processes as generic solutions and execute the compositions with appropriate parameters every time they need to perform a concrete task, thus relieving them from a lot of manual coordination effort. We show how such Web process compositions can be formalized, obtained and executed inside a common Web browser with automatic flow of data among different parties despite heterogeneous data. I...|$|E
40|$|As edit, analyze, measure or {{transform}} attribute grammars by hand is {{an exhaustive}} task, {{it would be}} great if it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>automatized,</b> specially for those who work in Language Engineering. However, currently there are no editors oriented to grammar development that cover all our needs. In this paper we describe the architecture and the development stages of AGile, a structured editor, analyzer, metric calculator and transformer for attribute grammars. It is intended, with this tool, to fill the existing gap. An AnTLR based attribute grammar syntax was used to define the input for this system. As soon as the user types the grammar, the input is parsed and kept in an intermediate structure in memory which holds the important information about the input grammar. This intermediate structure can be used to calculate all the metrics or to transform the input grammar. This system can be a valorous tool for those who need to improve the performance or functionalities of their language processor, speeding up the difficult task of defining and managing a language. Features like highlighting, automatic indentation, on-the-fly error detection, etc., also adds efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{advances}} of technologies for mobile robotics enable {{the application of}} robots to increasingly complex tasks. Cleaning office buildings {{on a daily basis}} is a problem that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> partially <b>automatized</b> with a cleaning robot that assists the cleaning professional yielding a higher cleaning capacity. A typical task in this domain is the selective cleaning, that is a focused cleaning effort to dirty spots, which speeds up the overall cleaning procedure significantly. To enable a robotic cleaner to accomplish this task, it is first necessary to distinguish dirty areas from the clean remainder. This paper discusses a vision-based dirt detection system for mobile cleaning robots that can be applied to any surface and dirt without previous training, that is fast enough to be executed on a mobile robot and which achieves high dirt recognition rates of 90 % at an acceptable false positive rate of 45 %.

40|$|In {{a recent}} work [M. Castellana and G. Parisi, Phys. Rev. E 82, 040105 (R) (2010) ], the {{large-scale}} {{behavior of the}} simplest non-mean-field spin-glass system has been analyzed, and the critical exponent related to the divergence of the correlation length has been computed at two loops within the epsilon-expansion technique by two independent methods. By performing the explicit calculation of the critical exponents at two loops, one obtains that the two methods yield the same result. This shows that the underlying renormalization group ideas apply consistently in this disordered model, {{in such a way}} that an epsilon-expansion can be set up. The question of the extension to high orders of this epsilon-expansion is particularly interesting from the physical point of view. Indeed, once high orders of the series in epsilon for the critical exponents <b>are</b> known, one <b>could</b> check the convergence properties of the series, and find out if the ordinary series resummation techniques, yielding very accurate predictions for the Ising model, work also for this model. If this is the case, a consistent and predictive non-mean-field theory for such a disordered system <b>could</b> <b>be</b> established. In that regard, in this work we expose the underlying techniques of such a two-loop computation. We show with an explicit example that such a computation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> quite easily <b>automatized,</b> i. e., performed by a computer program, in order to compute high orders of the epsilon-expansion, and so eventually make this theory physically predictive.
