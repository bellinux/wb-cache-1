5|$|A {{controversy}} surrounding the AACS <b>cryptographic</b> key arose in April 2007 when the Motion Picture Association of America and the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA) began issuing {{cease and desist}} letters to websites publishing a 128-bit (16-byte) number, represented in hexadecimal as 09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0 is the number they tried to ban|accessdate=May 3, 2007|date=May 2, 2007|author=Nick Farrell|publisher=The Inquirer}} (commonly referred to as 09 F9), a <b>cryptographic</b> key for HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. The letters demanded the immediate removal of the key and any links to it, citing the anti-circumvention provisions of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).|$|E
5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by <b>cryptographic</b> documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German <b>Cryptographic</b> Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} 26 letters (2×13) {{in the basic}} Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same {{algorithm}} is applied, so the same action {{can be used for}} encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no <b>cryptographic</b> security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.|$|E
5|$|During the advance, Australian troops {{captured}} Japanese <b>cryptographic</b> materials. This had {{an important}} effect on the subsequent {{course of the war}} against Japan in the South West Pacific, as it permitted codebreakers in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Gleason {{returned}} {{to active duty}} for the Korean War, serving as a Lieutenant Commander in the Nebraska Avenue Complex (which much later became {{the home of the}} DHS Cyber Security Division). His <b>cryptographic</b> work from this period remains classified, but it is known that he recruited mathematicians and taught them cryptanalysis.|$|E
5|$|In July 2002, {{the project}} {{released}} version 3.0, code-named Woody, the first release to include <b>cryptographic</b> software, a free licensed KDE and internationalization. During these last release cycles, the Debian project drew considerable {{criticism from the}} free software community because of the long time between stable releases.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to {{the utility}} by Doom9 forum members, bloggers, and {{mainstream}} media has ranged from supportive to intensely hostile. By some, the circumvention of AACS {{was seen as}} a reaffirmation of fair use. Others felt that the utility {{was no more than a}} piracy tool and would bring about group punishment against consumers in the form of player revocation. One article compared proponents of BackupHDDVD to terrorists. When the release of the tool was first publicized, several articles claimed that AACS had been cracked. In fact no <b>cryptographic</b> weaknesses constituting a crack have yet been found in AES, the underlying <b>cryptographic</b> system of AACS. Keys are actually obtained through a side-channel attack.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, Microsoft has complemented BitLocker {{with the}} Microsoft Encrypted Hard Drive specification, {{which allows the}} <b>cryptographic</b> {{operations}} of BitLocker encryption to be offloaded to the storage device's hardware. In addition, BitLocker can now be managed through Windows PowerShell. Finally, Windows 8 introduced Windows To Go in its Enterprise edition, which BitLocker can protect.|$|E
5|$|The Free Speech Flag is {{a symbol}} of {{personal}} liberty used to promote freedom of speech. Designed by artist John Marcotte, the flag and its colors correspond to a <b>cryptographic</b> key which enabled users to copy HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. It was created on May 1, 2007, during the AACS encryption key controversy.|$|E
5|$|Written by an {{anonymous}} programmer using the handle Muslix64, BackupHDDVD is distributed {{with none of}} the <b>cryptographic</b> keys necessary for decryption. Users wanting to use the software to decrypt a protected disc's contents must obtain the appropriate keys separately, a task with which neither the original author nor his or her versions of BackupHDDVD assist.|$|E
5|$|BackupHDDVD {{represented}} {{the first known}} successful attack against AACS. The utility circumvents content protection by decrypting video files directly with AES, the underling <b>cryptographic</b> cipher used by AACS. Using this technique, BackupHDDVD is able to completely bypass the AACS chain of trust, rendering it immune to revocation. The cost of this immunity is that users are forced to rely on keys leaking from commercial player software to use BackupHDDVD with new discs.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine {{based on the same}} <b>cryptographic</b> principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.|$|E

She recruits Donald Grant as an assassin and Tatiana Romanova, a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul, as the unwitting bait.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} fields are {{the field of}} {{rational}} numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most <b>cryptographic</b> protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{theoretical}} work in cryptography concerns <b>cryptographic</b> primitives—algorithms with basic <b>cryptographic</b> properties—and their relationship to other <b>cryptographic</b> problems. More complicated <b>cryptographic</b> tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or <b>cryptographic</b> protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note however, that the distinction between <b>cryptographic</b> primitives and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of <b>cryptographic</b> primitives include pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptographic</b> {{file system}} {{implementations}} for other operating systems are available, but the Microsoft EFS is not compatible {{with any of}} them. See also the list of <b>cryptographic</b> file systems.|$|E
25|$|Botan, a BSD-licensed <b>cryptographic</b> library {{written in}} C++.|$|E
25|$|In <b>cryptographic</b> applications, {{the ability}} to find two {{distinct}} values xμ-1 and xλ+μ-1 mapped by some <b>cryptographic</b> function ƒ to the same value xμ may indicate a weakness in ƒ. For instance, Quisquater and Delescaille apply cycle detection algorithms {{in the search for}} a message and a pair of Data Encryption Standard keys that map that message to the same encrypted value; Kaliski, Rivest, and Sherman also use cycle detection algorithms to attack DES. The technique may also be used to find a collision in a <b>cryptographic</b> hash function.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} aware of <b>cryptographic</b> history, <b>cryptographic</b> {{algorithm}} and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential effects of quantum computing are already being considered by some <b>cryptographic</b> system designers developing post-quantum cryptography; the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for this preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.|$|E
25|$|One or more <b>cryptographic</b> {{primitives}} {{are often}} used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a <b>cryptographic</b> system, or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security in the random oracle model). Cryptosystems use {{the properties of the}} underlying <b>cryptographic</b> primitives to support the system's security properties. Of course, as the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected backup data). Such cryptosystems are sometimes called <b>cryptographic</b> protocols.|$|E
25|$|Kryptos was {{the first}} <b>cryptographic</b> {{sculpture}} made by Sanborn.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, some <b>cryptographic</b> {{algorithms}} have {{export restrictions}} (see export of cryptography).|$|E
25|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD) is a secure communication method which implements a <b>cryptographic</b> protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. It enables two parties {{to produce a}} shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is often incorrectly called quantum cryptography, {{as it is the}} best-known example of a quantum <b>cryptographic</b> task.|$|E
25|$|DNS {{responses}} traditionally do {{not have}} a <b>cryptographic</b> signature, leading to many attack possibilities; the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses. DNSCurve has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as TSIG, add support for <b>cryptographic</b> authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize zone transfer or dynamic update operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of the processor makes it better suited to hardware-assisted <b>cryptographic</b> brute force attack applications than conventional processors.|$|E
25|$|Chaos {{theory has}} been used for many years in cryptography. In the past few decades, chaos and {{nonlinear}} dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of <b>cryptographic</b> primitives. These algorithms include image encryption algorithms, hash functions, secure pseudo-random number generators, stream ciphers, watermarking and steganography. The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys. From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the <b>cryptographic</b> systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based <b>cryptographic</b> algorithms. One type of encryption, secret key or symmetric key, relies on diffusion and confusion, which is modeled well by chaos theory. Another type of computing, DNA computing, when paired with chaos theory, offers a way to encrypt images and other information. Many of the DNA-Chaos <b>cryptographic</b> algorithms are proven to be either not secure, or the technique applied is suggested to be not efficient.|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{cryptanalysis}} is to {{find some}} weakness or insecurity in a <b>cryptographic</b> scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cryptographic</b> {{security}} of PGP encryption {{depends on the}} assumption that the algorithms used are unbreakable by direct cryptanalysis with current equipment and techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} how best to {{implement}} and integrate cryptography in software applications is itself a distinct field (see <b>Cryptographic</b> engineering and Security engineering).|$|E
25|$|Technically, digest {{authentication}} is {{an application}} of MD5 <b>cryptographic</b> hashing with usage of nonce values to prevent replay attacks. It uses the HTTP protocol.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{that use}} {{passwords}} for authentication {{must have some}} way to check any password entered to gain access. If the valid passwords are simply stored in a system file or database, an attacker who gains sufficient access to the system will obtain all user passwords, giving the attacker access to all accounts on the attacked system, and possibly other systems where users employ the same or similar passwords. One way to reduce this risk is to store only a <b>cryptographic</b> hash of each password instead of the password itself. Standard <b>cryptographic</b> hashes, such as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) series, are very hard to reverse, so an attacker who gets hold of the hash value cannot directly recover the password. However, knowledge of the hash value lets the attacker quickly test guesses offline. Password cracking programs are widely available that will test {{a large number of}} trial passwords against a purloined <b>cryptographic</b> hash.|$|E
25|$|Sanborn {{worked with}} a {{retiring}} CIA employee named Ed Scheidt, Chairman of the CIA Office of Communications, {{to come up with}} the <b>cryptographic</b> systems used on the sculpture.|$|E
25|$|This logic has applications, {{for example}} a <b>cryptographic</b> attack called the {{birthday}} attack, which uses this probabilistic model {{to reduce the}} complexity of finding a collision for a hash function.|$|E
25|$|Blowfish {{was one of}} {{the first}} secure block ciphers not subject to any patents and {{therefore}} freely available for anyone to use. This benefit has contributed to its popularity in <b>cryptographic</b> software.|$|E
25|$|The Wiener's attack, {{named after}} {{cryptologist}} Michael J. Wiener, {{is a type}} of <b>cryptographic</b> attack against RSA. The attack uses the continued fraction method to expose the private key d when d is small.|$|E
