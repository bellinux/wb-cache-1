5|$|Acetic acid is a {{chemical}} reagent {{for the production}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds.</b> The largest single use of acetic acid is in the production of vinyl acetate monomer, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production. The volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|Anti-vitamins are <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> that {{inhibit the}} {{absorption}} or actions of vitamins. For example, avidin is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits {{the absorption of}} biotin; it is deactivated by cooking. Pyrithiamine, a synthetic compound, has a molecular structure similar to thiamine, vitamin B1, and inhibits the enzymes that use thiamine.|$|E
5|$|From the {{structural}} perspective, the most distinctive <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> of boron are the hydrides. Included {{in this series}} are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B12H122−), decaborane (B10H14), and the carboranes such as C2B10H12. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.|$|E
50|$|Copper(I) sulfide is {{a copper}} sulfide, a <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> of copper and sulfur. It has the <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> Cu2S. It {{is found in}} nature as the mineral chalcocite. It has a narrow range of {{stoichiometry}} ranging from Cu1.997S to Cu2.000S.|$|R

5|$|Iron <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have many}} uses. Iron oxide mixed with {{aluminium}} powder can be ignited {{to create a}} thermite reaction, used in welding and purifying ores. Iron forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens. Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound discovered.|$|E

5|$|Small {{quantities}} of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} {{classifying}} <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> datasets. We present an algorithm that first mines the <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> dataset to discover discriminating sub-structures; these discriminating sub-structures are used as features to build a powerful classifier. The advantage of our classification technique is that it requires very little domain knowledge and can easily handle large chemical datasets. We evaluated the performance of our classifier on two widely available <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> datasets and have found it to give good results...|$|R
5|$|The {{properties}} of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship {{exists between the}} behavior of magnesium and scandium, {{just as there is}} between beryllium and aluminium. In the <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of cacti {{have been shown to}} contain psychoactive agents, <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> that can cause changes in mood, {{perception}} and cognition through their effects on the brain. Two species {{have a long history of}} use by the indigenous peoples of the Americas: peyote, Lophophora williamsii, in North America, and the San Pedro cactus, Echinopsis pachanoi, in South America. Both contain mescaline.|$|E
5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that xenon can form <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state.|$|E
25|$|A pure <b>chemical</b> <b>compound</b> is a <b>chemical</b> {{substance}} that {{is composed of}} {{a particular set of}} molecules or ions. Two or more elements combined into one substance through a chemical reaction form a <b>chemical</b> <b>compound.</b> All compounds are substances, but not all substances are compounds.|$|R

5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds,</b> since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae {{produces}} {{a series of}} diterpenoid <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> known as cyathins, which have antibiotic properties against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The capacity to produce cyathins—similar to C.striatus and C.africanus—is limited to haploid strains. The basic chemical structure of the cyathins, known as the cyathane skeleton, is chemically unique and has been investigated using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR); molecules with this structure have also been created synthetically.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (<b>chemical</b> <b>compounds).</b> This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.|$|E

5|$|Detzel and Wink (1993) {{published}} an extensive review of 63 types of plant allelochemicals (alkaloids, terpenes, glycosides, etc.) {{and their effects}} on bees when consumed. It was found that 39 <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> repelled bees (primarily alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins) and three terpene compounds attracted bees. They report that 17 out of 29 allelochemicals are toxic at some levels (especially alkaloids, saponins, cardiac glycosides and cyanogenic glycosides).|$|E
5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008. On September 28, 2015, NASA announced the presence of briny flowing salt water on the Martian surface.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, Siddiqui {{continued}} {{to discover and}} isolate numerous unique anti-bacterial compounds from various parts (leaves, bark, etc.) of the Neem and other plants. He had more than 50 <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> patented in his name {{in addition to those}} discovered {{as a result of his}} joint research with other colleagues and students. Most of these discoveries still remain vital natural ingredients of various medicines as well as biopesticides.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium {{has five}} ionic {{oxidation}} states ranging from +3 to +7 when forming <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{which can be}} simultaneously observed in solutions. It is the heaviest actinide that can lose all its valence electrons in a stable compound. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E
5|$|Promethium forms {{only one}} stable {{oxidation}} state, +3, {{in the form}} of ions; this is in line with other lanthanides. According to its position in the periodic table, the element cannot be expected to form stable +4 or +2 oxidation states; treating <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds</b> containing Pm3+ ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion is not easily oxidized or reduced.|$|E
5|$|Spectra of {{the main}} ring {{obtained}} by the HST, Keck, Galileo and Cassini have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which {{can be attributed to}} particular <b>chemical</b> <b>compounds,</b> although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8μm and 2.2μm.
