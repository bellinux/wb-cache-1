40|$|Organophosphorous (OP) {{pesticides}} {{are used}} frequently in agriculture, particularly in Asian countries over the pastdecades. Poisoning by these agents, either as acute or chronic in these nations, {{is a serious}} health problem. OP pesticidesresidue in fruits and vegetables that may not induce early clinical features, could also affect the human health. Therefore, medical and health professionals should be aware and learn more on the toxicology, prevention and proper management <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> poisoning. The well-known mechanism <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> toxicity is the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase,resulting in an accumulation of acetylcholine and continued stimulation of acetylcholine receptors. Therefore, they arealso called anticholinesterase agents. Determination of blood acetyl cholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase activities remains a mainstay for the rapid initial screening <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> pesticides. Quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> and their degradation products in plasma and urine by mass spectrometric methods is a more specific method, but is expensive and limited to specialized laboratories. Therefore, history <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> pesticides exposure and clinical manifestations of a cholinergic syndrome is sufficient for management of the exposed patients. However, electrophysiological tests may be requiredfor the diagnosis of delayed neuropathy <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> poisoning. The standard management <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> poisoning includes decontamination,atropine sulphate with an oxime. Recent advances focus on blood alkalinisation and magnesium sulphate as promising adjunctive therapies. Preventive measures in <b>OP</b> exposure are <b>of</b> great importance in human health in developing countries. Therefore, regulations and controls on safe use <b>of</b> <b>OP</b> particularly in Asian countries are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Op 18 /stathmin (Op 18) is a phosphorylation-regulated {{microtubule}} destabilizer that {{is frequently}} overexpressed in tumors. The importance <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 in malignancy was recently suggested by {{identification of a}} somatic Q 18 →E mutation <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 in an adenocarcinoma. We addressed the functional consequences <b>of</b> aberrant <b>Op</b> 18 expression in leukemias by analyzing the cell cycle of K 562 cells either depleted <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 by expression of interfering hairpin RNA or induced to express wild-type or Q 18 E substituted Op 18. We show here that although Op 18 depletion increases microtubule density during interphase, the density of mitotic spindles is essentially unaltered and cells divide normally. This is consistent with phosphorylation-inactivation <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 during mitosis. Overexpression <b>of</b> wild-type <b>Op</b> 18 results in aneugenic activities, manifest as aberrant mitosis, polyploidization, and chromosome loss. One particularly significant finding was that the aneugenic activity <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 was dramatically increased by the Q 18 →E mutation. The hyperactivity <b>of</b> mutant <b>Op</b> 18 is apparent in its unphosphorylated state, and this mutation also suppresses phosphorylation-inactivation of the microtubule-destabilizing activity <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 without any apparent effect on its phosphorylation status. Thus, although Op 18 is dispensable for mitosis, the hyperactive Q 18 →E mutant, or overexpressed wild-type Op 18, exerts aneugenic effects {{that are likely to}} contribute to chromosomal instability in tumors...|$|R

40|$|Oncoprotein 18 (Op 18, also termed p 19, 19 K, metablastin, stathmin, and prosolin) is a {{recently}} identified regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics. Op 18 is {{a target for}} both cell cycle and cell surface receptor-coupled kinase systems, and phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 on specific combinations of sites {{has been shown to}} switch off its MT-destabilizing activity. Here we show that induced expression of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) results in a dramatic increase in cellular MT polymer content concomitant with phosphorylation and partial degradation <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18. That PKA may regulate the MT system by downregulation <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 activity was evaluated by a genetic system allowing conditional co-expression of PKA and a series of kinase target site–deficient mutants <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18. The results show that phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 on two specific sites, Ser- 16 and Ser- 63, is necessary and sufficient for PKA to switch off Op 18 activity in intact cells. The regulatory importance of dual phosphorylation on Ser- 16 and Ser- 63 <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 was reproduced by in vitro assays. These results suggest a simple model where PKA phosphorylation downregulates the MT-destabilizing activity <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18, which in turn promotes increased tubulin polymerization. Hence, the present study shows that Op 18 has the potential to regulate the MT system in response to external signals such as cAMP-linked agonists...|$|R

40|$|Oncoprotein 18 /stathmin (Op 18), a {{regulator}} of microtubule dynamics, was recombinantly expressed and {{its structure}} and function analysed. We report that Op 18 by itself can fold into a flexible and extended α-helix, which is in equilibrium with a less ordered structure. In complex with tubulin, however, all except the last seven C-terminal residues <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 are tightly bound to tubulin. Digital image analysis <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 :tubulin electron micrographs revealed that the complex consists of two longitudinally aligned α/β-tubulin heterodimers. The appearance of the complex {{was that of a}} kinked protofilament-like structure with a flat and a ribbed side. Deletion mapping <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 further demonstrated that (i) the function of the N-terminal part of the molecule is to ‘cap’ tubulin subunits to ensure the specificity of the complex and (ii) the complete C-terminal α-helical domain <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 is necessary and sufficient for stable Op 18 :tubulin complex formation. Together, our results suggest that besides sequestering tubulin, the structural features <b>of</b> <b>Op</b> 18 enable the protein specifically to recognize microtubule ends to trigger catastrophes...|$|R

40|$|Nanostructured biosensors for the {{determination}} <b>of</b> organophosphorus pesticides (<b>OPs)</b> are fabricated by a layer-by-layer assembly technique. In the biosensors, bi-enzymes of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (ChOx) {{are used as}} biological receptors, while CdTe quantum dots (QDs) are explored as fluorescent probes for optical transduction of the enzymatic activity. Increasing amounts <b>of</b> <b>OPs</b> lead to a decrease of the enzymatic activity and thus {{a decrease in the}} production of hydrogen peroxide, which can quench the fluorescence of the CdTe QDs.
