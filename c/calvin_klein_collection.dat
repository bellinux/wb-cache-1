500|$|After his {{marriage}} to Tameka Foster, the sexual appeal of his artistry was expected to mature as The New Yorker writer Sasha Frere-Jones writes [...] "The challenge here is to convince us {{that he is a}} married and responsible man—grown and sexy, without sacrificing the louche, frictionless sense of play that made him famous." [...] VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to Glamour magazine, {{he was one of the}} [...] "Sexiest Men" [...] of 2010, and 2011. Celia Walden criticised Usher for being overly explicit, remarking [...] "the subject of his own sexual prowess, women and lingerie will obliterate any traditional interview technique." [...] In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating [...] "The singer came onto the scene in the '90s rocking baggy jeans and suits that made us question his celebrity status, but over the years this R star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon". In 2013, Complex placed him in its [...] "Most Stylish R Singers of the 90's" [...] list. Men's Health magazine was covered by Usher on its 25th anniversary issue with Lou Schuler calling him [...] "the man with the best abs in the entertainment industry".

500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein</b> <b>Collection</b> uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
