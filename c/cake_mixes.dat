The radio version ran {{an hour and a}} half; the TV version an hour, later expanded to an hour and a half. The Friday shows were heard on radio only, because {{at the end of the}} week, Godfrey traditionally broadcast his portion from a studio at his Virginia farm outside of Washington, D.C., and TV cameras were unable to transmit live pictures of him and his New York cast at the same time. Godfrey's skills as a commercial pitchman brought him a large number of loyal sponsors, including Lipton Tea, Frigidaire, Pillsbury <b>cake</b> <b>mixes</b> and Liggett & Myers's Chesterfield cigarettes.|$|E

These convenience foods are based on her most popular from-scratch recipes, such as coconut cupcakes, maple oatmeal scones, mango chutney, and lemon curd. Pricing of these items is comparatively expensive (for example, the suggested retail price for a single box of brownie mix is ten dollars) and they are only sold through upscale cookware and gourmet shops such as Crate & Barrel, Sur La Table, and Chicago's Fox & Obel Market Cafe.

5000|$|Some {{baking mixes}} {{are sold in}} bulk volumes, and the baker {{measures}} out the amount needed.

[...] This resulted in complaints from some customers about the mix making smaller cakes or fewer cupcakes. [...] Betty Crocker and Pillsbury mixes shrank from 18.25 ounces to 15.25 ounces.
