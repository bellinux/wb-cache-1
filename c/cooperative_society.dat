Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK's first co-operative societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families. The Sheerness Economical Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. By the middle of the 20th century, the society had spread across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased {{operating}} the Sheerness dockyard and the Medway Port Authority {{took over the}} site for commercial use. The dockyard closure led to thousands of job losses, {{and most of the}} nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished. By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691. The dockyard closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society,</b> as many of its members were dockyard workers. At the time, the society was the island's main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a larger society.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{examining}} the role of Women farmers’ <b>cooperative</b> <b>Societies</b> in Agricultural Production in Bauchi Local Government Area of Bauchi State Nigeria. A total of eighty (80) women farmers {{were randomly selected from}} eight <b>Cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> which represent 50 % of all registered and viable <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Societies</b> in the study area. Data were collected using well-structured pre-tested interview schedules, and analysed by means of descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, percentages and means). The results indicated that women <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Societies</b> in the study area were engaged in agricultural activities, such as land clearance (62. 5 %), planting and transplanting (62. 5 %) weeding (40 %), fertilizer application (75 %), food processing (87. 5 %), food storage (95 %) and animal production and management (94 %) respectively. The average land size of the respondents was 1. 3 hectare. Constraints to their development efforts included inadequacy of finance; lack of training of their members, inadequate farm implements and lack of suitable machines for Women farmer’s use. Government should provide soft and medium term loan to women <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies.</b> Extension staff should make women <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> as a target group for quick delivery of extension services.

25|$|The most {{striking}} and thorough reform {{imposed by the}} General Velasco's government was to eliminate all large private landholdings, converting most of them into cooperatives owned by prior workers on the estates. The reform was intended to destroy the basis of power of Peru's traditional elite and to foster a more <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> {{as an alternative to}} capitalism. Such socialpolitical purposes apparently dominated questions of agricultural production or any planned changes in patterns of land use. It was as if the questions of ownership were what mattered, not the consequences for output or rural incomes. In fact, the government soon created a system of price controls and monopoly food buying by state firms designed to hold down prices to urban consumers, no matter what the cost to rural producers.|$|E

25|$|Despite an {{expansive}} array of altruistic behaviors, cotton-top tamarins engage in great bouts of spite through negative reciprocity and punishment. They {{have been observed}} to immediately start denying cooperation with monkeys that deny them benefits. Further, in captivity, these primates are not observed to increase altruistic behavior with fellow primates that are committed fully to cooperation. Based on this, researchers believe that repeated interactions in a <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> {{like that of the}} cotton-top tamarin can heighten the chances that an individual will designate behavioral punishments to others in its group. This reaction has also been observed in other species. However, these reciprocal punishments, or relative lack of altruistic actions, may alternatively happen as a result of response facilitation that increases the chances of a cotton-top punishing another primate after watching that individual perform a similar action.|$|E

25|$|Some kibbutzim {{have been}} {{involved}} in legal actions related to their status as kibbutzim. Kibbutz Glil Yam, near Herzliya, petitioned the court regarding privatization. In 1999, eight members of kibbutz Beit Oren applied to the High Court of Justice to order the registrar of cooperative societies to declassify Beit Oren as a kibbutz and reclassify it as a different kind of <b>cooperative</b> <b>society.</b> The petitioners argued that the Kibbutz had dramatically changed its life style, having implemented differential salaries, closing the communal dining room, and privatizing the educational system and other services. These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the principle of equality in consumption. Consequently, the registrar of cooperative societies, who has the authority to register and classify cooperative societies, should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren. The kibbutz responded that it still maintained the basic principles of a kibbutz, but the changes made were vital to prevent a financial collapse and to improve the economic situation.|$|E
