5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern</b> (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
25|$|Rarer {{species are}} the black-throated loon and the ruddy {{turnstone}} (Arenaria interpres), with hardly a dozen nests around Vänern; and the <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern,</b> with hardly a dozen specimens.|$|E

Thousands of Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, northern shoveller also use the backwaters.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Brooks Island, {{located in}} central San Francisco Bay, California, {{currently}} supports the largest breeding colony of <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> (Hydroprogne caspia) in the Bay Area, {{and is one}} of several proposed relocation sites for some <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> from the world's largest colony in the Columbia River estuary of Oregon. Juvenile salmonids have been identified in the diet of <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> nesting at Brooks Island, so I investigated whether the colony, at its current or an enhanced size, poses a threat to the recovery of several runs of salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) in San Francisco Bay that are listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). I also examined the foraging ecology of Brooks Island <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> to 1) determine whether the colony is suitable for expansion based on availability of forage fish resources, a factor potentially limiting the size and productivity of the colony, and 2) investigate how <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> nesting at this colony exploit forage fish resources. I used a bioenergetics modeling approach, employing estimates of tern energy requirements and proportions of energy supplied by various prey types, to estimate consumption of juvenile salmonids by <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> nesting on Brooks Island during 2008 and 2009. Estimated salmonid consumption was 205, 000 smolts (95...|$|R

40|$|Availability of {{suitable}} nesting habitat that {{is free of}} nest {{predators and}} provides access to adequate prey resources within commuting distance {{is a major factor}} limiting seabird populations. <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> (Hydroprogne caspia) in western North America have shifted their breeding habitat from naturally occurring habitats in interior wetlands, lakes, and rivers to primarily human-created habitats in coastal bays and estuaries. This shift has brought <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> into conflict with fisheries of conservation concern, in particular anadromous salmonids. Prior to the 2010 breeding season, three artificial islands were built in the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex as alternative nesting habitat for <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> currently nesting at the world’s largest colony for the species, near the mouth of the Columbia River, Oregon. I investigated the efficacy of habitat creation (island building) and social attraction (decoys and recorded vocalizations) for establishing new breeding colonies in the Upper Klamath Basin, California. In 2010, approximately 258 pairs of <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> attempted to nest on the new islands and raised an average of 0. 6...|$|R
25|$|In particular, Papakanui Spit on {{the south}} head of the harbour entrance, a mobile sandspit, is {{important}} as a breeding and roosting area for the New Zealand dotterel and the fairy tern. It also has areas of pingao. The spit was an important habitat for the <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern.</b> The birds have moved {{to other parts of}} Kaipara Harbour, possibly due to human disturbance. An air weapons range used by the New Zealand Defence Force is a short distance south of the spit.|$|E
25|$|Birds of {{the delta}} are both winter {{visitors}} and passage migrants including great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), {{a wide variety of}} Anatidae, Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), about thirty species of migratory shorebirds, the whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida), the <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern</b> (Hydroprogne caspia), and the brown-headed gull (Larus brunnicephalus), which is very common. One of the most numerous wintering shorebird is the lesser sand plover (Charadrius mongolus), which occurs in flocks of many thousands along the outer coast {{of the delta}}. The wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola) and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) are also abundant.|$|E
25|$|This {{area has}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} significant wetland habitats for waterbirds in eastern Australia. Lignum floodways are a popular breeding habitat for a large range of waterbird species including ibis, and flooded areas of red gum forest provide habitat for nesting egrets, spoonbills and cormorants. Migratory species under the Japan–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA), the China–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA) and the Republic of Korea–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (ROKAMBA) that have been recorded to regularly use wetlands within the Yanga National Park and surrounding areas include the <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern,</b> Latham’s snipe, cattle egret, and the black-tailed godwit.|$|E

50|$|There {{were more}} than 10,000 <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> (Sterna caspia) in the reserve during the 1980s, {{and there are also}} many royal terns (Thalasseus maximus) and great white {{pelicans}} (Pelecanus onocrotalus).|$|R
25|$|Many coastal {{birds are}} {{frequently}} found in Rottnest. These include the pied cormorant, osprey, pied oystercatcher, silver gull, crested tern, fairy tern, bridled tern, rock parrot and the reef heron. The island salt lakes contain brine shrimp which support birds {{such as the}} red-necked avocet, banded stilt, ruddy turnstone, curlew sandpiper, red-capped dotterel, Australian shelduck, red-necked stint, grey plover, white-fronted chat, <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern</b> and the crested tern. Several pairs of osprey nest at Rottnest each year; one nest at Salmon Point {{is estimated to be}} 70 years old. Introduced peafowl are often seen near the main settlement.|$|E
25|$|When {{numbers of}} {{individuals}} {{are taken into}} account, the tropical birds overwhelmingly dominate. The islands {{are one of the}} most important breeding sites for tropical seabirds in Australia and have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). They contain by far the largest colonies of wedge-tailed shearwater in the eastern Indian Ocean, with over a million breeding pairs recorded there in 1994. They also contain Western Australia's only breeding colonies of the lesser noddy, and the largest colonies in Western Australia of the little shearwater, white-faced storm petrel, common noddy, <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern,</b> crested tern, roseate tern and fairy tern. In addition, they contain important breeding areas for the Pacific reef heron, Pacific gull, bridled tern, white-bellied sea eagle and osprey.|$|E
500|$|Other birds {{known to}} breed on North Island include the osprey (Pandion haliaetus cristatus), {{greater crested tern}} (Thalasseus bergii), <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern</b> (Hydroprogne caspia), silver gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae novaehollandiae), [...] and welcome swallow (Hirunda neoxena). Birds {{commonly}} recorded as resident on the island but not recorded as breeding there include the Pacific reef heron (Egretta sacra), white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), red-capped plover (Charadrius ruficapillus), fairy tern (Sterna nereis nereis), Australasian pipit (Antus novaseelandiae australis) and western silvereye (Zosterops lateralis chloronotus). The sooty oystercatcher (Haematopus fuliginosus fuliginosus) and white-backed swallow (Cheramoeca leucosterna) have also rarely been observed as resident on the island.|$|E

50|$|From June {{until the}} end of September, the lake's Canada goose {{population}} increases significantly; Canada geese become nearly ubiquitous {{around the perimeter of the}} lake. In late summer and early fall, a moderate pelican population also arrives, and <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> can be seen on the lake.|$|R
500|$|Terns {{range in}} size from the least tern, at [...] in length and {{weighing}} , to the <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern</b> at , [...] They are longer-billed, lighter-bodied, and more streamlined than gulls, and their long tails and long narrow wings give them an elegance in flight. Male and female plumages are identical, although the male can be 2–5% larger than the female and often has a relatively larger bill. Sea terns have deeply forked tails, and at least a shallow [...] "V" [...] is shown by all other species. The noddies (genera Anous, Procelsterna and Gygis) have unusual notched-wedge shaped tails, the longest tail feathers being the middle-outer, rather than the central or outermost. Although their legs are short, terns can run well. They rarely swim, despite having webbed feet, usually landing on water only to bathe.|$|E
500|$|Coral reefs {{were damaged}} in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary by the hurricane. Donna caused a {{significant}} negative impact on aquatic life in north Florida Bay. Marine life was either stranded by retreating salt water which had been driven inland or killed by muddied waters in its wake. Oxygen depletion due to animals perishing in the hurricane caused additional mortality. Although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks, dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame. Marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion. Sports fishing in the area took {{a few months to}} recover. Juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine nursery grounds into deeper water about [...] offshore, where they were subsequently captured by fishermen. [...] A <b>Caspian</b> <b>tern</b> was swept up the North American coast well to the north of its traditional breeding grounds, to Nova Scotia, which was witnessed four hours after the storm went by Digby Neck.|$|E
2500|$|Thousands of waders can be {{seen here}} during winter.

They include: fairy <b>terns,</b> little <b>terns,</b> <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns,</b> crested terns, pied oystercatchers and sooty oystercatchers. Many species of migratory birds come to nest here and include grey-tailed tattlers, great knots, lesser sand plovers, masked lapwings, Pacific golden plovers, red knots, red-capped plovers, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, sanderlings, waders, double-banded plovers, curlew sandpipers, common greenshanks, bar-tailed godwit and hooded plovers.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it has supported significant numbers of freckled and pink-eared ducks, grey teals, hardheads, Australian pelicans, banded stilts, red-necked avocets and <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns.</b> It also supports populations of Eyrean grasswrens, black honeyeaters, banded whitefaces, chirruping wedgebills and cinnamon quail-thrushes.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of study were {{to determine whether}} contaminant-associated immunosuppression occurs in prefledgling herring gulls and <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> from the Great Lakes and to evaluate immunological biomarkers for monitoring health effects in wild birds. During 1992 to 1994, immunological responses and related variables were measured in prefledgling chicks at colonies distributed across a broad gradient of organochlorine contamination (primarily polychlorinated biphenyls), which was measured in eggs. The phytohemagglutinin skin {{test was used to}} assess T-lymphocyte function. In both species, there was a strong exposure-response relationship between organochlorines and suppressed T-cell-mediated immunity. Suppression was most severe (30 - 45 %) in colonies in Lake Ontario (1992) and Saginaw Bay (1992 - 1994) for both species and in western Lake Erie (1992) for herring gulls. Both species exhibited biologically significant differences among sites in anti-sheep red blood cells antibody titers, but consistent exposure-response relationships with organochlorines were not observed. In <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> and, to a lesser degree, in herring gulls, there was an exposure-response relationship between organochlorines and reduced plasma retinol (vitamin A). In 1992, altered White blood cell numbers were associated with elevated organochlorine concentrations in <b>Caspian</b> <b>terns</b> but not herring gulls. The immunological and hematological biomarkers used in this study revealed contaminant-associated health effects in wild birds. An epidemiological analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that suppression of T-cell-mediated immunity was associated with high perinatal exposure to persistent organochlorine contaminants...|$|R
2500|$|Every year {{approximately}} 15,000 greater flamingos {{are reported}} to visit the lake along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks. The highest concentrations of flamingo {{are found in the}} periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below. The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity. Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, [...] 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, spotbill duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew.
