40|$|The {{regional}} {{distribution and}} frequency of the pancreatic endocrine cells in the ddN mouse were studied using specific antisera against insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP). In the pancreatic islets, most of insulin-immunoreactive (IR) <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> located in the central region, and glucagon-, somatostatin and hPP-IR <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> located in the peripheral region regardless of the lobe.

5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture.
