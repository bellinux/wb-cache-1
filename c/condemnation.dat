Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.|$|E

40|$|The {{struggle}} to delineate {{the relationship between}} theology and logic flourished {{in the thirteenth century}} and culminated in two <b>condemnations</b> in early 1277, one in Paris and the other in Oxford. To see how much and what kind of affect ecclessiastical actions such as <b>condemnations</b> and prohibitions to teach had on the development of logic in the Middle Ages, we investigate the events leading up to the 1277 actions, the condemned propositions, and the parts of these <b>condemnations</b> connected to modal and temporal logic specifically. We show that because of the specific motivations late 13 th-century and 14 th-century logicians had when working in modal and temporal logic, the effect of the 1277 <b>condemnations</b> on the development of those branches was much smaller than might have been supposed...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} I {{investigate the}} relation between Peter of Auvergne’s questions on Aristotle’s cosmological work De caelo and the <b>condemnations</b> of 1277. First I give a short survey of Peter’s life and work and of two sets of quaestiones on De caelo that are ascribed to him: the CEK-questions (very likely composed in 1271 - 1272) and the WP-questions (most probably composed after May 2, 1274). Then I briefly discuss the <b>condemnations</b> of 1277 and their relation to De caelo (the <b>condemnations</b> included some theories defended in De caelo). Finally, I discuss in detail the shifts in doctrine between the CEK- and the WP-questions. I {{argue that it is}} most likely that the change in doctrine between the CEK- and WP-questions on the eternity and animation of the heavens and on the possibility of an infinite multitude in act is effected by the <b>condemnations</b> of 1277. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Carcass and organ <b>condemnations</b> cause big {{economic}} {{losses in the}} beef industry. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the causes of <b>condemnations</b> of whole and partial carcasses and organs of cattle slaughtered at private abattoirs in Ethiopia. A total of 62, 917 cattle slaughtered at Abergelle, Elfora Bishoftu and Elfora Kombolcha abattoirs from February 2010 to November 2013 were used for the study. The main causes of <b>condemnations</b> of whole carcasses were poor bleeding (0. 11 %), abscess (0. 06 %), adhesion (0. 04 %), TB (0. 03 %), pneumonia (0. 01 %), Cysticercus bovis (0. 01 %) and bruising (0. 01 %). Prevalence of abscesses, TB and C. bovis were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between abattoirs. Main causes of partial <b>condemnations</b> of carcasses were bruising (34. 11 %), poor bleeding (25. 59 %), contamination (12. 58 %) and adhesion (9. 37 %). The prevalence of these problems were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between years, abattoirs and season. The main causes of <b>condemnations</b> of liver was faciola (29. 74 %) while lungs were mainly condemned due to H. cyst (23. 01 %) and pneumonia (22. 68). The main causes of <b>condemnations</b> of kidneys, hearts, tongue and spleens were nephritis (10. 91 %), poor bleeding (20. 83 %), abscess (4. 71 %) and splenitis (2. 74 %), respectively while heads were condemned mainly due to poor bleeding (18. 77 %) and bruising (17. 05 %). The causes of <b>condemnations</b> of organs were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between abattoirs or years or both in some cases. From the study it was concluded that the prevalence of disease problems differ from abattoir to abattoir and across years. It is therefore recommended that different strategies should be developed to minimize these problems though the year and between regions based on the dynamic nature of the diseases.
