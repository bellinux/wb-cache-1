5|$|Aqil's father, Musa Agha al-Hasi, {{himself a}} {{commander}} of Hawwara irregulars {{in the service}} of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for Gaza in 1814. He was not directly related to the Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige. Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of Cyrenaica (modern-day eastern Libya). Likewise, James Finn, the British consul in Jerusalem (1846–1863), claims Aqil's family was of Algerian or North African origin. Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a Turkmen woman. Aqil was born to the <b>couple</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nazareth area. According to historian Adel Manna, Aqil was born in Gaza. Musa had two other sons, Ali and Salih. Musa died in Gaza in 1830.|$|E

It associated guilt with an individual's fantasy ("How guilty {{do you feel}} when you fantasize about...") and jealousy with the partner's fantasy ("How jealous do {{you feel when you}}r partner fantasizes about..."). Higher levels of guilt were found among women, <b>couples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21-29 age range, shorter relationships and marriages, Republicans, and Roman Catholics; lower levels <b>in</b> men, <b>couples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 41-76 range, longer relationships, Democrats, and Jews.

In 1995, Mani returned to Tamil language drama through Bombay starring Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala, which {{told the story of}} a Hindu-Muslim <b>couple</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of the 1993 religious Bombay riots and bombings. It was also the first Indian film to focus on marriage between Hindu and Muslim people. The film met with controversy and censorship upon release, was subsequently dubbed into Hindi and was commercially successful and appreciated by critics. It won a number of awards, such as Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, Special Award from the Political Film Society, In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem International Film Festival and the Gala Award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.|$|E

5|$|The Etoiles {{are elected}} {{after going through}} {{what is known as}} , which {{consists}} of three competitions in the light novels and the manga versions. The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition, and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile <b>Couple.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> anime, the competition aspect of the story is toned down. Still, it facilitates the culmination of the story in the finale, and thus serves an important purpose. Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election, at which the president of the student council from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for the colors of the pendants: one is red, the other is blue. The older student receives the blue pendant and the younger of the two is given the red pendant.|$|E

As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly <b>couple</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey.
