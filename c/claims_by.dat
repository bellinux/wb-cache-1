5|$|Seventy-five-move rule: Similar to the fifty-move rule; however, if {{the final}} {{move in the}} {{sequence}} resulted in checkmate, this takes precedence. As with the fivefold-repetition rule, this applies independently of <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> the players, and allows a tournament director to intervene. This rule likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules.|$|E

5|$|British {{sovereignty}} {{of several of}} the overseas territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: Gibraltar is claimed by Spain, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are claimed by Argentina, and the British Indian Ocean Territory is claimed by Mauritius and Seychelles. The British Antarctic Territory is subject to overlapping <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> Argentina and Chile, while many countries do not recognise any territorial claims in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Josephson {{travelled}} to California to meet {{two leading}} {{members of the}} group, laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, authors of Mind Reach (1977). Targ and Puthoff {{had set up a}} parapsychology ("psi") lab at SRI and had had papers published about their work – which included testing later-discredited <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> Uri Geller that he could make objects move using psychokinesis – in Nature and other peer-reviewed journals. The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson's visit.|$|E

The claim {{was rejected by the}} Kuntsevo District Court in Moscow on September 7, 2012. Similar <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> Berdsk resident Yuri Zadoy and Novosibirsk resident Ivan Krasnitsky were dismissed by the same court on October 3, as was a subsequent appeal by Ruzankina to the Moscow City Court on February 18, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Minnesota Majority, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, {{conducted a study}} in which they flagged 2,803 voters for examination, including some 1,359 they suspected were ineligible convicted felons in the largely Democratic Minneapolis–St. Paul area who voted illegally in the Senate race. Subsequent investigations of Minnesota Majority's <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> election officials found that many of their allegations were incorrect.|$|E

5|$|The film deconstructs the church's <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> {{presenting}} a condensed history of Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, examining how celebrities {{interact with the}} church, and highlighting the stories {{of a number of}} ex-members and of the abuse and exploitation that they described seeing and experiencing. The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees.|$|E

Most of the present {{territory}} of Allegheny County, including most of Pittsburgh (with the notable exception {{of what is now}} the northside (Pittsburgh), formerly its own municipality Allegheny City), was once <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> Yohogania. Beaver County was created in 1800 from parts of Allegheny and Washington. The southern part, known locally as [...] "South Side Beaver" [...] because it is south of the Ohio River, was once <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> Yohogania.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{subsequent}} <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither {{was given the}} award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.|$|E
5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E
5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> Republicans that the cabin was a fort. A structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E

5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{played for}} Trinidad {{in the next}} Inter-Colonial Tournament, in British Guiana in 1922. Although in two games he scored only 45 runs and took four wickets, {{commentators}} considered his fielding in the covers to be exceptional, and he retained {{his place in the}} team largely as a fielder. Although Trinidad lost to Barbados in the final, the Barbados captain Harold Austin, who was also captain of the West Indies team, was impressed by Constantine. Mainly on the strength of his fielding, Austin secured Constantine's selection for the 1923 West Indian tour of England; it was a surprising choice, as there were other candidates who appeared to have stronger <b>claims.</b> <b>By</b> this time Constantine was working for Llewellyn Roberts, a larger solicitors' practice which paid better. As his new employer's longer working hours restricted Constantine's cricket practice, when he was selected for the West Indies tour he resigned his position.|$|E
5|$|Dubnium {{does not}} occur {{naturally}} on Earth and is produced artificially. The first discovery of the element was claimed by the Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in 1968, followed in 1970 by the American University of California. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery <b>claims</b> <b>by</b> the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, resulting in credit for discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was officially named dubnium in 1997 after the town of Dubna, {{the site of the}} JINR.|$|E
