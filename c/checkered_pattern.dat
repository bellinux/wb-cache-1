5|$|The {{quality of}} Type 94 Nambu pistols {{decreased}} {{towards the end}} of World War II as the Japanese faced bombing raids from allied forces and material shortages increased. This drastic change in quality from late March 1945, onwards with all quality standards appearing to disappear {{towards the end of}} June 1945. The smooth wooden finished grip was replaced by a bakelite <b>checkered</b> <b>pattern.</b> Many pistols were not serialized and no pistols have been reported that bear July 1945 manufacture date. Only four unserialized and undated pistols are known to exist and include mismatch parts with no inspection marks, lanyard loops, and extractors. A small number of pistols made during the final production stages include earlier production dates and appear to have been salvaged from previously discarded pistols that had minor or cosmetic defects.|$|E
25|$|Fritillaria (fritillaries) is a genus {{of spring}} {{flowering}} herbaceous bulbous perennial {{plants in the}} lily family (Liliaceae). The type species, Fritillaria meleagris, was first described in Europe in 1571, while other species from the Middle East and Asia were also introduced to Europe at that time. The genus has about 130–140 species divided among eight subgenera. The flowers are usually solitary, nodding and bell-shaped with bulbs that have fleshy scales, resembling those of lilies. They {{are known for their}} very large genome size and genetically are very closely related to lilies. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, from the Mediterranean and North Africa through Eurasia and southwest Asia to western North America. Many are endangered due to enthusiastic picking. The name Fritillaria is thought to refer to the <b>checkered</b> <b>pattern</b> of F. meleagris, resembling a box in which dice were carried. Fritillaries are commercially important in horticulture as ornamental garden plants and also in traditional Chinese medicine, which is also endangering a number of species. Fritillaria flowers have been popular subjects for artists to depict and as emblems of regions and organisations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Checker</b> <b>Pattern</b> {{detection}} in {{the presence}} of miscellaneous background objects is a challenging task in computer vision systems. In practical applications, the direct detection of corner points fails due to the illumination variation in the lighting system. A computationally efficient <b>checker</b> <b>pattern</b> detection method using morphological operations and contour tree validation is proposed. The proposed method is tolerant to illumination, rotation and scaling variation. Comparative analysis with corner detection demonstrates the viability of the proposed algorithm as a valuable tool for automatic camera calibration and 3 D measurements...|$|R

[...] "There'll be thousands of people seeing hockey as played by the pros for the first time. [...] They'll be sold on it because it's a great game, and they won't be satisfied to stay [...] but {{will turn out to}} the rinks." [...] As an experiment in the 1956–57 season, CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States. [...] Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to become viewer-friendly. [...] In 1949, to make the puck easier to see, the league mandated the ice surface painted white. [...] In 1951, so each team was distinguishable on black and white television, the League required home teams wear colored jerseys, and the road teams wear white. [...] For the same reason, teams painted the centre red line in a <b>checkered</b> <b>pattern</b> to set it apart from the solid blue lines.|$|E

2500|$|This {{species of}} {{butterfly}} is uniquely named in that its common {{name is not}} [...] "butterfly", but [...] "fritillary". The word fritillary refers to the <b>checkered</b> <b>pattern</b> of the butterfly's wings, which comes from the Latin word fritillus which means [...] "dicebox". The [...] "Glanville" [...] piece of this butterfly's name comes from the naturalist who discovered it, Lady Eleanor Glanville.

2500|$|Fur {{was mostly}} worn as an inner lining for warmth; {{inventories}} from Burgundian villages show that even there a fur-lined coat (rabbit, {{or the more}} expensive cat) {{was one of the}} most common garments. Vair, the fur of the squirrel, white on the belly and grey on the back, was particularly popular through most of the century and can be seen in many illuminated manuscript illustrations, where it is shown as a white and blue-grey softly striped or <b>checkered</b> <b>pattern</b> lining cloaks and other outer garments; the white belly fur with the merest edging of grey was called miniver. [...] A fashion in men's clothing for the dark furs sable and marten arose around 1380, and squirrel fur was thereafter relegated to formal ceremonial wear. Ermine, with their dense white winter coats, was worn by royalty, with the black tipped tails left on to contrast with the white for decorative effect, as in the Wilton Diptych above.|$|E

60|$|Lakamba {{came out}} on the {{platform}} before his own house and sat down--perspiring, half asleep, and sulky--in a wooden armchair under the shade of the overhanging eaves. Through the darkness of the doorway he could hear the soft warbling of his womenkind, busy round the looms where they were weaving the <b>checkered</b> <b>pattern</b> of his gala sarongs. Right and left of him on the flexible bamboo floor those of his followers to whom their distinguished birth, long devotion, or faithful service had given the privilege of using the chief's house, were sleeping on mats or just sat up rubbing their eyes: while the more wakeful had mustered enough energy to draw a chessboard with red clay on a fine mat and were now meditating silently over their moves. Above the prostrate forms of the players, who lay face downward supported on elbow, the soles of their feet waving irresolutely about, in the absorbed meditation of the game, there towered here and there the straight figure of an attentive spectator looking down with dispassionate but profound interest. On the edge of the platform a row of high-heeled leather sandals stood ranged carefully in a level line, and against the rough wooden rail leaned the slender shafts of the spears belonging to these gentlemen, the broad blades of dulled steel looking very black in the reddening light of approaching sunset.|$|E

The yard was full of life now: Marty was letting the {{screaming}} geese through the gate, and wickedly provoking the gander by hissing at him; the granary-door was groaning on its hinges as Alick shut it, after dealing out the corn; the horses were being led out to watering, amidst much barking of all the three dogs and many [...] "whups" [...] from Tim the ploughman, as if the heavy animals who held down their meek, intelligent heads, and lifted their shaggy feet so deliberately, were likely to rush wildly in every direction but the right. Everybody was come back from the meadow; and when Hetty and Adam entered the house-place, Mr. Poyser was seated in the three-cornered chair, and the grandfather in the large arm-chair opposite, looking on with pleasant expectation while the supper was being laid on the oak table. Mrs. Poyser had laid the cloth herself--a cloth made of homespun linen, with a shining <b>checkered</b> <b>pattern</b> on it, and of an agreeable whitey-brown hue, such as all sensible housewives like to see--none of your bleached [...] "shop-rag" [...] that would wear into holes in no time, but good homespun that would last for two generations. The cold veal, the fresh lettuces, and the stuffed chine might well look tempting to hungry men who had dined at half-past twelve o'clock. On the large deal table against the wall there were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans, ready for Alick and his companions; for the master and servants ate their supper not far off each other; which was all the pleasanter, because if a remark about to-morrow morning's work occurred to Mr. Poyser, Alick was at hand to hear it.|$|E

50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted across all current research that infants prefer high contrast and bold colors at their earlier stages of infancy, rather than saturated colors. One {{study found that}} newborn infants looked longer at <b>checkered</b> <b>patterns</b> of white and colored stimuli (including red, green, yellow) than they did at a uniform white color. However, infants failed to discriminate blue from white <b>checkered</b> <b>patterns.</b> Another study - recording the fixation time of infants to blue, green, yellow, red, and gray at two difference luminance levels - found that infants and adults differed in their color preference. Newborns and one month did not show any preference among the colored stimuli. It was found that three-month-old infants preferred the longer wavelength (red and yellow) to the short-wavelength (blue and green) stimuli, while adults had the opposite. However, both adults and infants preferred colored stimuli over non-colored stimuli. According this study, it was suggest that infants had a general preference for colored stimuli over non-colored stimuli at birth; however, infants {{were not able to}} distinguish between the different colored stimuli until after three months of age.|$|R

30|$|We {{measured}} a chromium film {{deposited on}} a quartz substrate with a <b>checker</b> <b>pattern</b> with a thickness of 20  nm and {{a period of}} 2 [*]×[*] 2  μm 2. Figure  3 shows a topographic image and two SNOM images of the chromium pattern measured with the s-polarized illumination [28]. Figure  3 b, c was measured at demodulation frequencies of Ω and 2 Ω, respectively. In those SNOM images, the <b>checker</b> <b>pattern</b> corresponding to the topography in Fig.  3 a is clearly observed. We found that the intensity of area of chromium film (higher parts) is {{higher than that of}} quartz area (lower parts), and they showed opposite sign of phase ϕ for the chromium and the quartz. This result indicates that the signal depends on not only the reflectivity but also the phase. Therefore, we consider that the contrast obtained in those SNOM images is due to difference in the complex permittivity of the materials. In Fig.  3 c, a dark area surrounding the chromium patterns is observed. We believe {{this is due to the}} edge darkening effect. Spatial resolution was determined to be 14  nm by measuring a cross section of SNOM images measured at 2 Ω.|$|R
