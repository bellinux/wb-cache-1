5|$|A single fungal serpin {{has been}} {{characterized}} to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains {{in addition to its}} serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein <b>complex</b> <b>that</b> breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a <b>complex</b> <b>that</b> can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker <b>complex</b> <b>that</b> were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{indigenous peoples}} traveled through Oklahoma {{as early as}} the last ice age. Ancestors of the Wichita, Kichai, Teyas, Escanjaques, and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma. Southern Plains Villagers lived in the central and west of the state, with a subgroup, the Panhandle culture people living in panhandle region. Caddoan Mississippian culture peoples lived {{in the eastern part of}} the state.

Although Tikal was completely abandoned soon afterwards, this continuation in complex construction activity indicated that the elite residents were still inhabiting the palace at this time.|$|E

40|$|The {{chromatin}} {{structure of}} a gene {{plays an important role}} in regulating its expression. This structure is established through the action of various protein <b>complexes</b> <b>that</b> remodel nucleosomes, catalyse post-translational modifications, deposit histone variants and methylate DNA. Together these complexes establish epigenetic marks that influence expression of the gene. Some of these epigenetic marks are transient while others, such as those involved in silencing genes are more stable and can require several cell divisions to be fully implemented or reversed. Deregulated gene expression programs are a feature of cancer biology and it is now apparent that epigenetic changes, as well as genetic changes, are important in establishing these aberrant expression patterns. However, unlike genetic alterations, epigenetic changes are reversible. The <b>complexes</b> <b>that</b> catalyse these modifications therefore represent valuable targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we will review the most recent literature describing the protein <b>complexes</b> <b>that</b> catalyse epigenetic modifications and the inhibitors of these <b>complexes</b> <b>that</b> are being pursued as cancer drugs. In addition we will highlight those epigenetic modifiers that provide promise as therapeutic targets but for which inhibitors are not currently available...|$|R
5|$|The North Acropolis of {{the ancient}} Maya city of Tikal in Guatemala is an {{architectural}} <b>complex</b> <b>that</b> served as a royal necropolis and was a centre for funerary activity for over 1300 years. The acropolis is located near {{the centre of the}} city {{and is one of the}} most studied of Maya architectural complexes.

5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, leaving only a rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a <b>complex</b> <b>that</b> consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{cells have}} other enzymes that can degrade RNA, {{either from the}} 3' or from the 5' end of the RNA, the exosome complex is {{essential}} for cell survival. When the expression of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped, for example by RNA interference, growth stops and the cells eventually die. Both the core proteins of the exosome complex, {{as well as the}} two main associated proteins, are essential proteins. Bacteria do not have an exosome complex; however, similar functions are performed by a simpler <b>complex</b> <b>that</b> includes the protein PNPase, called the degradosome.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic <b>complex</b> <b>that</b> was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Tuck {{has five}} {{residential}} facilities: Buchanan Hall (constructed 1968) and Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000) Pineau-Valencienne Hall, Achtmeyer Hall and Raether Hall (2008). Further, a new complex called the Tuck Living and Learning <b>Complex</b> <b>that</b> houses 95 additional {{students as well}} as classrooms and study space serves as the home for nearly half of first-year Tuck students. This state-of-the-art facility was constructed in 2008 for around $27.2 million. The Tuck School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library) with the adjacent Thayer School of Engineering. The Tuck campus is serviced by Byrne Hall, a dining facility operated by Dartmouth Dining Services.|$|E

In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.|$|E
