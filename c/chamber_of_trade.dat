[...] They considered the layout for the street to be exemplary for its time (it {{was put in place}} following the construction of a bypass in the early 1990s), creating a [...] "pleasant" [...] and [...] "successful" [...] shopping environment and allowing people {{to take advantage of a}} good [...] "range of specialist shops and numerous cafes, restaurants and pubs", together with the [...] "strong supermarket" [...] offering set in [...] "well-crafted re-configured streetscape". The long high street featured one hundred percent retail occupancy, independent traders and a [...] "cafe culture". [...] The Academy considered a particularly strong aspect of the street to be the good working collaboration between individual businesses and the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trade.</b> In the 2017 Vitality Index of 1000 retail locations in the UK carried out by Harper Dennis Hobbs, Berkhamsted was ranked as the 16th best shopping location in the country.

[...] Berkhamsted has an active Transition Town community.|$|E
