Underdeveloped water resources <b>constrain</b> <b>progress</b> towards poverty reduction. We examine linkages and complementarities between agricultural water, education, markets and rural poverty through an empirical study using household level data from selected villages in southern Ethiopia. We show that investments in irrigation can contribute to poverty reduction, but the poverty reducing impacts of irrigation water are greater when human capital and rural markets are well developed. The size of landholding, access to irrigation water, on-farm land and water conservation practices, literacy of the household head, and years of education of adults are all significant determinants of household welfare, and thus potential pathways for reducing poverty. Expansion of cultivated land, particularly irrigated land, universal literacy, and an extra school year for adults all reduce poverty, but reductions in poverty are greater when irrigation is combined with universal literacy.

Water resources and irrigated agriculture are not developed to their full potential. Currently less than 4 % of renewable water resources in Africa are withdrawn for agriculture.

We tested for genetically based mating isolation between lake and stream threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) from the Misty watershed, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We combined several design elements that are uncommon in the studies of stickleback mate choice: (i) we used second-generation laboratory-reared fish (to reduce environmental and maternal effects), (ii) we allowed for male-male competitive interactions (instead of the typical no-choice trials) and (iii) we included hybrids along with pure types. Males of different types (Lake, Inlet, hybrid) were paired in aquaria, allowed to build nests and then exposed sequentially to females of all three types. We found that Lake and Inlet males differed in behaviours thought to influence stickleback mate choice (inter- and intra-sexual aggression, display and nest activities), whereas hybrids were either intermediate or apparently 'inferior' in these behaviours. Despite these differences, Lake and Inlet fish did not mate assortatively and hybrid males did not have a mating disadvantage. Our study reinforces the noninevitability of mating isolation evolving in response to ecological differences and highlights the need to further investigate the factors promoting and <b>constraining</b> <b>progress</b> towards ecological speciation. status: publishe...|$|R

Of recruitment attempts for eligible women, 45 % consented; of those who declined, the top cited reasons were lack of time (40 %) and lack of interest (18 %).

The experimental study of cumulative culture and the innovations essential to it is a young science, with child studies so rare that the scope of cumulative cultural capacities in childhood remains largely unknown. Here we report a new experimental approach to the inherent complexity of these phenomena. Groups of 3 – 4 -year-old children were presented with an elaborate array of challenges affording the potential cumulative development {{of a variety of}} techniques to gain increasingly attractive rewards. In contrast to a prior study, we found evidence for elementary forms of cumulative cultural progress, with inventions of solutions at lower levels spreading to become shared innovations, and some children then building on these to create more advanced but more rewarding innovations. This contrasted with markedly more <b>constrained</b> <b>progress</b> when children worked only by themselves, or if groups faced only the highest-level challenges from the start. Further experiments that introduced higher-level inventions via the inclusion of older children, or that created ecological change, with the easiest habitual solutions no longer possible, encouraged higher levels of cumulative innovation.

40|$|Since 1997, local {{government}} in the United Kingdom has found itself at the sharp end of an ambitious programme of potentially far-reaching reforms known collectively as the '{{local government}} modernisation agenda' (LGMA). These initiatives are intended to promote 'joined-up government' and holistic service delivery [...] two {{of the hallmarks of}} New Labour's approach to public service improvement. To date there has been very little analysis {{of the ways in which}} local authorities are approaching this task at a corporate level. The authors examine the theory and practice of joining up policymaking and service delivery in local government. They draw upon an analysis of the perspectives of key actors involved in the formulation and implementation of current local government reforms at the national level and the experiences of a sample of authorities that have been among the most active in seeking to integrate the various elements of the LGMA at local level. The evidence suggests that the superficially attractive logic of more integrated policymaking and service provision, which runs so strongly through current reforms, belies the multidimensional nature of joined-up working. The presentation of the LGMA as a coherent package of reforms therefore disguises the degree to which different forms of joining up may conflict. In particular, the push for closer vertical integration between local and central government, with ever-tighter control being exerted from the centre over priorities and performance, is seen as <b>constraining</b> <b>progress</b> towards more effective horizontal joined-up working at a local level. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe must soon “run {{the world}} on renewables” but cannot, and should not try to, {{accomplish}} this entirely with electricity transmission. We need to supply all energy, not just electricity, from diverse renewable energy (RE) resources, both distributed and centralized, where the world's richest RE resources – oflarge geographic extent and high intensity – are stranded: far from end-users with inadequate or nonexistent gathering and transmission systems to deliver the energy. Electricity energy storage cannot affordably firm large, intermittent renewables at annual scale, while carbon-free gaseous hydrogen (GH 2) and liquid anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) fuels can: GH 2 in large solution-mined salt caverns, NH 3 in surface tanks of various sizes, both pressurized and refrigerated, from home and village to continental scales. “Smart Grid” is emerging as primarily a DSM (demand side management) strategy to encourage energy conservation. Making the electricity grid “smarter” does not: 1. Increase physical transmission capacity; 2. Provide affordable annual-scale firming storage for RE; 3. Solve grid integration problem for large, time-varying RE; 4. Alleviate NIMBY objections to new transmission siting; 5. Reduce the high O&M costs of overhead electric lines. The “smarter” grid may be more vulnerable to cyberattack. Adding storage, control, and quality adjunct devices to the electricity grid, to accommodate very high renewables content, may be technically and economically inferior to GH 2 and NH 3 RE systems. We need to expand our concept of “transmission”, to synergistically and simultaneously solve the transmission, firming storage, and RE integration“balancing” problems severely <b>constraining</b> <b>progress</b> toward “running {{the world on}} renewables”...|$|R

This speciation continuum {{can range from}} weak or no divergence to strong genetic differentiation between populations. Here, {{we focus on the}} early phases of adaptive divergence in the East African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, which occurs in both Lake Tanganyika (LT) and inflowing rivers. We first assessed the population structure and morphological differences in A.  burtoni from southern LT. We then focused on four lake-stream systems and quantified body shape, ecologically relevant traits (gill raker and lower pharyngeal jaw) as well as stomach contents. Our study revealed the presence of several divergent lake-stream populations that rest at different stages of the speciation continuum, but show the same morphological and ecological trajectories along the lake-stream gradient. Lake fish have higher bodies, a more superior mouth position, longer gill rakers and more slender pharyngeal jaws, and they show a plant/algae and zooplankton-biased diet, whereas stream fish feed more on snails, insects and plant seeds. A test for reproductive isolation between closely related lake and stream populations did not detect population-assortative mating. Analyses of F 1 offspring reared under common garden conditions indicate that the detected differences in body shape and gill raker length do not constitute pure plastic responses to different environmental conditions, but also have a genetic basis. Taken together, the A.  burtoni lake-stream system constitutes a new model to study the factors that enhance and <b>constrain</b> <b>progress</b> towards speciation in cichlid fishes...|$|R

This review approaches the retrospective of Biological Control in Brazil in recent decades, with an emphasis on the "culture of applying agrochemicals" adopted by Brazilian growers, which <b>constrains</b> <b>progress</b> in this area. Successful cases of Biological Control have been reported on in Brazil and there are, in fact, excellent programs in place that use insects or entomopathogenic microrganisms for insect pest control. Most of the studies in this area have been published in Portuguese and are, therefore, not readily available internationally. Importantly, half of the planted sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), around four million hectares, is treated with natural enemies (insects) and/or pathogens. In contrast to other countries that employ Biological Control in small areas, the challenge in Brazil is to implement programs in large farms. Many obstacles must be overcome and discussed in working groups so that we can assume a world leadership position in the use of Biological Control in tropical regions as Brazil is already considered the leader in tropical agriculture. In this review, use of Biological Control is discussed within the Integrated Pest Management philosophy, as a path toward sustainable agriculture that is in harmony with other pest control methods. We must develop a technology of Biological Control adapted to tropical regions, rather than copying models developed for temperate regions, which are usually inappropriate for Brazilian conditions...|$|R
40|$|Spacetime Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) {{methods are}} used to solve {{hyperbolic}} PDEs describing wavelike physical phenomena. When the PDEs are nonlinear, the speed of propagation of the phenomena, called the wavespeed, {{at any point in}} the spacetime domain is computed as part of the solution. We give an advancing front algorithm to construct a simplicial mesh of the spacetime domain suitable for DG solutions. Given a simplicial mesh of a bounded linear or planar space domain M, we incrementally construct a mesh of the spacetime domain M × [0, ∞) such that the solution can be computed in constant time per element. We add a patch of spacetime elements to the mesh at every step. The boundary of every patch is causal which means that the elements in the patch can be solved immediately and that the patches in the mesh are partially ordered by dependence. The elements in a single patch are coupled because they share implicit faces; however, the number of elements in each patch is bounded. The main contribution of this paper is sufficient constraints on the progress in time made by the algorithm at each step which guarantee that a new patch with causal boundary can be added to the mesh at every step even when the wavespeed is increasing discontinuously. Our algorithm adapts to the local gradation of the space mesh as well as the wavespeed that most <b>constrains</b> <b>progress</b> at each step.

This indicates that the implemented policies, being either “people centred” (as in market driven) or “place based” (addressing regional disparity) did not sufficiently address equitable growth.

Some countries are moving forward with dealing with these legacies, and accordingly have built up appropriate technical resources and expertise, but many national programmes still face very significant challenges. However some factors <b>constraining</b> <b>progress</b> in addressing legacies from the past remain. There is for that reason a need to better understand the global situation and to analyse the barriers impeding the implementation of decommissioning and environmental remediation programmes, with the aim of outlining actions that may improve current situations where progress is impaired. The IAEA 'CIDER' project was launched in March 2013 in support of these objectives and with the support of other international organisations, particularly the European Commission and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The present document aims to support the development of adequate policies in IAEA Member States for decommissioning and environmental remediation, addressing in essence the following three fundamental questions: - What are the motivations for implementing decommissioning and environmental remediation? - What are the main constraints hindering progress of decommissioning and environmental remediation programmes? - What are the solutions for overcoming these constraints, taking account of experience from programmes under implementation? This document, prepared in close collaboration with the IAEA, makes concise yet comprehensive proposals in answer to those questions, drawn from the results of a global survey performed in advance of the CIDER project and on the more extensive analysis provided in the CIDER project report, which was elaborated by expert groups from IAEA Member States.

40|$|Effectiveness of the Lebanese {{government}} to address environmental challenges is constrained by large variety of factors. The impact of trust {{is a major}} factor that shapes environmental management and affects its outcomes. Nevertheless, knowledge of trust relationships and as a factor affecting environmental management is significantly lacking in the case of Lebanon. This research studies trust and cooperation relationships, and their impact on the environmental management process in North-Lebanon, from the perceptions of the three main stakeholders involved: public sector stakeholders, private sector stakeholders, and citizens. Based on 499 surveys with citizens and 49 interviews with public and private sector stakeholders, the results demonstrate lack of trust and cooperation among the stakeholders and that this hinders environmental management in Lebanon. The lack of trust leads citizens to reserve their participation in environmental activities, or to not comply with regulations and decisions related to environmental management. Moreover, it <b>constrains</b> <b>progress</b> of planned projects, even sometimes causing delay and cancellation. The results also reveal that some stakeholders successfully circumvent environmental regulations by using trust and cooperation with public authorities to effectively obstruct environmental regulations. The thesis argues that willingness to cooperate for general interest is lower than that related to the incentives for trust and cooperation leading to personal benefit. Solid waste management, specifically in the Al-Fayhaa Union area, was used as a case study. Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping was applied to a stakeholders meeting and revealed “lack of trust relationships” as a central variable in the relationship between trust and other factors affecting solid waste management in northern Lebanon. One of the resulting maps, combining perceptions of all 29 participants, indicated that trust was rated second among the top 10 variables with a high centrality in the solid waste management system.

Through four qualitative {{case studies of}} Australian universities, we find that institutional forces <b>constrain</b> or <b>progress</b> the internationalisation process. Exploratory in-depth interviews with university managers help draw out six paired propositions of diametrically opposed institutional forces. The three pillars of new institutional theory: coercive, normative and mimetic isomorphism, are seen to interactively impact market commitment in the empirical context of internationalising universities. For coercive pressures, host and home governments are shown to impact internationalisation positively and negatively. In terms of normative pressures, {{the pursuit of a}} particular external identity for each case appears to impact whether or not the universities internationalise further. For mimetic pressures, the success and failure of competing organisations’ internationalisation projects are proposed to influence levels of market commitment with knowledge of failed competitors shown to weigh heavily on the minds of decision-makers when considering new internationalisation projects. Despite the limited generalisability of this study, this approach may be useful in other studies of highly institutional fields where institutional forces oppose each other as constraints and enablers. 26 page(s...|$|R

METHODS We have carried out a documentary analysis of the ordinances, technical reports, conference reports, normative resolutions, and decrees from 2009 to 2014. RESULTS This is a time of consolidation of the psychosocial model, with expansion of the health care network and inversion of the funding for community services with a strong emphasis on the area of crack cocaine and other drugs. Mental health is an underfunded area within the chronically underfunded Brazilian Unified Health System. The governance model <b>constrains</b> the <b>progress</b> of essential services, which creates the need for the incorporation of a process of regionalization of the management.

This lack of a clear vision {{may be due to the}} fact that the Chinese discourse on world order is still a work in <b>progress,</b> <b>constrained</b> by internal practices, and Africa is its testing ground for the construction of a discourse that China envisages as an alternative...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{extremely}} limited hardware resources on sensor nodes and the clement deploying environment, the adversary Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack becomes a serious security threat toward wireless sensor networks. Without adequate defense mechanism, the adversary can simply inundate the network by flooding the bogus data packets, and paralyze the partial or whole sensor network by depleting node battery power. Prior work on false packet filtering in sensor networks are mostly based on symmetric key schemes, with {{the concern that}} the public key operations are too expensive for the resource <b>constrained</b> sensors. Recent <b>progress</b> in public key implementations on sensors, however, has shown that public key is already feasible for sensors. In this paper, we present PDF, a Public-key based false Data Filtering scheme that leverages Shamir’s threshold cryptography and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and effectively rejects 100 % of false data packets. We evaluate PDF by real world implementation on MICAz motes. Our experiment results support the conclusion that PDF is practical for real world sensor deployment...|$|R
40|$|Tropical peatlands {{are known}} {{not only for}} their high, area-based, carbon {{emissions}} in response to land-use change but also as hot spots of debate about associated data uncertainties. Perspectives are still evolving on factors underlying the variability and uncertainty. Debate includes the ways of reducing emissions through rewetting, reforestation and agroforestry. A knowledge value-chain that is long and complex links (a) fundamental understanding of peat and peatland processes leading to sciencebased quantification and default values, (b) willingness and (c) ability to act towards emission reduction, and ultimately (d) to local, national and global actions that effectively provide rules, incentives and motivation to conserve peat and reduce emissions. We discuss this value chain, its stakeholders and issues that still remain partially unresolved. We conclude that, to shorten the denial and conspiracy-theory stages of debate that otherwise slow down steps B and C, networks of international and national scientists have to be involved at the early stage of identifying policysensitive environmental issues. Models span part of the knowledge value-chain but transition of analysis units requires specific attention, from soil volumes through area and commodity flows to opportunities for reductions. While drainage of peatlands triggers landscape-scale increases in emissions, factors beyond drainage depth, including nutrient supply, may have {{a major influence on}} decomposition rates. Attempts to disentangle the contributions of plant and peat-based respiration in surface flux measurements involve assumptions that cannot be easily verified in comparisons between land uses. With progress on A leading to new internationally accepted defaults and with resistance on step B reduced, the reality of C and lack of working solutions for D is currently <b>constraining</b> further <b>progress...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{iterative}} {{algorithm is}} developed to estimate LIDAR ratio for a thin cirrus cloud over an aerosol layer. First, the thin cirrus cloud is screened out {{and replaced by}} a modeled LIDAR signal and the extinction coefficients of the aerosol layer are derived using the Fernald backward method. These aerosol coefficients are referred as the “actual values”. Second, the original LIDAR signal which includes the thin cirrus cloud is also inverted by the Fernald backward method down to the aerosol layer but using different LIDAR ratio for the thin cirrus cloud. Depending on the different assumptions about the LIDAR ratio of the thin cirrus cloud, different sets of aerosol extinction can be derived. The “actual values ” which {{are found in the}} first step can be used to <b>constrain</b> this iterative <b>progress</b> and the correct LIDAR ratio of the thin cirrus cloud can be found. The detailed description of this method and retrieval examples are given in the paper. The cases compared with other methods are presented and the statistical result is also shown and agrees well with other studies...|$|R
