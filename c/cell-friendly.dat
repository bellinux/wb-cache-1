40|$|Topic: Cellular {{migration}} and biomaterialsINTRODUCTION: For human body tissue regeneration, different approaches, including scaffold-based[1], growth factor-based[2] and cell-based tissue engineering[3], are explored. In cell-based tissue engineering, developing appropriate vehicles for cell encapsulation and delivery is highly important. The process of cell encapsulation must be <b>cell-friendly</b> for achieving high cell viability. Moreover, for microspherical delivery vehicles, {{the diameter of}} cell-encapsulated microspheres is a critical factor. The diameter should not be too small or too large. Degradation properties of polymers for microspheres are another important factor for cell delivery.

While flowing through a microchannel, cells migrate sideways, influenced by an acoustic field, into streams of increasing acoustic impedance, until reaching their cell-type specific point of zero acoustic contrast. We establish an experimental procedure and provide theoretical justifications and models for iso-acoustic focusing.

40|$|International audienceConceiving {{biomaterials}} able {{to mimic}} the specific environments of extracellular matrices are a prerequisite for tissue engineering applications. Numerous types of polymers (PEG, PLA, etc.) {{have been used for}} the design of biocompatible scaffolds, but they are still less efficient than natural biopolymers such as collagen extracts. Chemically modified and loaded with different bioactive factors, biopolymers afford an environment favourable to cell proliferation and differentiation. Unfortunately, they present several drawbacks, such as weak batch-to-batch reproducibility, potential immunogenicity and high cost of production. Herein we propose a fully synthetic covalent hydrogel obtained by sol-gel polymerisation of a silylated peptide. We selected a short and low molecular building-block derived from the consensus collagen sequence [Pro-Hyp-Gly]. Interestingly, the sol-gel process occurs in physiological buffer, enabling the embedment of stem cells.

40|$|Summary of thesis: Tissue {{engineering}} {{seeks to}} mimic the properties and functionalities of biological tissue. In the context of bone repair, tissue engineering is becoming an increasingly important science in the active search for synthetic alternatives to autografts. The purpose of this work has been to develop and characterize an organic-inorganic composite material with potential applications {{within the field of}} bone tissue engineering. A simple, fast and <b>cell-friendly</b> fabrication of an alginate and calcium phosphate based composite was comprehensively explored and emphasis was put on the development of a thorough characterization protocol. Alginate, a biopolymer well-known for its ionotropic gelation and cell-encapsulation abilities, has been combined with calcium phosphate minerals to explore its potential as a scaffold material for hard tissue applications and as a model system to study mineral formation in the presence of an organic matrix. A one step counter-diffusion method was applied to simultaneously gel the alginate and precipitate the mineral. Characterization of this composite was performed using bulk, end-point techniques such as X-ray diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analysis to investigate mineral phase and content, respectively, as well as in situ optical characterization of gelling kinetics and mineralization. The in situ studies were performed in a model system to map the spatial distribution of mineral within the composite and the formation and maturation of the mineral crystals primarily using confocal Raman microspectroscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. A robust, <b>cell-friendly</b> fabrication protocol for a phase-pure brushite-alginate composite has been developed using brushite seed crystals. Using a correlative characterization scheme with spatiotemporal resolution developed in this work, the mineralization process during the formation of this composite was comprehensively described and shown to include the presence of amorphous calcium phosphate, which quickly dissolved and led to brushite growth in the presence of seeds and conversion to octacalcium phosphate in the absence of brushite seeds. Further maturation {{led to the formation of}} thermodynamically stable hydroxyapatite in both cases. The findings in this study may improve the design of scaffold materials based on alginate-calcium phosphate composites and contributes to the understanding of crystallization within hydrogel matrices...|$|E

Micropatterns, nanopatterns, nanoparticles and bio-hybrid materials have been widely used as physicochemical factors in conjunction with proper functionalities on material surfaces in order to (i) maintain multipotency of the MSCs for long-term culture [15], (ii) control cell adhesion, migration and proliferation [16, 17], and (iii) guide their differentiation into specific lineages [1, 18, 19]. Among various materials available for stem cell studies, carbon-based materials, including fullerenes, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene/graphene oxide (GO) have shown immense potential for <b>cell-friendly</b> and cell-adhesive materials with lower toxicity [20, 21]. Remarkably, these carbon-based materials have demonstrated their excellent capabilities in stem cell differentiation into specific lineages, especially for bone (osteogenic) differentiation. This could be attributed to their unique surface properties, such as absorption/repulsion of specific differentiation factors, and improvement in cell adhesion via the interaction between the cell membrane and the surface of the carbon materials [22, 23].|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) composite scaffold {{was prepared}} for enhanced cartilage tissue engineering, which was composed of a poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) backbone network and a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) -block-poly(ethylene glycol) -block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA–PEG–PLGA) thermogel surface. The composite scaffold not only possessed adequate mechanical strength similar to native osteochondral tissue as a benefit of the PCL backbone, but also maintained <b>cell-friendly</b> microenvironment of the hydrogel. The PCL network with homogeneously-controlled pore size and total pore interconnectivity was fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM), and was impregnated into the PLGA–PEG–PLGA solution at low temperature (e. g., 4 °C). The PCL/Gel composite scaffold was obtained after gelation induced by incubation at body temperature (i. e., 37 °C). The composite scaffold showed {{a greater number of}} cell retention and proliferation in comparison to the PCL platform. In addition, the composite scaffold promoted the encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to differentiate chondrogenically with a greater amount of cartilage-specific matrix production compared to the PCL scaffold or thermogel.

With this aim, we studied the <b>cell-friendly</b> and biocompatible behavior of RKKP glass-ceramic coated Titanium (Ti) surface seeded with human amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) from placenta. The sol-gel synthesis procedure was used to prepare the RKKP glass-ceramic material, which was then deposited onto the Ti surface by Pulsed Laser Deposition method. The cell metabolic activity and proliferation rate, the cytoskeletal actin organization, and the cell cycle phase distribution in hAMSCs seeded on the RKKP coated Ti surface revealed no significant differences {{when compared to the}} cells grown on the treated plastic Petri dish. The health of of hAMSCs was also analysed studying the mRNA expressions of MSC key genes and the osteogenic commitment capability using qRT-PCR analysis which resulted in being unchanged in both substrates.

In this study, polycaprolactone micro and nano-fiber based vascular grafts were evaluated in the rat abdominal aorta replacement model for 1. 5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (n = 3 for each time point). The grafts were evaluated for patency, thrombosis, compliance, tissue regeneration, and material degradation. Results show excellent structural integrity throughout the study, with no aneurysmal dilation, and perfect patency with no thrombosis and limited intimal hyperplasia. Endothelialization, cell invasion, and neovascularization of the graft wall rapidly increased until 6 months, but at 12 and 18 months, a cellular regression is observed. On the medium term, chondroid metaplasia takes place in the intimal hyperplasia layers, which contributes to calcification of the grafts. This study presents issues with degradable vascular grafts that cannot be identified with short implantation times or in vitro studies.

Existing studies have shown significant demands for generating {{a certain level of}} wall shear stress (WSS) on scaffold microstructural surfaces for promoting cellular response and attachment efficacy. Recently, its role in shear-induced erosion of polymer scaffold has also drawn increasing attention. This paper proposes a bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) approach for design of scaffold microstructure in terms of the WSS uniformity criterion, by downgrading highly-stressed solid elements into fluidic elements and/or upgrading lowly-stressed fluidic elements into solid elements. In addition to this, a computational model is presented to simulate shear-induced erosion process. The effective stiffness and permeability of initial and optimized scaffold microstructures are characterized by the finite element based homogeni zation technique to quantify the variations of mechanical properties of scaffold during erosion. The illustrative examples show that a uniform WSS is achieved within the optimized scaffold microstructures, and their architectural and biomechanical features are maintained for a longer lifetime during shear-induced erosion process. This study provides a mathematical means to the design optimization of cellular biomaterials in terms of the WSS criterion towards controllable shear-induced erosion. 10 page(s...|$|E

We study encapsulation with the controllable release and diffusion properties ofpoly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVPON), poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), silk-polylysine, silk-polyglutamic acid, pure silk films, and E-coli cells from the multi-printing process. Specifically, we investigate the effect of thickness, the number of bilayers, and the hydrophobicity of substrates on the properties of inkjet/stamping multilayer films such as structural stability, responsiveness, encapsulation efficiency, and biosensing properties. We suggest that a more thorough understanding of the LbL assembly using inkjet printing and stamping techniques can lead to the development of encapsulation technology with no limitations on either the concentration of loading, or the chemical and physical properties of the encapsulated materials.

The scaffolds should be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine specific morphologies at different scales and dimensions capturing characteristic features and functionalities of the extra-cellular matrix. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce scaffolds. We have a particular interest in developing systems based in biodegradable polymers. Those demanding applications require a combination of mechanical properties, processability, <b>cell-friendly</b> surfaces and tunable biodegradability that are specific for the application. Electrospinning is a versatile technique used to produce synthetic polymeric ultrafine fibers. It enables the production of non-woven meshes with fiber diameters in the nanometer range with high surface area-to-volume ratio and high porosity. Those meshes can mimic some aspects of the extracellular matrix of human tissues and be used as scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.

Here, we present a novel approach based on a hybrid printing technique to create cellularized 3 D printed constructs. The hybrid bioprinting strategy combines a reinforcing gel for mechanical support with a bioink to provide a cytocompatible environment. In comparison with thermoplastics such as [Formula: see text]-polycaprolactone, the hydrogel-based reinforcing gel platform enables printing at <b>cell-friendly</b> temperatures, targets the bioprinting of softer tissues and allows for improved control over degradation kinetics. We prepared amphiphilic macromonomers based on poloxamer that form hydrolysable, covalently cross-linked polymer networks. Dissolved at a concentration of 28. 6 %w/w in water, it functions as reinforcing gel, while a 5 %w/w gelatin-methacryloyl based gel is utilized as bioink. This strategy allows for the creation of complex structures, where the bioink provides a cytocompatible environment for encapsulated cells. Cell viability of equine chondrocytes encapsulated within printed constructs remained largely unaffected by the printing process.

Based on this concept, xanthan, a bacterial extracellular polysaccharide with potential as encapsulating matrix, was conjugated with hydrophobic palmitoyl groups to obtain an amphiphilic system able to form capsules by self-assembly processes. The conjugation of xanthan was performed at different xanthan/palmitoyl chloride ratios and Fourier transformed infrared, 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, as well as wide angle X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry were performed to characterize the obtained conjugates.

Inkjet printing is a versatile tool that can be used for a broad range of applications. Ubiquitous in households, offices and industry, there has been growing interest in the use of inkjet printing for biological applications. Inkjet printing allows the user to deposit nano-picolitre volume of inks of low viscosity with high precision and high repeatability. Within this thesis, inkjet printing was used to explore its applications in the life sciences, with jetting behaviour and scaffold design optimised. The creation of <b>cell-friendly</b> scaffolds was investigated. Gelatin scaffolds, crosslinked with inkjet printed glutaraldehyde were fabricated. Fibroblasts were seeded onto these fabricated scaffolds and shown to proliferate without hindrance, allowing a method to create sub-millimetre <b>cell-friendly</b> fibres for tissue engineering applications. The ability for inkjet printing to create scaffolds to control cell alignment was investigated. Cell orientation can be controlled through inkjet printing paraffin wax to restrict cell proliferation on a substrate. Paraffin wax is not harmful or toxic to cells, and cells were able to grow within the negative spaces between the wax patterns, to create aligned cell culture as cells proliferated. An advantage with the wax scaffolds was that the wax scaffold was readily removable with a scalpel that allowed further analysis of cell behaviour when proliferating into an unrestricted space. A proportion of cells was also detached upon wax removal, proportional to cell density within the wax scaffold and wax channel width. After wax removal, cell cultures quickly lost their ordered appearance within 3 days as they proliferated randomly across the substrate. The creation of in vitro vasculature models through the use of a combination of inkjet-printed wax, PDMS moulding and wax-loss method to create medical phantoms for the study of rheological behaviour was studied. The scalloping behaviour of the printed wax vessel was reduced in the final phantom created, as there would be a thin lining of wax that covers the interior of the PDMS mould after wax removal, making the vessel smoother. Cell printing of neuronally relevant cells were investigated. NG 108 - 15 and porcine Schwann cells (along with fibroblasts to act as a control experiment) were inkjet printed, studying cell viability during and after inkjet printing. It was concluded that cells were not significantly damaged during inkjet printing over a wide range of voltages (50 V- 230 V), and no correlation was seen to show an increase in cell death with increasing voltages. Inkjet printed NG 108 - 15 cells showed they produced longer neurites compared to control samples after 7 days. Further to results, it was confirmed that cell printing is limited to a duration of less than 40 minutes due to cell aggregation within the reservoir of the printing system, causing a steady significant decrease in cell numbers during printing. ...|$|E

Protein-based microbubbles are typically obtained by dispersing of gas phase in the protein solution. The protein deposited/cross-linked on the gas/liquid interface stabilizes the gas core. Innovative applications of protein-MBs prompt the investigation on the properties of MBs obtained using different proteins that are able to confer them specific properties and functionality.

Microfluidic technology has proven very useful in the creation of <b>cell-friendly</b> microenvironments. Such techniques are, however, currently limited to a few cell types.

40|$|Trehalose is a {{naturally}} occurring disaccharide which {{is associated with}} extraordinary stress-tolerance capacity in certain species of unicellular and multicellular organisms. In mammalian cells, presence of intra- and extracellular trehalose {{has been shown to}} confer improved tolerance against freezing and desiccation. Since mammalian cells do not synthesize nor import trehalose, the development of novel methods for efficient intracellular delivery of trehalose has been an ongoing investigation. Herein, we studied the membrane permeability of engineered lipophilic derivatives of trehalose. Trehalose conjugated with 6 acetyl groups (trehalose hexaacetate or 6 -O-Ac-Tre) demonstrated superior permeability in rat hepatocytes compared with regular trehalose, trehalose diacetate (2 -O-Ac-Tre) and trehalose tetraacetate (4 -O-Ac-Tre). Once in the cell, intracellular esterases hydrolyzed the 6 -O-Ac-Tre molecules, releasing free trehalose into the cytoplasm. The total concentration of intracellular trehalose (plus acetylated variants) reached as high as 10 fold the extracellular concentration of 6 -O-Ac-Tre, attaining concentrations suitable for applications in biopreservation. To describe this accumulation phenomenon, a diffusion-reaction model was proposed and the permeability and reaction kinetics of 6 -O-Ac-Tre were determined by fitting to experimental data. Further studies suggested that the impact of the loading and the presence of intracellular trehalose on cellular viability and function were negligible. Engineering of trehalose chemical structure rather than manipulating the cell, is an innocuous, <b>cell-friendly</b> method for trehalose delivery, with demonstrated potential for trehalose loading in different types of cells and cell lines, and can facilitate the wide-spread application of trehalose as an intracellular protective agent in biopreservation studies...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the development of}} biomimetic matrices that are simultaneously <b>cell-friendly,</b> allow rapid vascularization, exhibit enough mechanical integrity to be comfortably handled and resist mechanical stresses when implanted in the site of interest. Meeting all these requirements with a single component material has proved to be very challenging. The hypothesis underlying this work was that hybrid materials obtained by combining scaffolds with bioactive hydrogels would result in a synergy of their best properties: a construct with good mechanical properties, easily handled and stable thanks to the scaffold; but also, because of the gel, <b>cell-friendly</b> and with enhanced oxygen and nutrients diffusion, and promoter of cell colonization. Moreover, such a composite material would also be useful as a controlled release system because of the gel’s incorporation. Poly (ethyl acrylate) (PEA) scaffolds prepared with two different morphologies were envisaged to provide the mechanical integrity to the system. Both types of scaffolds were physicochemically characterized and the effect of the scaffolds production process on the PEA properties was examined. The scaffolds preparation methods affected the PEA properties; nevertheless, the modifications induced were not detrimental for the PEA biological performance. Two different bioactive gels were studied as fillers of the scaffolds’ pores: hyaluronan (HA), which is a natural polysaccharide, and a synthetic self-assembling peptide, RAD 16 -I. HA is ubiquitously present in the body and its degradation products have been reported to be angiogenic. RAD 16 -I is a synthetic polypeptide that mimics the extracellular matrix providing a favourable substrate for cell growth and proliferation. Given the hydrophobic nature of poly(ethyl acrylate), the combination of PEA scaffolds with aqueous gels raised a number of problems regarding the methods to combine such different elements, the ways to gel them inside the pores, and the procedures to seed cells in the new composite materials. Different alternatives to solve these questions were thoroughly studied and yielded protocols to reliably obtain these complex structures and their biohybrids. An extensive physico-chemical characterization of the components’ interaction and the combined systems was undertaken. As these materials were intended for cardiac tissue engineering applications, the mechanical properties and the effect of the fatigue on them were studied. The different composite systems here developed were homogeneously filled or coated with the hydrogels, were easy to manipulate, and displayed appropriate mechanical properties. Interestingly, these materials exhibited a very good performance under fatigue. The use of the composite systems as a controlled release device was based on the possibility of incorporating active soluble molecules in the hydrogel within the pores. A release study of bovine serum albumin (BSA), intended as a model protein, was performed, which served as a proof of concept. The biological performance of the hybrid scaffolds was first evaluated with fibroblasts to discard the materials cytotoxicity and to optimize the cell seeding procedure. Subsequently, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultures were performed for their interest in angiogenic and vascularization processes. Finally, co-cultures of HUVECs with adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal cells (MSCs) were carried out. These last cells are believed {{to play an important role}} for clinical regenerative medicine, and their cross-talk with the endothelial cells enhances the viability and phenotypic development of HUVECs. Through the different experiments undertaken, hybrid scaffolds exceeded the outcome achieved by bare PEA scaffolds. Arnal Pastor, MP. (2014).

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{advancement}} of regenerative medicine technologies, {{there is an}} urgent need {{for the development of}} new, <b>cell-friendly</b> techniques for obtaining nanofibers—the raw material for an artificial extracellular matrix production. We investigated the structure and properties of PCL 10 nanofibers, PCL 5 /PCL 10 core-shell type nanofibers, as well as PCL 5 /PCLAg nanofibres prepared by electrospinning. For the production of the fiber variants, a 5 – 10 % solution of polycaprolactone (PCL) (Mw = 70, 000 – 90, 000), dissolved in a mixture of formic acid and acetic acid at a ratio of 70 : 30 m/m was used. In order to obtain fibers containing PCLAg 1 % of silver nanoparticles was added. The electrospin was conducted using the above-described solutions at the electrostatic field. The subsequent bio-analysis shows that synthesis of core-shell nanofibers PCL 5 /PCL 10, and the silver-doped variant nanofiber core shell PCL 5 /PCLAg, by using organic acids as solvents, is a robust technique. Furthermore, the incorporation of silver nanoparticles into PCL 5 /PCLAg makes such nanofibers toxic to model microbes without compromising its biocompatibility. Nanofibers obtained such way may then be used in regenerative medicine, for the preparation of extracellular scaffolds: (i) for controlled bone regeneration due to the long decay time of the PCL, (ii) as bioscaffolds for generation of other types of artificial tissues, (iii) and as carriers of nanocapsules for local drug delivery. Furthermore, the used solvents are significantly less toxic than the solvents for polycaprolactone currently commonly used in electrospin, like for example chloroform (CHCl 3), methanol (CH 3 OH), dimethylformamide (C 3 H 7 NO) or tetrahydrofuran (C 4 H 8 O), hence the presented here electrospin technique may allow for the production of multilayer nanofibres more suitable for the use in medical field...|$|E
40|$|Various {{fabrication}} methods {{including traditional}} chemical engineering methods and advanced Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques are currently used {{for construction of}} tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds. Traditional techniques have several limitations as they usually can’t control pore size, pore geometry and spatial distribution of pores properly. In contrast, AM advanced techniques can simply control {{the internal and external}} structure of scaffolds and overcome some intrinsic limitations of conventional methods such as shape restrictions, manual intervention, inconsistent and inflexible processing procedures. In order to these advantages, there has been trend in recent years on fabrication of TE scaffolds using AM processes directly or indirectly. In particular, extrusion freeforming systems such as fused deposition modelling (FDM), bioplotting, robocasting, and solvent-based extrusion freeforming have been widely investigated for producing TE scaffolds and bioactive constructs due to their ability of processing different biomaterials, their possibility of manufacturing scaffolds in a <b>cell-friendly</b> environment, their high reproducibility and flexibility, and their simple process control in comparison with other AM techniques. Despite the daily progress in the use of extrusion freeforming methods in regenerative medicine there are still some aspects such as process resolution need to be improved to meet the requirement in different biomedical applications. A solvent-based extrusion freeforming device was designed and set up to print 3 D bioceramic lattice structures with highly uniform interconnected pores (as fine as 30 µm) for different application. Filaments can be delivered with high precision with diameters down to 60 mm thanks to our unique nozzle design and the equipment built in-house at Southampton. The effect of nozzle die land on extrusion pressure was investigated and used as a guide to optimize the nozzle design to make high resolution bioceramic lattice structures with decrease extrusion pressure. In this talk, the effects of process parameters including nozzle size and die land, paste rheology, and bioceramic particle size on extrusion pressure, uniformity and resolution of the 3 D printed lattice structures will be discussed in detail<br/...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{strategies that}} I have developed to introduce mechanical and biochemical heterogeneity into synthetic tissue engineering scaffolds for heart valves. For a tissue engineered heart valve to work well, it {{must meet the}} mechanical demands of the natural heart valve and support healthy valve cell behavior. Natural heart valve leaflets have a heterogeneous structure with distinct layers that provide the valve with unique mechanical functions. My research focused on mimicking the mechanics and biochemical signaling of each layer so that the entire scaffold will function similar to the natural valve. Three specific strategies to add heterogeneity into tissue engineered heart valve scaffolds are described in this thesis. First, I designed an innovative method to direct the proper spatial arrangement of cell adhesive peptides {{in order to promote}} the correct organization of the two different cell types in the valve (valve endothelial cells and valve interstitial cells). Second, hyaluronan hydrogels were utilized as a mechanical and biochemical mimic of the middle, spongiosa layer of heart valves. Third, I learned how valve interstitial cells respond to synthetic fibrous structure in 3 D culture by designing a composite scaffold made from poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels and electrospun polyurethane fibers. The electrospun fibers were incorporated to give the valve scaffold the anisotropic, viscoelastic, and non-linear mechanical behavior similar to native valves, while the hydrogel material functioned as a <b>cell-friendly</b> substrate. These specific research projects provide methods and results that advance the heart valve tissue engineering field while having broad applicability to other tissue engineering applications, especially for tissues which have a layered structure and a stratified distribution of multiple cell types. The results of this research also lay the groundwork for constructing heart valve scaffolds for the purpose of in vitro disease modeling. A synthetic heart valve model based on this research would be more consistent than explant animal valves and could be used to study the initiation and progression of heart valve disease...|$|E
40|$|Objective : The {{cellular}} microenvironment {{plays an}} important role in controlling the cellular behavior. Therefore, in Tissue Engineering strategies, systems have been designed so that by combining cells, signaling molecules and engineered substrates, one can mimic as closely as possible the native microenvironment of the extracellular matrix. In this context, injectable hydrogels have been developed that allow controlling the cellular spatial distribution and that provide a 3 D support. However, many of these systems fail to replicate the mechanical properties of tissues and more significantly to provide a <b>cell-friendly</b> environment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the cellular response of human adipose stem cells (hACS) within a growth factor-enriched injectable hydrogel. Methods : Hydrogels were formed by combining platelet lysates (PLs) with a methacrylated gellan gum (MeGG) solution at different ratios. The hydrogels were further stabilized by photopolymerization. The parameters of photocrosslinking were varied and the dynamical mechanical properties evaluated for all the conditions. Total protein content released from the hydrogels was quantified for all the conditions using micro-BCA assay. Human ASCs were both seeded on the surface of the hydrogels for 7 days and encapsulated within the materials for 14 days. Results and discussion : Hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties were fabricated by changing the volume ratio of PLs and MeGG. The highest elastic modulus (nearly 500 kPa) was achieved for the condition with the lowest volume of PLs (2 MeGG: 1 PLs), being significantly more elastic than MeGG alone. The rate of release of proteins present in the PLs from the PLs-MeGG hydrogels was higher for the condition with equal volume of MeGG and PLs (1 MeGG: 1 PLs), as a result of the lower crosslinked polymer network. Human ASCs cultured onto the engineered surfaces showed a good metabolic activity and proliferation. Immunostaining revealed that MeGG:PL combinations fostered the attachment and spreading of cells. A strikingly improved cellular behavior was observed for the formulations with PLs, when compared to MeGG alone. This behavior was further confirmed at a 3 D scale, demonstrated by a significantly higher cellular metabolic activity on the hydrogels with PLs...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a painful}} {{degenerative}} joint disease that affects millions of North Americans. OA {{could be better}} managed if tissue engineers can develop methods to create long-term mechanically stable engineered articular cartilage tissue substitutes. Many of the tissue engineered cartilage constructs currently available lack the chemical stimuli, <b>cell-friendly</b> environment, and/or mechanical strength needed for use in joint cartilage repair. The goal of my research was to test the efficacy of composite scaffolds comprised of a solid synthetic polymer framework impregnated with a fibrin/alginate hydrogel containing hyaluronic acid (HA) and/or chondroitin sulphate supplements (CS). The suitability of a polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and iron(III) oxide material slurry as the synthetic polymer framework was determined. It was found that a solid three-dimensional scaffold with an interconnected porous structure could be fabricated from this material using dispensing-based rapid prototyping. Moreover, films of the PLGA-iron oxide material supported higher cell populations of porcine chondrocytes compared to a previously reported PLGA-hydroxyapatite material film. In addition, an experiment examining the effects of HA and/or CS macromolecule supplementation on chondrocytes cultured in a fibrin-alginate hydrogel was performed. Chondrocytes cultured in fibrin-alginate hydrogels retained their phenotype better than chondrocytes cultured in monolayer as analysis of expression of type I collagen and type II collagen mRNA transcripts. HA or CS supplementation of the hydrogels increased matrix production {{during the first week}} of culture. However, the effects of these supplements on matrix accumulation were not additive and were no longer observed after 2 weeks of culture. Supplementation of the hydrogels with HA and/or CS increased the chondrocyte cell population after two weeks of culture, and the effects of these macromolecule on cell numbers were additive. Finally, composite scaffolds were successfully fabricated by impregnating the solid PLGA-iron oxide scaffold with a CS-supplemented fibrin-alginate hydrogel. However, a large amount of cell death that occurred during the cell seeding prevented quantification of cellular DNA or sulphated GAG accumulation in these composite scaffolds. Nevertheless, my research suggests that, with refinement of the cell seeding process, a CS supplemented fibrin-alginate/PLGA-iron oxide composite may be a superior three-dimensional scaffold system for use in articular cartilage tissue engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|Fiber bundles {{are present}} in many tissues {{throughout}} the body. In most cases, collagen subunits spontaneously self-assemble into a fibrilar structure that provides ductility to bone and constitutes the basis of muscle contraction. Translating these natural architectural features into a biomimetic scaffold still remains a great challenge. Here, a simple strategy is proposed to engineer biomimetic fiber bundles that replicate the self-assembly and hierarchy of natural collagen fibers. The electrostatic interaction of methacrylated gellan gum with a countercharged chitosan polymer leads to the complexation of the polyelectrolytes. When directed through a polydimethylsiloxane channel, the polyelectrolytes form a hierarchical fibrous hydrogel demonstrating nanoscale periodic light/dark bands similar to D-periodic bands in native collagen and align parallel fibrils at microscale. Importantly, collagen-mimicking hydrogel fibers exhibit robust mechanical properties (MPa scale) at a single fiber bundle level and enable encapsulation of cells inside the fibers under <b>cell-friendly</b> mild conditions. Presence of carboxyl- (in gellan gum) or amino- (in chitosan) functionalities further enables controlled peptide functionalization such as Arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) for biochemical mimicry (cell adhesion sites) of native collagen. This biomimetic-aligned fibrous hydrogel system can potentially {{be used as a}} scaffold for tissue engineering as well as a drug/gene delivery vehicle. S. S. and D. F.

40|$|Non-viral gene {{delivery}} vectors with messenger RNA (mRNA) as a carrier of genetic information {{are among the}} staple gene transfer vectors for research in gene therapy, gene vaccination and cell fate reprogramming. As no passage of genetic cargo {{in and out of}} the nucleus is required, mRNA-based vectors typically offer the following five advantages: 1) fast start of transgene expression; 2) ability to express genes in non-dividing cells with an intact nuclear envelope; 3) insensitivity to the major gene silencing mechanisms, which operate in the nucleus; 4) absence of potentially mutagenic genomic insertions; 5) high cell survival rate after transfection procedures, which do not need to disturb nuclear envelope. In addition, mRNA-based vectors offer a simple combination of various transgenes through mixing of several mRNAs in a single multi-gene cocktail or expression of a number of proteins from a single mRNA molecule using internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes), ribosome skipping sequences and proteolytic signals. However, on the downside, uncontrolled extracellular and intracellular decay of mRNA can be a substantial hurdle for mRNA-mediated gene transfer. Procedures for mRNA delivery are analogous to DNA transfer methods, which are well-established. In general, there are three actors in the {{gene delivery}} play, namely, the vector, the cell and the transfer environment. The desired outcome, that is, the efficient delivery of a gene to a target cell population, depends on the efficient interaction of all three parties. Thus, the vector should be customised for the target cell population and presented in a form that is resistant to the aggressive factors in the delivery milieu. At the same time, the delivery environment should be adjusted to be more vector-friendly and more <b>cell-friendly.</b> The recipient cells should be subjected to a specific regimen or artificially modified to become receptive to gene transfer with a particular vector and resistant to the environment. As a rule, barriers outside tissues (e. g. mucus) and an aggressive intercellular environment complicate gene delivery in vivo, which, therefore, requires more complex gene transfer procedures than transfection of tissue culture cells. This review is focused on transfection methods for mRNA vectors, which rely either on the forceful propulsion of mRNA inside the target cells (e. g. by electroporation or gene gun) or on the complexing of mRNA with other substances (e. g. polycationic transfection reagents) for delivery via endocytic pathways...|$|E
40|$|Genetic or {{physical}} cells manipulation aspires {{to be new}} challenges in tissue engineering. Current technologies to generate tissues, such as micro-scale hydrogels (microgel) assembly, scaffold seeding, molding or bio-printing suffer from the difficulty to control cells organization, multi-steps time consuming procedures and/or potentially cytotoxic side effects. In this PhD, we aimed at developing <b>cell-friendly</b> and rapid techniques, easily transferable to biological laboratories, for two broadly challenging applications: bone healing and neural tissue engineering, for which the above-mentioned techniques cannot yet provide widely reliable models. In case of a bone critical size defect, external help is often needed for bone healing, and gold-standard for care is bone autograft. Alternatively, the fracture healing process can be stimulated and restored by the implantation at the fracture site of hydrogels embedding growth factors. Both technologies suffer however from side effects such as donor site morbidity or cells over-proliferation in the hydrogel proximity. Moreover, the kinetic of growth factors release cannot be temporally controlled. In this work, we aim at developing an alternative method using ultrasound to spatially and temporally control growth factors release within a biocompatible material: fibrin hydrogels. Towards this goal, we encapsulated, in lipoplexes, plasmids that are {{under the control of}} a heat-shock promoter. We then transfected cells, stimulate the production of the targeted protein by heat shock and reported its expression. We also optimized an encapsulation protocol for cells within fibrin gels. This proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of transfection by lipoplexes with a plasmid under control of heat shock, and pave the way for future developments of in situ transfection of autologous cells, for a tight temporal and spatial control of therapeutic proteins expression using ultrasound-induced hyperthermiaManipuler génétiquement ou physiquement des cellules présente un très grand intérêt pour l'ingénierie tissulaire mais soulève encore de nombreux challenges.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{possible}} embodiements of Advanced Therapies {{and in particular}} of Tissue Engineering the use of temporary scaffolds to regenerate tissue defects {{is one of the}} key issues. The scaffolds should be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine specific morphologies and surface chemistry with the local release of bioactive agents. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce scaffolds aiming the regeneration of a wealth of human tissues. We have a particular interest in developing systems based in nanofibrous biodegradable polymers 1, 2. Those demanding applications require a combination of mechanical properties, processability, <b>cell-friendly</b> surfaces and tunable biodegradability that need to be tailored for the specific application envisioned. Those biomaterials are usually processed by different routes into devices with wide range of morphologies such as biodegradable fibers and meshes, films or particles and adaptable to different biomedical applications. In our approach, we combine the temporary scaffolds populated with therapeutically relevant communities of cells to generate a hybrid implant. For that we have explored different sources of adult and also embryonic stem cells. We are exploring the use of adult MSCs 3, namely obtained from the bone marrow for the development autologous-based therapies. We also develop strategies based in extra-embryonic tissues, such as amniotic fluid (AF) and the perivascular region of the umbilical cord 4 (Whartonâ s Jelly, WJ). Those tissues offer many advantages over both embryonic and other adult stem cell sourcess. These tissues are frequently discarded at parturition and its extracorporeal nature facilitates tissue donation by the patients. The comparatively large volume of tissue and ease of physical manipulation facilitates the isolation of larger numbers of stem cells. The fetal stem cells appear to have more pronounced immunomodulatory properties than adult MSCs. This allogeneic escape mechanism may be of therapeutic value, because the transplantation of readily available allogeneic human MSCs would be preferable as opposed to the required expansion stage (involving both time and logistic effort) of autologous cells. Topics to be covered: This talk will review our latest developments of nanostructured-based biomaterials and scaffolds in combination with stem cells for bone and cartilage tissue engineering.

40|$|Renewable {{cellulose}} nanofibrils (CNFs) and chitin nanofibrils (ChNFs) {{are very}} attractive bionanoparticles {{due to their}} outstanding properties such as remarkable mechanical properties, flexible surface functionalities, thermostability, barrier properties, large surface area, biocompatibility and for their global availability from renewable resources and food waste. Nowadays, the research concerning materials based on CNFs and ChNFs {{is still in its}} infancy. This thesis deals with fundamental and groundbreaking research regarding CNF- and ChNF-based materials (fibers, hollow fibers and scaffolds) in connection with additive manufacturing techniques. The merging of defined nanoscale building blocks with advanced additive manufacturing techniques is of eminent importance for the preparation of multiscale and highly functional materials with de-novo designed architectures. In terms of mechanical properties, one major bottleneck to maximize those of materials based on CNFs and ChNFs (e. g. nanopapers and macroscale fibers) is to find pathways to control their direction of alignment and understand how preferred alignment correlates with macroscale mechanical properties. In this context, I processed CNF and ChNF dispersions into high-performance macroscopic fibers using much more environmentally friendly routes compared to the established processes to produce cellulose- and chitin-based macrofibers. In chapter 2, I show that strain-rate controlled wet-stretching of rehydrated macroscale fibers composed of CNFs and ChNFs induces a high degree of orientation and also that the degree of alignment scales with macroscale mechanical stiffness. I find similar degrees of alignment in both types of nanofibril-based macrofibers, yet substantially different macroscale stiffness, with the CNF-based fibers (ECNF = 33 GPa) outperforming the ChNF-based ones (EChNF = 12 GPa) considerably. These differences can be correlated to the mechanical properties of the underlying cellulose I and α-chitin crystals and the degree of crystallinity of the nanofibrils, which both govern the stiffness of an individual nanofibril. This study likely demonstrates the maximum performance in terms of stiffness of materials prepared by CNFs and ChNFs and reveals a critical difference in the performance of both classes of bionanoparticles. Beyond mechanical properties, I explored the capabilities of CNFs and ChNFs in the field of tissue engineering by fabricating scaffolds with potential applications as temporal supports during the regeneration of bone tissue. This study is shown in chapter 3. The development of hierarchically ordered materials having designed porosities from the macro to nanoscales remains very challenging in material science and engineering. Such materials are essential {{to a wide range of}} technologies, in particular for tissue engineering, where producing hydrogel scaffolds with multi-scale topographies potentially allows the instruction of cellular behavior to target the organization of tissues. To address these issues, I developed a simple inverse templating strategy that enables the preparation of nanofibrillar hydrogel scaffolds with defined porosities in the macro- and nanoscale. First, together with the Wessling group (DWI), we designed a lithographic process that furnishes sacrificial gyroid scaffolds, based on a resin that degrades in alkaline media. After infiltration with hydrogels of highly crystalline and stiff CNFs and ChNFs, the templates were simply dissolved in mild alkaline solution, and hydrogel replicas of the templates were obtained. This simple approach represents a platform fabrication method for a range of hydrogel-based materials with de novo designed pore geometries. Subsequent cell studies in collaboration with Dr. John Hardy (presently at Lancaster University, UK) and Laura de Laporte (DWI) confirmed the biocompatibility of the CNF and ChNF-based scaffolds and revealed important differences in terms of cell attachment. Differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) into osteogenic outcome could be facilitated using a collagen bone mimetic coating, rendering these scaffolds interesting for bone tissue engineering. In the last study performed in this thesis (shown in chapter 4), I continued using the concept of reverse templating but this time using CNF hollow tubes as sacrificial templates to create macroscale tubular cell constructs. I demonstrate that dispersions of CNFs can be processed into complex shapes, and used as a sacrificial template to prepare freestanding cell constructs. I showcase the approach for the fabrication of hollow fibers using a controlled extrusion through a circular die into a coagulation bath. The dimensions of the hollow fibers are tunable, and the final tubes combine the nanofibrillar porosity of the CNF hydrogel with a sub-millimeter wall thickness and centimeter-scale length provided by the additive manufacturing technique. I also demonstrate that covalent and supramolecular cross-linking of the CNFs can be used to tailor the mechanical properties of the hydrogel tubes within one order of magnitude and in an attractive range for the mechanosensation of cells. The resulting tubes are highly biocompatible and allow for the growth of mouse fibroblasts into confluent cell layers in their inner lumen. A detailed screening of several cellulases enables to degrade the scaffolding, temporary CNF hydrogel tube in a quick and highly <b>cell-friendly</b> way, and allows the isolation of coherent cell tubes. I foresee that the growing capabilities of 3 D printing techniques in combination with the attractive features of CNFs – sustainable, globally abundant, biocompatible and enzymatically degradable – will allow to make plant-based biomaterials with hierarchical structures and on-demand degradation useful for instance to engineer complex tissue structures to replace animal models, and for implants...|$|E
