40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore an {{alternative}} formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. <b>The</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice are <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> that make human cooperation necessary and possible, and because human cooperation {{is necessary to}} justice, they make justice both necessary and possible. For constructivists, principles of justice respond to these <b>circumstances.</b> Standard accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice {{can be found in}} Hobbes, Hume, and Rawls, and many contemporary theorists rely on these accounts. My dissertation rejects these standard accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice—on <b>the</b> grounds <b>of</b> exclusion and trust—and defends an alternative account. A core idea of my proposed alternative is that <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice must be understood in terms of solidarity. A proper understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> solidarity in an adequate characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice requires a good grasp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> solidarity itself. To that end I offer a novel account of solidarity which I argue improves existing theories <b>of</b> solidarity. In <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> this project I explain the role and importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. I then offer a full description of solidarity and its normative character. In <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project I offer my new account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice, including an explanation and examples <b>of</b> how broad <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> this reformulation is. I conclude the project by applying my new account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice to <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> climate change, and ask whether we can now construe <b>the</b> coordination <b>of</b> resources between generations as a problem of justice...|$|R
