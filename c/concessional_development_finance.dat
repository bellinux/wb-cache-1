40|$|<b>Development</b> <b>finance</b> {{institutions}} {{which provide}} equity capital {{have been used}} to stimulate economic growth worldwide. The potential uses for equity <b>development</b> <b>finance</b> organizations in the United States have been recognized. Probably the most dramatic use, and one with broad economic ramifications is the establishment of an equity <b>development</b> <b>finance</b> institution to correct imperfections in the private capital market system of this country. One of the major flaws of the American capital market has been that the supply of capital for new small sized businesses has been artificially scarce. The focus of this Note will be, first to examine the reasons that the private capital market has failed to be an adequate source of equity capital for new small businesses. Second, this Note will review the structure and operations of the Canada Development Corporation, a <b>development</b> <b>finance</b> institution which makes equity investments in the Canadian economy. Finally, this Note will make recommendations as to how an equity <b>development</b> <b>finance</b> corporation modeled after the Canada Development Corporation, could be established in the United States to increase the availability of equity capital for small businesses...|$|R
40|$|The Philippines' recent {{economic}} performance has been remarkable amid the lingering {{slowdown in the}} global economy and the devastation brought about by recent natural disasters. The economy grew by 7. 2 percent in 2013, substantially higher than its 6. 8 percent growth in 2012. With GDP growth averaging at 5. 9 percent in the last three years, the Philippines is one of the better performers among the developing economies. However, the economy faces problems of high poverty incidence and income inequality. The main challenge is how to sustain rapid and inclusive growth. It is important for the government's inclusive growth strategy and development agenda to be supported by responsive <b>development</b> <b>finance.</b> This <b>Development</b> <b>Finance</b> and Aid Assessment prepared for the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) takes stock of current <b>development</b> <b>finance</b> in the Philippines.
