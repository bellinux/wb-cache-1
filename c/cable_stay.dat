50|$|Construction {{was carried}} out by Cleveland Bridge U.K. Ltd. Construction {{methodology}} by Richard Hornby & Bruce Ramsay of Cleveland Bridge. The bridge is the first <b>cable</b> <b>stay</b> bridge in the world constructed using the incremental launching method (ILM) for the superstructure erection. The construction was commenced in May 2000 and the bridge opened on 9 June 2003. The bridge is managed under a public-private partnership between the National Roads Authority on behalf of the Irish Government and a private company, Celtic Roads Group. The concession company has an obligation to maintain the road for 30 years.|$|E
50|$|A {{detailed}} inspection on 24 January found a stress fracture {{in a second}} support <b>cable</b> <b>stay,</b> like the one which had failed previously. Engineers determined {{that all of these}} connectors would have to be replaced; rather than a brief closure the bridge would have to remain closed for six months. In addition traffic on the river below was also halted. In March Nuttall began installing five temporary saddle frames atop the bridge's arch; these allowed the weight of the bridge to be supported without the hangers. This allowed them to replace defective fork connectors at {{the top and bottom of}} each hanger.|$|E
50|$|Line 1 of the Mumbai Metro {{spans the}} entire suburb of Andheri (Andheri metro station) {{connecting}} Versova {{in the west}} to Ghatkopar in the Eastern Suburbs, covering a distance of 11.4 km. It is fully elevated, and consists of 12 stations. 9 out of the 12 stations are in Andheri. Work on the corridor began on 8 February 2008. A <b>cable</b> <b>stay</b> bridge, spanning the Western railway line, on the project was completed at the end of 2012. The line opened for service on 8 June 2014. Latest statistics reveal that approximately 85 million passengers have used the metro line in the first 11 months since its launch.|$|E
2500|$|The Wye Bridge is a [...] long {{cable-stayed}} bridge, which {{crosses the}} border {{marked by the}} River Wye between England and Wales, [...] south of Chepstow. It consists of a single large <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> section with two single-leg pylons supporting the bridge deck from {{the centre of the}} roadway. The deck is an orthotropic box girder similar to the Severn Bridge but has a different appearance as it has two sets of <b>cable</b> <b>stays</b> on each of two towers. Originally there was only one set of <b>cable</b> <b>stays</b> but these were replaced during the strengthening works. The Wye Bridge was built by Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company.|$|R

50|$|Although {{differentiated}} from cable-stayed bridges in {{a number}} of areas, the principal and defining extradosal characteristic is the low height of the main towers or pylons, expressed as a proportion of the main span length. Classic cable-stayed designs employ a tower-height to main-span ratio of around 1:5 (or 0.20). In comparison, extradosed bridges have towers with height:span ratios of between 1:8 and 1:15 (0.125 to 0.067), with around 1:10 (0.10) being most common. This lower tower height results in a much flatter cable angle, typically ~ 17° to the horizontal, and a correspondingly much higher axial compression force within the bridge superstructure due to the greater horizontal force component within each <b>cable</b> <b>stay.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{cable-stayed}} system assumes all {{static and}} dynamic loads {{on which the}} very existence of the bridge depends. Cable stays are not designed to endure the entire lifetime of the bridge, but they are repairable and have the best possible protection from natural disasters and other adverse impacts.PSS cable stays consist of parallel strands of 15.7 mm diameter; every strand consists of seven galvanized wires. Cable stays incorporate from 13 to 79 strands. The length of the shortest <b>cable</b> <b>stay</b> is 135.771 m; the longest, 579.83 m. The protective housings of the cable stays are made from HDPE and have the following features:UV resistance; resistance to local climate conditions of Vladivostok (temperature range from minus 40 °C to plus 40 °C) and environmental aggressiveness.|$|E
50|$|Supported {{structure}} on the cable-stayed {{portion of the}} bridge consists of a composite girder, an A-shaped pylon and the <b>cable</b> <b>stays.</b> Overall span of the girder is 324.7 m. Concrete roadway slab is of generally constant depth of 25 cm. A total of 38 <b>cable</b> <b>stays</b> have been executed, comprising 27 to 61 steel wire cables placed in protective polyethylene pipes.|$|R

Please click on the alternative location to access it. 72 p. <b>Cable</b> <b>stayed</b> bridges, especially long-span <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> bridges, have become more and more popular due to their strong functionality. Large amplitude of cable vibrations such as parametric excitation may occur because of the traffic load or wind load or for a particular combination of cable and deck frequency. The present thesis involves parametrically induced vibrations in <b>stay</b> <b>cables</b> and the effect of the live load on the long-span Bill Emerson Memorial <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> bridge. Numerical simulation has been carried out to analyze the parametric behavior of the cable by using cable-mass and cable-beam models. Finite element code LS-DYNARTM has been used to analyze the transient nonlinear response of <b>stay</b> <b>cables</b> and bridge deck. Cables have been modeled by cable elements and seatbelt elements in LS-DYNARTM.

50|$|The Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor (SSTC) is a {{proposed}} transport link from the A19, {{through the city}} centre, to the port. A major phase of the plan {{is the creation of}} a new bridge, which will link the A1231 Wessington Way on the north of the river with the Grove site in Pallion, on the south of the river.In 2008, Sunderland City Council offered the residents of Sunderland the opportunity to vote on the design of the bridge. The choices were a 700 ft, iconic <b>cable</b> <b>stay</b> bridge, which would result in a temporary increase in council tax, or a simple road bridge which would be within the council's budget.The results of the consulatation were inconclusive, with residents keen to have an iconic bridge, but reluctant to have a subsequent increase in tax to fund it.Regardless of the ultimate design of the new bridge, the landing point will be the Grove site in Pallion. Plans for this site focus around {{the creation of a new}} residential area, with homes, community buildings, commercial and retail sites.|$|E
50|$|In 1979 {{a tender}} {{was called by}} the Queensland Main Roads Department for a new bridge {{crossing}} of the Brisbane River.The conforming design main span {{was designed as a}} balanced cantilever with two raised post tensioned concrete compression stays located on the median & over each of the two main piers to support the 260 metre span. Due to the proximity of the Brisbane Airport, an overall structural height constraint was provided due to aircraft flight path & clearances. This constraint ruled out the possibility of a conventional <b>Cable</b> <b>Stay</b> Bridge due to the height of the pylons that would be required.Due to cost considerations an alternative design concept was proposed by Bruce Ramsay (Manager Engineering) of VSL. This alternative design required a world record main span of 260m for a free cantilever concrete box girder bridge. The concept was adopted by one of the tenderers - Transfield Queensland Pty.Ltd. who were subsequently awarded the project {{on the basis of this}} alternative. It held the record span of 260m for over 15 years. The box girder is still the largest prestressed concrete, single box in the world, measuring 15m deep at the pier, with a box width of 12m and an overall deck width for the six lanes of 22m.|$|E
50|$|The dual-carriageway ends after {{bypassing}} Midleton with {{an ordinary}} two-lane road continuing east to Youghal. At Youghal a single carriageway bypass {{was completed in}} 2003, bringing the road around {{the west of the}} town to the northern side of Youghal. Here the road crosses the River Blackwater into County Waterford. Northeast of this, the road was widened as part of the N25 Kinsalebeg project. This consisted of widening of 3.5 kilometers of single carriageway to include a hard shoulder {{on both sides of the}} road. The route passes Dungarvan, with a future bypass at preliminary design stage, before reaching Kilmeaden west of Waterford city and onto the Waterford City Bypass. Beginning at Kilmeaden the bypass passes the Woodstown historic settlement, before crossing the River Suir (via a <b>cable</b> <b>stay</b> bridge of about 475m in length) between Gracedieu in County Waterford and Grannagh in County Kilkenny. The bypass meets the M9 Motorway and N24 at the Grannagh interchange, before joining the old N25 east of Slieverue. The bypass connects to the Outer Ring Road and the old N25 via a road known as the Western Link. (The bypass as a whole contains 23 km of dual carriageway* and 14 km of single carriageway.) The bypass is a tolled road.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Cable {{supported}} structures have distinctive dynamic behaviour. Extradosed bridge, {{which is}} intermediate to Girder Bridge and <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> bridge, owing to its shallow cables, the structure behaviour of Extradosed Bridge {{differs from that}} of <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> bridge. Forced vibration of structure for given Earthquake time history is governed by peak acceleration. For <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> structures such as Extradosed <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> bridge it is difficult to predict dynamic response using usual methods of dynamic analysis as applied to some other bridge structures like response spectrum analysis, accurate analysis like time history analysis is time consuming and has time and cost effects. Nonlinearities can only be considered in time history analysis. The proposed method correlates the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and earthquake deformation ratio (EDR) which can be used for simplified dynamic analysis and can prove handy tool for structural engineers to know earthquake related serviceability without much complicated analysis at initial stages. This ratio can be used to present seismic damage indices. The method is proposed considers Extradosed bridge for example...|$|R
