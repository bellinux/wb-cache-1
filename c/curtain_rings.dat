500|$|Peter {{visits the}} Quahog Mini-Mart where Chris works {{after a visit}} to the local spa. After he threatens to sue the store for Chris' [...] "sexual remarks", Peter is given an {{unlimited}} gas coupon for a year by Carl. Peter begins {{to take advantage of the}} card, even taking a trip into space, until Lois suggests that the family travel to the Grand Canyon. They leave early the next morning but inadvertently leave Stewie behind at home, only realizing that when they visit the site of 9/11. They first contact Joe but cannot get a hold of him. They then contact Cleveland and Quagmire to look after Stewie. After not receiving any calls from either of them, Lois insists that the family return home to Stewie. While driving the car, Peter somehow enters the car next to them, causing the Griffins' car to crash. When the family attempts to ride a train home, Peter spends the last of the money that they saved on <b>curtain</b> <b>rings.</b> Lois becomes angered and blames all their misfortunes on Peter's stupidity, only to feel ashamed when he informs her that everyone else respects him for who he is. Eventually, Brian is able to get the family a ride in a pickup truck bound for Quahog.|$|E

6000|$|Deepest blue was {{the lake}} that day--the {{day when they}} had the mock tournament, and the men rode clumsy farm horses around in a glade in the woods and caught <b>curtain</b> <b>rings</b> {{on the end of a}} lance. Such fun! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good Lord, sir!" [...] he cried, with amazement on his face. Holmes put {{his finger}} on his lips, {{replaced}} his hand in his breast pocket, and burst out laughing as we turned down the street. [...] "Excellent!" [...] said he. [...] "Come, friend Watson, the <b>curtain</b> <b>rings</b> up for the last act. You will be relieved to hear {{that there will be no}} war, that the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no setback in his brilliant career, that the indiscreet Sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion, that the Prime Minister will have no European complication to deal with, and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{then there}} was the power of every day. Benham {{imagined}} himself at large on his liberating steed of property while indeed he was mounted on the made horse of Civilization; while he was speculating whither he should go, he was already starting out upon the round. One hesitates upon the magnificent plan and devotion of one's lifetime and meanwhile there is usage, there are engagements. Every morning came Merkle, the embodiment of the established routine, the herald of all that the world expected and required Benham to be and do. Usually he awakened Benham with the opening of his door and the soft tinkle of the <b>curtain</b> <b>rings</b> as he let in the morning light. He moved softly about the room, gathering up and removing the crumpled hulls of yesterday; that done he reappeared at the bedside with a cup of admirable tea and one thin slice of bread-and-butter, reported on the day's weather, stood deferential for instructions. [...] "You will be going out for lunch, sir. Very good, sir. White slips of course, sir. You will go down into the country in the afternoon? Will that be the serge suit, sir, or the brown?" ...|$|E
60|$|None of her {{troubles}} {{were allowed}} to interfere with Mrs. Frost's peace. Outwardly, she was cheerful and helpful; equable, though less lively. Those carpets and curtains, tables and chairs, which were the grand topics at the House Beautiful, were neither neglected nor treated with resigned impatience. Mary's taste, counsel, and needle did good service; her hearty interest and consideration {{were given to the}} often-turned volume of designs for bedsteads, sofas, and window-curtains; and Miss Mercy herself had hardly so many resources for making old furniture new. Many of her happiest half-hours with Louis were spent as she sewed the stiff slippery chintz, and he held the <b>curtain</b> <b>rings,</b> while Aunt Catharine went to inspect the workmen, and many a time were her cares forgotten, and her active spirits resumed, while Louis acted carpenter under her directions, and rectified errors of the workmen. It might not be poetical, but the French sky-blue paper, covered with silvery fern-leaves, that Louis took such pains to procure, and the china door-handles that he brought over in his pockets, and the great map which Mary pasted over the obstinate spot of damp in the vestibule, were the occasions of the greatest blitheness and merriment that they shared together. Much did they enjoy the prediction that James would not know his own house; greatly did they delight in sowing surprises, and in obtaining Aunt Catharine's never-failing start of well-pleased astonishment. Each wedding present was an event;--Mr. Mansell's piano, which disconcerted all previous designs; Lord Ormersfield's handsome plate; and many a minor gift from old scholars, delighted to find an occasion when an offering would not be an offence. Even Mr. Calcott gave a valuable inkstand, in which Mrs. Frost and Louis beheld something of forgiveness.|$|E
5000|$|The 1987 film Planes, Trains and Automobiles has a {{character}} played by John Candy {{who is a}} <b>curtain</b> <b>ring</b> salesman. [...] His ability to sell the rings for their alternate uses (e.g., large earrings) {{is central to the}} plot of the movie.|$|R
60|$|The <b>curtain</b> <b>rang</b> up on {{the third}} act, and Beatrice, seated well back in the shadows, {{followed}} the play attentively, appreciated its good points and had every appearance of both understanding and enjoying it. Afterwards, she rose promptly to her feet, still clapping.|$|R
50|$|The film stars Steve Martin as Neal Page, a high-strung {{marketing}} executive, who meets Del Griffith, {{played by}} John Candy, an eternally optimistic, outgoing, overly talkative, and clumsy shower <b>curtain</b> <b>ring</b> salesman.

Curtain hardware products are made of varieties of materials including metals and plastics. Mostly aluminum and iron are used for making rings, hooks, rods and poles.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day {{they attempt to}} reach Chicago by train, but the locomotive breaks down, leaving the passengers stranded in a Missouri field. After reaching Jefferson City, Del sells his remaining shower <b>curtain</b> <b>rings</b> to buy bus tickets, but neglects to tell Neal that they are only valid to St. Louis. Upon arrival, Neal again offends Del over lunch and the two part ways.|$|E
60|$|The <b>curtain</b> <b>rang</b> up {{upon one}} of the most {{gorgeous}} and sensuous of the Russian ballets. John, who by their joint insistence was occupying the front chair in the box, leaned forward in his place, his eyes steadfastly fixed upon the stage. Both the prince and Lady Hilda, in the background, although they occasionally glanced at the performance, devoted most of their attention to watching him.|$|R
60|$|Act 2 was that, capering like a brute of a Zulu executioner, I {{retired from}} my victim and hid {{myself in a}} bush {{on the edge of}} the plateau at a {{distance}} of forty yards. After this there was a pause. The place was intensely bright with sunshine and intensely silent; as silent as the skeletons of the murdered men about me; as silent as Hans, who lay there looking so very small and dead in that big theatre where no grass grew. It was an eerie wait in such surroundings, but at length the <b>curtain</b> <b>rang</b> up for Act 3.|$|R

5000|$|Its Broadway premiere was {{produced}} and staged by Jed Harris with scenic design by Robert Edmond Jones. The play was a hit, running for 166 performances from 20 October 1933 to March 1934 at the Cort Theatre. Laurence Olivier appeared as Julian, Jill Esmond as Leonora, James Dale as Mr. Dulcimer, O. P. Heggie as Mr Owen and Leo G. Carroll as Trump. It was Heggie's final Broadway role. Harris's direction was lauded for its subtlety. Decades later, Olivier described the play as [...] "a wonderful piece of work... brilliantly done and sensationally successful". In the New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote: [...] "When the <b>curtain</b> <b>rings</b> down after a long, tense evening, {{you feel that}} the entire story has been brilliantly and forcefully told.... The theater has unleashed one of its thunderbolts." ...|$|E
50|$|The Adventures of Twizzle is {{the first}} {{television}} show produced by AP Films and specifically Gerry Anderson, after being approached by author Roberta Leigh (who also co-produced with Anderson) and her colleague Suzanne Warner. Sources vary as to who directed the series. In addition to his production duties, Anderson also directed the episodes with photography by Arthur Provis, Anderson's founding partner at AP Films. The music for the songs was written by Leslie Clair (a pseudonym for Leslie Solley) and scored by Barry Gray. Art direction was by Reg Hill and special effects were by Derek Meddings, all of whom would become long-time collaborators of Anderson. Twizzle, and all the puppets for the 52 episodes, were made by Joy Laurey. There were two Twizzle puppets made for filming, one for conventional shots and the second for stunt shots when Twizzle's arms and legs became longer, a trick that relied on a system of <b>curtain</b> <b>rings</b> and puppet strings pulled inside the puppets' arms and legs.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike most brigadiers, he was {{not given}} a {{paramilitary}} funeral, complete with volleys of gunfire fired over the coffin. It was a private affair, attended by only 14 mourners. As a further sign of his unpopularity among loyalists, a street disco was held in east Belfast to celebrate his death. Gray's effigy, with a <b>curtain</b> <b>ring</b> representing his trademark single gold earring, was thrown upon a bonfire. In lieu of murals dedicated to his memory, there was only graffiti scrawled on an east Belfast wall which read: [...] "Jim Gray RIP - Rest in Pink". Gray's estate was frozen by the Assets Recovery Agency {{as part of an}} investigation into his criminality.|$|R
60|$|Laverick {{had reached}} that stage {{when he felt}} indisposed to discuss Mademoiselle any longer with a {{stranger}}, even though that stranger should be her manager. He nodded and took up his programme. As he did so, the <b>curtain</b> <b>rang</b> up upon the next act. Laverick turned deliberately towards the stage. The little man had paid his respects, as he put it. Laverick felt disinclined for further conversation with him. Yet, though his head was turned, he knew very well that his companion's eyes were fixed upon him. He had an uncomfortable sense {{that he was an}} object of more than ordinary interest to this visitor, that he had come for some specific object which as yet he had not declared.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{sometimes}} {{the number on}} the ballot is printed on a perforated stub which is torn off and placed on a ring (like a shower <b>curtain</b> <b>ring)</b> before the ballot is cast into the ballot box. The stubs prove that an elector has voted and ensure that they can only vote once, but the ballots themselves are both secret and anonymous. At the end of voting day, the number of ballots inside the box should match the number of stubs on the ring, certifying that every ballot was cast by a registered elector, and that none of them were lost or fabricated. Sometimes the ballots themselves are numbered, making the vote trackable. This was ruled legal by Federal District Judge Christine Arguello, who ruled that the U.S. Constitution does not grant a right to a secret ballot.|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins]STEWART FIELDNEWBURGH, NEW YORK Friday 1815 Dearest Dottie, Good evening, darling. This is {{your little}} tour walker {{bringing}} you Sugar Report # 14 - 764 -N. Many items {{of great interest}} are in the news tonight. 1. I love you. 2. It was cold today 3. I love you. 4. Where did a certain girl in a certain town in New York get those beautiful eyes? 5. You’re wonderful 6. I love you. And that covers the news for this evening. Be sure to get your next Sugar Report from the nearest Postman tomorrow! Gosh hon, it will seem funny {{to have a long}} Saturday night for a change, one with the full twelve hours, instead of the scanty twelve minutes that these past few have been. It was swell to talk to you last night, even if it was about moves, and yellow gold, and turkish bath’s. We never seem to talk about important things do we? Except our wedding, and you. So—let’s talk about something important, for a change. O. K. hon, let’s get a yellow gold ring. I thought you didn’t like yellow gold. I like it better than white, it makes the diamond(s) look much brighter;—and also then we can get wedding bands that match. I looked at one that a fella has up here. It’s really sharp. About 1 / 16 ” thick. Sort of a design on it. You wouldn’t want just a plain band would, you? They look too much like <b>curtain</b> <b>rings.</b> We’ll probably have all this talked over {{by the time you get}} this, but it’s nice to talk about, anyhow. Gosh hon, I still can’t believe it. You of all people. Yes I remember the day we walked in the rain, I guess I fell in love with you that day. I remember we walked over to my house, and Owen came. We played some records on my Victrola. I can remember you lying in front of it on your stomach (I remember the damndest [sic] things). Gee I’ve known you a long time, haven’t I? Yet every time I see you, I fell [sic] that I meet you all over again, love’s a strange thing all right. Well darling I’ll see you Sunday, for about six puny hours. Until then I’ll count the minutes, (and the hours) I love you, darling,—you’ll never know how much. Give my best to your family. I love you— As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
60|$|The <b>curtain</b> <b>rang</b> up again, {{the play}} proceeded. But {{not the same}} play--at least, so it seemed to Matravers--not the same play, surely not the same woman! A {{situation}} improbable enough, but dramatic, had occurred {{at the very beginning}} of the second act. She had risen to the opportunity, triumphed over it, electrified her audience, delighted Ellison, moved Matravers to silent wonder. Her personality seemed to have dilated with the flash of genius which Matravers himself had been amongst the first to recognize. The strange pallor of her face seemed no longer the legacy of ill-health; her eyes, wonderfully soft and dark, were lit now with all manner of strange fires. She carried herself with supreme grace; there was not the faintest suspicion of staginess in any one of her movements. And more wonderful than anything to Matravers, himself a delighted worshipper of the beautiful in all human sounds, was that marvellously sweet voice, so low and yet so clear, expressing with perfect art the highest and most hallowed emotions, with the least amount of actual sound. She seemed to pour out the vial of her wrath, her outraged womanhood in tones raised little above a whisper, and the man who fronted her seemed turned into the actual semblance of an ashamed and unclean thing. Matravers made no secret now of his interest. He had drawn his chair to the front of the box, and the footlights fell full upon his pale, studious face turned with grave and absolute attention upon the little drama working itself out upon the stage. Ellison in the midst of his jubilation found time to notice what to him seemed a somewhat singular incident. In crossing the stage her eyes had for a moment met Matravers' earnest gaze, and Ellison could almost have declared that a faint, welcoming light flashed for a moment from the woman to the man. Yet he was sure that the two were strangers. They had never met--her very name had been unknown to him. It must have been his fancy.|$|R
2500|$|The {{humpback}} whale uses a feeding technique called bubble net feeding. A group of whales swim in a shrinking circle, blowing bubbles below {{a school of}} prey fish. Forage fish show a strong fear of bubbles and can be easily contained within a bubble <b>curtain.</b> The shrinking <b>ring</b> of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever smaller cylinder. The whales then lunge feed, often as a synchronised group, suddenly swimming upward through the [...] "net", mouths agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp. The ring can begin at up to [...] in diameter with perhaps a dozen whales cooperating. The use of a crittercam attached to whale's back has revealed that some whales blow the bubbles while others dive deeper to drive fish toward the surface, and yet others herd the prey into the net by vocalizing. Some {{humpback whale}}s also scare schooling fish by slapping their tails (lobtail). Although many whale species lunge feed, only humpbacks use bubble nets.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from critics and fans upon release, many noted its moving lyrics and tight instrumentation. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone likened the song to The Human League's [...] "Seconds" [...] and The Knife's [...] "Heartbeats" [...] and wrote: [...] "Underneath the <b>curtain</b> of synthesizers, <b>ringing</b> power chords, pulverizing drums and cheerfully shouted backing vocals, lead singer Win Butler tells a grim tale about cultural pressures that lead {{men and women}} to hate themselves." [...] In reviews for the song in The Independent, Jacob Stolworthy said the track [...] "signals that Arcade Fire's best days may not be behind them", and Christopher Hooton remarked, [...] "It's the kind of song where you don't know whether to cry or dance, and that's probably the best kind." [...] Jeremy Gordon of Spin described the synthesizer that sets the song's tempo as [...] "the sonic realization of the band's decade-old dream about the dark mystery of the city." [...] Pitchfork's Jillian Mapes said that while the song [...] "will stop someone from doing something rash ... Arcade Fire are pompous about knowing that, throwing their arms wide around the problem and presenting their own music as the solution." ...|$|R
