5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted <b>control</b> <b>stick.</b> Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn expanding interest at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in research work on aircraft side-arm <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> has necessitated {{the determination of}} the previous and ongoing projects involved with the development of side-arm <b>control</b> <b>sticks.</b> This paper presents a survey of the English language literature dealing with aircraft <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> over the period of 1936 to 1971. The result of the survey is an abstracted bibliography of significant literature related to the design and testing of aircraft <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> and a guide to the literature.

5|$|In 1080°s two trick modes, trick {{attack and}} contest, players accrue points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players {{to perform a}} series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, {{all of which are}} performed by using a combination of circular positions of the <b>control</b> <b>stick,</b> the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time. The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.|$|E
5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the <b>control</b> <b>stick.</b> It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E

5|$|The next title, Tomb Raider Chronicles, {{depicted}} the late Lara Croft via her friends' flashbacks. The game introduced stealth attacks, which would {{carry over to}} the next game, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. While the original development team worked on Chronicles, Core Design assigned a new team to develop Angel of Darkness for the PlayStation 2. Anticipating innovative changes from next generation consoles, Adrian Smith—co-founder of Core Design—wanted to reinvent the character {{to keep pace with}} the updated technology. Core Design conducted market research, including fan polls, to aid in Angel of Darknesss development. The development team felt it could not alter the character and instead opted to place her in a situation different from previous games. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed for more manoeuvres and a more detailed character model; the number of polygons in Croft's model increased to 4,400. The team sought to add more melee manoeuvres to better match Lara Croft's portrayal as an expert fighter in her backstory. Movement control was switched from the directional pad to the analogue <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> to provide more precision. After the original team finished Chronicles, it joined the development of Angel of Darkness. Excess content, missed production deadlines, and Eidos's desire to time the game's launch to coincide with the release of the 2003 Tomb Raider film resulted in a poorly designed game; Croft was brought back to life without explanation and the character controls lacked precision.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: <b>control</b> <b>stick,</b> rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|E
25|$|Paresev 1 - {{first flight}} on January 25, 1962, crashed on March 14, 1962. Frame {{fitted with a}} linen {{membrane}} wing and the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> coming from overhead {{in front of the}} pilot's seat.|$|E
5000|$|... "Twirling", [...] "sticking," [...] and [...] "stick juggling" [...] are all {{common terms}} {{for using the}} twirling prop known as devil sticks, flower sticks, or various other names. A set of devil sticks {{is made up of}} one baton and two <b>control</b> <b>sticks.</b>|$|R
25|$|The tail {{features}} a rudder mounted with a piano hinge {{on the right}} side only. The elevator is a full flying stabilator and incorporates anti-servo tabs inboard on both sides to increase pitch <b>stick</b> forces. The <b>controls</b> are actuated by dual <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> and conventional rudder pedals.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{is built}} from {{aluminum}} tubing {{and covered with}} pre-sewn Dacron sailcloth envelopes.

The single seat Drifter and XP503 are both stressed for +6/-3g.|$|R
25|$|Paresev 1A - {{first flight}} May 18, 1962, last flight was on June 28, 1962. Used a rebuilt frame from the Paresev 1, {{but had a}} <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> and a Dacron {{membrane}} wing.|$|E
25|$|McCornack {{had first}} {{installed}} a canard elevator on a Pfledge in 1978, {{but did not}} create a production model until 1980. The canard was operated by a side-mounted <b>control</b> <b>stick.</b> Fore-and-aft movement of the stick moved the canard and sideways movement controlled the tip-rudders. The canard was constructed with tubular spars, aluminum ribs and covered in standard aircraft fabric.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} air-to-air {{weaponry}} {{can be carried}} by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to release weapons effectively and safely, using the head-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or <b>control</b> <b>stick.</b> When the pilot changes from one weapon system to another, visual guidance for the required weapon automatically appears on the head-up display.|$|E
50|$|Infinite Air {{emphasizes}} simulation-style gameplay, {{much like}} HB Studios’ previous work with The Golf Club and Madden 15. Rather than executing tricks through button combos, players use the <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One controllers. The left <b>stick</b> <b>controls</b> carving, quick flips, and spins, while the right controls pre-loaded flip torques, shifties, tweaks, and the grab location on your board {{while in the}} air. The trigger buttons control right and left grabs.|$|R
5000|$|Barnstormers : An {{airplane}} ride {{in which}} riders control their height {{in the air}} by pulling back or pushing forward on <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> in the aircraft's' cockpits. This ride is not located in Kiddie City, but instead, near the Arcade. Opened in 1955 with all other 5 kiddie rides.|$|R
50|$|Some {{people also}} {{thought that the}} <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> used in the PS2 & Xbox {{controllers}} made the essential precision {{a little bit harder}} to achieve in the long run due to the smooth edges and deadzone, whereas those of the Gamecube controller had octagonal edges and no deadzones at all.|$|R
25|$|The {{driver and}} the {{passenger}} enter and exit the car {{through the front}} hatch that houses the windshield. The conventional steering wheel and the brake and throttle controls were replaced with a device similar to a airplane's yoke. When the driver pushes the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> forward the car speeds up, while when pulled back the car slows down. Turns are made by moving the yoke control left or right.|$|E
25|$|Mignet {{made the}} {{aircraft}} intentionally simple. The Flying Flea {{is essentially a}} highly staggered biplane, which almost could {{be considered to be}} a tandem wing aircraft, built of wood and fabric. The original design was a single-seater, and had two-axis flying controls. The aircraft had a standard <b>control</b> <b>stick.</b> Fore-and-aft movement controlled the front wing's angle of attack, increasing and decreasing the lift of the wing. Because the front wing was located forward of the center of gravity, that would pitch the nose up and down.|$|E
25|$|The Hughes 269 was {{designed}} with a fully articulated, three-blade main rotor, and a two-blade tail rotor that would remain as distinctive characteristics {{of all its}} variants. It also has shock absorber-damped, skid-type landing gear. The flight controls are directly linked to the swashplate of the helicopter {{so there are no}} hydraulic systems in the 269. There are generally two sets of controls, although this was optional on the civil 269A. For three-seat aircraft, the middle collective <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is removable and a seat cushion can be put in its place for the third passenger.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantis is a two-seat side-by side {{low wing}} {{aircraft}} with conventional landing gear. The fuselage is constructed of welded steel tubing. Fuel tanks {{are located in}} the wings. with a central header tank. The aircraft uses two <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> for each pilot and a pull-up flap handle between the seats. The seats recline to a 35 degree angle.|$|R
25|$|The wing is {{equipped}} with slotted Fowler flaps, which occupy 2/3 of the span. These deploy to 40 degrees and lower the stall speed by 9 knots to 51 knots (60mph). The flaps are always set to 20 degrees for takeoff. The ailerons are operated by <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> and feature end-fences inboard and outboard for better slow speed and stall handling.|$|R
50|$|The {{manipulation}} of the devil stick (also devil-sticks, devilsticks, flower sticks, gravity sticks, or juggling sticks) {{is a form of}} gyroscopic juggling or equilibristics, consisting of manipulating one stick ("baton") between one or two other sticks held one in each hand. The baton is lifted, struck, or stroked by the two <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> ('handsticks' or 'sidesticks'), stabilising the baton through gyroscopic motion.|$|R
25|$|The Hughes 269 {{was created}} with a fully articulated, {{counter-clockwise}} rotating, three-bladed main rotor, and a two-bladed tail rotor that would remain as distinctive characteristics {{of all its}} variants. It also has shock absorber-dampened, skid-type landing gear. The flight controls are directly linked to the control surfaces of the helicopter {{so there are no}} hydraulics in the 269. There are generally two sets of controls, although this was optional on the civil 269A. For three-seat aircraft, the middle collective <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is removable and a seat cushion can be put in its place for the third passenger. In the 300CB and 300CBi, the collective control can be repositioned to left-handed configuration for the Pilot In Command position (right seat).|$|E
25|$|Nintendo {{released}} Super Mario 64 in 1996. Before then, {{there was}} no established paradigm for bringing platform games into 3D. Mario 64 set a new standard, and it was imitated by many subsequent 3D platformers. Its gameplay allowed players to explore open 3D environments with greater freedom than any previous attempt at a 3D platform game. To aid this, Nintendo added an analog <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> to its Nintendo 64 controller, something which had not been included in a standard console controller since the Vectrex, and which has since become standard on other controllers. This allowed for the finer precision needed for a free perspective. Players no longer followed a linear path {{to the ends of}} levels, either, with most levels providing objective-based goals. There were a handful of boss levels that offered more traditional platforming.|$|E
25|$|Sin and Punishment is a rail shooter and {{shooting}} gallery video game co-developed by Treasure and Nintendo. Originally published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 in 2000, Sin and Punishment {{takes place in}} the near future of 2007 when humanity is struggling with a global famine. Scientists develop a new species to raise as food, but the creatures revolt and war breaks out. The player takes on the roles of Saki and Airan as they fight to save Earth from destruction. The game employs a unique Nintendo 64 controller layout, utilizing both the D-pad and <b>control</b> <b>stick.</b> This control scheme allows the player to strafe, jump, and dodge around the screen while simultaneously aiming the targeting reticle. The player must shoot at enemies and projectiles while also dodging attacks to survive and progress through the game.|$|E
2500|$|Pan Am Airlines, who {{traditionally}} called {{its famous}} luxury airliners [...] "Clippers", took offense at Piper {{using the name}} for their light aircraft. As {{a result of this}} pressure Piper further refined the model, adding wing flaps, further fuel tanks and replaced the <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> with yokes. A more powerful Lycoming O-290 125hp engine was installed and this model became the Piper PA-20 Pacer.|$|R
50|$|Most yokes are {{connected}} and will both move together, thus providing instant indication {{to the other}} pilot when one makes a control input. This {{is in contrast to}} some fly-by-wire <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> that allow each pilot to send different, and sometimes greatly conflicting, inputs such as was experienced on Air France Flight 447, the Airbus A330 Rio-Paris flight that crashed into the sea in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|A flat ride cymbal {{produces}} the tightest, driest, most <b>controlled</b> <b>stick</b> sound of all ride cymbals, {{but with an}} airy wash.
