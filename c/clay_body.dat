25|$|Chemical {{methods for}} {{cleaning}} ceramics involve water, solvents, acids, and alkalis. Prolonged soaking in water {{may be used}} as a conservation method. The goal is to either remove stains from the surface or to remove the soluble salts in the <b>clay</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{products}} of faience manufactories are {{identified by the}} usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: {{the character of the}} <b>clay</b> <b>body,</b> the character and palette of the glaze, and the style of decoration, faïence blanche being left in its undecorated fired white slip. Faïence parlante bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Apothecary wares, including albarelli, can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the faïence patriotique that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|A common {{degradation}} {{issue in}} ceramics involves soluble salts. Soluble salts can either enter the <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> from the environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, {{or they are}} already naturally occurring due to {{the components of the}} materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they crystallize. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the ceramic body. A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt crystallizing. Overtime the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the general}} rules of phase transformations in {{calcareous}} <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> during firing {{were used to}} estimate the equivalent firing temperature (EFT) of seventeenth century polychrome Persian haft rang tiles based on their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The novelty of this work is, however, that it handles the XRD patterns of archaeological <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> with principal component analysis (PCA) {{in order to have}} a new look at their firing and thermal behaviour. Statistically handling the XRD patterns, different clusters were discriminated in the <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> whose mineralogical composition showed various proportions of amorphous and quartz contents. The results showed interesting trends in the different clusters in terms of the EFT, quartz content, and the density of the bodies. The present work uses PCA for the first time to have a new look at XRD patterns of archaeological <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> and, moreover, to interpret the PCA results in order to estimate the EFT of a large number of archaeological <b>clay</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> a flux {{creates a}} limited and {{controlled}} amount of glass, which works to cement crystalline components together. Fluxes {{play a key}} role in the vitrification of <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> by reducing the overall melting point. The most common fluxes used in <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> are potassium oxide andsodium oxide which are found in feldspars. A predominant flux in glazes is calcium oxide which is usually obtained from limestone. The two most common feldspars in the ceramic industry are potash feldspar (orthoclase) and soda feldspar (albite).|$|R
50|$|Hoshino mixes red {{and white}} clay {{together}} by kneading them until she notices the <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> creating a uniquely organic form. At that moment, she hones in on the intrinsically Japanese concept of movement meeting stillness {{in a moment of}} clarity. From there, she utilizes a wire tool to texturize the surface along the <b>clay</b> <b>body’s</b> contours and to hollow out the piece to accentuate the naturalistic form.|$|R
25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|E
2500|$|In {{traditional}} Western terms, most celadons {{are strictly}} counted as stoneware, since the fired <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> is usually neither white nor translucent. In the traditional Chinese classification, which divides pottery into low-fired earthenware and high-fired porcelain, they count as porcelain. Compromise {{terms such as}} [...] "porcellanous stoneware" [...] {{may be used to}} describe the pieces, and some Western writers consider the wares should be [...] "regarded as porcelains".|$|E
2500|$|Yaozhou and {{the other}} Northern Celadons have a <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> that fires to a light grey under glaze, and a [...] "yellowish to olive-brown where exposed". [...] The glaze is transparent, at least until later examples, and lacks the {{opalescence}} that Longquan celadon received from millions of tiny gas bubbles trapped in the glaze, {{as well as the}} grey and blue tints that the green of southern wares could achieve. [...] Instead the colour [...] "tends to yellowish or muddy brown tones", generally where the reducing atmosphere is not strong enough.|$|E
5000|$|Dunting also {{occurs in}} wares {{produced}} from montmorillinite <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> {{due to the}} volume expansion of cristobalite during its inversion upon cooling. [...] "The release of free silica, takes place in montmorillonite above 950 C, but almost double the silica is released, compared to kaolin. Therefore, <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> with high amounts of montmorillonite contain {{a high percentage of}} free silica after firing, which may cause the ware to crack during cooling.(Dunting)" ...|$|R

2500|$|Arretine ware, {{in spite}} of its very {{distinctive}} appearance, {{was an integral part of}} the wider picture of fine ceramic tablewares in the Graeco-Roman world of the Hellenistic and early Roman period. [...] That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury tablewares made of silver. [...] Centuries before Italian [...] terra sigillata was made, Attic painted vases, and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or burnishing. [...] Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.|$|E
2500|$|Examination of {{excavated}} fragments {{shows the}} fired <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> {{is a light}} grey colour, sometimes compared to the colour of incense ash. Although stoneware by Western criteria (not a category recognised in traditional Chinese thinking), the wares are fired at a relatively low temperature, and are far from fully vitrified, absorbing water at a [...] "fairly high" [...] rate. Nor is the body free from flaws when examined under magnification. Since it was almost entirely covered by glaze, these issues did not detract from the wares. [...] Some authorities note that the body might really be considered earthenware, though it is always classified by Western writers as stoneware, because of the other Northern Celadons it relates to, and in Chinese terms as porcelain.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> is a {{necessary}} component of pottery. Clay must be mined and purified in an often laborious process, and certain tribes have ceremonial protocols to gathering clay. Different tribes have different processes for processing clay, which can include drying in the sun, soaking in water for days, and repeatedly running through a screen or sieve. Acoma and other Pueblo pottery traditionally pound dry clay into a powder and then remove impurities by hand, then running the dry powder through a screen, mixing it with a dry temper, and then mixing water to create a plastic paste. In preparing the clay, potters spend hours wedging it to remove air pockets and humidity that could easily cause it to explode during firing. The clay then needs to [...] "cure" [...] over time.|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Industrial Design) The {{research}} project entitled: The Analysis of Clay Materials {{for use in}} a Ceramic Studio was undertaken in order to give a quantitative base to the understanding of clay materials and their role in <b>clay</b> <b>bodies.</b> The project consists of analysing the clay materials as they are supplied, using technically sophisticated equipment. A set of data for each of the nine chosen clays was assembled and then correlated for easier comparison. The clay materials were then mixed into <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> using a set proportion in order that a comparison of the nine <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> could be made and related to the data assembled for the clay materials.

2500|$|Gladding, McBean & Co.’s ware {{would be}} {{produced}} in a new patented earthenware <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> known as Malinite. Dr. Andrew Malinovsky developed the high talc one-fire body using an amorphous flux in 1928 for Gladding, McBean & Co. Malinite was developed {{for use in the}} production of one-fire clay tile; however the company made the decision to use Malinite for their dinnerware production. By using the Malinite and adjusting the kiln temperature for a one fire process, the company solved the crazing problem in their own product. Glaze was applied to the unfired body, and the glaze and body matured together in the kiln, saving the company the time and expense of separate bisque firing for the body. [...] For the new line of pottery, Gladding, McBean & Co. decided to use Prouty tunnel kilns. The Prouty tunnel kiln patents were acquired in the purchase of the West Coast holdings of the American Encaustic Tiling Company in 1933. Prouty tunnel kilns allowed for the continuous flow of ware through the kiln to fire pottery. Thus the plant “combined mills, jiggering units, conveyors, dryers and kilns into a model of straight line output.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Slipware is pottery {{identified}} by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather-hard <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing. Slip is an aqueous suspension of a <b>clay</b> <b>body,</b> {{which is a}} mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. The slip placed onto a wet or leather-hard <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> surface by a variety of techniques including dipping, painting, piping or splashing.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic clays are {{water-based}} substances {{made from}} clay minerals and other raw materials. They are baked at high temperatures {{in a process}} known as firing to create ceramics, such as terra cotta, earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Paper clay produced by pottery clay manufacturers is a <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> to which a small percentage of processed cellulose fiber has been added. When kiln-fired, the paper burns out, leaving the <b>clay</b> <b>body.</b> Consequently, the firing temperatures and glazes selection should be the same on those used with the <b>clay</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Traditional Korean {{greenware}} has distinctive decorative elements. The {{most distinctive}} are decorated by overlaying glaze on contrasting <b>clay</b> <b>bodies.</b> With inlaid designs, known as sanggam in Korean, {{small pieces of}} colored clay are inlaid in the base clay.

50|$|Pottery is made {{by forming}} a ceramic (often <b>clay)</b> <b>body</b> into objects of a {{required}} shape and heating them to high temperatures in a kiln which removes all {{the water from the}} clay, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> can be decorated before or after firing; however, prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Kneading helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished either by a machine called a vacuum pug or manually by wedging. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a <b>clay</b> <b>body</b> has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping, it is dried and then fired.|$|E

40|$|Disposal of PC and TV sets is {{a growing}} problem, {{involving}} for over 40 wt. % waste glasses with high Pb (funnel) or Ba-Sr concentration (panel) which cannot be recycled in the glass manufacture. A possible way to re-use these glasses is in the manufacturing of clay bricks and roof tiles, that was appraised by laboratory simulation of the brickmaking processing and technological characterization of unfired and fired products. The recycling of both funnel and panel glasses into <b>clay</b> <b>bodies</b> is technologically feasible, resulting in a behaviour substantially plasticity-reducing during shaping-drying (implying a reduction of mechanical strength) and promoting sintering during firing. No significant release of Pb, Ba and Sr was found during firing and leaching test for the carbonate-poor body; in contrast, some Pb volatilization during firing and Sr leaching were observed for the carbonate-rich body. Additions of 2 wt. % appear to be practicable, while 5 wt. % glass induces unacceptable modifications of technological properties.
