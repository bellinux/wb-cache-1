5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> spoken or written language.

AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{contributions}} of metacognitive and self-regulated learning theories to research on students' calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> Historically, cognitive psychologists have studied calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> within a purely metacognitive framework, {{with an emphasis on}} the role of text and task factors but little consideration of factors of self. There has been a recent trend, however, towards incorporating a social cognitive perspective to the study <b>of</b> calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension,</b> with factors <b>of</b> self such as motivation and affect being examined more often. Among the factors of self that have been examined, self-efficacy has played a major role as it may be all but impossible to disentangle its influence on students' calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> Other variables <b>of</b> self that have been examined include ability, familiarity, ego and goal-orientation, goal setting, personality traits and susceptibility to social and cultural influences. Broadening the context in which calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> is assessed allows a more complete examination of the rich set of interrelated processes that affect students' performance...|$|R

Heigl originally wanted to play Izzie as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blond for the part. Heigl's <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> medical procedures and terminology is slight; the actress explained that while she has an admiration for doctors, she is not as fascinated by medicine as other cast members. When Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery left Grey's Anatomy to launch the spin-off show Private Practice, Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Izzie.|$|E
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for rescaling objective measures <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> {{so that they}} reflect amounts <b>of</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> on an absolute scale. The {{procedure is}} based upon rauding theory, a theory that interrelates reading ability, passage difficulty, reading time, and passage <b>comprehension.</b> The validity <b>of</b> the rescaling procedure is dependent upon one primary assump-tion—that {{the relationship between the}} objective measure <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> and the theoretical construct, accuracy <b>of</b> <b>comprehension,</b> is linear. The rescaling procedure was evaluated and illustrated by application to previously collected data. Four different measures <b>of</b> passage <b>comprehension</b> ad-ministered subsequent to reading yielded drastically different "percent com-prehension " scores—the average of all the errors among the measures at each rate was 15 %.

5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> him which is important.|$|E

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> the work of the modernista architect.|$|E

40|$|The main {{question}} discussed in current {{debates about the}} epistemology of testimony concerns whether the justification of testimonial beliefs is inferential or non-inferential. This thesis offers a novel argument for inferentialism, the former view. It does so through, firstly, assuming a widely shared view about the psychology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> – the inferential model of communication – along with widely shared views about the epistemic basing relation and inferential justification, and then, secondly, arguing that inferentialism in the epistemology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> - the view that (i) comprehension states are beliefs, and (ii) that the justification of such states is inferential - follows from these assumptions. It is then argued that inferentialism in the epistemology of testimony follows from inferentialism in the epistemology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> Through offering this argument, the thesis aims to demonstrate that our views about the psychology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> have far-reaching consequences for our theorizing {{in the fields of}} epistemology of testimony and epistemology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> In fact, widely held such views arguably have as a consequence that neither testimony nor <b>comprehension</b> are sources <b>of</b> non-inferential justification, an important epistemological insight...|$|R
