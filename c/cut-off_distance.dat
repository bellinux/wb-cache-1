Methods: A systematic review was performed via 8 databases to assess relevant English language full-text articles published from January 1, 1980 to October 31, 2009. Participant characteristics, interventions, reliability, validity, and predictive value for each article with respect to functional capacity as defined by peak VO 2 levels were extracted and compared. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) scores were determined for each study. Results: Fourteen studies met the selection criteria. Comparison of the studies investigating reliability shows that the 6 MWT has good reproducibility. The 6 MWT demonstrates moderate correlation with peak VO 2 levels, and ability to predict VO 2 (functional capacity) dependent on <b>distance</b> walked. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>distances</b> vary from 300 to 490 meters depending on the study; if total distance walked remains equal or less than these values, the 6 MWT retains its strong predictive value.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} spatial dependency in the technical efficiency estimates of rice farmers using panel data from the Central Visayan island of Bohol in the Philippines. Household-level {{data were collected from}} irrigated and rainfed agroecosystems. In each ecosystem, the geographical information on residential and farm-plot neighborhood structures was recorded to compare household-level spatial dependency among four types of neighborhoods. A Bayesian stochastic frontier approach that integrates spatial dependency was used to address the effects of neighborhood structures on farmers’ performance. Incorporating the spatial dimension into the neighborhood structures allowed for identification of the relationships between spatial dependency and technical efficiency through comparison with non-spatial models. The neighborhood structure at the residence and plot levels were defined with a spatial weight matrix where <b>cut-off</b> <b>distances</b> ranged from 100 m to 1, 000 m. We found that spatial dependency exists at the residential and plot levels and is stronger for irrigated farms than rainfed farms. We also found that technical inefficiency levels decrease as spatial effects are more taken into account. Because the spatial effects increase with a shorter network distance, the decreasing technical inefficiency implies that the unobserved inefficiencies can be explained better by considering small networks of relatively close farmers over large networks of distant farmers...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{holographic}} dark energy is proposed, following {{the idea that}} the short <b>distance</b> <b>cut-off</b> is related to the infrared cut-off. We assume that the infrared cut-off relevant to the dark energy is the size of the event horizon. With the input ΩΛ = 0. 73, we predict the equation of state of the dark energy at the present time be characterized by w = − 0. 90. March, 2004 The cosmological constant problem is a longstanding problem in theoretical physics, and has received even more serious considerations recently, due to the observational evidence for a non-vanishing value [1]. The direct evidence for the existence of the dark energy is further supported by other cosmological observations, in particular by the WMAP experiment [2]. For the first time in history, theorists are forced to explain not only why the cosmological constant is small, but also why it is comparable to the critical density (in this note we shall use terms the cosmological constant and the dark energy exchangeably.) A. Cohen and collaborators suggested sometime ago [3], that in quantum field theory a short <b>distance</b> <b>cut-off</b> is related to a long <b>distance</b> <b>cut-off</b> due to the limit set by formation of a black hole, namely, if ρΛ is the quantum zero-point energy density caused by a shor...|$|R

50|$|In principle, {{simulations}} of very large systems, approaching a cubic micron for milliseconds, are possible using a parallel implementation of DPD running on multiple processors in a Beowulf-style cluster. Because the non-bonded forces are short-ranged in DPD, {{it is possible}} to parallelize a DPD code very efficiently using a spatial domain decomposition technique. In this scheme, the total simulation space is divided into a number of cuboidal regions each of which is assigned to a distinct processor in the cluster. Each processor is responsible for integrating the equations of motion of all beads whose centres of mass lie within its region of space. Only beads lying near the boundaries of each processor's space require communication between processors. In order to ensure that the simulation is efficient, the crucial requirement is that the number of particle-particle interactions that require inter-processor communication be much smaller than the number of particle-particle interactions within the bulk of each processor's region of space. Roughly speaking, this means that the volume of space assigned to each processor should be sufficiently large that its surface area (multiplied by a distance comparable to the force <b>cut-off</b> <b>distance)</b> is much less than its volume.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{two types of}} systems – {{surfactants}} and phospholipids, which are amphiphilic molecules composed of hydrophilic head-groups and hydrophobic tail-groups. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with atomistic forcefield were carried out on monolayers {{of a series of}} linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), which are the most popular synthetic surfactant family, at the water/air interface. The structures and properties, such as surface tension, tilt angles, solubility, mobility, are investigated and compared for different LAS homologs and isomers. A set of coarse-grained (CG) model was developed for studying the phase behaviors of LAS surfactant molecules. First of all, a variety of simple CG models of water, with different resolutions, interaction potentials (Lennard-Jones, Morse), and <b>cut-off</b> <b>distances,</b> were systematically examined. The relationships between the parameters and the thermodynamic properties, such as density, surface tension, and compressibility, were found to fit simple mathematical equations. The limits of applicability of these CG water models were explored by checking the melting temperature. One specific CG water model, W 3 -LJ 124 -rc 15, was chosen based on the balance between efficiency and accuracy. The LAS CG model was systematically developed by fitting the thermodynamic data from experiments and structural data obtained from all-atom MD for the NaCl solutions, aliphatic and aromatic alkanes, alkyl sulfonates and LAS solutions. An extensive evaluation of the parameters provides a reliable, transferable and computationally efficient CG model, which can be easily employed to simulate the self-assembly of LAS aqueous solutions into different morphologies starting from random configurations. The CG model was shown to accurately reproduce the phase behavior of solutions of pure isomers of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, despite the fact that phase behavior was not directly taken into account in the forcefield parameterization. CG MD simulations were also performed to calculate the free energy profiles of the aggregation of two trans-membrane inclusions in the phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer, and the free energy profile of the membrane meniscus caused by the hydrophobic mismatch between the hydrophobic length of the trans-membrane inclusions and the hydrophobic thickness of the DMPC bilayer. ...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{advancement}} {{in computer technology}} {{makes it possible to}} perform simulations of large particulate systems using Discrete Element Method (DEM). However, it is still a challenge to adjust the DEM simulation parameters, especially the interparticle forces, in order to obtain rational results. Many of these forces diverge as the distance between particle surfaces approaches zero. Therefore, a <b>cut-off</b> <b>distance</b> needs to be considered in order to avoid such a problem. This work presents the results of the computational analysis of the influence of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>distance,</b> which is required to avoid the divergence of the van der Waals force, on the collision of a single particle against a flat surface. Hence, the effect of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>distance</b> on the coefficient of restitution, collision duration and maximum overlap has been studied. In addition, we have theoretically derived an expression for the minimum velocity under which the particle remains adhered to the surface (critical velocity) {{as a function of the}} <b>cut-off</b> <b>distance.</b> The simulation predictions of the critical velocity are within the range of experimental data published in the literature. We demonstrate that the <b>cut-off</b> <b>distance</b> has a profound influence on particle rebound and therefore, a careful selection of this parameter should take place when simulating bulk particle behaviour. Given that the hydrophobic force is usually simulated using the same expression as the van der Waals force, the results presented here could also be considered in the context of the simulation of the hydrophobic force...|$|E
