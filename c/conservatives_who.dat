5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas.

Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal <b>conservatives</b> <b>who</b> believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive <b>conservatives</b> <b>who</b> adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, {{although some of}} the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970.

5|$|By 1986, Angola {{began to}} assume a more {{central role in the}} Cold War, with the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Eastern bloc nations {{enhancing}} support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American <b>conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict in the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative Party {{had split}} down the middle: {{on one side}} were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the {{moderate}} <b>conservatives</b> <b>who</b> supported the Conciliation. The ultraconservatives were led by Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and Paulino Soares de Sousa, 1stViscount of Uruguai—all former ministers in the 1848–1853 cabinet. These elder statesmen had taken control of the Conservative Party after Paraná's death. In the years following 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension {{that had previously been}} granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult task of not only disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake. John Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith's radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed the new thinking such as Hugh Latimer. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious <b>conservatives</b> <b>who</b> desired to maintain the link with Rome.|$|E
5|$|The 19th {{century was}} a {{turbulent}} time for Spain. Those {{in favour of}} reforming Spain's government vied for political power with <b>conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some liberals, in a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, sought to limit {{the power of the}} monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended a short-lived liberal government with French royalist military assistance. Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874. There were several attempts to realign the political system to match social reality. Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called latifundia) as well as all the important government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{had long}} seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he {{concluded}} {{his time as}} governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and {{did not support the}} forces trying to prevent Tillman's re-nomination in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened <b>Conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> did not bother to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's Senate seat) to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.|$|E

5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear {{contrast with the}} pedestrian images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far {{to the left of the}} Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the <b>Conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to <b>conservatives</b> <b>who</b> were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{was aware}} of the often {{negative}} response to his work: in a poem dedicated to the memory of Friedrich Schiller, he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed Te iartă să faci răul, iar binele nici mort—"They forgive the evil committed against them, but never the good"). A noted author of satire, he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments. As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: <b>conservatives</b> <b>who</b> mimicked liberalism were the subject of his Areopagiul bestielor ("The Areopagus of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the left wing of liberalism, most notably C. A. Rosetti and his supporters. During and after his exile, his conflicts with Cezar Bolliac and Ion Ghica also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended to downplay his contributions to the Wallachian Revolution of 1848.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Marie Eugène Pierlot (23 December 1883 – 13 December 1963) was a Belgian {{politician}} and 32nd Prime Minister of Belgium, serving between 1939 and 1945. Pierlot, {{a lawyer and}} jurist, served in World War I before entering politics in the 1920s. A member of the Catholic Party, Pierlot became Prime Minister in 1939, shortly before Belgium entered World War II. In this capacity, he headed the Belgian government in exile, first from France and later Britain, while Belgium was under German occupation. During the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, a violent disagreement broke out between Pierlot and King Leopold III over whether the King should follow the orders of his ministers and go into exile or surrender to the German Army. Pierlot considered Leopold's subsequent surrender a breach of the Constitution and encouraged the parliament to declare Leopold unfit to reign. The confrontation provoked a lasting animosity between Pierlot and other <b>conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> supported the King's position and considered the government's exile to be cowardly.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go to the trouble of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the <b>Conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E
