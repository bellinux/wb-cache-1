The agreement makes the Philippines the eighth country to host the NUASC through which the Transnational Doctoral Programs for Leading Professionals in Asian <b>Countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> implemented. It will enable Filipino doctoral candidates to enroll in NU doctoral programs without having to be physically present in Nagoya for the whole duration of the course. Nagoya's Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences and Graduate School of International Development will offer the doctorates in bioagricultural sciences and international development, respectively, through the said facility.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the hardest}} hit {{countries}} in Sub-Saharan Africa—and possibly later in South and Southeast Asia—will face a demographic upheaval as HIV/AIDS and associated diseases reduce human life expectancy {{by as much as}} 30 years and kill as many as a quarter of their populations over a decade or less, producing a huge orphan cohort. Nearly 42 million children in 27 countries will lose one or both parents to AIDS by 2010; 19 {{of the hardest}} hit <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the three}} {{countries}} in the region, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, increased efforts to patrol the strait {{in an attempt to}} curb piracy. While Singapore wants international support in this effort, Indonesia and Malaysia are opposed to foreign intervention. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the three <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to stamp out piracy. The problem is especially acute in Indonesia. There were 325 reported pirate attacks worldwide in 2004; nine occurred in Malaysian waters, eight in Singaporean waters, and 93 in Indonesian waters.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E

Muse had {{previously}} competed {{on behalf of}} Somalia at international youth athletic competitions around the world. Prior to the competition, she spoke {{of the difference in}} the quality of the training facilities in Somalia compared to those in other countries, saying [...] "A number of <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> participating among them Jamaica and United States; but I am hoping to shine. We don’t have the same training facilities, theirs is better than ours. I know they are determined to win but we are also equally determined." [...] She competed in the sixth heat of the 400 metres competition on 13 August; she came in last place with a time of 1:10:14, over 18 seconds behind the heat's winner Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain.|$|E
500|$|The four {{withdrawn}} members {{demanded that}} the Council return to the Act of January 8 and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany. After heated debates that lasted for several weeks, on February 15, at 10 o'clock am, the new revision of the Act was ready. It included, with minor stylistic changes, wording of the Act of January 8 and promulgation and notification, drafted on February 1. Promulgation and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change {{the meaning of a}} legal document. The Council, including the withdrawn members, was invited to return the next day for its finalization. On the next day, February 16, 1918, at 12:30 pm, all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims, at 30 Didžioji Street in Vilnius. The building has since been known as the House of the Signatories (...) and houses a museum. The Council first voted to approve the first part, the first two paragraphs up to the word drauge, of the Act. This section was approved unanimously. The second part, however, did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word [...] "finally" [...] in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly (in [...] "... the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> finally determined by the Constituent Assembly ..."). They were afraid that this word would give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly, while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non-negotiable and non-appealable nature of the future Assembly's decisions. Therefore, the Act was unanimously approved [...] but did not have full-fledged support from all twenty men.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proposed}} EEG (2016) is {{a continuation}} of the EEG (2014). [...] It replaces prescribed feed-in tariffs with an auction system for the majority of renewable technologies. [...] It repeats the deployment corridors specified in the EEG (2014) to control the uptake of renewable electricity over the next decade and to ensure that future renewable energy targets are honored. [...] This corridor will be maintained by auctioning only a defined capacity each year. [...] Only those renewables projects that bid successfully will receive EEG support for the electricity they supply over the following 20years. [...] Each technology – photovoltaics, onshore wind, offshore wind, and biomass – will get an auction design tailored to its needs. [...] Small renewables installations of under 750kW capacity or under 150kW for biomass will not be required to tender and will continue to receive conventional feed-in tariffs. [...] Bidders from other European <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to compete in the auctions for up to 5% of the annual capacity, under certain conditions. [...] The new auction system should cover more than 80% of the new renewable electricity capacity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} post-2013 {{proposal}} by Prof. Alan Matthews underlines {{the lack of}} ambition in tackling the issue. [...] "This CAP reform {{was not intended to}} address the trade barriers used to keep some EU market prices higher than world market levels. The EU has reduced the effect of these barriers for a number of developing countries through extending the scope of preferential access under various trade agreements, and a further reduction is being negotiated in the WTO Doha Round. Nonetheless, developing <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> disappointed that the opportunity was not taken in this reform to set a final date for the ending of export subsidies. A more ambitious CAP reform, in which the targeting of direct payments was pursued more insistently and coupled payments were phased out, would also have a greater effect in removing the remaining distortions caused by the CAP to world markets." [...] In another study, Prof. Matthews showed how linking EU farm subsidies to goals such as environmental protection could help farmers in poor countries, although much depends {{on the size of the}} payments and how they are made.|$|E
