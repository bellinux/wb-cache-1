Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, <b>curlew</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose.

40|$|Wader species {{migrating}} {{through the}} Sivash (Ukraine) use hypersaline and brackish lagoons. We studied {{the use of}} the two habitat types, and focused on the profitability of Brine Shrimp Artemia salina, prey species in hypersaline lagoons for Dunlins Calidris alpina, <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Calidris ferruginea and Broad-billed Sandpipers Limicola falcinellus (although the latter was abundant in the brackish habitat only). Colour-marked Dunlins restricted feeding to the lagoon type in which they were initially captured. Dunlins and <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> fed in areas where Brine Shrimps were of average size (0. 23 - 0. 34 mg AFDM). Artemia intake may be restricted by the visual foraging mode, as during rain and twilight pecking rates decreased to 45. 9 - 76. 8 % of values measured during dry periods in full daylight. Feeding activities were higher in hypersaline than in brackish lagoon (84. 6 and 69. 0 %, respectively). Broad-billed Sandpipers feeding on Artemia had longer handling times (0. 87 s prey(- 1)) than Dunlins and <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (0. 58 and 0. 54 s prey(- 1)), which performed surface tension transport (STT) of prey in their pointed, thin bills. There were no differences in body mass increases in Dunlins in hypersaline and brackish lagoons. In Broad-billed Sandpipers, catching results suggest an increase in body mass in the brackish lagoon only. Supported by intake rate-based calculations of potential mass gain rates, we conclude that Brine Shrimp can form a profitable prey for Dunlins and for <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> but apparently not for Broad-billed Sandpipers...|$|R

40|$|Using constant-effort catch data, {{causes of}} annual {{variation}} in the timing of migration of <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris ferruginea) migrating through Ottenby, Sweden, {{as well as the}} trend in timing of migration from 1946 - 2005, was investigated. Variation in the timing of autumn migration of adult and juvenile <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> was influenced by breeding success connected to predation pressure on the Arctic breeding grounds. Median migration date of adult birds was significantly later in good breeding years compared with poor breeding years while the migration of juveniles was earlier in good breeding years compared with poor breeding years. Also, adults migrated earlier when the average temperature in June was warmer. Median migration dates of adults have advanced by 23 days from 1946 - 2005, but the migration dates of juveniles have remained unchanged. Unchanged migration dates of juveniles indicate that earlier departure of the adult <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> from the breeding grounds was not due to earlier breeding. Evidence suggests that declining breeding productivity as a result of increasing predation on broods of shorebirds might, over the years, be the reason for the observed pattern of early departure of adults from the breeding grounds. One possible consequence of earlier migration is a mismatch between timing of migration and periods of food abundance on migration routes and at the wintering grounds, leading to a decline in adult and juvenile survival and population size.

5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, <b>curlew</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, {{northern}} gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|R

50|$|Some species neither {{regularly}} breed nor {{winter in}} Great Britain, but pass through on migration often in large numbers. Arctic breeding waders {{are a good}} example, with species such as little stint and <b>curlew</b> <b>sandpiper</b> usually being fairly common on passage.|$|E
5000|$|Cox's sandpiper ("Calidris" [...] × paramelanotos), {{described}} as a new species in 1982, is now {{known to be a}} stereotyped hybrid between males of the pectoral sandpiper ("Calidris" [...] melanotos) and female <b>curlew</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> It is known from nearly two dozen sightings since the 1950s, almost all of which are from Australia, with one record from Massachusetts. and another from Japan.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the stopover patterns {{of male and}} female <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> at a stopover area in northeast Spain. <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> were trapped and colour-ringed during autumn migration in 1992 and 1993. Stopover length was similar to those reported previously for this and other waders that migrate using a small number of widely separated staging areas, but were greater than stopovers reported for other waders that migrate using a large number of staging areas separated by short distances. The differences in stopover length between the birds using these two strategies could be related to the fuel reserves that have to be accumulated to reach the next staging area. Males stayed longer in the area than females. Seasonal changes in prey availability or sex differences in moulting and migratory patterns do not account for these differences in stopover ecology. Following a time-selected model of optimal migration, sex differences in stopover ecology could be related to a dominance of the larger females over the males or to a higher foraging efficiency or a shorter search and settling time in females. Whether these differences are restricted to the studied area or are widespread in other staging areas used by the species could be important for assessing the possible differences in the migration speed of <b>Curlew</b> <b>Sandpipers.</b> The finding that males leave the breeding grounds 22 — 35 days before females but arrive at the study area with only a 10 -day difference supports the hypothesis that females migrate faster than males at least {{in the first half of}} their migrationPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|No firm {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the <b>curlew</b> <b>sandpiper's</b> phylogenetic status (i.e., what its closest relatives are) and hence Erolia cannot be exactly delimited at present.

50|$|Of all shorebird species, the <b>curlew</b> <b>sandpiper</b> has the {{smallest}} breeding range {{in relation to}} its non-breeding range.
