Insurance companies choose underwriting and financing policies to maximise shareholder value.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} some testing procedures, both in time/frequency framework, useful to test for significant <b>cycles</b> in <b>insurance</b> data. The US underwriting cycle is measured using the growth rates of real premiums. Design/methodology/approach – In addition to the traditional AR(2) model, two new approaches are suggested: testing for a significant peak in the periodogram using Fisher g test and a nonparametric version of it, and testing for unit root <b>cycles</b> in <b>insurance</b> data. Findings – All approaches find empirical evidence for a cyclical behaviour of the growth rates of property-liability real premiums. Results on the length of dominant cycle still diverge, according to the approach (time/frequency domain). Originality/value – Compared to the existing literature, the present study innovates in that it highlights additional testing procedures, helpful to detect significant <b>cycles</b> in <b>insurance</b> time series.

The process of estimating parameters for a regime switching model can be quite difficult using traditional techniques.

Regime Switching and <b>Insurance</b> <b>Cycles</b> A Real Life Problem A client came to me with a problem: a long tailed financial insurance class had occasional bad years, and the client wanted to know whether these bad years were part of a cycle, and if so, could that cycle be predicted so that losses could be recognised earlier (triangle reserving techniques took years to recognise the bad years) and perhaps even prevented or reduced in severity? It quickly appeared that these claim frequencies were related to the building cycle – the number of building approvals, which fluctuated over time.

40|$|Abstracts: The costly {{external}} financing assumption in capital shock theories of <b>insurance</b> <b>cycles</b> are often attributed to Myers and Majluf (1984). The {{purpose of this}} paper is to revisit the Myers and Majluf model and to propose a modified model that better fits capital shock theories. By so doing, this paper attempts to provide justification for existing empirical papers on <b>insurance</b> <b>cycles.</b> Contrary to conventional belief, we argue that while the insight of Myers and Majluf is applicable, their model itself is not appropriate to justify the capital shock theories, since (i) it does not justify price increases at the time of information symmetry; (ii) given information asymmetry, its results imply that an insurer that is severely affected by a shock can always raise capital; and (iii) it does not consider liability that is a main concern of insurers. We consider a modified version of the Myers and Majluf model, by introducing liability. When a shock is small, the results are similar to Myers and Majluf. However, when a shock is large, a pooling equilibrium always exists, in which all insurers cannot raise capital. Interpreting no financing as price increases, this result justifies the argument that costly {{external financing}} leads to price increases...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{sets out}} to use the loss ratio series of Switzerland, Germany, the USA and Japan, to test whether {{underwriting}} cycles still exist internationally and to identify possible structural changes.

Findings – All four countries have breaks in different years. This result leads to {{the hypothesis that the}} factors affecting underwriting cycles are mainly country-specific, such as economic environment and regulations, rather than global/international. Although the financial theory and the insurance pricing theory suggest that the loss ratio series should be co-integrated with the interest rate series with co-integrating coefficient - 1, the empirical results do not support the theories.

40|$|We {{start from}} the {{hypothesis}} that Goodwin's (1967) distributive cycle does not represent a process of social reproduction that {{can be considered as}} adequate and sustainable in the long-run, due to the degradation of a part of the workforce it implies during periods of mass unemployment. Against this background, the paper then formulates an unemployment benefit system and a minimum (and maximum) wage rule for the employed where this form of economic reproduction of capitalism is overcome, at least to a certain extent. There is perfect mobility on the labor market (concerning 'hiring' and 'firing'), with fluctuations of the employment rate made socially acceptable by guaranteeing minimum levels of income to all members of the workforce. We can show in this framework that minimum (and maximum) real wages provide increased stability to the economy by reducing the amount of overshooting in income distribution as well as the employment rate.

Reinsurance is hypothesized to be a potential factor in observed cycles in the primary market; despite this, few underwriting cycle studies focus on reinsurance. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate determinants of reinsurance prices in the U. S. Nonproportional reinsurance is highlighted, since it is designed to cover the tail of the loss distribution and is considered to be relatively riskier than proportional reinsurance as a result. Separate samples of professional U. S. reinsurers for property and for casualty are studied, based upon the reinsurers' writings of property versus casualty nonproportional reinsurance. The sample period is 1991 - 1995. The results support both the capacity constraint hypothesis and the risky debt hypothesis, {{and this is the first}} research to support both.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the {{existence}} of underwriting <b>cycles</b> in property-liability <b>insurance</b> for Switzerland, the USA, and Japan over a period of 40 years (1957 - 1997), it aims to overcome some of the limitations of a pure autoregressive process of second order (AR(2)). Design/methodology/approach – Loss-ratio data for the three countries are used for the recent period 1957 - 1997. To test for the existence of cycles and calculate their length, we start with autoregressive processes of second order and include more variables that should be taken into account. We also estimate a cointegration model in order to separate long-term and short-term dynamics. Findings – The hypothesis of cycles of six years in length no longer holds globally and it is necessary to go further than estimating simple AR(2) processes. Different models or specifications seem adequate for different countries because of the varying structure of the <b>insurance</b> markets. <b>Cycles</b> are still found for the USA and most estimations for Switzerland, whereas most specifications for Japan have not revealed cycles. Originality/value – Most empirical work on underwriting cycles has so far been done on US data. This study investigates <b>insurance</b> <b>cycles</b> for three countries on three continents. Based on the autoregressive process of second order and the estimations presented in the companion to this article (i. e.

40|$|Lost in {{the recent}} efforts to take {{political}} advantage of (or explain away) the rapid rise in liability insurance premiums is any real attempt to understand the underwriting cycle, {{why it is so}} severe in medical malpractice insurance, and what it might mean for the ability of malpractice liability to deliver on its risk distribution, loss prevention, and corrective justice objectives. This essay attempts to fill that gap. Part 1 provides a primer on the liability <b>insurance</b> underwriting <b>cycle</b> that draws on the research prompted by the mid- 1980 s insurance hard market. This part explains that the recent dramatic increases in predicted medical malpractice losses are a result of the <b>insurance</b> <b>cycle,</b> not dramatic changes in medical malpractice claim payments. Part 2 explores why the underwriting cycle is so severe in medical malpractice insurance. This part applies my recent Geneva Lecture analysis of liability risks to the specific problem of medical malpractice, with a fuller consideration of the dynamics of the underwriting cycle. In short, the cycle is so severe because there is a relatively long period between the time that the premiums for a medical malpractice policy are paid and the time that losses under that policy can be known with certainty, and because there is more uncertainty regarding future medical malpractice losses than many other kinds of losses. Part 3 explores whether insurance regulators should consider acting to moderate the underwriting cycle (assuming that they could do so). This part argues that there are good reasons to believe that medical malpractice insurance crises lead medical providers to improve patient safety and, therefore, that efforts to moderate the cycle could {{have a negative impact on}} patient safety. Further research is needed before we can draw firm conclusions, but leaving the <b>insurance</b> <b>cycle</b> alone would be the wiser course for now...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of the U. S. liability insurance market and the link between its performance and developments in tort law. Over the last few decades, the dominant feature of the insurance market has been the insurance cycle: intermittent periods of rapidly rising premiums and cutbacks on the availability of coverage. The <b>insurance</b> <b>cycle</b> appears to be increasing in amplitude and, since the 1960 s, has been concentrated increasingly in liability lines. The dynamic behavior of the insurance market can be fully explained in a model that emphasizes uncertainty and informational asymmetries, as outlined in this paper. I conclude the paper with a discussion of some policy implications as well as the impact of liability insurance on the incentive role, as opposed to the insurance role, of the tort system. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{underwriting}} {{cycle is}} {{the tendency of}} property and casualty insurance premiums, profits, and availability of coverage to rise and fall with some regularity over time. A cycle begins when insurers tighten their underwriting standards and sharply raise premiums {{after a period of}} severe underwriting losses or negative stocks to capital (e.g., investment losses). Stricter standards and higher premium rates lead to an increase in profits and accumulation of capital. The increase in underwriting capacity increases competition, which in turn drives premium rates down and relaxes underwriting standards, thereby causing underwriting losses and setting the stage for the cycle to begin again. For example, Lloyd's Franchise Performance Director Rolf Tolle stated in 2007 that [...] "mitigating the <b>insurance</b> <b>cycle</b> was the [...] "biggest challenge" [...] facing managing agents in the next few years".|$|R

Such a balancing of benefits and costs is likely sensitive to the cyclical state of the economy, and hence the generosity of benefits should also respond to the cyclical state of the economy. The nature of such responses in an optimal unemployment insurance (UI) program is analyzed in a simple model. The results suggest that an optimal UI program would both increase the initial level of benefits and extend higher benefits over time in response to a recessionary shock. A simple extension of benefits, such as exists automatically in the system in the United States, provides both poorer insurance and poorer incentives than the optimal program, and does so at a higher cost. Moreover, the current UI system in the U. S. provides a substantially higher level of welfare to workers who lose jobs during tight labor markets...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the optimality of business cycle dependent unemployment benefits.

Incentives are strengthened in booms, where job search is more efficient, whereas insurance is strengthened in recessions, where job search is less efficient and where involuntary unemployment is higher. A business cycle dependent UI system {{is not only a}} theoretical abstraction, as there already exists such systems in practice, e. g. in the US and Canada.
