5|$|The royal arms of CharlesII are in {{the north}} aisle. During the 1852 {{restoration}} whitewash {{was removed from the}} walls, revealing the royal arms of HenryVII, and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George. Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500. Other glass comes from the Victorian era. This includes the east window from about 1858, and the window at the east end of the north aisle from about 1861, both by William Warrington, and the east window in the south aisle from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes. The two westernmost windows in the south aisle are by O'Connor and dated 1871. There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. In the north aisle is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular <b>cross-shaft</b> carved with interlace decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11thcentury.|$|E
25|$|St Andrew's {{is built}} of {{sandstone}} with tiled roofs. It has a nave, south porch, chancel, south vestry, and west tower. The tower is divided by string courses into three stages. It has a plinth, diagonal buttresses, a battlemented parapet with gargoyles, and a pyramidal cap with a weathervane. On its northeast is an octagonal stair turret, {{also with a}} pyramidal cap. In the upper stages on the north, west and east fronts are carved fragments which {{are said to have}} come from Haughmond Abbey; these include canopied niches, some containing sculpted figures, and ceiling bosses. In the bottom stage is a three-light west window, there are rectangular openings in the middle stage, and the top stage contains two-light louvred bell openings. The north wall of the nave is Anglo-Saxon and contains blocks from former Roman buildings. These blocks have Lewis holes. This wall has a triple lancet window and a three-light arched window. In the south wall are two-three light windows and a porch containing a doorway. The porch has a parapeted gabled double lancet window, and a carved frieze. Set into the top of the south wall is a fragment of a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon <b>cross-shaft.</b> On each side of this is a carved block of similar date, one depicting a beast and the other a bird. The chancel also incorporates some re-used Roman masonry in its north wall, which contains two narrow round-headed windows and a triple lancet window. In the south wall is a blocked Norman priest's doorway. The east window has five lights, and around it are portions of blocked former windows. The vestry has two square windows, one on each side of a round-arched doorway.|$|E
500|$|Cumbria is {{predominantly}} rural, {{and has the}} largest national park in England and Wales, the Lake District. The county's major industry is tourism, {{but there is also}} some manufacturing, especially in the coastal towns of Barrow-in-Furness and Whitehaven. [...] The geology of the county is complex: the central Lake District region contains volcanic and metamorphic rocks, with sedimentary rocks around the periphery. [...] The building materials used for the churches are mainly the sedimentary rocks of sandstone and limestone, with roofs in metamorphic slate. Stone from the nearby Roman Hadrian's Wall was re-used in the construction of some churches in the north of the county, including StAndrew, Aikton, StMichael, Burgh by Sands, and StPeter, Kirkbampton. [...] Viking material in the form of statues and the Gosforth Cross is found in association with StMary, Gosforth, and in a wall of StMary and StMichael, Great Urswick, is a <b>cross-shaft</b> thought to be Viking in origin. [...] Because of Cumbria's proximity to Scotland, several churches incorporate defensive features, including StMichael, Burgh by Sands, StMungo, Dearham, StJames, Great Ormside, and StJohn, Newton Arlosh. [...] This list consists of the 49GradeI listed ecclesiastical buildings in the ceremonial county of Cumbria, as recorded in the National Heritage List for England.|$|E
40|$|The short takeoff {{and landing}} {{capabilities}} {{that characterize the}} performance of powered-lift aircraft are dependent on engine thrust and are, therefore, severely affected by loss of an engine. This paper shows {{that the effects of}} engine loss on the short takeoff and landing performance of powered-lift aircraft can be effectively mitigated by <b>cross-shafting</b> the engine fans in a twin-engine configuration. Engine-out takeoff and landing performances are compared for three powered-lift aircraft configurations: one with four engines, one with two engines, and one with two engines in which the fans are <b>cross-shafted.</b> The results show that the engine-out takeoff and landing performance of the <b>cross-shafted</b> two-engine configuration is significantly better than that of the two-engine configuration without <b>cross-shafting...</b>|$|R

500|$|Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs {{to create}} its {{ornamental}} patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 [...] "pagan" [...] burials {{in the north}} and west from the mid-ninth to the mid-tenth centuries. These include jewellery, weapons and occasional elaborate high status items. Amongst the most impressive of these is the Scar boat burial, on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia. From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in Colonsay revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin. A combination of Viking and Celtic styles can be see in a penannular brooch from Pierowall in Orkney, which has a Pictish-style looped pin. It is about two inches in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons. After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament. They were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns. Examples include the eleventh-century cross-slab from Dóid Mhàiri on the island of Islay, where the plant motifs {{on either side of the}} <b>cross-shaft</b> are based upon the Ringerike style of Viking art. The most famous artistic find from modern Scotland, the Lewis Chessmen, from Uig, were probably made in Trondheim in Norway, but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by Celtic patterns.|$|E
2500|$|Sol and Luna, personifications {{of the sun}} and moon, {{occupy the}} top of the cross's shaft, a common feature in Crucifixion scenes of the period, {{although}} unusually they are here shown on the shaft of the cross itself, above Christ and with Luna above Sol. [...] More usually they are to either side of the <b>cross-shaft,</b> or at the ends of the arms. [...] Also Sol here lacks his usual rays, suggesting an eclipse is represented, following the Gospels. [...] The border contains most of the gems, held in typically Carolingian plant motif settings, which are exceptionally finely executed.|$|E

50|$|When {{driving in}} a {{straight}} line the two engines were locked; turning the steering wheel gradually closed the throttle for the engine of one track and opened the throttle for the engine driving the other. The two engines were joined at their <b>cross-shafts,</b> from which the final drive to the tracks was by chains to sprockets on either side. When steering the clutches joining the <b>cross-shafts</b> were released, one engine sped up while the other slowed down, the turn being on the side opposite to that of the faster running engine. The steering effect could be increased by use of the brakes on one engine or another. This arrangement had the advantage over that of earlier tanks of being controlled by one man only, but called for great skill {{on the part of the}} driver, because one or both of the engines could be stalled if care was not exercised. Although in theory a simple solution to give gradual steering, in practice it proved impossible to control the speeds of the engines, causing the vehicle to take an unpredictable path. Drivers grew wary and stopped the vehicle and locked one track before every turn; this caused many track breaks, as the movement became too abrupt.|$|R

These gears lie below the track plate that the bobbin carriers ride on, and an even number of gears must be used as there are always an even number of bobbins.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a weaving shed was to provide spaces for {{rows and rows of}} {{identical}} looms. A standard shed would house 1200 looms, and it was common to think in multiples of 400 looms. These looms would be tentered by weavers who worked from four to eight looms each and were paid on piece-rate. The looms would be maintained by a skilled tackler who would be on hand to gait the looms and effect instant repairs or adjustments. There would be four tacklers for 400 looms. The looms were powered by leather belts from overhead <b>cross-shafts,</b> on bevel gears from the line shaft that ran the length of the shed.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} special design {{criteria}} which apply to power management in a tilt-rotor aircraft. These include {{the need for}} accurate and fast control of rpm and thrust, while accounting for the dynamic interactions between rotor systems caused by <b>cross-shafting</b> and aircraft lateral/directional response. The power management system is also required to provide acceptable high speed sensitivity to longitudinal turbulence. It is shown that the criteria can best be met using a single governor adjusting the collective pitch by an amount proportional {{to a combination of}} the average rpm and the integral of the average rpm of the two rotors. This system is evaluated and compared with other candidate systems in hover and cruise flight...|$|R

50|$|Gračanica {{represents}} {{the culmination of}} the Medieval Serbian art of building in the Serbo-Byzantine tradition. The church has the form of a double inscribed cross, one inside the other, the inner one providing for a vertical silhouette so as to raise the central dome upwards on a graded elaboration of masses. The dome rests on four free-standing pillars. Above the spaces between the <b>cross-shafts,</b> four smaller domes give a regular structure to the whole crowning complex. Three three-sided apses (the central one being the largest) put a mild distinction on the altar space externally. The diaconicon and the prosthesis are separated by full walls. Between the nave and the narthex there are wide, heavy pillars and the katolikon (conventual church) is on a level higher. The church was built in alternate courses of brick and stone. At the end of the 14th century an exonarthex was added with double arcades, but these were blinded in the 16th century.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the second government-conducted, piloted flight simulation of the Grumman Design 698 V/STOL (vertical and short takeoff and landing) aircraft. Emphasis {{is on the}} aircraft's handling qualities as rated by various NASA, Navy, and GAC pilots with flight experience ranging from CTOL (conventional take-off and landing) to V/STOL aircraft. The Design 698 had been modified to resolve the flight problems that were of most concern to the pilots in the first investigation (Phase I). Those problems included an adverse nonminimum phase (NMP) acceleration response in both the longitudinal and lateral axes, a large thrust-response lag, and adverse ground effects. The adverse NMP acceleration is an attribute of the vertical vanes (a Grumman patent) positioned in the fan exhaust flow. The primary modifications included using the vertical-vane deflection as a thrust spoiling method, {{the addition of the}} <b>cross-shafted</b> propulsion system, and the implementation of two velocity and attitude control modes (standard and precision) for speeds below 50 knots...|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{new class of}} aircraft - the Advanced Theater Transport (ATT) will combine strategic range and high payload with 'Super-STOL' (short take-off and landing) capability. It is also proposed to modify a YC- 15 into a technology demonstrator with a 20 -deg tilt wing; four, eight-bladed propellers; <b>cross-shafted</b> gearboxes and V- 22 engines. These constitute a unique combination of design features that potentially affect performance, loads and whirl-mode stability (whirl flutter). NASA Ames Research Center is working with Boeing and Hamilton Sundstrand on technology challenges presented by the concept; the purpose of NASA involvement is to establish requirements for the demonstrator and for early design guidance, with emphasis on whirl flutter. CAMRAD II {{is being used to}} study the effects of various design features on whirl flutter, with special attention to areas where such features differ from existing aircraft, notably tiltrotors. Although the stability margins appear to be more than adequate, the concept requires significantly different analytical methods, principally including far more blade modes, than typically used for tiltrotors...|$|R
