40|$|We {{detail a}} general method for {{measuring}} agreement between two statistics. An application is two ratios of directly standardized rates which differ {{only by the}} choice of the standard. If the statistics have a high value for the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> then the expected squared difference between the statistics is small relative to the variance of the average of the two statistics, and inferences vary little by changing statistics. The estimation of a <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> between two statistics is not straightforward because there is only one pair of observed values, each statistic calculated from the data. We introduce estimators of the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> for two statistics and discuss their use, especially as applied to functions of standardized rates.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{discusses the}} use of Cohen’s j (kappa), Brennan and Prediger’s jn, and the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>agreement</b> for the examination of disagreement. Three scenarios are considered. The first involves all disagreement cells in a rater rater cross-tabulation. The second involves one of the triangles of disagreement cells. The third involves the cells that indicate disagreement by one (ordinal) scale unit. For {{each of these three}} scenarios, <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> disagreement in the form of j equivalents are derived. The behavior <b>of</b> the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> disagreement in the three situations is studied. The first and the third case pose no particular problem. The j equivalents and the other coefficients can be interpreted as usual. In the second case, problems arise such that the range of disagreement js is restricted because the tables are incomplete. Thus, the standard log-frequency model of rater independence is no longer applicable. When the more general models of quasi-independence are used, negative degrees of freedom can result for smaller tables. Simulation results illustrate the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> disagreement {{for each of the three}} scenarios. Empirical data examples are given. Cohen’s (1960) j (kappa) is the most popular <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> rater <b>agreement.</b> j indicates the degree to which two raters agree beyond chance.

40|$|Russia's {{boreal forests}} host 11 % of the world's live forest biomass. They play a {{critical}} role in Russia's economy and in stabilizing the global climate. The boreal forests of central and western Siberia represent the largest unbroken tracts of forest in the world. The European Commission funded SIBERIA project aimed at producing a forest map covering an area of 1. 2 million square kilometres. Three synthetic aperture radars (SAR) on board the European remote sensing satellites ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 and the Japanese Earth resources satellite JERS- 1 were used to collect remote sensing data. Radar is the only sensor capable of penetrating cloud cover and imaging at night. An adaptive, model-based, contextual classification to derive ranked total growing stock volume classes suitable for large-scale mapping is described. The accuracy assessment of the Siberian forest cover map is presented. The weighted <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> κw is calculated to quantify the agreement between the classified map and the reference data. First, the classified map is compared with Russian forest inventory data (κw = 0. 72). The inherent uncertainty in the forest inventory data is simulated by allowing for fuzziness. The effect of uncertainty on the unweighted <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> κ is stronger than that on the weighted <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> κw. Second, the map is compared with a more reliable, independent posterior ground survey by Russian forestry experts (κw = 0. 94).

40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} framework, based on both spectral and spatial information, is proposed. The {{objective is to}} improve the classification of hyperspectral images for high resolution land cover mapping. The spatial information is obtained by a marker-based Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF) algorithm. A pixel-based SVM algorithm is first used to classify the image. Then, the marker- based MSF spectral-spatial algorithm is applied to improve the accuracy for classes with low accuracy. The marker-based MSF algorithm is used as a binary classifier. These two classes are the low accuracy class and the remaining classes. Finally, the SVM algorithm is trained for classes with acceptable accuracy. To evaluate the proposed approach, the Berlin hyperspectral dataset is tested. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the original MSF-based approach.

METHODS: Eighty healthy subjects {{with a mean age of}} 49. 7 years (range 40 to 60 years) were studied. Tentative near additions were determined using four different techniques: one-half amplitude accommodation with minus lenses (AAL); one-third accommodative demand with positive lens (ADL); balanced range of accommodation with minus and positive lenses (BRA) and crossed cylinder test with initial myopisation (CCT). The power of the addition was then refined to arrive at the final addition. RESULTS: The mean tentative near additions were lower than the final addition for ADL and BRA addition methods. The mean differences between tentative and final additions were low for all the tests examined (less than 0. 25 D).

Little {{is known of}} the accuracy of such classifications at a scale below the stand.

Performing traditional accuracy assessment on the outputs of individual change detection procedures using the Metatruth Image as reference dataset, demonstrated that former outputs identified change events accurately at pixel level.

This paper introduces a modified change vector analysis (mCVA) approach and conceptually contrasts it against traditional CVA. The {{results of a}} comparative study between this change detection algorithm and three other widely used change detection algorithms: standardized differencing, ratioing and selective principal component analysis are summarized. Landsat Thematic Mappper (TM) imagery and detailed change maps of a forested area in Northern Minnesota were used. Change indicators (vegetation indices) were grouped into three conceptually independent categories corresponding to soil, vegetation and moisture characteristics. Change periods of two, four and six years were considered. All change detection outputs were multidimensional and of a continuous nature, and could therefore be subjected to a supervised maximum likelihood algorithm using identical data training sets. Change extraction accuracies were determined by computing overall accuracy and Kappa <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> against independent reference datasets.

40|$|PURPOSE To compare high {{resolution}} T 2 sequences and post Gadolinium T 1 sequences {{in the diagnosis}} and preoperative staging of perianal and anal fistulas. METHOD AND MATERIALS 40 patients (15 with chronic inflammatory bowel disease) with clinical evidence or suspicion of anal fistulas underwent pelvic MRI (1. 5 T) performed with phased-array coil. Images were obtained in the axial and coronal planes using TSE T 2 -weighted {{high resolution}} sequences, T 2 -weighted HASTE and T 1 -weighted FLASH sequences after gadolinium enhancement. Following parameters were considered: presence of a fistula and relationship with the sphincters, presence of abscesses or complications. All patients underwent surgery, considered the gold standard. MRI and surgical findings were assessed using the Park’s fistula-in-ano classification and the St. James MR imaging classification of perianal fistulas. RESULTS MRI documented no evidence of fistula in 4 patients, intersphinteric fistulas in 11 (grade 1 and 2 St. James), trans-sphincteric fistulas in 17 (grade 3 and 4 St. James), translevator in 4 (grade 5) and complex ano-rectum-vaginal fistulas in 4. Concordance with surgery was 87. 5 %. The weighted K <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the interobserver <b>agreement</b> for high resolution T 2 sequences resulted 0. 89 and for post gadolinium T 1 sequences was 0. 89. The weighted k <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> intraobserver <b>agreement</b> for two observers were 0. 88 and 0. 93. The agreement between high resolution T 2 and post gadolinium T 1 sequences, stratified by observer was 0. 92. The χ 2 test for heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> between the two observers was 0. 648, p= 0. 421. CONCLUSIONS MRI is an accurate technique for the identification and classification of anal and perianal fistulas and their complications. Both high resolution T 2 and T 1 post gadolinium sequences resulted adequate for classifying fistulas. No evidence <b>of</b> heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> was found...|$|R
