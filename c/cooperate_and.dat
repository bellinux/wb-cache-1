5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} week of July 1919, the General Syrian Congress (GSC) held its first meeting in Damascus and Darwaza was its secretary. The GSC called for the {{immediate}} independence of Syria as a sovereign state under a constitutional monarchy and underlined its opposition to the establishment of Zionism in southern Syria (Palestine). Along with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Aref al-Aref, Darwaza founded and became an officer of the Palestinian Society in Damascus. The organization urged all societies and clubs in Palestine to <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> condemn the San Remo Conference's decision to grant Great Britain a mandate over Palestine and Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Japanese crackdowns {{on these}} guerrillas in Luzon were {{widespread}} and brutal. The Japanese Army, Kempeitai and Filipino collaborators hunted down resistance fighters and anyone associated with them. One example happened to resistance leader Wenceslao Vinzons; {{leader of the}} successful guerilla movement in Bicol. After being betrayed to the Japanese by a Japanese collaborator, Vinzons was tortured to give up information on his resistance movement. Vinzons however, refused to <b>cooperate,</b> <b>and</b> he and his family, consisting of his father Gabino, his wife Liwayway, sister Milagros and children Aurora and Alexander, were bayoneted to death.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{has taken}} Rose to the Dalek. Rose takes pity on the {{creature}} and touches its casing; the Dalek absorbs her DNA and {{the remnants of}} time energy she has from traveling in the TARDIS, and re-energizes itself. It escapes its bonds, kills several guards, and connects to the Internet to learn {{it is the last}} surviving Dalek. With no other purpose, it proceeds to target and exterminate any non-Dalek life form. The Vault is locked-down, and while Adam escapes, Rose is trapped within. van Statten is forced to release the Doctor to help stop the Dalek, but the Dalek refuses to <b>cooperate,</b> <b>and</b> continues killing all those left in the Vault.|$|E
5|$|As UN {{air raids}} against the North Koreans intensified, Dean {{was moved to}} Sunan, north of P'yongyang, to a hut where he lived with several guards. They began daily interrogations {{primarily}} aimed at forcing military intelligence from him or making him sign a written condemnation of the UN intervention in Korea, but Dean adamantly refused to do so. Senior North Korean military leaders continued such interrogations through October 1950 but eventually gave up when Dean would not <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> was not intimidated by their threats. Dean continued to suffer from illness related to poor food {{but he was not}} given another interpreter and was not interrogated after October 1950. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured. Dean took to playing chess with his guards often and he was allowed to exercise daily. He was kept alone, however, and was never with other American prisoners for the remainder of his confinement. Dean later wrote extensively of his capture and imprisonment in his 1973 autobiography, General Dean's Story. He claimed the North Koreans considered him a war criminal and had many discussions with him about the problems with capitalism in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Economic demand {{influences}} {{the location of}} particular specialties. For example, more orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry {{are more likely to}} practice in high income areas.

Some specialties need to <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> thus locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, Rockefeller {{approached}} Pratt {{with a plan}} to <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> consolidate their businesses.

Rockefeller had apparently learned a lot about Rogers' talents and negotiating skills during the South Improvement conflict. He quietly accepted the offer on the exact terms Rogers had laid out. In this manner, Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important independent refiners to join the Standard Oil Trust.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> opt out of bargaining.|$|E
