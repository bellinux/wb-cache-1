40|$|Psychological and psychopathological {{characteristics}} in eating disorders (ED) {{were analyzed by}} Wartegg projective test on one-hundred ED female patients. Thirty-five patients diagnosed with Anorexia of restricting-type (ANrt), twenty-two patients diagnosed with Anorexia of purgingtype (ANpt) and forthy-three patients with Bulimia diagnosis (BL) (DSM-IV criteria and EDES questionnaire) were compared with eighty-one control subjects (CN). Wartegg test results, by a quantitative scoring system, show significant differences between ED patients and <b>CN</b> on <b>depression,</b> impulsivity, reality testing and aggressiveness. ANrt present anxiety, perfectionism and impulsivity; ANpt show lower formal quality than other qroups, and BL show depression and low self-realization. Wartegg projective test shows a significant unconscious or disguised impulsivity in restricting anorexic patients...|$|R
40|$|A {{plethora of}} {{research}} has documented {{the negative effects of}} distress on physical and psychological well-being. However, past research showed that connection to nature and mindfulness reduce distress and improve psychological well-being. Unfortunately, the processes through which mindfulness is associated to connection to nature during the recovery from distress is unknown. Understanding the aspects of how connection to nature and mindfulness independently and jointly relate to well-being increases our existing knowledge of the health benefits associated with these constructs. Therefore, the current study had three foci: (1) the relationships between connection to nature (CN), mindfulness, and distress to psychological well-being (PWB) such as depression, anxiety, positive states of mind, and life satisfaction; (2) the moderating effects of connection to nature and mindfulness on the association between distress and PWB; and (3) the mediating effects of mindfulness on the relation between CN and PWB and distress. Participants (N= 276; n= 37 males, n= 239 females) were undergraduate (n= 273) and graduate (n= 3) students from a Midwestern university. Results indicated that CN was negatively associated with distress and depression. In addition, mindful attention, mindful awareness, and mindful acceptance were positively associated with life satisfaction and positive states of mind and inversely associated with depression and distress. All mindfulness measures except mindful awareness were inversely associated with anxiety. Furthermore, mindful awareness fully mediated the associations between <b>CN</b> and <b>depression</b> and distress. Mindful attention also fully mediated the CN-distress association. Buffering effects against the negative outcomes of distress were found in the moderation analyses. That is, mindful acceptance moderated the association between distress and PWB (depression and life satisfaction). More specifically, despite having increased distress, those with higher mindful acceptance had lower levels of depression and higher levels of life satisfaction. Lastly, CN did not moderate the association between distress and PWB. Limitations of this study and future direction for research are discussed. Advisor: Julia C. Torquat...|$|R
25|$|Convulsions from GHB can {{be treated}} with the benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} or lorazepam. Even though these benzodiazepines are also CNS depressants, they are GABAA agonists whereas GHB is primarily a GABAB agonist, and so do not worsen <b>CNS</b> <b>depression</b> as much as might be expected.|$|E
25|$|An {{overdose}} of dextropropoxyphene {{may lead to}} various systemic effects. Excessive opioid receptor stimulation {{is responsible for the}} <b>CNS</b> <b>depression,</b> respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, miosis, and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for mood- or thought-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose will increase CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} benzodiazepines, {{temazepam}} produces additive CNS-depressant effects when coadministered with other medications which themselves produce <b>CNS</b> <b>depression,</b> such as barbiturates, alcohol, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, nonselective MAO inhibitors, phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, skeletal muscle relaxants, antihistamines, and anaesthetics. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline {{has been shown}} to reduce the sedative effects of temazepam and other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine {{overdose}} {{describes the}} ingestion {{of one of}} the drugs in the benzodiazepine class in quantities greater than are recommended or generally practiced. The most common symptoms of overdose include central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>depression,</b> impaired balance, ataxia, and slurred speech. Severe symptoms include coma and respiratory depression. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. There is an antidote, flumazenil, but its use is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Side effects {{typical of}} {{hypnotic}} benzodiazepines {{are related to}} <b>CNS</b> <b>depression,</b> and include somnolence, sedation, drunkenness, dizziness, fatigue, ataxia, headache, lethargy, impairment of memory and learning, longer reaction time and impairment of motor functions (including coordination problems), slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, blurred vision (in higher doses), and inattention. Euphoria was rarely reported with its use. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, temazepam had an incidence of euphoria of 1.5%, much more rarely reported than headaches and diarrhea. Anterograde amnesia may also develop, as may respiratory depression in higher doses.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of benzodiazepine overdose may be difficult, but is usually made {{based on the}} clinical presentation of the patient along {{with a history of}} overdose. Obtaining a laboratory test for benzodiazepine blood concentrations can be useful in patients presenting with <b>CNS</b> <b>depression</b> or coma of unknown origin. Techniques available to measure blood concentrations include thin layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography with or without a mass spectrometer, and radioimmunoassay. Blood benzodiazepine concentrations, however, {{do not appear to be}} related to any toxicological effect or predictive of clinical outcome. Blood concentrations are, therefore, used mainly to confirm the diagnosis rather than being useful for the clinical management of the patient.|$|E
25|$|Flumazenil is very {{effective}} at reversing the <b>CNS</b> <b>depression</b> associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. One {{study found that}} only 10% of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for flumazenil. In this select population who are naive to and overdose solely on a benzodiazepine, it can be considered. Due to its short half life, the duration of action of flumazenil is usually less than 1 hour, and multiple doses may be needed. When flumazenil is indicated the risks can be reduced or avoided by slow dose titration of flumazenil. Due to risks and its many contraindications, flumazenil should be administered only after discussion with a medical toxicologist.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive <b>CNS</b> <b>depression.</b> Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam {{has been found to}} be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthric, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. <b>CNS</b> <b>depression</b> occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration.|$|E

500|$|Following {{decontamination}} and {{the institution}} of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using antidotes. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are ethanol and fomepizole. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning. [...] The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid. [...] The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites. [...] Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the degradation pathway. [...] Because ethanol has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase, about a 100-times greater affinity, it successfully blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, which prevents the further degradation. [...] Without oxalic acid formation, the nephrotoxic effects can be avoided, but the ethylene glycol is still present in the body. [...] It is eventually excreted in the urine, but supportive therapy for the <b>CNS</b> <b>depression</b> and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits. [...] Pharmaceutical grade ethanol is usually given intravenously as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% dextrose, {{but it is also}} sometimes given orally {{in the form of a}} strong spirit such as whisky, vodka, or gin.|$|E

2500|$|Benzodiazepines bind to a {{specific}} benzodiazepine receptor, thereby enhancing {{the effect of the}} neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and causing <b>CNS</b> <b>depression.</b> In overdose situations this pharmacological effect is extended leading to a more severe <b>CNS</b> <b>depression</b> and potentially coma [...] or cardiac arrest. [...] Benzodiazepine-overdose-related coma may be characterised by an alpha pattern with the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation being prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses of benzodiazepines therefore cause prolonged CCT and IPLs.|$|E

Symptoms of isopropyl alcohol poisoning include flushing, headache, dizziness, <b>CNS</b> <b>depression,</b> nausea, vomiting, anesthesia, hypothermia, hypotension, shock, respiratory depression, and coma.
