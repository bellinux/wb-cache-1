5|$|They {{arrive at}} a cave. Tintin ventures inside and finds <b>Chang,</b> who is feverish and shaking. The Yeti {{suddenly}} appears, revealed as a large anthropoid, reacting with anger at Tintin's attempt to take <b>Chang.</b> As it lunges at Tintin, the flash bulb of Tintin's camera goes off, and scares the Yeti away. <b>Chang</b> tells Tintin that the Yeti saved his life after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend <b>Chang.</b> As the party travels home, <b>Chang</b> muses that the Yeti is not a wild animal, but has a human soul.

50|$|The book now {{moves to}} the story of <b>Chang's</b> mother (Bao Qin/De-hong), who at the age of fifteen began working for the Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong's Red Army. As the Revolution progressed, her work for the party helped her rise through the ranks. She met the man who would become <b>Chang's</b> father (Wang Yu/Shou-yu), a {{high-ranking}} officer. The couple were soon married but Communist Party dictates meant they were not allowed to spend much time together. Eventually, the couple were transferred to Yibin, <b>Chang's</b> father's hometown. It was a long and arduous trek. <b>Chang's</b> mother traveled on foot because of her rank, while her father rode in a Jeep. He was not aware that <b>Chang's</b> mother was pregnant. After arrival at Nanjing, <b>Chang's</b> mother undertook gruelling military training. After the strain of the training coupled with the journey, she suffered a miscarriage. <b>Chang's</b> father swore to never again be inattentive to his wife's needs.|$|R

5|$|In early 2013, the Recess Gallery in New York City's SoHo {{neighbourhood}} presented We Buy White Albums, {{an installation}} by artist Rutherford <b>Chang.</b> The piece {{was in the}} form of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. <b>Chang</b> created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the LP were overlaid.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, Eqs. (2), (3) and (4) can {{be applied}} to only one of <b>Chang’s</b> equations. The applicability of <b>Chang’s</b> equation depends on whether the pile is embedded in the ground or not. In other words, once scouring occurs, <b>Chang’s</b> formula should be changed to meet the required boundary conditions. As a result, the corresponding performance functions should be modified accordingly. In this case, the MPP-based approach is not suitable for reliability analysis.|$|R
50|$|The axiom of constructibility {{implies that}} <b>Chang's</b> {{conjecture}} fails. Silver proved {{the consistency of}} <b>Chang's</b> conjecture from the consistency of an ω1-Erdős cardinal. Hans-Dieter Donder showed the reverse implication: if CC holds, then ω2 is ω1-Erdős in K.|$|R
50|$|After his six year absence, the General made a brief {{conjugal}} {{visit to}} his concubine, during which a daughter, <b>Chang's</b> mother, was conceived. General did not stay there for long, even to see his daughter but he named his daughter Bao Qin meaning precious zither. During the child's infancy, <b>Chang's</b> grandmother put off persistent requests {{for her to be}} brought to the General's main household, until he became very sick and it was no longer a request. <b>Chang's</b> grandmother {{had no choice but to}} comply. During her visit to the household, the General was dying. The general had no male heir, and <b>Chang's</b> mother was very important to the family. Realizing that the General's wife would have complete control over her life and her child's, when he would die, <b>Chang's</b> grandmother fled with her baby to her parents' home, sending false word to her husband's family that the child had died. With his last words, the General unexpectedly proclaimed her free at age twenty-four. Eventually she married a much older doctor (Dr. Xia) with whom she and her daughter, <b>Chang's</b> mother, made a home in Jinzhou, Manchuria. She was no more a concubine, but a true, beloved wife.|$|R

5|$|The Killer was {{director}} Woo's follow-up to A Better Tomorrow 2 which {{was released in}} 1987. The first cut of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo. According to producer Terence <b>Chang,</b> Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked <b>Chang</b> to fire Woo from the studio. When <b>Chang</b> refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief.|$|E
5|$|The episode's teleplay {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Kyle Killen, from a story by Killen, and staff writers Leonard <b>Chang</b> and Noelle Valdivia; it was Killen's seventh writing credit, and <b>Chang</b> and Valdivia's third writing credit each. It was directed by Miguel Sapochnik, his first directing credit for the series.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Superior Court Judge Thomas P. Billings, {{going against}} the other judges on the state’s Business Litigation Session bench, {{dismissed}} both <b>Chang's</b> [...] "options claims" [...] and [...] "partnership claims". <b>Chang’s</b> lawyer, Alan D.

5000|$|The one-story {{structure}} has primarily {{served as a}} restaurant since the 1960s, but {{appears to have been}} unoccupied for several long stretches. Permits from 1984 indicate that the restaurant was legally known as the New Canaan Restaurant (corporate name), doing business as <b>Chang's</b> Mongolian Grill. [...] From 1985 to 1999, the one-story structure comprising Dante's main room, at the southwest corner of West Burnside and Third Avenue, was the original <b>Chang's</b> Mongolian Grill. On April 1, 1999, Frank Faillace took over the lease from <b>Chang's,</b> remodeling and opening on February 3, 2000.|$|R
30|$|The {{non-uniform}} <b>Chang’s</b> AC technique proved {{superior to}} OS-EM AC methods for uniformity {{in parts of}} the liver investigated in the phantom study. The noise in the reconstructed SPECT image grew with {{an increase in the number}} of iterations when an OS-EM algorithm was used [17, 18]. OS-EM algorithms are used in both non-uniform <b>Chang’s</b> AC and OS-EM AC methods, and the same mu-map is used. The attenuation correction is performed in the iterative reconstruction process with OS-EM AC methods. However, with non-uniform <b>Chang’s</b> AC method, the correction is carried out after completion of the OS-EM reconstruction of the scatter corrected SPECT data. The increase in noise may influence the regional mu-value when the OS-EM AC method is used. On the other hand, regional mu-value is not affected by the non-uniform <b>Chang’s</b> AC method because the AC is not carried out in the iterative reconstruction process. This is considered to be one of the main reasons why the uniformity of the non-uniform <b>Chang’s</b> AC images was superior to that of the OS-EM AC images in this study.|$|R
5|$|Travelling to Hukow {{with the}} ransom money for Fang, Tintin comes across a flood that has {{destroyed}} a village and rescues a young Chinese orphan, <b>Chang</b> Chong-Chen. <b>Chang</b> accompanies Tintin to Hukow, {{where one of}} Mitsuhirato's spies ambushes them; they realise {{that it was a}} trap and that Fang was not there. Meanwhile, the detectives Thomson and Thompson are employed by Dawson to arrest Tintin, but fail on multiple occasions. Returning to Shanghai, Tintin intends to confront Mitsuhirato, and allows himself to be captured by him. Being held prisoner at The Blue Lotus, it is revealed that Mitsuhirato is working with the film director Rastapopoulos, who {{is the head of the}} international opium smuggling organisation that Tintin had previously battled in Cigars of the Pharaoh. However, Tintin formulates a plan, with <b>Chang</b> and the Sons of the Dragon appearing to rescue Tintin and Fang; Rastapopoulos is arrested while Mitsuhirato commits seppuku. Fang develops a cure for Rajaijah, while Wang adopts <b>Chang</b> as his son.|$|E
5|$|At its opening, <b>Chang</b> {{claimed the}} record for the tallest {{vertical}} loop of any roller coaster in the world. At the time, it was the world's tallest, fastest and longest stand-up coaster. It also claimed records for the largest drop and the most inversions on a stand-up roller coaster. All of these records had eclipsed those set by Mantis, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996. In 1998 Riddler's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, and <b>Chang</b> surrendered its titles.|$|E
