40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} a self-calibration algorithm that corrects the linearity errors of pipelined ADCs with a sub-radix architecture, {{based on the}} results of simple code density tests. The proposed algorithm identifies discontinuities in an ADC’s output histogram data, calculates correction codes for transitions in pipeline stages, and digitally calibrates ADC’s output codes. Simulation results show that the calibration algorithm can dramatically improve the linearity performance of ADCs. The INL can be reduced from about 1000 LSB to less than 1 LSB. Since this algorithm is based on conventional code density tests and uses only a few memory <b>cells</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> logic <b>circuits</b> to carry out the calibration, this algorithm can be easily implemented on chip without introducing much area and cost overhead and serving as a self-calibration solution for high-speed high-precision pipelined ADCs.
