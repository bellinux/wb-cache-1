50|$|Indium (111In) <b>capromab</b> {{pendetide}} (trade name Prostascint) is used {{to image}} the extent of prostate cancer. <b>Capromab</b> is a mouse monoclonal antibody which recognizes prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) from prostate cancer cells and normal prostate tissue. It is linked to pendetide, a derivative of DTPA. Pendetide acts as a chelating agent for the radionuclide indium-111. Following an intravenous injection of Prostascint, imaging is performed using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).|$|E

The antibody <b>capromab</b> pendetide reacts with prostate membrane specific antigen (PMSA) and can be labelled with Indium-111.|$|E
40|$|Correct {{staging of}} {{prostate}} cancer is an unmet clinical need. Radionuclide targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with In- 111 -labeled <b>capromab</b> pendetide (ProstaScint) is a clinical option for prostate cancer staging. We propose the use of I- 124 -labeled <b>capromab</b> to decrease the retention of radioactivity in healthy organs (due to the non-residualizing properties of the radiolabel). The use of I- 124 as a label should increase imaging sensitivity due to the advantages of PET as an imaging modality. <b>Capromab</b> targets the intracellular domain of PSMA; accumulation of radioactivity in the tumor should not depend on internalization of the antigen/antibody complex. <b>Capromab</b> was iodinated, and its targeting properties were compared with indium labeled counterpart in LNCaP xenografts in dual isotope mode. PSMA-negative xenografts (PC 3) were used as a negative control. Radioiodinated <b>capromab</b> bound to PSMA specifically. Biodistribution of I- 125 /In- 111 -capromab showed a more rapid clearance of iodine radioactivity from liver, spleen, kidneys, bones, colon tissue, as well as tumors. Maximum tumor uptake (13 +/- 8 % ID/g for iodine and 29 +/- 9 % ID/g for indium) and tumor-to-non-tumor ratios for both agents were measured 5 days post-injection (pi). High tumor accumulation and low uptake of radioactivity in normal organs were confirmed using microPET/CT 5 days pi of I- 124 -capromab...|$|E
40|$|Indium In 111 <b>capromab</b> {{pendetide}} (ProstaScint®; Cytogen Corporation, Princeton, NJ), a radiolabeled {{monoclonal antibody}} to prostate-specific membrane antigen, offers a potential means of localizing sites of soft tissue metastasis in prostate cancer patients. Although {{the test was}} previously limited by poor positive predictive value and specificity owing to the inherent limitations of single photon emission computed tomography, improvements in techniques of anatomic localization, along with increased reader experience, have significantly improved its accuracy. In addition to the conventional roles for ProstaScint, such as staging and detection of relapse, {{a number of new}} potential applications have emerged...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} label tissue-specific {{antibodies}} {{has long been}} of interest for improving detection and guidance for therapeutic applications. The most studied target for prostate cancer is the prostate-specific membrane antigen, which is upregulated in prostate cancer, hormone-refractive disease, and prostate cancer metastases. Investigations using radioimmunoscintigraphy with the radiolabeled 7 E 11 antibody <b>capromab</b> pendetide have significantly improved sensitivity for prostate cancer detection compared with standard cross-sectional imaging, based on tissue confirmation of pathologic results. Over the past 5 years, significantly greater image resolution from improved camera technology {{and the use of}} co-registration to fuse functional and anatomic (computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) images have dramatically enhanced prostate cancer localization. Outcomes data from several sources have spurred a resurgence in interest in this imaging modality...|$|E
30|$|Prostate-specific {{membrane}} antigen (PSMA) as {{a member}} of trans-membrane folate hydrolase family, which could enhanced the expression level in prostate cancer tissue other than benign or neoplastic epithelial prostate cells (Bostwick et al. 1998; Ross et al. 2003). A weak extra prostatic expression of PSMA has been reported in some other tissues (Renneberg et al. 1999; Silver et al. 1997) Therefore, the Hu 591 monoclonal antibody(mAb) targeting the PSMA extracellular domain, has been applied to the prostate cancer therapy (Liu et al. 1997; Nanus et al. 2003). An 111 In-labeled monoclonal antibody (<b>Capromab</b> pendetide, ProstaScint) could targeted to PSMA and used for imaging lymph node metastases. Recently, Zitzmann et al., have reported a novel peptide DUP 1 with specificity for PSMA-negative prostate tumor cell lines, such as DU- 145 and PC- 3, which was identified by phage display techniques.|$|E
30|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} common cancer in men in Europe, with 417, 000 new cases {{diagnosed}} in 2012 [1] and 75, 800 deaths predicted in 2016 [2]. Prognosis is very good if the disease is detected early when it is confined to the prostate gland. However, in the presence of metastatic disease, 5 -year survival drops significantly [1]. There is a need for sensitive imaging techniques to assess metastatic and locally recurrent PCa in order to improve the outcome for these patients [3]. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well-established marker for PCa, with elevated expression in virtually all PCa but particularly in high-grade disease [4]. The radiopharmaceutical 111 In <b>capromab</b> pendetide (ProstaScint, EUSA Pharma, licenced in the USA since 1997) is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets an internal epitope of PSMA, which limits its utility because of poor accessibility to circulating mAb [5]. In contrast, the mAb J 591 targets an external epitope and has shown more promise as an imaging agent, labelled with 111 In for SPECT imaging, 89 Zr for PET imaging and 177 Lu for targeted radionuclide therapy; however, no commercial product has emerged yet [6 – 8].|$|E
40|$|Advances in imaging technologies, {{including}} {{computerized tomography}} (CT) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), are improving {{the role of}} imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Hybrid (SPECT/CT) imaging, in particular, shows an increased sensitivity for identification of prostate cancer. Published studies have also recently proposed a new paradigm {{in the administration of}} radiation therapy for prostate cancer, favoring dose-escalation strategies to improve tumor control for localized disease. Conventional dose-escalation protocols have previously relied primarily on margin extension to the entire prostate gland to achieve dose-escalation; extending increased risk to radiosensitive normal structures. A newer strategy proposes use of advanced imaging to confine dose-escalation to biological target volumes identified on <b>capromab</b> pendetide SPECT/CT -fused image sets or image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). This strategy defines a shift in radiation dosimetry and planning from uniform glandular prescription dosing with dose-escalation applied generically to the peripheral regions and margin extension; to dose-escalation confinement to discrete regions of known disease as defined by focal uptake on radioimmunoscintigraphy fusion with anatomic image sets, with minimal margin extension. The introduction of advanced imaging for IGRT in prostate cancer has also introduced an improved capability for the early-identification of patients at risk for metastatic disease, where more aggressive therapeutic interventions may prove beneficial...|$|E
