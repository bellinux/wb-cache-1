25|$|The first AVST release, CallXpress 7.0, was in April 2004. Frost & Sullivan {{recognized}} AVST {{with the}} 2004 Entrepreneurial Company Award for its sound marketing strategy and {{identification of a}} new and exceptional product solution. In September 2004, AVST announced further validation of its strength in the market by procuring $10 million in new funding from Ignition Partners and Dolphin Equity Partners. Shortly after, in November 2004, AVST introduced CallXpress 7.5 which provided the <b>Centigram</b> telephone user interface emulation. CallXpress 7.5 also offered user administration via Microsoft Active Directory and SMTP message notification.|$|E
50|$|This {{acquisition}} occurred following Lernout & Hauspie's bankruptcy proceedings. Previously, Lernout & Hauspie {{had acquired}} these speech technology companies: BBS, Berkeley Speech Technologies (1996), <b>Centigram</b> Communications Corporation, Dragon Systems (2000), FDC, and Kurzweil Applied Intelligence (1998).|$|E
50|$|In 1795 {{a new law}} {{replaced}} the three names gravet, grave and bar by a single generic unit name: the gram. The new gram was equal to the old gravet. Four new prefixes were added to cover the same range of units as in 1793 (milligram, <b>centigram,</b> decigram, gram, decagram, hectogram, kilogram, myriagram). The brass prototype of the grave was renamed to provisional kilogram.|$|E
40|$|Iodine {{value is}} defined as the number of <b>centigrams</b> of iodine per gram of oil sample. Drying {{property}} of fatty oils mainly depends on the type of unsaturated fatty acids and relative amounts of each type of fatty acid in a unit weight of oil. Iodine value of fatty oil is a quantitative measure of unsaturation and hence fatty oils are categorized into drying oil, semidrying oil and non-drying based on iodine value. Fatty oils with iodine value above 150 mgg-l are called drying oils and iodine value in between 150 mgg-l and 120 mgg-l are semi drying oils, whereas fatty oils having iodine values below 120 mgg' are classified as non-drying oils...|$|R
25|$|On 10 February 1954, a {{few days}} after he talked to Pietro Scaglione, an {{assistant}} prosecutor from Palermo, Aspanu Pisciotta was assassinated by poison in his cell at Ucciardone Prison in Palermo while breakfasting with his cellmate father. The dose was a substantial 20 <b>centigrams</b> of strychnine, enough to kill 40 dogs. There {{can be little doubt that}} elements of Mafia committed the crime, with the blessing of the conservative and reactionary politicians with whom they were connected. When Ciro Verdiani and Cusumano Geloso died before their natural life expectancies, suspicions of poisoning were voiced. Benedetto Minasola was murdered in 1960. The Mafioso suspected of poisoning Pisciotta was shot in 1961, and Scaglione was killed by the Mafia while serving as Prosecutor General of Palermo in 1971.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} and practical method for characterizing refuse-derived fuels (RDF) {{with respect to}} greenhouse gas-relevance (or biomass content) is required by industries and waste management companies. As RDF usually consist {{of a variety of}} materials with different physical properties, sampling and sample preparation may represent crucial steps with regard to reliable analysis results. This is particularly valid for analytical methods, which rely on only small test specimens (<b>centigrams),</b> such as the adapted Balance Method (aBM). The aBM was recently developed by the authors and is based on elemental analyses (CHNSO). The investigations focus on elaborating an appropriate sample preparation for the aBM. To this end, two RDF model mixtures are generated out of paper, cardboard and different plastics, and comminuted down to a grain of size of < 0. 2 mm using two differing mills as finishing step. The results of the aBM (applied for 52 samples) show that the performance of the method in terms of trueness and variation is competitive relative to standardized methods. Deviations between the determined value and the theoretical biogenic mass fraction are below 4. 5 %rel (at a probability of 95 %). Furthermore, the standard deviation for both mixtures is below Â± 3. 0 %rel. A nested variance component analysis indicates that the last milling step and the step of drawing the test specimens for analysis contribute most to the observed variability. A consecutive application of two types of mills as a finishing step prior to analysis is proposed in order to facilitate a sufficient grinding of plastics as well as of cellulose fibers...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{there were over}} 30 {{companies}} vying for the corporate voicemail market. Among the many contenders were IBM, VMX, Wang, Octel, ROLM, AT&T, Northern Telecom, Delphi Communications, Voice and Data Systems, Opcom, Commterm, Genesis, Brook Trout, Innovative Technology (ITI), Glenayre, BBL, AVT, AVST, Digital Sound, <b>Centigram,</b> Voice-mail International and Active Voice. Only {{a few of these}} companies were successful in capturing a significant market share and remain in the voice-mail business today.|$|E

40|$|Human tissue-type {{plasminogen}} activator {{was produced}} in <b>centigram</b> quantities from 50 - 60 1 batches of conditioned medium of a human melanoma cell culture. The yields of the procedure remained essentially unchanged during 50 subsequent preparations. The final products were of high purity as assessed by SDS gel electrophoresis. These materials, after filtration on 0. 22 microM Milliporefilters were sterile and free of viruses and pyrogens. Their stability was very good in the fluid form at temperatures up to 56 degrees C.

40|$|Homogeneous {{fragments}} of exosporium were extricated in <b>centigram</b> amounts from dormant spores of Bacillus cereus and analyzed for intrinsic constituents. The membrane {{proved to be}} chemically complex but not unique, consisting mainly of protein (52 %), amino and neutral polysaccharides (20 %), lipids (18 %), and ash (4 %). Seventeen common amino acids were identified by chromatography, and were present in usual proportions except for low levels of cystine-cysteine, methionine, tyrosine, and histidine. Glucosamine was the only amino sugar, and glucose and rhamnose were the principal neutral sugars. The lipid fraction contained 5. 5 % cardiolipin as the only phospholipid, 12. 5 % neutral lipids, and at least 19 fatty acids, among which normal C 16 and C 18 ones predominated. Calcium and phosphorus occurred in the ash. Small amounts of teichoic, ribonucleic, and dipicolinic acids were believed to represent contamination...|$|E
