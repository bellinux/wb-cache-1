A typical probe uses a 9megohm {{series resistor}} shunted by a low-value capacitor {{to make an}} RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9megohm series resistor is shunted by a 12.2pF capacitor for a time constant of 110microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90pF in parallel with the scope input of 20pF and 1megohm (total capacitance 110pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, {{there will be an}} adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency.

Special high-voltage resistors are used in such probes as they must be able to tolerate high input voltages and, to produce accurate results, must have matched temperature coefficients and very low voltage coefficients. <b>Capacitive</b> <b>divider</b> probes are typically used for voltages above 100 kV, as the heat caused by power losses in resistor divider probes at such high voltages could be excessive.|$|E
