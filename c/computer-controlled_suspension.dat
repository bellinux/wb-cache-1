5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} highly {{regarded}} option is a <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> damping system called [...] "Skyhook". [...] This adaptive damping system uses coil-over shock absorbers {{and a set of}} six accelerometers that continually monitor the movement of the wheels and car body and transmits this information to a control unit. [...] The vehicle's computer analyzes this data and coordinates it with the Cambiocorsa transmission and other Maserati safety systems. Skyhook then calculates, and recalculates, the data at least 40 times per second and instantaneously adjusts each shock absorber accordingly. [...] When placed in the Sport mode, the suspension firms up for better cornering.|$|E
40|$|A {{design feature}} of many <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> systems, is {{their ability to}} adapt control law {{parameters}} to suit prevailing road conditions. Here, for systems employing high bandwidth actuators and state variable feedback control, the benefits of such adaptation are shown to be at best marginal. An optimal adaptive LQG system is compared with a fixed structure nonlinear feedback controller {{in the context of}} a simple quarter-vehicle suspension model. Performance comparisons are made, and trends considered under more realistic conditions. In consequence the overall usefulness of this type of adaptation is called into question...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. This study demonstrates a new nonlinear controller design methodology applicable to automotive suspension systems. It enhances {{the ability of the}} designer to tackle the complex design problem of a controller for a <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>suspension.</b> Based on the principles of optimal control, it permits the use of more general system models and cost functions than the standard linear optimal design techniques and hence, increases the freedom of the designer. It implements the control with an optimal, nonlinear feedback law and is shown to have the potential to improve vehicle performance. [Continues. ...|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{technology}} has shifted this curve outward, {{so that it}} is possible to offer vehicles that are extremely comfortable and still handle very well, like the Citroën DS, or vehicles with excellent handling that are also reasonably comfortable, like the Mercedes E-Class or BMW 5-Series. One technical solution for offering both excellent comfort and reduced or eliminating body roll is by using <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>suspensions,</b> such as hydraulic active suspension system (like Active Body Control) or active anti-roll bars, however such systems are expensive because of their complexity.|$|R
5000|$|No {{manual gearbox}} or limited slip {{differential}} option were available for any models. <b>Computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension</b> was available as a feature named [...] "Computer Active Technology Suspension" [...] (CATS).|$|R
5000|$|The {{general design}} concept was overseen by German {{industrial}} designer Alexander Neumeister. The running gear utilizes <b>computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension</b> for a smoother, safer ride, and yaw dampers are fitted between cars for improved stability. All sixteen cars in each original trainset were powered, giving {{a maximum of}} [...] Each train cost an estimated 5 billion yen, and only nine were built.|$|R
40|$|A {{suspension}} system is typically an indispensable component of any automotive system since it can effectively isolate the impact, vibration and shock {{emanating from the}} surface terrain to the tyre {{and then to the}} passenger in the vehicle when the vehicle moves along the terrain. It thereby provides to a certain extent, riding comfort {{on the part of the}} passenger/s in the vehicle. Since the development of the vehicle {{suspension system}}, designers have been faced with the conflict of vehicle safety versus ride comfort. Originally, this trade-off was minimized by the single optimal adjustment of a passive spring and damper. In more recent years, the development of <b>computer-controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> dampers and actuators has increased the investigation of the vehicle safety versus ride comfort trade-off, and has led to the development of numerous active and semi active suspension control designs (Wilkinson, 1994) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} won by Ayrton Senna in the Lotus 99T with its <b>computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension.</b> It {{was the second}} win in {{succession}} for Senna after his victory at Monaco. The Lotus rode the bumpy street circuit far better than the competition allowing Senna {{to take care of}} his tyres and cruise to a 33-second victory over the Williams FW11B of Nelson Piquet with reigning world champion Alain Prost finishing third in his McLaren MP4/3.|$|R
50|$|It was {{a complex}} hydropneumatic, <b>computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension</b> system. This {{did away with}} {{conventional}} springs and anti-roll (stabiliser) bars in favour of hydraulic struts controlled by an array of sensors (such as yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces. The system worked well and gave an unusually controlled yet smooth ride with no body roll. However, the additional weight and power requirements of the system affected straight-line performance somewhat.|$|R
50|$|In January 1990, CERV III (No. 3) {{made its}} debut at the International Auto Show in Detroit. The car's {{mid-mounted}} V-8 is a 5.7-liter 32-valve, dual-overhead cam LT5, with twin turbos and internal modifications, giving it , 655 lbft Nm- torque, and {{a top speed of}} 225 mph. The car was made of carbon fiber with a fiberglass-finish coating, with estimated price of $300k-400k. Other standard features include <b>computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension</b> system, ABS braking and traction control, six-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel-drive and four-wheel steering along with a fully multiplexed electrical architecture.|$|R
5000|$|BBC {{television}} commentator Murray Walker reported {{during the}} Australian GP that the FW13, like its predecessor, was {{originally designed to}} use the <b>computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension</b> rather than the conventional suspension used on most cars at the time. However, after the problems encountered {{in the first half}} of [...] with the FW12, Williams decided more work was needed on getting the active suspension to work better with the naturally aspirated engines of the time and converted the new car to passive suspension. Walker reported that this was the reason the FW13 had so late in making its race debut as the team worked hard in testing to get the handling of the car right before putting it into competition.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying was {{dominated}} by the Honda powered Williams, with Mansell ahead of Piquet. Third was Ayrton Senna with his Lotus. The Lotus 99T, now in the Yellow and Blue colours of new sponsors Camel Cigarettes, was using the <b>computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension</b> {{for the first time}} in the hope that its advantages (keeping the car at the optimum ride height) would give them an edge over the rest of the field. The total number of cars entered for the event was 23, but on race day the March team, who went into the race with a modified Formula 3000 car for F1 rookie Ivan Capelli due to their new car not being ready, ran out of Cosworth DFZs, blowing their last in the Sunday morning warm-up and there were only 22 starters.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the start}} of the [...] season Gérard was joined at Lotus by the talented Ayrton Senna. By the Portuguese Grand Prix held at a torrential Estoril, Senna would score his maiden win in a Ducarouge Lotus 97T. This was to be the first of 7 and culminated in the 1987 victory in Detroit. His 1987 car, the Lotus 99T was the first Formula One car to be fitted with a <b>computer-controlled</b> active <b>suspension</b> system. Also, after four seasons of using the {{turbocharged}} Renault V6 engine, the 99T would use the powerful Honda V6 turbo. Senna, growing increasingly dissatisfied with Lotus' ability to build a championship contending car, would {{by the end of the}} season be unkindly referring to the 99T as nothing more than a 98T (the teams [...] car) with a Honda engine instead of a Renault. The 99T was also visually more bulky than its competitors from Williams, Ferrari and McLaren.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Mark VII, the Mark VIII {{featured}} a unibody construction with a high-strength roof capable of withstanding 5000 lbs of force, heavy-gauge steel door beams {{to protect against}} side impacts, front and rear crumple zones, dual front-side airbags and four-wheel antilock disc brakes. Like the similar Thunderbird and Cougar, the Mark VIII {{featured a}} short-long arm (SLA) four-wheel independent suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars and a standard <b>computer-controlled</b> air <b>suspension</b> with sensors to automatically lower the ride height at high speed, enhancing the car's aerodynamic efficiency. Powering the Mark VIII was an all-new, all-aluminum 4.6 L DOHC 32-valve V8. The engine {{was the first of}} its kind in Ford's Modular engine family. The 4.6 L V8 produced [...] @ 5500 rpm and [...] of torque @ 4500 rpm and required premium grade 91-octane fuel for optimum performance. Handling the V8's power was the 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. The Mark VIII's rear axle ratio was 3.08:1. The Mark VIII also featured standard chrome dual exhaust tips and 16-inch cast aluminum wheels.|$|R
40|$|Manned {{spacecraft}} {{will never}} be free of acceleration perturbations due to necessary motions of crewmembers. However, in most cases, the perturbations can be minimized or even isolated from sensitive experiments when required. The principal disturbances and methods of isolation are described. As the crew moves about the spacecraft, no external forces are applied and the average acceleration remains near zero. External force will be exerted when jets are fired for spacecraft attitude control or translation, and these must {{be transferred to the}} microgravity experiments. Transitory acceleration and vibration are produced by crew and equipment. The most significant on Orbiter have been wall push-offs used for body translation within the spacecraft, the exercise conducted on a treadmill within the middeck area, closing doors of stowage compartments and the vibration of some machinery, such as a sample centrifuge. For short periods of perhaps a few minutes, crew and equipment motion can be largely inhibited, but not for much longer intervals. It may be necessary to mount especially sensitive experiments on an isolation table, which can greatly reduce the acceleration transferred to the experiment. Either weak mechanical springs or, even better, a <b>computer-controlled</b> electromagnetic <b>suspension</b> can be used to effectively insulate the table from vibration at frequencies above about 0. 01 Hz. Another option is to free-float an experiment table within the spacecraft. All of the above-mentioned perturbations can be eliminated for some minutes if the entire experiment package is allowed to free-float within the spacecraft until a wall contact is made. Package acceleration levels should be maintainable below 10 (exp - 8) g sub o in this way...|$|R
