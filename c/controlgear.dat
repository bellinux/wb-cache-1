5000|$|Australian Standard AS 2756.1997: Low-voltage {{switchgear}} and <b>controlgear</b> - Mounting rails for mechanical {{support of}} electrical equipment.|$|E
40|$|Specifies {{requirements}} for factory-assembled metal-enclosed switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> {{for alternating current}} of rated voltages above 1 kV and {{up to and including}} 52 kV for indoor and outdoor installation, and for service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz. Enclosures may include fixed and removable components and may be filled with fluid (liquid or gas) to provide insulation. This standard defines several types of metal enclosed switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> which differ due to - the consequences on network service continuity in case of maintenance on the switchgear and controlgear; - the need and convenience of maintenance of the equipment. For metal-enclosed switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> containing gas-filled compartments, the design pressure is limited to a maximum of 300 kPa (relative pressure). Metal-enclosed switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> for special use, for example, in flammable atmospheres, in mines or on board ships, may be subject to additional requirements. Components contained in metal-enclosed switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> are to be designed and tested in accordance with their various relevant standards. This standard supplements the standards for the individual components regarding their installation in switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> assemblies. This standard does not preclude that other equipment may be included in the same enclosure. In such a case, any possible influence of that equipment on the switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> is to be taken into account. This first edition of IEC 62271 - 200 cancels and replaces the third edition of IEC 60298, published in 1990, and constitutes a technical revision. Significant technical changes from the third edition of IEC 60298 are as follows: This revised document has been basically changed to be updated to today's use of high- voltage switchgear and <b>controlgear</b> up to 52 kV. The main changes are: new definitions and classification of equipment, introduction of internal arc classes (IAC) and its testing. This standard is...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. Low-voltage {{switchgear}} and <b>controlgear</b> assemblies with a rated short-circuit withstand strength above 10 kA, are required, by law, {{to conform}} to the South African standard, SANS 1473 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and <b>Controlgear</b> Assemblies: Part 1 : Typetested, partially type-tested and specially tested assemblies with rated short-circuit withstand strength above lOkA). Standard SANS 1473 - 1 stipulates three categories of assemblies i. e. type-tested, partially type-tested and specially tested assemblies. The specially tested assembly is unique to the South African market, while the other two categories are stipulated in standard SANS IEC 60439 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and <b>Controlgear</b> Assemblies: Part 1 : Type-tested and partially type-tested assemblies), which is internationally accepted in many countries as the applicable low-voltage assembly standard. Standard SANS 1473 - 1 specifies seven type-tests for certification as a type-tested assembly (TTA), but specifies, at most, three type-tests for certification as a specially tested assembly (STA). The underlying purpose of a technical standard is to provide for the safety of people and property, with the purpose of the research being twofold: 1. To investigate if the testing requirements specified for a specially tested assembly (STA), in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, are correctly applied, and do not pose any safety risks. 2. To investigate any safety risks that stem from the fact that four type-tests are excluded for verification as a specially tested assembly (STA), as opposed to the seven type tests required for verification as a type-tested assembly (TTA). The document highlights the technical inadequacies of an assembly that is certified as a STA, in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, and the potential safety risks associated with this type of assembly classification...|$|E
