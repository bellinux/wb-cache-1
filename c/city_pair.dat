40|$|Abstract: The {{observed}} excess price {{variability in}} cross-border <b>city</b> <b>pairs</b> {{compared to that}} in within-country <b>city</b> <b>pairs</b> {{has been defined as}} the “border effect. ” We used a unique data set from cities that were in the same country at one time and were in two separate countries later on {{to examine the effects of}} the presence of a national border on price variability. Interestingly a border-like effect was detected even during the period when all the cities were in the same country. We also found a large border effect when cities were in two separate countries. However, we found no change in the price variability at cross-border <b>city</b> <b>pairs</b> during the periods both before and after the cities separated into two different countries. This finding suggests that the observed systematic higher variability of consumer prices in cross-border <b>city</b> <b>pairs</b> might not be due to the presence of a border as suggested in the literature.

50|$|Users access an airline’s {{inventory}} {{through an}} availability display. It contains all offered flights {{for a particular}} city-pair with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the <b>city</b> <b>pair</b> is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending {{on the type of}} co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called passenger name record (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or special services requests (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveller systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{transportation}} technology {{may mean that}} topography matters less, but trade routes will continue to favour the paths of least resistance. The location of gateway cities and distribution hubs exhibit patterns of hierarchical systems. A change in technology that alters location advantage heightens corridor competition and in the longer term, it may modify the relative positions of cities in the regional hierarchy. Changes {{in transportation}} technology during the 1850 s and the 1950 s that altered the barriers {{of time and space}} reordered trade corridors in these periods. As the 21 st Century opens, the growing Asian economies are stimulating Pacific trade routes, and intermodal container shipping is causing a resurgence of railway opportunities for trade routes that are prepared to foster their development. This paper examines the concept of gateways and corridors, and the importance that strategic <b>city</b> <b>pairs</b> play in taking advantage of transportation opportunities. Its purpose is to encourage discussion on the topic of trade corridor competition. The first section presents a conceptual framework for examining trade corridors. Subsequently, two examples of strategic <b>city</b> <b>pairs</b> and corridor competition are considered. The paper concludes with some thoughts on the role of strategic <b>city</b> <b>pairs</b> in the promotion of the Mid-continent corridor. ...|$|R
