25|$|As {{the time}} passed, by autumn the Arab middle class had {{exhausted}} its resources. Under these circumstances, the Mandatory government {{was looking for}} an intermediary who might help persuade the Arab Higher Committee to end the rebellion. Al-Husseini and the Committee rejected King Abdullah of Transjordan as mediator because of his dependence on the British and friendship with the Zionists, but accepted the Iraqi Foreign Minister Nuri as-Said. As Wauchope warned of an impending military campaign and simultaneously offered to dispatch a Royal Commission of Inquiry to hear the Arab complaints, the Arab Higher Committee called off the strike on 11 October. When the promised Royal Commission of Inquiry arrived in Palestine in November, al-Husseini testified before it as <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> for the Arabs.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day on July 7, the prosecution's <b>chief</b> <b>witness,</b> Jones, testified that Bolden attempted {{to sell him}} government information for $50,000. He said that Bolden had driven him to a park where he showed him parts of a Secret Service file. During his testimony on July 9, Bolden denied all charges against him. He also denied that he had offered Richard Walter, an informant, $500 to kill Jones {{and said that he}} had only told Walter to stay away from Jones. Bolden's first jury deadlocked 11-1 in favor of conviction, at which time presiding judge Joseph Sam Perry issued an Allen charge in which he expressed his belief that Bolden was guilty but that the jury was free to disregard his opinion. The jury remained deadlocked, and Perry declared a mistrial on July 11, 1964. He set August 3 as the date for a new trial.|$|E
500|$|When von Engelken {{resigned}} in February 1917, his successor was Raymond T. Baker, who foresaw that women would hold high government positions in increasing numbers, and gave O'Reilly a more public role. [...] Each year, Baker appeared before Congress {{to defend the}} bureau's appropriation requests, and O'Reilly sat behind him. [...] In 1920 and 1921, Baker tried to get Congress to formally designate O'Reilly, who then held the title of executive clerk, as Assistant Director, but without success. After the Harding administration took office, Baker was replaced in 1922 by Frank E. Scobey, one of Harding's Ohio Gang. [...] The new director {{had little interest in}} Mint affairs, and O'Reilly not only supervised the bureau's operations, but was the <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> before Congress in 1922, defending both the appropriation request and the continuing drive to have herself designated Assistant Director. [...] This time, Congress was more amenable, and she gained the title effective from 1924.|$|E

500|$|In Greek tradition, clepsydrae {{were used}} in court; later, the Romans adopted this practice, as well. There are several {{mentions}} of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in Theaetetus, Plato says that [...] "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on". Another mention occurs in Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass: [...] "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak {{for as long as}} there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base". The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.|$|E
500|$|Ward's role {{on behalf}} of MI5 was {{confirmed}} in 1982, when the Sunday Times located his former contact [...] "Woods". Although Denning always asserted that Ward's trial and conviction were fair and proper, most commentators {{believe that it was}} deeply flawed—an [...] "historical injustice" [...] according to Davenport-Hines, who argues that the trial was an act of political revenge. One High Court judge said privately that he would have stopped the trial before it reached the jury. The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of the trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges, and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summing up. Above all, the judge failed to advise the jury of the evidence revealed in the Gordon appeal that Keeler, the prosecution's <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> against Ward, had committed perjury at the Gordon trial. In January 2014 Ward's case was being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which has the power to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice and refer cases to the Court of Appeal.|$|E
500|$|A <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> for the {{prosecution}} at Düsseldorf in the 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1970 trials was Franciszek Ząbecki, who was employed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as a rail traffic controller at Treblinka village from 22 May 1941. In 1977 he published his book Old and New Memories, in which he used his own records to estimate that at least 1,200,000 people died at Treblinka. His estimate {{was based on the}} maximum capacity of a trainset during the Grossaktion Warsaw of 1942 rather than its yearly average. The original German waybills in his possession did not have the number of prisoners listed. Ząbecki, a Polish member of railway staff before the war, {{was one of the few}} non-German witnesses to see most transports that came into the camp; he was present at the Treblinka station when the first Holocaust train arrived from Warsaw. [...] Ząbecki was a member of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army), which formed most of the Polish resistance movement in World War II, and kept a daily record of the extermination transports. He also clandestinely photographed the burning Treblinka II perimeter during the uprising in August 1943. Ząbecki witnessed the last set of five enclosed freight wagons carrying Sonderkommandos to the Sobibór gas chambers on 20 October 1943. In 2013, his son Piotr Ząbecki wrote an article about him for Życie Siedleckie that revised the number to 1,297,000. Ząbecki's daily records of transports to the camp, and demographic information regarding the number of people deported from each ghetto to Treblinka, were the two main sources for estimates of the death toll.|$|E

2500|$|Allan later {{spoke about}} the Paardekraal {{incident}} {{in an interview with}} the London Sunday Times, remarking that it resembled a [...] "set-up". She explained to Stuart Wavell; [...] "Fifteen police cars appeared and I don't know how many policemen. It was like the movies. I said, 'Am I on Candid Camera?'". Later, relations between the pair cooled and an acrimonious battle ensued in the press, with Allan taking legal action against Terre'Blanche because of repeated nuisance contact. A case of crimen injuria was laid against Terre'Blanche in March 1989 relating to the damaged gates, with Allan subpoenaed as <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> for the state. Ultimately Allan was not required to testify, and Terre'Blanche was acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|Defense lawyers {{suggested}} police used intimidation tactics on witnesses. On May 11, Moezeldin Elmostafa, {{an immigrant}} taxi driver {{who signed a}} sworn statement about Seligmann's whereabouts that defense lawyers say provides a solid alibi, was arrested on a 2½-year-old shoplifting charge. Arresting officers first {{asked if he had}} anything new to say about the lacrosse case. When he refused to alter his testimony, he was taken into custody. An arrest and conviction would have destroyed his chance for citizenship and could have led to his deportation. Elmostafa was subsequently tried on the shoplifting charge and acquitted, after a grainy security tape proved that a security guard who was the prosecution's <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> had [...] "misremembered" [...] events.|$|E
2500|$|... 29 BCE – Josephus {{writes that}} Herod had great passion and also great jealousy {{concerning}} his wife, Mariamne I. She learns of Herod's plans to murder her, and stops sleeping with him. Herod puts her on trial {{on a charge}} of adultery. His sister, Salome I, was <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> against her. Mariamne I's mother Alexandra made an appearance and incriminated her own daughter. Historians say her mother was next on Herod's list to be executed and did this only to save her own life. Mariamne was executed, and Alexandra declared herself Queen, stating that Herod was mentally unfit to serve. Josephus wrote that this was Alexandra's strategic mistake; Herod executed her without trial.|$|E

50|$|Still {{relatively}} new to their professions and without Johnson's {{active participation in}} the case, Aiken and Clampitt were woefully unprepared for their task.

But the necessities of an assize week, and of such a trial as this, level much of these distinctions, and they were both prepared to condescend and become affable.|$|R

September 14, 1920 Their case remanded until October 18, Busteed pleaded guilty to running a gambling house October 5, 1920 and fined $1,000. Gideon and the others were given similar sentences.

2500|$|In 1977 Florida {{sentence}}d to death child rapist William H. Shue. The state's Supreme Court vacated the sentence in 1978 and ordered him returned to the Ocala Circuit Court for resentencing. While declining to rule on the overall question of capital punishment for child rape, the court {{said there had been}} no showing in Shue's case of [...] "extraordinary cruelty or of violence or injury to the young victims." [...] The court noted that Judge Swigert had imposed the death penalty, although the jury that had convicted Shue had sentenced him to life imprisonment. Daniel Coler was {{sentenced to}} death in 1978 in Florida for the rape of his daughter as a child. Coler's death sentence was overturned in 1982 because the court found that irrelevant and prejudicial testimony had been introduced in his case, preventing a fair trial. The state said that it would not retry him, as the victim did not want to testify and the other <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> had died in an auto accident. Coler was set free after 4 1/2 years on death row.|$|E
2500|$|The Hunts, {{like the}} Riverses, were an {{established}} naval and Church of England family. One of those {{destined for the}} pulpit was Thomas (1802–1851), but some quirk of originality set him off into an unusual career. [...] While an undergraduate at Cambridge, Thomas Hunt {{had a friend who}} stammered badly and his efforts to aid the afflicted student led him to leave the University without taking a degree {{in order to make a}} thorough study of speech and its defects. He built up a good practice as a speech therapist and was patronised by Sir John Forbes MD FRS, who sent him pupils for twenty four years. [...] Hunt's most famous case came about in 1842 when George Pearson, the <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> in the case respecting the attempt on the life of Queen Victoria made by John Francis, was brought into court he was incapable of giving his evidence. However, after just a fortnight's instruction from Hunt he spoke easily, a fact certified by the sitting magistrate. Hunt died in 1851, survived by his wife Mary and their two children. His practice was then passed on to his son, James.|$|E

2500|$|Rezko's {{relationship}} with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich {{and his family}} were {{at the root of the}} federal corruption case which led to Rezko's conviction. Rezko donated $117,652 to Blagojevich's campaigns, and is credited by the prosecutor in his trial with having delivered bundled contributions totalling almost $1.44 million. Since 1997, Blagojevich's wife, Patricia, has made at least $38,000 acting as Rezko's real-estate agent on several of his company's property acquisitions. When Blagojevich won the Illinois gubernatorial election in 2002, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years. Rezko recommended many of his business associates and their relatives for positions within state government, three of whom were appointed to the state board that oversees hospital projects. the state's development board was run by another former Rezko business associate. Rezko and Republican fundraiser Stuart Levine were charged in a 24-count federal indictment for allegedly using Rezko's influence with public officials to demand millions of dollars in kickbacks from companies that wanted to do business with the state. [...] Levine pleaded guilty and served as the <b>chief</b> <b>witness</b> against Rezko at trial. [...] Levine and several other witnesses implicated Blagojevich in the schemes.|$|E

How did he come up with that? I have seen it with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kenny {{claimed in}} her 1943 {{autobiography}} (co-authored by Martha Ostenso) that she treated her first cases of infantile paralysis in 1910 while working alone as a bush nurse in the Clifton district. That episode was romanticised in the 1946 film Sister Kenny, featuring Rosalind Russell (who befriended Kenny). Surveillance {{records from the}} early 1900s show that infantile paralysis was a rare disease in Queensland prior to World War I, although {{there is evidence that}} subacute cases were brought to Kenny's cottage hospital in Clifton. In her memoir, Kenny claimed she was baffled by the cases she encountered and sought assurance from Dr. Aeneas McDonnell. He wired back, [...] "...treat them according to the symptoms as they present themselves". Sensing that their muscles were tight, she did what mothers around the world did: applied hot compresses and weights made from woollen blankets to their legs. Kenny wrote in her autobiography that a little girl woke up very much relieved and said, [...] "Please, I want them rags that well my legs". Several children recovered with no serious aftereffects. Many years passed before Kenny treated anyone else who might have had polio. The story of Kenny's first encounter with an acute case of polio is a 20th-century medical legend, but there is no documented record other than her memoir.
