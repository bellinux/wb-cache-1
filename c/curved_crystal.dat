In all these domains his interests {{are concerned with}} the concept of defect, in the continuation of F.C. Frank and J. Friedel. He demonstrated the role of <b>curved</b> <b>crystal</b> defects in the topology of frustrated systems. He developed with J. Friedel the concepts of continuous defects.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Cauchois {{established}} the fundamental principles {{of a new}} x-ray spectrometer that was both {{easy to use and}} had a high resolution, satisfying the Bragg reflection condition. The new spectrometer was named after her, and from 1934 she used it to observe gas emissions and multiplets. The new technique was used around the world for the analysis of x-rays and gamma rays and prompted a wave of new scholarship in radiation studies. Cauchois pioneered developments in x-ray imaging and observed that x-ray radiation could be focused using <b>curved</b> <b>crystal</b> for use in monochromators and x-ray scattering. Cauchois' work on soft x-ray distributions was the first step in determining the photo-absorption spectra. She used the radiation reflected from crystals to study the electronic structure of materials.|$|E
50|$|Micro x-ray {{fluorescence}} (µXRF) is an elemental analysis technique {{that relies on}} the same principles as {{x-ray fluorescence}} (XRF). The difference is that micro x-ray fluorescence has a spatial resolution with a diameter many orders of magnitude smaller than conventional XRF. While a smaller excitation spot {{can be achieved by}} restricting x-ray beam using a pinhole aperture, this method blocks much of the x-ray flux which has an adverse effect on the sensitivity of trace elemental analysis. Two types of x-ray optics, polycapillary and doubly <b>curved</b> <b>crystal</b> focusing optics, are able to create small focal spots of just a few micrometers in diameter. By using x-ray optics, the irradiation of the focal spot is much more intense and allows for enhanced trace element analysis and better resolution of small features. Micro x-ray fluorescence using x-ray optics has been used in applications such as forensics, small feature evaluations, elemental mapping, mineralogy, electronics, multi-layered coating analysis, micro-contamination detection, film and plating thickness, biology and environment.|$|E

The model generalizes the results based on the dynamical theory of diffraction, which are valid only for crystals with a radius of curvature lower than the critical curvature.

5000|$|Monochromatic {{wavelength}} dispersive {{x-ray fluorescence}} (MWD XRF) is an enhanced version of conventional wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDXRF) elemental analysis. The key {{difference is that}} MWD XRF uses a doubly <b>curved</b> <b>crystal</b> X-ray optic between the X-ray source and the sample resulting in monochromatic excitation. [...] This additional optic creates a high-intensity X-ray beam on a small spot size without increasing {{the power of the}} X-ray source. An MWD XRF instrument is constructed from a low-power X-ray tube, a point-to-point focusing optic for excitation, a sample cell, a focusing optic that collects the fluorescence from the sample, and an X-ray detector. By using an optic between the X-ray source and the sample, a monochromatic beam free of bremsstrahlung, excites the sample, eliciting the secondary fluorescence X-rays needed for elemental analysis. By restricting the band of wavelengths used for excitation, a much higher signal to background ratio is achieved. This type of excitation allows much lower limits of detection and faster reading times.|$|E

Among the French of Port-des-Singes, it is called peradam. Ivan Lapse remains puzzled by the formation and root meaning of this word. It may mean, according to him, [...] "harder than diamond," [...] and it is; or [...] "father of the diamond," [...] and they say that the diamond is in fact the product of the degeneration of the peradam by a sort of quartering of the circle or, more precisely, cubing of the sphere. Or again, the word may mean [...] "Adam's stone," [...] having some secret and profound connection to the original nature of man. The clarity of this stone is so great and its index of refraction so close to that of air that, despite the crystal's great density, the unaccustomed eye hardly perceives it. But to anyone who seeks it with sincere desire and true need, it reveals itself by its sudden sparkle, like that of dewdrops.

Desorption probed by spatially-resolved TPD of multilayers of H 2 O shows no dependence on the exact substrate structure and thus confirms the absence of thermal gradients during temperature ramps. In the submonolayer regime, we observe a small and linear dependence of the desorption temperature on the A and B step density.
