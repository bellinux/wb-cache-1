The thermal, mechanical and elastic {{properties of the}} compacted PEUU materials were studied. With increasing urea content, the shear modulus was increased, while the glass transition temperature (Tg) remained low and unaffected. The Tg's of PEEU's with PPO segments were, however, lower than with PPO-co-PEO segments, indicating more mixing of urea segments with PPO-co-PEO. The flow temperatures of both PEUU's were high (300 °C) for all compositions. The <b>compression</b> <b>sets,</b> tensile sets and hysteresis energy of the PEUU's were low and increased with urea content. The use of PPO-co-PEO segments resulted in PEEU's with higher <b>compression</b> <b>sets</b> and tensile sets and also more hysteresis.

50|$|Silicone rubber offers good {{resistance}} to extreme temperatures, {{being able to}} operate normally from -100 to 300 C. Some properties such as elongation, creep, cyclic flexing, tear strength, <b>compression</b> <b>set,</b> dielectric strength (at high voltage), thermal conductivity, fire resistance {{and in some cases}} tensile strength can be—at extreme temperatures—far superior to organic rubbers in general, although a few of these properties are still lower than for some specialty materials. Silicone rubber is a material of choice in industry when retention of initial shape and mechanical strength are desired under heavy thermal stress or sub-zero temperatures. Organic rubber has a carbon-to-carbon backbone which can leave it susceptible to ozone, UV, heat and other ageing factors that silicone rubber can withstand well. This makes silicone rubber one of the elastomers of choice in many extreme environments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{hierarchical}} lossy image <b>set</b> <b>compression</b> al-gorithm (HMSTa) {{has recently}} been proposed for lossy <b>compression</b> of image <b>sets.</b> It was shown that this algorithm performs well when an image set contains well separated clusters of similar images. As a result, if one applies the HMSTa algorithm after a clustering algorithm has been applied, the compression performance depends on the qual-ity of the partition. In this paper, we examine a number of well-known hierarchical clustering methods and cluster validity measures, and their relationships to the compression performance of HMSTa. This relationship {{can be used as}} a component in a fully automated image <b>set</b> <b>compression</b> algorithm.

40|$|The biggest {{challenge}} in image <b>set</b> <b>compression</b> {{is how to}} efficiently remove the set redundancy among images {{as well as the}} redundancy inside a single image. Different from all the previous schemes, in this paper we are the first to propose a generic image <b>set</b> <b>compression</b> scheme which removes the set redundancy based on local features in addition to luminance values. The SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) descriptor which characterizes an image region invariant to scale and rotation is utilized in our scheme to measure and further enhance the correlation among images. Given an image set, we build a minimal cost prediction structure according to the SIFT-based prediction measure between images. We also utilize a SIFT-based global transformation to enhance the correlation between two images by aligning them to each other in terms of both geometry and intensity. The set redundancy and image redundancy are both further reduced by block-based motion estimation and rate-distortion optimal mechanism proposed in HEVC. Experimental results show that our new feature based scheme always produces the best result regardless the image set’s properties.

40|$|We propose an {{extensive}} {{analysis of the}} behavior of majority votes in binary classification. In particular, we introduce a risk bound for majority votes, called the C-bound, that takes into account the average quality of the voters and their average disagreement. We also propose {{an extensive}} PAC-Bayesian analysis that shows how the C-bound can be estimated from various observations contained in the training data. The analysis intends to be self-contained and can be used as introductory material to PAC-Bayesian statistical learning theory. It starts from a general PAC-Bayesian perspective and ends with uncommon PAC-Bayesian bounds. Some of these bounds contain no Kullback-Leibler divergence and others allow kernel functions to be used as voters (via the sample <b>compression</b> <b>setting).</b> Finally, out of the analysis, we propose the MinCq learning algorithm that basically minimizes the C-bound. MinCq reduces to a simple quadratic program. Aside from being theoretically grounded, MinCq achieves state-of-the-art performance, as shown in our extensive empirical comparison with both AdaBoost and the Support Vector Machine.

These studies {{examined}} the compressive force loss of fluorosilicone o-rings at accelerated (elevated) temperatures and were {{then used to}} make predictions about force loss at room temperature.

The <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> of these fluorosilicone o-rings {{was found to have}} a reasonably linear correlation with the force loss. The aging predictions based on using the observed curvature of the Arrhenius aging plots were validated by field aged o-rings that yielded degradation values reasonably close to the predictions. <b>Compression</b> <b>set</b> studies of silicone o-rings from a previous study resulted in good correlation to the force loss predictions for the fluorosilicone o-rings from this study.
