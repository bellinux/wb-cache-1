5000|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit, the rapid {{expansion}} of which is traced to Slade's Case (1602). The medieval law of contract developed in a fractured way through the old actions of covenant, debt and account. In the 1500s litigants began to use the action on the case to enforce contractual agreements (with the exception of <b>contracts</b> <b>under</b> <b>seal,</b> for which debt sur obligation was required), a shift vindicated in Slade's Case. The modern law of contract then gradually began to take shape.|$|R
5000|$|Second, the {{doctrine}} of consideration requires a person with whom a <b>contract</b> not <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> is made is only able to enforce it if there is consideration from the promisee to the promisor.|$|R

50|$|William Wetmore Story {{was the son}} of jurist Joseph Story and Sarah Waldo (Wetmore) Story. He {{graduated}} at Harvard College in 1838 and at the Harvard Law School in 1840, {{continued his}} law studies under his father, was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, and prepared two legal treatises of value — Treatise on the Law of <b>Contracts</b> not <b>under</b> <b>Seal</b> (2 vols., 1844) and Treatise on the Law of Sales of Personal Property (1847).|$|R
5000|$|In {{contract}} law, {{a simple}} contract is a contract made orally or in writing, {{rather than a}} <b>contract</b> made <b>under</b> <b>seal.</b> Simple <b>contracts</b> require consideration to be valid, but simple contracts may be implied from the conduct of parties bound by the contract. William Blackstone observed in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that in the seventeenth century, debtors used simple contracts as one of three accepted forms of unsecured debt instruments. In 1828, the Parliament of the United Kingdom amended the statute of frauds so that oral acknowledgments or promises {{could not be used}} as evidence to prove the existence of a simple contract. Today, some American jurisdictions have established that a security interest is perfected [...] "when a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire a judicial lien that is superior to the interest" [...] of the secured party.|$|R
50|$|Normally, records {{should not}} be filed <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> without a court permission. However, FRCP 5.2 {{requires}} that sensitive text - like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts, and children’s names - should be redacted off the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits. A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy <b>under</b> <b>seal,</b> or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> without redaction. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court’s permission to file some exhibits completely <b>under</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Normally records {{should not}} be filed <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> without court permission. However, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 allows a person making a {{redacted}} filing to also file an unredacted copy <b>under</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Filing <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> is a {{procedure}} allowing sensitive or confidential {{information to be}} filed with a court without becoming {{a matter of public}} record. The court generally must give permission for the material to remain <b>under</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Attorney General may, in his discretion, seize {{or place}} <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> any {{controlled}} substances owned or possessed by a registrant whose registration has expired or who {{has ceased to}} practice or do business in the manner contemplated by his registration. Such controlled substances shall be held {{for the benefit of}} the registrant, or his successor in interest. The Attorney General shall notify a registrant, or his successor in interest, who has any controlled substance seized or placed <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> of the procedures to be followed to secure the return of the controlled substance and the conditions under which it will be returned. The Attorney General may not dispose of any controlled substance seized or placed <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> <b>under</b> this subsection until the expiration of one hundred and eighty days from the date such substance was seized or placed <b>under</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R

Before the arraignment, Hastert arrived at The Loop offices of Sidley Austin, his attorney's law firm, and at the courthouse met with the pretrial services office.|$|R
50|$|A person {{making a}} {{redacted}} filing can file an unredacted copy <b>under</b> <b>seal,</b> or the Court {{can choose to}} order later that an additional filing be made <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> without redaction. Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with court should be provided to the other parties in the case. Some courts also require that an additional electronic courtesy copy be emailed to the other parties.|$|R

5000|$|Formerly, {{the term}} [...] "power" [...] {{referred}} to an instrument signed <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> while a [...] "letter" [...] was an instrument under hand, {{meaning that it}} was simply signed by the parties, but today a power of attorney need not be signed <b>under</b> <b>seal.</b> Some jurisdictions require that powers of attorney be notarized or witnessed, but others will enforce a power of attorney {{as long as it}} is signed by the grantor.|$|R

500|$|At {{a status}} hearing on June 18 (which Hastert did not attend), Hastert's {{attorney}} Green stated that [...] "Something {{has to be}} done to stop these leaks. They're unconscionable, and they have to stop." [...] Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Block told Durkin that prosecutors were also troubled by the leaks and that the government is [...] "doing everything we can" [...] to stop them. At the same status conference, Durkin told the attorneys that he plans to modify the protective order to make it less restrictive. Rather than having all material that might be considered sensitive filed <b>under</b> <b>seal,</b> Durkin said that he might grant a motion directing lawyers to file a motion requesting that the material be filed <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> first. If Durkin granted such a motion, the attorneys would file both a complete copy <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> and a redacted copy that would be publicly available.|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} phrase signed, sealed {{and delivered}} {{refers to the}} practice of seals; however, attesting witnesses have replaced seals to some extent. Agreements <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> are also called contracts by deed or specialty; in the United States, a specialty is enforceable without consideration. In some jurisdictions, specialties have a liability limitation period of double that of a simple contract and allow for a third party beneficiary to enforce an undertaking in the deed, thereby overcoming the doctrine of privity. Specialties, as a form of contract, are [...] and can therefore be distinguished from covenants, which, being also <b>under</b> <b>seal,</b> are unilateral promises.|$|R
