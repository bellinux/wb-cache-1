40|$|Mark-to-market {{accounting}} helps create asset {{bubbles and}} exacerbate their negative collateral consequences when they burst. It does the latter by forcing {{the hand of}} counterparties to demand collateral {{even when it is}} inefficient to do so. Watchful waiting and inaction is often the more efficient course of action. Yet often this is the road not taken, out of fear of litigation and regulatory sanctions. Nonetheless, as a business matter, forbearance on foreclosure may well make sense if the party is optimistic about future values and a <b>collateral</b> <b>call</b> would generate assets sales that, under present mark-to-market rules, would negatively impact these values. But if the party forbears and is wrong about the future values, shareholders may sue the firm for not exercising its legal rights in order to protect their interests. Because future values are uncertain, litigation costs are high, and courts are likely to make some mistakes, firms will demand excessive levels of collateral. In this environment, the high transaction costs of coordination and fear of potential antitrust liability can combine to cause a rush to seize or demand collateral, even when collective forbearance would be more efficient. These problems of imperfect litigation and antitrust rules will sometimes cause action to be taken when inaction would be the more efficient course. Deleveraging cascades will result, thereby increasing the risk of financial meltdown. This article explores these and other issues surrounding the mark-to-market controversy. No system of valuing a firm 2 ̆ 7 s assets and liabilities is perfect, so our critique of mark to market does not clinch the case for the reinstating historical cost accounting. Rather our goal is to simply point out previously unrecognized problems with mark to market, based on their interaction with the legal system. Armed with an understanding of how litigation risk can influence market participants 2 ̆ 7 behavior under different valuation rules may help standard setters in the industry modify the existing rules to reduce the chance of future market meltdowns...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{liquidity}} risk on a firm's production and hedging decisions. Liquidity needs result from the revaluation of forward contracts prior to maturity and <b>collateral</b> <b>calls</b> {{in the case of}} losses. The provision of collateral causes financing costs, which depend on a firm-specific borrowing rate. Within a model of a risk-averse firm under price uncertainty, I derive bounds on optimal output quantities and hedge ratios for general utility functions and the special case of CRRA. It is shown that even firms with a high credit standing might reduce their forward positions substantially in response to liquidity risk. A model extension allows the firm to hedge its liquidity needs with call options. The analysis leads to different recommendations than previous studies, which focus on futures hedging under a borrowing constraint...|$|R

5000|$|A {{closely related}} {{contract}} is a futures contract; they differ in certain respects. Forward contracts {{are very similar}} to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets. Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or [...] "true-ups" [...] in margin requirements like futures - such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded over the counter (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain. In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the <b>collateral</b> <b>calls</b> based upon certain [...] "trigger" [...] events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame, e.g., quarterly, annually, etc.|$|R

40|$|The 2007 – 09 {{financial}} crisis {{drew attention to}} the nature and consequences of connections among financial firms. New reporting standards set {{in the wake of the}} crisis have shed more light on these ties in current financial markets. New data are available on the magnitude of risk exposure and the types of collateral that link bank holding companies with their trading partners in over-the-counter derivatives markets. The data show that both the level of risk and diversity of collateral involved in these contracts vary widely depending on the type of counterparties. During the 2007 – 09 {{financial crisis}}, the degree to which financial institutions were linked through over-the-counter (OTC) asset markets was eye-opening and has since been identified as an important contributor to financial fragility. Financial firms have long been linked through traditional lending agreements. However, the connections created by more complex contracts, such as OTC derivatives and repurchase agreements, are more relevant to the risk these firms face because they are closely tied to the values of fast-moving financial variables. For these transactions, collateral—assets that can be seized in case of nonpayment—is stated as a standard contract term to mitigate credit losses in case a partner defaults.

40|$|The paper reconsiders {{the role}} of money and banking in {{monetary}} policy analysis by including a banking sector and money in an optimizing model otherwise of a standard type. The model is implemented quantitatively, with a calibration based on U. S. data. It is reasonably successful in providing an endogenous explanation for substantial steady-state differentials between the interbank policy rate and (i) the collateralized loan rate, (ii) the uncollateralized loan rate, (iii) the T-bill rate, (iv) the net marginal product of capital, and (v) a pure intertemporal rate. We find a differential of over 3 % pa between (iii) and (iv), thereby contributing to resolution of the equity premium puzzle. Dynamic impulse response functions imply pro-or-counter-cyclical movements in an external finance premium that can be of quantitative significance. In addition, they suggest that a central bank that fails to recognize the distinction between interbank and other short rates could miss its appropriate settings {{by as much as}} 4 % pa.

I also demonstrate that such a standard is implementable by providing examples of existing disclosures from large dealer firms in their quarterly filings. These disclosures often contain useful firm-level data on derivatives, but {{due to a lack of}} standardization, they cannot be aggregated to assess the risk to the system. I highlight the important contribution that reporting the “margin coverage ratio” (MCR), namely the ratio of a derivatives dealer’s cash (or liquidity, more broadly) to its contingent <b>collateral</b> or margin <b>calls</b> in case of a significant downgrade of its credit quality, could make toward assessing systemic risk contributions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{collateral}} systems commonly {{employed by}} many derivatives central counterparties (CCPs), {{such as the}} Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) or the Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach, fail to consider the loss dependence of their clearing members. As a consequence, CCPs are often left exposed to simultaneous extreme losses that could undermine their stability {{and that of the}} entire financial system. In this context, this thesis proposes two new collateral methodologies that address this problem. Chapter 2 uses copulas to develop a methodology that accounts for the tail dependence of market participants. This method allows individual margins to increase when clearing firms are more likely to suffer simultaneous extreme losses; thus, reducing the probability and shortfall associated with joint margin exceedances. Chapter 3 proposes a <b>collateral</b> methodology, <b>called</b> CoMargin, which generalizes the VaR approach to a multivariate setting. This method targets and stabilizes the conditional probability of financial distress across clearing members, can be generalized to any number of market participants and can be backtested using formal statistical tests. The empirical sections of Chapter 3 use proprietary data from the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), which include daily observations of the actual trading positions of all of its members from 2003 to 2011. This dataset is the first one {{of its kind in the}} economics and finance literature and opens the door to the development of new models that do not have to rely on the strong assumptions made in the past about the trading behaviour of market participants...|$|R

40|$|A bank {{borrowing}} some money {{has to give}} some securities to the lender, which is <b>called</b> <b>collateral.</b> Different kinds of collateral can be posted, like cash in different currencies or a stock portfolio depending on {{the terms of the}} contract, which is called a Credit Support Annex (CSA). Those contracts specify eligible collateral, interest rate, frequency of collateral posting, minimum transfer amounts, etc. This guarantee reduces the counterparty risk associated with this type of transaction. If a CSA allows for posting cash in different currencies as collateral, then the party posting collateral can, now and at each future point in time, choose which currency to post. This choice leads to optionality that needs to be accounted for when valuing even the most basic of derivatives such as forwards or swaps. In this thesis, we deal with the valuation of embedded optionality in collateral contracts. We consider the case when collateral can be posted in two different currencies, which seems sufficient since collateral contracts are soon going to be simplified. This study is based on the conditional independence approach proposed by Piterbarg [8]. This method is compared to both Monte-Carlo simulation and finite- difference method. A practical application is finally presented with the example of a contract between Natixis and Barclays. ...|$|R
