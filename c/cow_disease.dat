5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad <b>cow</b> <b>disease</b> and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

How to use the limited data to show the general spatial distribution of the disease is a key issue in building the efficient spatial monitoring method. We use GIS application software ArcGIS 9. 1 to overcome the lack of data of sampling sites and establish a prediction model in estimation of the disease distribution.

40|$|The {{presence}} of somatic cells in milk {{is a widely}} disputed issue in milk production sector. The somatic cell counts in raw milk are a marker for the specific <b>cow</b> <b>diseases</b> such as mastitis or swollen udder. The high level of somatic cells causes physical and chemical changes to milk composition and nutritional value, and as well to milk products. Also, the mastitic milk is not proper for human consumption due to its contribution to spreading of certain diseases and food poisoning. According to these effects, EU Regulations established the maximum threshold of admitted somatic cells in raw milk to 400000 cells / mL starting with 2014. The {{purpose of this study}} was carried out in order to examine the raw milk samples provided from small farms, industrial type farms and milk processing units.

Despite the amazing fact that farmers’ participation in the dairy value chain has promised the better outcome, there are still millions of rural farmer households struggling against the inefficient production and marketing, and decline with hope of improving their main source of income. Plus the extreme price volatility and the market power of downstream actors, rural dairy farmers with small-scale production have verged to the edge of selling up the whole supply chain.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 40 years, dairy cow {{breeding}} {{has led to}} very high yielding cows (more than doubled average annual milk yields in most dairying countries), but also to a deterioration in cow health, fertility and longevity (Pryce et al. (1999)). Consequently, many breeding organizations {{all over the world}} are seeking to include functional traits in their breeding programmes (Groen et al. (1997), Christensen et al. (1998)). A great amount of research is done on potential index traits for indirect selection for health traits (Groen et al. (1997)). The whole constitution of the animals is to some extent considered in Scandinavian breeding programmes using the epidemiological data of all herd book animals (Philipsson et al. (2000)) and in breeding for life time dairy performance (Haiger (2000)). Our working hypothesis is that animal constitution has to do with the intensity of their species-specific character and expression. We propose to develop an evaluation model by comparing the vertebrates’ early embryonic states and their embryonic development: All vertebrates exhibit quite similar early embryonic states. Species-specific differentiation appears during later embryonic development. The specialization of the organ systems occurs with different intensities for each species resulting in different “morphologic valencies” (Portmann (1983)). The “morphologic valency” derives from the degree of differentiation of the organs (Portmann (1983)). It is possible to group the organ systems in a metabolic-limb-system, a rhythmic system (blood circulation and respiration) and a nerve-senses-system (after Schad (1971) and Steiner (1917)). Most animal species develop one of those three organ systems to a great extent. Ruminants develop highly specialized limbs and a highly differentiated digestion system: their four stomachs and their intestinal organs are more complex than those of all other mammals. Their life is dominated by these organs: dairy cows spend at least two thirds of a day eating and ruminating. Animal welfare is strongly influenced by the state of health of those specialized organs. Many <b>cow</b> <b>diseases</b> correlate with imbalances in the digestion system (Lotthammer (1992), Spranger (1998)). To assess animal constitution we propose giving special attention to physiology and behaviour with respect to these highly specialized organs and to the corresponding temperament (most animals with a highly specialized digestion and metabolic system tend to have a calm disposition (Marek et al. (1956)). We are thus looking for links between health, ruminating behaviour, metabolic and digestion parameters and temperament of dairy cows. Such observations need to be done under appropriate animal husbandry conditions. 60 dairy cows on a biodynamic farm in Switzerland were observed in terms of ruminating behaviour (ruminating time per day and per ruminating period, frequency of ruminating periods per day, jaw movements per bolus, chewing time per bolus, ruminating speed), body condition score (BCS after Ferguson et al. (1994)), manure consistency and temperament (nervousness / calmness while being brushed by an unknown person). Most methods for these observations had to be developed (Schneider (2002)). The records thus gained were correlated to the health parameters of the same <b>cows</b> (<b>disease</b> incidence, somatic cell score; methods for this were developed by Silvia Ivemeyer). The cows exhibited individual differences in all parameters. Multiparous cows chewed less and slower than primiparous cows. High yielding multiparous cows chewed less than lower yielding multiparous cows. Chewing time per bolus correlated negatively with mastitis incidence. Nervous cows exhibited higher somatic cell scores and a tendency to higher disease incidences than calm cows. Standard deviations in BCS correlated with metabolic diseases, claw diseases and reproduction problems. Evaluations are ongoing...|$|R

Dataset used for analyses comprised 1293 lactation data from 859 Holstein cows. The datasets for LDA, ketosis and DD were analysed separately. Mixed model procedures were used to analyse the DMY. In terms of LDA and ketosis the difference between parity 1 and parity ≥ 2 was not statistically significant, whereas, the difference was significant for DD. It was observed that 68 % of LDA cases and 62 % of ketosis cases were in first two weeks of lactation. All LDA cases were in the first eight weeks of lactation and all ketosis cases (other than one case) were in the first ten weeks of lactation. Digestive disorder cases were seen in all peri-ods of lactation. Milk losses were observed two weeks before the diagnosis of LDA and one week before the diagnosis of ketosis and DD. It was determined that the highest milk loss in all three dis-eases was in diagnose week and the milk losses in diagnose week were 8. 1 kg/day in LDA, 6. 21 kg/day in ketosis and 2. 86 kg/day in DD. For all three diseases, decreases in lactation milk yield of ill cows were observed when compared to healthy cows, however, these differences were not statistically significant.
