5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} relating to the establishment clause, where he insisted on the strict separation of <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.|$|E
5|$|Beneath the ealdormen, reeves—royal {{officials}} who were noble local landowners—were {{in charge of}} a town or royal estate. The authority of <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> was not separated in early medieval societies, and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan bishop and local abbots, who also attended the king's royal councils.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation. He delivered {{the opinion of the}} court in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government, but also to the states.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Churches</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> are {{separated}} {{at the federal}} level since 1848. However, the article 72 ("Church and state") of the constitution determine that [...] "The regulation {{of the relationship between the}} <b>church</b> <b>and</b> the <b>state</b> is the responsibility of the cantons". Some cantons of Switzerland recognise officially some churches (Catholic Church, Swiss Reformed Church, Old Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> Jewish congregations). Other cantons, such as Geneva and Neuchâtel are laïques (that is to say, secular).|$|R

Still, they weigh the marginal gains from socializing their children against its costs. <b>Churches</b> <b>and</b> <b>states</b> may stigmatize sex, both because of a concern about the welfare of their ‡ocks and the need to control the cost of charity associated with out-of-wedlock births.

5|$|Historians {{debate the}} extent to which Geneva was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's {{theology}} clearly called for separation between <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state.</b> Other historians have stressed the enormous political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} of <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, {{where he stands}} with a Bible {{in one hand and}} a sword in the other. For him, the <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E
5|$|After {{going without}} a rabbi {{for another two}} years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately {{advocated}} liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and separation of <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> and opposed prohibition, antisemitism, and Tammany Hall. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. He also supported California's compulsory sterilization {{of the mentally ill}} and mentally retarded, and eugenicist E. S. Gosney's advocacy on this issue.|$|E

5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} Jerusalem and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only Jerusalem and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration of <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> and benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> <b>State,</b> a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> {{maintained}} close {{relations in}} the Anglo-Saxon period, both socially and politically.

Watkins. He joined in Engel v. Vitale, which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools. In , similarly, he voted to strike down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.|$|E
5|$|King Stefan the First-Crowned, who {{had become}} ill, took monastic vows and died in 1227. Radoslav, the eldest son, became king; he was crowned at Žiča by his uncle, Archbishop Sava.

He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, the first surviving full Scottish play, which satirised the corruption of <b>church</b> <b>and</b> <b>state,</b> making use of elements such as medieval morality plays, with a humanist agenda.|$|E
