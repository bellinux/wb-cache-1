40|$|Dynamic {{phenomena}} such as transient and steady-state resonant vibrations in vertical {{transportation systems}} {{deployed in the}} modern built environment and underground mining applications affect {{the performance of the}} entire installation. In extreme high rise structures and deep underground mines traction drive elevator systems and drum-driven <b>lifting</b> <b>installations</b> employ long ropes and cables that exhibit low-frequency modes and nonlinear modal interactions. This results in the need to develop mathematical models in order to simulate their dynamic behaviour to predict and control their non-linear stationary and non-stationary dynamic responses; the coupled vibrations of a car/ conveyance and counterweight; as well as motions of other components present in the system, such as compensating sheave assemblies and diverter pulleys. The underlying causes of these dynamic responses / vibrations are varied. They include low frequency sway motions of the host structure induced by high winds and seismic activities, poorly aligned guide rail joints and guide rail imperfections, eccentric / out-of-balance pulleys and sheaves, systematic resonance in the electronic drive control system, motor torque ripple and aerodynamic effects that occur in the hoistway. Consequently, conditions for external, parametric and autoparametric resonances can readily arise during the operation of such installations. In this context, this paper will demonstrate a general approach to model the dynamic behaviour of typical vertical transportation and <b>lifting</b> <b>installations.</b> Subsequently, dynamic models and simulation techniques for the prediction of their non-stationary / nonlinear dynamic responses are discussed and the effectiveness of these techniques are demonstrated. Then, suitable strategies can be proposed to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses of the system so that the installation can operate under these conditions safely...|$|R

30|$|Over-, and under-design of {{artificial}} <b>lift</b> <b>installations</b> {{happens in the}} industry very often and professionals {{know how to deal}} with them. Some lifting methods such as gas lifting or sucker rod pumping are relatively easy to handle since their lifting capacity can be adjusted in quite broad ranges after installation. ESP installations, however, do not tolerate design inaccuracies because any given ESP pump can only be used in a specific, quite restricted range of pumping rates. If used outside its recommended liquid rate range, the hydraulic efficiency of the pump rapidly deteriorates; efficiencies can go down to almost zero. In addition to the loss of energy and the consequent decrease in profitability the ESP system, when operated under such conditions, soon develops mechanical problems that can lead to a complete system failure. The usual outcome is a workover job and the necessity of running a newly designed ESP system with the proper lifting capacity.|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} effects that occur when a high-speed lift travels through the hoistway involve {{a range of}} diverse phenomena that lead to excessive vibrations of the sling-car assembly and noise inside the hoistway and the car. Noise and vibration may then be transmitted to the building structure. Thus, a good understanding and prediction of aerodynamic phenomena occurring in high-speed <b>lift</b> <b>installations</b> is essential to design a system which satisfies ever more demanding ride quality criteria. This paper discusses the fluid-structure interactions taking place in high-rise applications and {{presents the results of}} a study to develop a computational model to predict the aerodynamic interactions in high-speed lift systems using Multibody Dynamics (MBD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques.

40|$|The {{performance}} of lift (elevator) systems {{deployed in the}} modern tall built environment can be substantially affected by adverse environmental conditions suchs as seismic (earthquake) activities (as well as strong winds). The building motion (sway) which is induced by those environmental conditions excites the lift system elastic components such as suspension / compensating ropes, belts and cables. A complex dynamic situation arises when the building is excited near its natural frequency which in turn approaches the natural frequency of the ropes. In this scenario resonances interactions phenomena take place. These phenomena severely affect lightly tensioned compensating ropes, as well as travelling cables, that sway at {{the frequency of the}} building displaying non-planar responses. Thus, the lift system designers have to take into consideration the critical characteristics of the building structure before the <b>lift</b> <b>installation</b> is constructed and installed. In this presentation the excitation mechanism is explianed and the dynamic analysis of responses of lift ropes is discussed. Suitable control strategies can then be developed and applied to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses arising in the building – lift system...|$|R

To increase oil production from existing wells in an oil field we have to focus much on optimizing oil production. One way to optimize oil production is to find an alternative to existing intermittent gas lift technology. As we study big oil field currently with huge oil and gas operating companies, the gas injection line network is very old and new intermittent gas <b>lift</b> <b>installations</b> on new wells has been connected to the existing network. Now this creates gas starving for the new installations and resulting in inadequate amount of gas production from the well. By introducing Plunger lift technology of artificial gas lift along with existing intermittent gas lift can provide a fool proof solution to the problem and also reduction in injected gas requirement also. Thus, reducing the compressor duty and overall reduction in environmental emission of harmful gases by reducing the diesel engine load required previously for compression.

40|$|Horizontal axis wind {{turbines}} {{have a number}} of limitations for offshore operations, particularly in deep water (i. e. over 50 m). For example, scalability restrictions, the necessity for high <b>lift</b> <b>installations</b> offshore requiring specialist vessels, high gravitational and aerodynamic moments on the support structure and a need to maintain rotary equipment at heights typically over 60 – 80 m. Conversely, vertical axis {{wind turbines}} have several inherent attributes that offer some advantages for offshore operations, particularly their scalability and low over-turning moments with better accessibility to drivetrain components. This paper describes the aerodynamic optimisation of a novel 10 MW vertical axis wind turbine rotor shape offering a low-stress design to minimise manufacturing and maintenance costs of the whole turbine assembly including the supporting structure and foundations. The Aerogenerator vertical axis wind turbine is self-supporting so does not require a supporting tower, giving a low centre of gravity and producing significantly lower aerodynamic over-turning moments than conventional vertical axis wind turbines or horizontal axis wind turbines, making it a credible option for a floating, deep water platform. A numerical optimisation procedure is described to minimise the Aerogenerator weight while imposing aerodynamic, mechanical and structural side constraints. The study proposes a novel ‘sycamore’-shaped rotor design that demonstrates a lower cost of energy compared with conventional offshore turbines...|$|R

In these systems long slender continua (LSC) such as steel wire ropes and composite belts play pivotal roles as suspension means and weight-compensation members.

40|$|The {{demand for}} oil and gas, {{as well as the}} {{proceeding}} into new harsh areas in the north for exploring and producing oil and gas keep pushing the boundaries of offshore engineering into ever-deeper waters and harsher environments. The exploration and production activities require correct modelling of the offshore platforms to tolerate these challenges. This requires accurate modelling of offshore modules throughout all phases. This thesis will focus on modelling of an offshore module. A previous Master’s thesis in UiS, (Desta, 2012) has already considered loads for designing of an offshore module placed on a platform but neglected transportation, <b>lifting</b> and <b>installation</b> loads. The effects of these loads are significant on the Norwegian Shelf and they will be discussed in the present study. Available literature is reviewed and the modelling is performed by applying the software SAP 2000. The modelling will be limited to modelling of a module on a fixed steel platform. The main focus of the thesis is to stress the many important considerations and conditions during the loadout, transportation, <b>lifting</b> and <b>installation</b> phases. During transportation, the motions of the transport barge is of key concern. During the lifting/ installation phase, the moments of the module caused by the lift arrangement, dynamics as well as possible impact forces must be considered. Moreover, the relative motion between the barge and the crane is of primary importance. These load conditions are evaluated and optimum dimensions are computed. These dimensions are compared to the results given in the Master thesis prepared by Desta (2012) to validate weather the dimensions evaluated by Desta (2012) are within acceptable limits for loadout, transportation, <b>lifting</b> and <b>installation</b> procedures. This thesis work is performed at the University of Stavanger. In the thesis work, we have in initially selected material properties and cross section geometries for the module from Desta, (2012). The report presents an introduction to the selection of design factors in the different operational phases and presents a comparison of these factors as given in NORSOK, ISO and DNV-GL standards. Structural analysis are carried out for the transportation, <b>lifting</b> and <b>installation</b> phases to check the load capacity of the module and to see if the structure can withstand the different effects during these phases. The design principles and methods will be discussed extensively. Subjective risk analysis of load-out, transportation and lifting/installation has also been performed and suitable risk reducing measures are proposed. At the end, the discussions and the main findings, challenges and recommendations based on the modelling results and experiences during the thesis work are highlighted. Recommendations on how to obtain an efficient design process backed by risk assessment are also presented. It {{should be noted that the}} words ‘action’ and ‘load’ are used interchangeably in this report...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{activities}} in ice-covered waters are gaining increased attention nowadays. Such operations as crew change, <b>lifting,</b> <b>installation,</b> drilling, etc. may require keeping the vessel {{on a fixed}} location during long time periods. The use of dynamic positioning systems appears therefore to be an attractive solution, being much more flexible than mooring operations. However, the ice environment is significantly different from open water conditions. As known from several full-scale experiments, systems developed for open water purpose do not answer all ice challenges. Nevertheless, recent R&D projects have demonstrated the feasibility of DP in ice. During the DYPIC project, a European collaborative program, large amount of ice model basin tests have been performed at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin. Those tests have not only spotlighted stationkeeping possibilities under certain challenging conditions, but have also brought out several important aspects of ice forces on the hull. In this paper, the DYPIC outcomes are used to build an automatic heading control system for a DP vessel {{in order to improve}} its stationkeeping abilities in ice. The system with automatic heading is then compared in a numerical simulation framework to a system with fixed heading. The results show that in selected scenarios the DP system with automatic heading control outperforms clearly the one with fixed heading control. Specifically, the ice loads and the power consumption are reduced considerably. 1...|$|R

This paper discusses mathematical models to predict transient and steady-state resonant vibrations taking place in deep mine and high-rise applications. In these systems long slender continua (LSC) such as steel wire ropes and composite belts play pivotal roles as suspension means and weight-compensation members. The natural frequencies of these systems are slowly varying, rendering them non-stationary. The nonlinear dynamic interactions involve exchanges of energy between various modes of vibration.

The models are represented by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations defined in a slowly time-variant space domain. The nature of loads acting upon the lifting systems is often nondeterministic (stochastic) so that the methods of stochastic dynamics need to be employed to predict the dynamic behaviour of the system. The results and conclusions presented in this paper demonstrate that a good understanding and prediction of the dynamic behaviour of vertical transportation systems are essential for developing vibration suppression and control strategies to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses so that the installation will operate without compromising the structural integrity and safety standards...|$|R
40|$|Field {{testing of}} various {{artificial}} lift methods {{to determine their}} applicability can be costly. To alleviate these costs, {{it is necessary to}} develop a simple method to predict plunger lift applicability in advance of the installation under particular well operational conditions. In this work a simple-to-use approach has been developed to provide an accurate way to determine the applicability of plunger lift for wells. This method examines the feasibility of plunger lift for different tubing size, as a function of operating pressure and the well depth. The method is useful to obtain the minimum produced gas liquid ratio (GLR) required to support plunger <b>lift</b> <b>installation</b> in a well. If the well 2 ̆ 7 s measured producing GLR is {{greater than or equal to}} that given by this method, then plunger lift will likely work for the well.

In particular, petroleum and production engineers would find the proposed method to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions...|$|R

To pursue better living conditions, the role of building management is no longer just focused on providing a hygienic and safety living or working place, but is also required to create a sustainable environment. Thus, building management has to adopt various green measures to improve the sustainability of their buildings. In Hong Kong, industrial buildings being part of the building sector with high energy consumption and waste generation, which increased its potential to implement green measures. Therefore, nowadays management of industrial buildings are more willing to implement various kinds of green measures in their buildings. In order to affirm the effectiveness of those measures, this study will focus on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of green measures in Hong Kong's industrial buildings and will try to identify the cost-effective green measures that could be applied in industrial buildings. In this research, it would study on energy efficiency measures related to lighting, air-conditioning and <b>lifts</b> <b>installations,</b> as well as waste recycling measures. A case study of a sample building would illustrate the effectiveness of green measures in real situation. The concept of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness will be used to analyze the performance of green measures. Furthermore, the concept of payback period will be adopted in determining the cost-effectiveness of a green measures. Also, an interview will be carried out to understand the difficulties of implementing green measures in industrial buildings. The results of this study showed that waste recycle is the most cost-effective scheme in industrial buildings. Also, when comparing the cost-effectiveness of various energy efficiency measures, replacement of lighting is more cost-effective than the others, even though the type of lighting being replaced involved a higher cost. Apart from that, the energy saving system for <b>lift</b> <b>installations</b> has a highest energy saving performance when compared to those measures of lighting and air conditioning. Also, the findings showed that the factors of disturbance on operations, insufficient quantifiable benefits, high investment cost, long payback period and lack of support from senior management and government are the key barriers impeded the implementation of green measures in industrial buildings. Besides, incorporation of organization objectives with green measure performance and increase linkage of monetary benefits with the performance of green measure could help to improve the accomplishment of green measures. The findings of this study would serve the purpose to remind the building management of industrial buildings the environmental impacts that generated from their buildings and suggested means for them to contribute their efforts in environmental protection. By showing the performance and evaluating different kinds of green measures with a real case, this research had sorted out the cost-effective scheme and provided some actual statistics and information to building management of industrial buildings for their decision making. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
