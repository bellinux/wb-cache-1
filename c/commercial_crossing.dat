5|$|Water-borne {{trade has}} been practiced {{since at least}} the dawn of civilization, when Sumeria was {{connected}} to Harappan India. Around 2000 BC, the Minoans of Crete established the earliest thalassocracy, a maritime empire heavily dependent upon its trade and naval power. The city-states of the Phoenicians and Greeks then replaced them in the centuries after 1200 BC, ultimately establishing far-flung colonial empires which spread from the Sea of Azov to the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Under the Romans, commerce continued to thrive. In the first centuries BC, steppe nomads' interruption of India's access to Siberian gold caused them to open up maritime routes to Malaysia and Indonesia, exposing them first to Hindu and then Muslim traders. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish elsewhere. The Tamil Chola dynasty thrived on trade between Tang China, the Javanese Srivijaya Empire, and the Abbasid Caliphate in the west. Following further conquests, Arabians came to dominate maritime trade in the Indian Ocean, spreading Islam along the East African coast and, eventually, Southeast Asia. A major effect of the Age of Discovery was the unification of the world's regional trade networks into a single world market, largely run by and for the European monarchs and the merchants of Amsterdam, London, and other Atlantic ports. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13 million people were shipped across the Atlantic to be sold as slaves in the Americas. The Hales Trophy was an award for the fastest <b>commercial</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Atlantic and was won by the SS United States in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours, and forty minutes.|$|E

5000|$|The Agreed Principles for Rafah {{stipulate}} that [...] "Rafah {{will also be}} used for export of goods to Egypt". A confidential PLO document reveals that in fact Egypt under President Mubarak did not allow exports. The Palestinians agreed that all imports of goods are diverted to the Kerem Shalom border crossing, because Israel threatened to exclude Gaza from the customs union out of concern about the implementation of the Paris Protocol. On the other hand, the Palestinians agreed because they wanted to limit Israeli interference at Rafah and maximize their sovereignty. Diversion via Kerem was meant as a temporary measure but in fact, imports through Rafah were never realized, forcing the Palestinians to develop a smuggling tunnels economy. Israel had consistently tried to turn the Kerem Shalom border crossing (which borders Egypt) into a <b>commercial</b> <b>crossing</b> between Gaza and Israel, or as an alternative passenger crossing to Rafah. The Palestinians were concerned that Israel would take control over the Gaza-Egypt border or even replace Rafah and objected.|$|E
50|$|Imperatriz is {{the largest}} <b>commercial</b> <b>crossing</b> point, energy and {{economic}} center of Maranhão and the second largest populational, economical, political and cultural center {{in the state and}} has a strategic position not only useful to the state but also for the whole north of Brazil. Imperatriz is a cross between the production of soy of Balsas, in southern Maranhão, timber extraction on the border with Pará state, with steel produced and processed in Açailândia in and family farming {{in the rest of the}} state, with emphasis on rice production as well as future potential of power generation and pulp with the implementation of hydroelectric of Estreito, hydroelectric of Serra Quebrada and the Suzano Pulp and Paper factory. Besides these capabilities, the city is a center for mining, mainly in the reserve of Ciriaco, a neighboring region. To provide logistical support to all these activities, Imperatriz is a local wholesale and retail center for goods from the south of Maranhao, north of Tocantins, and east of Pará. For transportation, Imperatriz has the Belém-Brasília highway, the Tocantins River and the North-South and the Carajás Railroads. In addition, the main lines of electricity transmission for Maranhao and other states pass near the city.|$|E

40|$|Effect of some {{factors on}} the yield and culinary quality of roasted and grilled lamb meat The effects of {{selected}} animal production factors on the yield of cuts and saleable meat {{and on the}} culinary pa-rameters of roasted and grilled meat were investigated. Half-carcasses of 32 lambs, fattened intensively to 30 - 35 kg body weight, were studied. The experimental factors were: a) feeding – standard mixture (group C) or stan-dard mixture with 10 % rapeseed and linseed at a 2 : 1 ratio (RL), b) breed group – Merino (M) and Ile de France × (F 1 Friesian × Polish Merino) ewes (If×FM) and c) sex of lambs.

40|$|The goose {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient of domesticated birds now bred commercially. Whereas the {{greatest}} concentration of the world's geese is to be found in Asia, there is considerable breed diversity in Europe. Geese enterprises are most successful with highly productive breeds well adapted to local conditions. Economically useful traits, such as body weight, liveability, egg production, hatchability, feather formation and ability to be fed for the production of fat livers, need to be more clearly identified. Knowledge of the genetic differences between and within breeds in reproductive or production traits and of the heritability values of these traits are essential if the artificial selection of geese is to be successful. In the <b>commercial</b> <b>crossing</b> of breeds it is customary and preferable to use dam and male strains selected for reproductive and meat traits, respectively. Implementing modern DNA techniques would facilitate the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and the introduction of marker-assisted selection. Progress with and results from other avian species would help to compensate for the current lack of specific markers and other molecular tools in geese. An important feature of geese is their ability to consume green forages and other cheap components of crops and to maintain productivity on diets with low protein contents; they are also frequently able to make effective use of novel local feed resources. Geese are at present usually raised on deep litter, on free range, in cages or on slats, using short days, diminishing light intensity or fluorescent light, and over one or two cycles of lay. To improve the efficiency of production of geese their biological and economic features need to be more actively studied. There is an urgent need to integrate genetic, nutritional, reproductive and management information and approaches so that present production systems can be adjusted and the genetic potential of geese more fully realised...|$|E
