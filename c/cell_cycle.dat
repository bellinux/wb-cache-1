5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new <b>cell</b> <b>cycle.</b> ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E
5|$|After DNA damage, <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> {{and gives}} the cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E
5|$|DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway that blocks <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down {{the rate of}} S phase progression when DNA is damaged. It leads to a pause in <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> allowing the cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide.|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} fade of Sony 18650 Li-ion cells {{increases with}} increase in temperature. After 800 <b>cycles,</b> the <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at RT and 45 8 C showed a capacity fade of 30 and 36 %, respectively. The <b>cell</b> <b>cycled</b> at 55 8 C showed a capacity loss of about 70 % after 490 cycles. The rate {{capability of the}} cells continues to decrease with cycling. Impedance measurements showed an overall increase in the cell resistance with cycling and temperature. Impedance studies of the electrode materials showed an increased positive electrode resistance when {{compared to that of}} the negative electrode for <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at RT and 45 8 C. However, <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at 50 and 55 8 C exhibit higher negative electrode resistance. The increased capacity fade for the <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at high temperatures can be explained by taking into account the repeated film formation over the surface of anode, which results in increased rate of lithium loss and also in a drastic increase in the negative electrode resistance with cycling...|$|R
40|$|ZSCAN 4 is a DNA-binding {{protein that}} {{functions}} for telomere elongation and genomic stability. In vivo, it is specifically expressed at the two-cell stage during mouse development. In vitro, it is transiently expressed in mouse {{embryonic stem cells}} (ESCs), only in 5 % of the population at one time. Here we attempted to elucidate when, under what circumstances, Zscan 4 is activated in ESCs. Using live cell imaging, we monitored the activity of Zscan 4 together with the pluripotency marker Rex 1. The lengths of the <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> in ESCs were diverse. Longer <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> were accompanied by shorter telomeres and higher activation of Zscan 4. Since activation of Zscan 4 is involved in telomere elongation, we speculate that the extended <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> accompanied by Zscan 4 activation reflect the time for telomere recovery. Rex 1 and Zscan 4 did not show any correlation. Taken together, we propose that Zscan 4 is activated to recover shortened telomeres during extended <b>cell</b> <b>cycles,</b> irrespective of the pluripotent status...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the aging behavior of lithium ion batteries in automotive and energy storage applications {{is essential for the}} acceptance of the technology. Therefore, aging experiments were conducted on commercial 18650 -type state-of-the-art cells to determine the influence of the temperature during electrochemical cycling on the aging behavior of the different cell components. The cells, based on Li(Ni 0. 5 Co 0. 2 Mn 0. 3) O 2 (NCM 532) /graphite, were aged at 20 °C and 45 °C to different states of health. The electrochemical performance of the investigated cells shows remarkable differences depending on the cycling temperature. At contrast to the expected behavior, the <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at 45 °C show a better electrochemical performance over lifetime than the <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at 20 °C. Comprehensive post-mortem analyses revealed the main aging mechanisms, showing a complex interaction between electrodes and electrolyte. The main aging mechanisms of the <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at 45 °C differ strongly at contrast to <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> at 20 °C. A strong correlation between the formed SEI, the electrolyte composition and the electrochemical performance over lifetime was observed...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} downstream {{target of}} ATM and ATR is p53, {{as it is}} required for inducing apoptosis following DNA damage. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle,</b> beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle,</b> the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E

The capacity loss and power fade of the <b>cells</b> <b>cycled</b> over 100 percent DOD was significantly faster than the <b>cell</b> <b>cycled</b> over 70 percent DOD. The overall cell impedance increased with cycling, although the ohmic resistance from the electrolyte was almost constant.

40|$|International audienceRobust {{mechanisms}} to control cell proliferation {{have evolved to}} maintain the integrity of organ architecture. Here, we investigated how two critical proliferative pathways, Myc and E 2 f, are integrated to control <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> in normal and Rb-deficient cells using a murine intestinal model. We show that Myc and E 2 f 1 – 3 have little impact on normal G 1 –S transitions. Instead, they synergistically control an S–G 2 transcriptional program required for normal cell divisions and maintaining crypt–villus integrity. Surprisingly, Rb deficiency results in the Myc-dependent accumulation of E 2 f 3 protein and chromatin repositioning of both Myc and E 2 f 3, leading to the ‘super activation’ of a G 1 –S transcriptional program, ectopic S phase entry and rampant cell proliferation. These findings reveal that Rb-deficient cells hijack and redeploy Myc and E 2 f 3 from an S–G 2 program essential for normal <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> to a G 1 –S program that re-engages ectopic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles,</b> exposing an unanticipated addiction of Rb-null cells on Myc...|$|R

40|$|Development of a fertilized {{human egg}} into an average sized adult {{requires}} about 29 trillion cell divisions, thereby producing enough DNA to stretch to the Sun and back 200 times (DePamphilis and Bell, 2011) ! Even more amazing {{is the fact that}} throughout these mitotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles,</b> the human genome is duplicated once and only once each time a cell divides. If a cell accidentally begins to re-replicate its nuclear DNA prior to cell division, checkpoint pathways trigger apoptosis. And yet, some cells are developmentally programmed to respond to environmental cues by switching from mitotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> to endocycles, a process in which multiple S phases occur in the absence of either mitosis or cytokinesis. Endocycles allow production of viable, differentiated, polyploid cells that no longer proliferate. What is surprising is that among the 516 (Manning et al., 2002) to 557 (BioMart web site) protein kinases encoded by the human genome, only eight regulate nuclear DNA replication directly. These are Cdk 1, Cdk 2, Cdk 4, Cdk 6, Cdk 7, Cdc 7, Chk 1 and Chk 2. Even more remarkable is the fact that only four of these enzymes (Cdk 1, Cdk 7, Cdc 7 and Chk 1) are essential for mammalian development. Here we describe how these protein kinases determine when DNA replication occurs during mitotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles,</b> how mammalian <b>cells</b> switch from mitotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> to endocycles, and how cancer cells can be selectively targeted for destruction by inducing them to begin a second S phase before mitosis is complete...|$|R

In externally deposited eggs from representatives of all the major phyla, gastrulation is preceded by specialized extremely rapid cleavage <b>cell</b> <b>cycles.</b> Mammals also exhibit remarkably fast <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> in close association with gastrulation, but instead of beginning development with these rapid cycles, the mammalian egg first devotes itself to th...|$|R

5|$|The proteasomal {{degradation}} pathway {{is essential}} for many cellular processes, including the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle,</b> the regulation of gene expression, and responses to oxidative stress.

5|$|Earlier <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 {{phase and}} S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
40|$|Early {{embryonic}} <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> in Drosophila {{consist of}} rapidly alternating S and M phases. Three genes, pan gu (png), plutonium (plu), and giant nuclei (gnu) coordinate these early S-M cycles by ensuring adequate Cyclin B protein levels. Mutations {{in any of}} these genes result in unregulated DNA replication and a lack of mitosis (“giant nuclei” phenotype). png encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, and plu and gnu encode small, novel proteins. We show that PNG, PLU, and GNU constitute a novel protein kinase complex that specifically regulates S-M <b>cell</b> <b>cycles.</b> All three proteins are required for PNG kinase activity and are phosphorylated by PNG in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed a direct interaction between PNG and PLU, and their co-expression is required for physical association and activation of PNG kinase. Artificial dimerization of PLU via fusion to either GST or FK 506 binding protein (in the presence of dimerizing agent) abrogates the requirement for GNU to activate PNG kinase. We propose a model in which GNU normally regulates embryonic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> by promoting transient dimerization of a core PNG/PLU complex, thereby stimulating PNG kinase activity...|$|R
40|$|In Xenopus oocytes, the c-mos {{proto-oncogene}} {{product has}} been proposed to act downstream of progesterone to control the entry into meiosis I, the transition from meiosis I to meiosis II, which {{is characterized by the}} absence of S phase, and the metaphase II arrest seen prior to fertilization. Here, we report that inhibition of Mos synthesis by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides does not prevent the progesterone-induced initiation of Xenopus oocyte meiotic maturation, as previously thought.

40|$|AbstractFemale {{sea urchins}} store their gametes as haploid eggs. The zygote enters S-phase 1 h after fertilization, {{initiating}} {{a series of}} <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> that lack gap phases. We have cloned cyclin E from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Cyclin E is synthesized during oogenesis, {{is present in the}} germinal vesicle, and is released into the egg cytoplasm at oocyte maturation. Cyclin E synthesis is activated at fertilization, although there is no increase in cyclin E protein levels due to continuous turnover of the protein. Cyclin E protein levels decline in morula embryos, while cyclin E mRNA levels remain high. After the blastula stage, cyclin E mRNA and protein levels are very low, and cyclin E expression is predominant only in cells that are actively dividing. These include cells in the left coelomic pouch, which forms the adult rudiment in the embryo. The cyclin E present in the egg is complexed with a protein kinase. Activity of the cyclin E/cdk 2 changes little during the initial <b>cell</b> <b>cycles.</b> In particular, cyclin E-cdk 2 levels remain high during both S-phase and mitosis. Our results suggest that progression through the early embryonic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> in the sea urchin does not require fluctuations in cyclin E kinase activity...|$|R
5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle.</b> For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the <b>cell</b> <b>cycle.</b> When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the time course of}} protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the meiotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> of Xenopus laevis oocytes and the mitotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> of Xenopus eggs. We have identified two proteins that undergo marked changes in tyrosine phosphorylation during these processes: a 42 -kDa protein related to mitogen-activated protein kinase or microtubule-associated protein- 2 kinase (MAP kinase) and a 34 -kDa protein identical or related to p 34 cdc 2. p 42 undergoes an abrupt increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation at the onset of meiosis 1 and remains tyrosine phosphorylated until 30 min after fertilization, at which point it is dephosphorylated. p 42 also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after microinjection of oocytes with partially purified M-phase-promoting factor, even in the presence of cycloheximide. These findings suggest that MAP kinase, previously implicated in the early responses of somatic cells to mitogens, is also activated at the onset of meiotic M phase and that MAP kinase can become tyrosine phosphorylated downstream from M-phase-promoting factor activation. We have also found that p 34 goes through a cycle of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation prior to meiosis 1 and mitosis 1 but is not detectable as a phosphotyrosyl protein during the 2 nd through 12 th mitotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles.</b> It may be that the delay between assembly and activation of the cyclin-p 34 cdc 2 complex that p 34 cdc 2 tyrosine phosphorylation provides is not needed in <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> that lack G 2 phases. Finally, an unidentified protein or group of proteins migrating at 100 to 116 kDa increase in tyrosine phosphorylation throughout maturation, are dephosphorylated or degraded within 10 min of fertilization, and appear to cycle between low-molecular-weight forms and high-molecular-weight forms during early embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe Drosophila PAN GU (PNG) kinase complex regulates the {{developmental}} translation of cyclin B. cyclin B mRNA becomes unmasked during oogenesis independent of PNG activity, but PNG {{is required for}} translation from egg activation. We find that although polyadenylation of cyclin B augments translation, it is not essential, and a fully elongated poly(A) is not required for translation to proceed. In fact, changes in poly(A) tail length are not sufficient to account for PNG-mediated control of cyclin B translation and of the early embryonic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles.</b> We present evidence that PNG functions instead as an antagonist of PUMILIO-dependent translational repression. Our data argue that changes in poly(A) tail length are not a universal mechanism governing embryonic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles,</b> and that PNG-mediated derepression of translation is an important alternative mechanism in Drosophila...|$|R
