40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} apart from insulin resistance, {{type 2 diabetes}} is also characterized by dysfunction of insulin secretion by the endocrine pancreas. Insulin secretion failure could be explained, at least in part, by the progressive β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis which leads the transition from glucose intolerance to over diabetes. <b>Chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia,</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperlipidemia,</b> oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines, disrupt and/or attenuate signal transduction pathways that promote normal β-cell turnover and survival, leading {{to the destruction of}} endocrine pancreas in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Initiatory β-cell dysfunction mechanisms include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, dysregulation of TG/FFA cycling and gluco-lipo-toxicity. Hyperglycemia, once established, promotes a further series of mechanisms such as inflammation, O-glycosylation and amyloid deposition, that under the umbrella of glucotoxicity, lead to severe phenotypical β-cell alterations and to β-cell mass reduction through apoptosis. Even though hyperglycemia is not the “primum movens” for β-cell dysfunction, it catalyzes, however, the transition from glucose intolerance to over type 2 diabetes through mechanisms collectively referred to as glucotoxicity. Activation of insulin signalling in pancreatic β-cells promotes proliferation, differentiation and survival and has been implicated in protection from apoptosis induced by several stimuli. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of high glucose on the proximal events of insulin signalling in association with endogenous cytokine expression and β-cell survival in the mouse βTC- 6 pancreatic β-cell line. Western blot analysis revealed that prolonged exposure of βTC- 6 cells to increased glucose concentrations resulted in significant inhibition of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, and insulin receptor substrate- 2 (IRS- 2) as well as PI 3 -kinase activation. These changes were accompanied by annulment of Akt-mediated suppression of FOXO activation. The observed glucose-induced downregulation of insulin signalling also affected the protein synthesis branch of the pathway by abolishing insulin-induced mTOR activation and inhibition of insulin-induced downregulation of 4 E-BP 1. Suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) were reported to be induced by several cytokines and inhibit insulininitiated signal transduction in insulin-sensitive tissues. We showed that attenuation of IRS- 2 /Akt-mediated signalling was associated with increased IL- 1 β and SOCS- 1 expression, as assessed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis. The observed up-regulation of endogenous cytokine signalling and FOXO activation, were accompanied by enhanced caspase- 3 activation and increased susceptibility of βTC- 6 cells to apoptosis, as determined by TUNELFACS analysis. According to the obtained results, we propose a mechanism through which the observed glucose-induced endogenous IL- 1 β expression leads to increased βTC- 6 cell apoptosis by inhibiting IRS- 2 /Akt-mediated signaling, through SOCS- 1 up-regulation. These results, also suggest that impairment of the insulin survival pathway should contribute to β-cell apoptosis and to the onset of, or to the progression, to type 2 diabetes. ...|$|E

In this study we examined if ROS production in Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL 60) differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (dHL 60) induces ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). To cause ROS production cells were treated with PMA or by <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia.</b> <b>Chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> failed to induce ROS production and did not cause activation of the UPR in dHL 60 cells. PMA, a pharmacologic NADPH oxidase activator, induced ER stress in dHL 60 cells as monitored by IRE- 1 and PERK pathway activation, and this was independent of calcium signaling. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI, abolished both ROS production and UPR activation.

40|$|Aldehyde {{dehydrogenase}} (ALDH) 2 is a mitochondrial isozyme of {{the heart}} involved in the metabolism of toxic aldehydes produced from oxidative stress. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia-mediated decrease in ALDH 2 activity may impair mitochondrial respiration and ultimately result in cardiac damage. A single dose (65 mg/kg; i. p.) streptozotocin injection to rats resulted in hyperglycemia with blood glucose levels of 443 ± 9 mg/dl versus 121 ± 7 mg/dl in control animals, p< 0. 0001, N = 7 - 11. After 6 months of diabetes mellitus (DM) induction, the rats were sacrificed after recording the functionality of their hearts. Increase in the cardiomyocyte cross sectional area (446 ± 32 μm 2 Vs 221 ± 10 μm 2; p< 0. 0001) indicated cardiac hypertrophy in DM rats. Both diastolic and systolic dysfunctions were observed with DM rats compared to controls. Most importantly, myocardial ALDH 2 activity and levels were reduced, and immunostaining for 4 HNE protein adducts was increased in DM hearts compared to controls. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an index of mitochondrial respiration, was decreased in mitochondria isolated from DM hearts compared to controls (p< 0. 0001). Furthermore, the rate of mitochondrial respiration {{and the increase in}} carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) -induced maximal respiration were also decreased with <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia.</b> <b>Chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> reduced mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins. Reduced ALDH 2 activity was correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, pathological remodeling and cardiac dysfunction, respectively.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine if <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> would impair metabolic switching of myotubes. Human myotubes were treated with or without <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> (20 mmol/l glucose for 4 days), and metabolism of [C]oleic acid (OA) and [C]glucose was studied. Myotubes exposed to <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> showed a significantly reduced OA uptake and oxidation to CO, whereas acid-soluble metabolites were increased compared to normoglycemic cells (5. 5 mmol/l glucose). Glucose suppressibility, the ability of acute glucose (5 mmol/l) to suppress lipid oxidation, was 50 % in normoglycemic cells and reduced to 21 % by hyperglycemia. Adaptability, the capacity to increase lipid oxidation with increasing fatty acid availability, was not affected by hyperglycemia. Glucose uptake and oxidation were reduced by about 40 % after hyperglycemia, and oxidation of glucose in presence of mitochondrial uncouplers showed that net and maximal oxidative capacities were significantly reduced. Hyperglycemia also abolished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, ATP concentration was reduced by 25 % after hyperglycemia. However, none of the measured mitochondrial genes were downregulated nor was mitochondrial DNA content. Microarray and real-time RT-PCR showed that no genes were significantly regulated by <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia.</b> Addition of <b>chronic</b> lactate reduced both glucose and OA oxidation to the same extent as <b>hyperglycemia.</b> In conclusions, <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> reduced substrate oxidation in skeletal muscle cells and impaired metabolic switching.

Accumulating evidence shows that beta-cell UCP 2 expression is upregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions and that increased activity of UCP 2 decreases insulin secretion. Mitochondrial superoxide has been identified as a posttranslational regulator of UCP 2 activity in islets; thus, UCP 2 may provide protection to beta-cells at one level while simultaneously having detrimental effects on insulin secretion.

AIM: We assessed the association between <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia,</b> measured by hemoglobin A 1 c, and functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We included 812 patients with acute ischemic stroke (mean age 66 [*]±[*] 14 years; 61. 5 % male). Patients were categorized per hemoglobin A 1 c level: no (42 [*]mmol/mol). Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score[*]>[*] 2 after 3 months. The relation between <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> and functional outcome was assessed with a Poisson regression analysis and expressed as risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals with no <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> as the reference. RESULTS: Moderate <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> was present in 234 (28. 8 %) patients and severe <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> in 183 (22. 5 %) patients. Acute hyperglycemia on admission was present in 338 (41. 6 %) patients. Severe <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> was associated with poor outcome (risk ratios 1. 40; 95 % confidence interval 1. 09 - 1. 79).

40|$|Background: Blood {{glucose level}} {{continuously}} fluctuates {{within a certain}} range in the human body.

Blood glucose fluctuation {{has been shown to}} mediate more adverse effects on vascular endothelial cells and diabetes complications than <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia,</b> which has been explained as due to oxidative stress. As few previous studies have reported the effects of <b>chronic</b> and intermittent <b>hyperglycemia</b> on the apoptosis and function of pancreatic beta cells, this study reported herein was performed to investigate such effects on these cells. Methods: For <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia,</b> INS- 1 cells were cultured for 5 days with changes of RPMI 1640 medium containing 33 mM glucose every 12 hours. For intermittent hyperglycemia, the medium containing 11 mM glucose was exchanged with the medium containing 33 mM glucose every 12 hours. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay Hoechst staining and cleaved caspase 3. Insulin secretory capacity was assessed, and the expression of Mn-SOD and Bcl- 2 was measured by Western blotting. Results: In comparison to the control group, INS- 1 cells exposed to <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> and intermittent hyperglycemia showed an increase in apoptosis. The apoptosis of INS- 1 cells exposed to intermittent hyperglycemia increased significantly more than the apoptosis of INS- 1 cells exposed to <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia.</b> In comparison to the control group, the insulin secretory capacity in the two hyperglycemic states was decreased, and more with intermittent <b>hyperglycemia</b> than with <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia.</b> The expression of Mn-SOD and Bcl- 2 increased more with <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> than with intermittent hyperglycemia...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> cause a diffuse {{decrease}} in regional cerebral blood flow and that <b>chronic</b> <b>hyperglycemia</b> decreases the brain L-glucose space.

To investigate the mechanism of the impaired ATP formation, we {{examined the effects of}} elevated glucose and fatty acids levels on ATP synthase beta-subunit expression, ATP content and insulin secretion in INS- 1 insulinoma beta-cells. ATP synthase beta-subunit expression was measured by western blot, ATP content was monitored by ATP luminescence and insulin secretion detected by radio immunoassay. Our result indicated that chronic exposure to high doses of fatty acids together with high levels glucose produced a marked decrease in ATP synthase beta-subunit protein expression. Reduction of ATP synthase beta-subunit protein expression occurred with a decreased intracellular ATP concentration and insulin secretion at high fatty acid concentrations. These results indicate that high glucose together with fatty acids impair the production of ATP in beta-cells through the suppression of mitochondrial ATP synthesis.
