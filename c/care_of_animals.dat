500|$|As of 2010, the Conservancy was {{undertaking}} several {{programs to}} help breeders and the public understand the need for {{and the way to}} preserve heritage breeds. As the number of expert livestock breeders continues to dwindle, the Master Breeders' Apprentice Program aims to supplement their number by educating competent and interested members of the public. Through the Breed Rescue and Conservation Acquisition Program, the organization works with breeders and breed registries to begin and sustain conservation programs for rare livestock breeds. The Southeastern Livestock Breed Initiative aims to expand and reintroduce rare breeds from the American southeast, combining traditional breeds with low-impact farming (agriculture that has a lesser impact on the environment than high-intensity commercial farming) to assist in restarting the small, niche market farming that once existed in the area. [...] In 2014, the Conservancy published the book An Introduction to Heritage Breeds describing conserving and <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> under the purview of the organization, detailing each breed's specific needs and characteristics.|$|E
500|$|The {{period of}} the British Raj hastened the Marwari's downfall, as did the {{eventual}} independence of India. The British occupiers preferred other breeds, and tried to eliminate the Marwari, along with the Kathiawari. The British instead preferred Thoroughbreds and polo ponies, and reduced {{the reputation of the}} Marwari to the point where even the inward-turning ears of the breed were mocked as the [...] "mark of a native horse". During the 1930s the Marwari deteriorated, with breeding stock diminishing and becoming of poorer quality due to poor breeding practices. Indian independence, along with the obsolescence of warriors on horseback, led to a decreased need for the Marwari and many animals were subsequently killed. In the 1950s many Indian noblemen lost their land and hence much of their ability to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> resulting in many Marwari horses being sold as pack horses, castrated, or killed. The breed {{was on the verge of}} extinction until the intervention of Maharaja Umaid Singhji in the first half of the 20th century saved the Marwari. His work was carried on by his grandson, Maharaja Gaj SinghII.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Bradshaw's {{research}} {{led her to}} {{the conclusion}} that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) existed in free-ranging elephant survivors of severely traumatic events, including mass culls (systematic killing), poaching, translocation, and other human attacks. [...] Typically gentle and peaceful herbivores with complex social structures, tight-knit lifelong familial bonds, sophisticated cognitive capacities, and highly empathic responsiveness, traumatized elephants were displaying behavioral aberrations such as inter- and intra-species aggression, abnormal startle response, depression, and infant neglect. The unprecedented killing and assault of over 100 rhinoceroses by traumatized young bull elephants was documented in South Africa. [...] Bradshaw integrated psychobiological and ethological principles, specifically the understanding that maternal and community loss lead to pathogenic right hemispheric neurological development, which often results in hyperaggression and socioemotional dysfunction. She found that violent human interference was leading to the breakdown of elephant culture and society, which was the focus of a report by Charles Siebert at the New York Times called [...] [...] She also documented this in her book, , which received multiple international awards and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and recommended as a book of the week on the Jean Feraca show, [...] These findings and later studies confirming vertebrate commonalities led her to establish trans-species psychology as a theory and method for the study and <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> (human-inclusive). She also established the non-profit organization, , which is dedicated to furthering scientific understanding and practical applications that promote animal well-being.|$|E
6000|$|... "A load of grass, then, is so cheap, {{that the}} cost of hauling it fifty miles would be more than it is worth. But cotton is worth a great deal more, in {{proportion}} to its bulk. It can therefore be transported to distant places to be sold and manufactured. Thus the enormous quantity of cotton which grows every summer in the southern states, is packed in bags, very tight, and is hauled to the rivers and creeks, and there it is put into steamboats and sent to the great seaports, and at the seaports it is put into ships, which carry it to England or to the northern states, to be manufactured; and it is so valuable, that it will bring a price sufficient to pay all the persons that have been employed in raising it, or in transporting it. But the grass that grows in the northern countries can not be transported. The mills for manufacturing cotton may be in one country, and the cotton be raised in another, and then, after the cotton is gathered, it may be packed and sent thousands of miles to be manufactured. But the sheep and oxen which are to eat the hay, can not be kept in one country, while the grass which they feed upon grows in another. The animals must live, in general, on the very farm which the grass grows upon. Thus, while the cotton cultivator has nothing to do but to raise his cotton and send it to market, the grass cultivator must not only raise his grass, but he must provide for and take care of all the animals which are to eat it. This makes the agriculture of the northern states a far more complicated business, because the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> runs into great detail, and requires great skill, and sound judgment, and the exercise of constant discretion.|$|E
