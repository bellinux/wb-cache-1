I will use the research in the form of questionnaire and content analysis. The thesis is divided into two parts - theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part I describe cultural predisposition, symbols and marketing communications. In the practical part I concern with with the questionnaire and content analysis. Results from my research are that people know the symbols. The most mentioned symbol was animal. The consumers have also not problem with the meaning of the symbol. The content analysis of three types of magazines shows that most displayed symbol was figure.

40|$|The digital {{technology}} revolution {{has changed the}} ecosystem <b>of</b> the <b>advertising</b> industry. New media have brought major changes and challenges to the creation, diffusion, and influence <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> images. First, small teams and individuals have replaced 4 A <b>advertising</b> companies as <b>creators</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> images for brands with more interactive elements. Second, social media have enabled common people to actively participate in brand building via sharing their images and comments online. Third, customized images with precise positioning offer meaningful brand experiences to consumers. To meet the new challenges, this article proposes three strategies: multidisciplinary learning, design thinking, and consumer insight. The findings provide some suggestions for designers to consider how advertising image design and diffusion operate in the new media era, which technologies {{can be used to}} reach target audiences, and what stories can be told to deliver meaningful brand experiences.

Creation and evaluation are therefore intertwined and not, as the literature on creativity has suggested, two sequential steps of the creative process. Since the beginning of the past century, several areas of aesthetic research have examined advertising. Most research has focused on the finished product (i. e., the message), and little of it has studied the production process and the creative activity of art directors and copywriters. Recent research on creativity, inspired by applied social and cognitive psychology (e. g., Lonergan, Scott, & Mumford, 2004; Mumford, 2003) has, however, motivated a renewed interest in this topic...|$|R

Kovachevich considered the project an artwork and {{described it as}} ‘conceptual realism.’ In an interview with Terri Sultan in 1991, for the catalogue of the exhibition, ‘’Thomas Kovachevich: Seeing Invisible Things’’ at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Kovachevich said, [...] "Conceptual realism refers to ideas as solutions to real problems, rather than to what we know as the conceptual art that developed in the 70’s, which was centered in pure idea." [...] Doctor's By Phone provided a way for doctors to be available for consultation 24 hours a day by phone. A page in the Corcoran catalogue for the exhibition was a reprint from a full page ad in the New York Times for Doctor’s By Phone. The project received national press and media coverage.|$|R
50|$|After {{a week of}} frivolity and orgies {{in their}} new bodies, Perry and the other {{recruits}} land on Beta Pyxis III for basic training, during which the CDF's disdain for the United States armed forces is made clear, although one thing they got right was the Rifleman's Creed. Perry's drill instructor, Master Sergeant Ruiz, adopts a tough and disdainful persona towards to recruits, but later discovers Perry is the <b>creator</b> <b>of</b> an <b>advertising</b> slogan Ruiz adopted as a personal mantra ("Sometimes you just gotta hit the road.".) As a dubious gesture of respect, Perry is given the job of platoon leader during the weeks of training before he is shipped out to the CDF ship Modesto. His first engagement is with the Consu, a fierce, incredibly intelligent and religiously zealous alien species. Perry improvises a tactic which enables the CDF to win this first battle quickly. This is soon followed {{by a number of}} battles with, among others, the bear-like Whaidians and the tiny Covandu. By the end of this last engagement Perry begins to suffer psychological distress over killing the Liliputian Covandu and accepts that he has transformed both physically and mentally.|$|R
40|$|Until the 1950 s, {{advertising}} agencies followed the creative model {{based on the}} individual skill sets whereby the <b>creators</b> <b>of</b> the <b>advertising,</b> the copywriters and art directors functioned as separate entities. This model changed in the late 1950 s when Bill Bernbach proposed that by combining these two skill sets – copywriting and art direction - creative and organisational outcomes could be improved (Levenson, 1987). Over the ensuing decades the dyadic “team” approach has been adopted by {{advertising agencies}} around the world. While group and team work occurs in many professions, the dyadic “team” relationship seems to be unique to the advertising industry. In other commercial sectors, professionals work individually, developing their careers without relying on the attributes of the dyadic team. In the advertising industry, they function as a unit, are frequently hired as a “team”, and may work exclusively {{with each other for}} a number of years. Why do the majority of agencies continue to seek out, support, celebrate, reward and sometimes almost deify creative teams? This research seeks to explore whether successful creative dyadic teams have any characteristics in common. In the context <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> creativity, is there any validity in the suggestion that “anything you can do we can do better”? I harbour no expectation that a list of secret ingredients will be uncovered during the course of research, but rather seek to explore and better understand the composition of the team and how it functions. What seems important is what occurs during the process of the team members working together, as their individual beliefs, values, and assumptions intersect within the creative environment and practice. This qualitative research into dyadic teams uses semi structured interviews with the participants, contextualized by ethnographic observations of their environment, organisation and agency peers. Using grounded theory, themes within the data have been identified, analysed and discussed...|$|R
