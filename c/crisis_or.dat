5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone <b>crisis</b> <b>or</b> the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} statistical {{evidence suggesting}} that in industrial countries, recessions {{that are associated with}} either banking <b>crises</b> <b>or</b> housing <b>crises</b> dampen output far more than ordinary recessions. Using a parametric panel framework that allows for a bounceback of the level of output {{in the course of the}} cyclical recovery, we find that ordinary recessions are followed by strong recoveries that make up for almost all the preceding shortfall in output. This bounceback tends to be significantly smaller following recessions associated with banking <b>crises</b> <b>or</b> housing <b>crises.</b> Our paper corroborates the practice of focusing exclusively on severe crises used in an emerging macroeconomic literature and integrates it with the earlier literature on recessions and recoveries...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} and compares {{the performance of}} regulators {{in the fields of}} finance and sport, especially cycling.

Second, I estimate the attention effect on new regulation in response to <b>crises</b> <b>or</b> scandals. The interest of the paper is in the alignment of incentives to prevent regulatory capture and to ensure accountability and enforceability. The paper concludes that the differences hold important lessons that call for the reform of rules and institutions governing finance and cycling alike...|$|R

40|$|Avoiding {{the broader}} output losses to their economy {{is likely to}} be the key reason why governments avoid debt crises. Despite this, there has been little work that seeks to {{quantify}} output losses associated with such crises. This paper seeks to fill this gap. We find that debt crisis episodes last for long - on average by about ten years - and are associated with large output losses (of at least 5 % per year). Sovereign crises rarely occur in isolation - more often than not they are associated with currency <b>crises</b> <b>or</b> banking <b>crises</b> <b>or</b> both. It is the occurrence of a potent cocktail of 'twin' <b>or</b> 'triple' <b>crises</b> that is strongly associated with output losses rather than sovereign crisis per se.
