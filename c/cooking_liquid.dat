50|$|Liebig drew {{upon his}} work in plant {{nutrition}} and plant and animal metabolism to develop a theory of nutrition, which had significant implications for cookery. In his Researches on the chemistry of food (1847) Liebig {{argued that it was}} important to eat not only meat fibre, but also meat juices, which contained various inorganic chemicals. These vital ingredients would be lost during conventional boiling or roasting in which <b>cooking</b> <b>liquids</b> were discarded. For optimum nutritional quality, Liebig advised that cooks should either sear the meat initially to retain fluids, or retain and use <b>cooking</b> <b>liquids</b> (as in soups or stews).|$|R

50|$|Soppressata Toscana, soppressata from Tuscany, is {{made from}} the {{leftover}} parts of the pig. First, the head is boiled for a few hours. When it is done, it is picked of meat and skin. All of the meat and skin, including the tongue, are chopped, seasoned, and then stuffed into a large casing. The <b>cooking</b> <b>liquid</b> is poured in to cover the mixture and it is then hung and the <b>cooking</b> <b>liquid</b> (high in gelatin) thickens to bind everything together.

50|$|Ragù alla bolognese is {{a complex}} sauce which {{involves}} various cooking techniques, including sweating, sautéing and braising. As such, it lends itself well to interpretation and adaptation by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Common sources of differences include which meats to use (beef, pork or veal) and their relative quantities, the possible inclusion of either cured meats or offal, which fats {{are used in the}} sauté phases (rendered pork fat, butter, olive or vegetable oil), what form of tomato is employed (fresh, canned or paste), the makeup of the <b>cooking</b> <b>liquids</b> (wine, milk, tomato juices, or broth) and their specific sequence of addition.|$|R

A useful statistic instrument for this is the so called "triangular test". Sea bass of medium/big size have been used for the test. All the samples have been boiled and oven cooked. The triangular test consisted in submitting to the evaluators all the possible pairs of the same muscular portion and all the possible pairs of <b>cooking</b> <b>liquids</b> obtained from fish belonging to different thesis and a pair from the same thesis.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{manufacture}} of natural cheese was developed using 5 X ultrafiltered whole milk retentate. The retentate was prefermented to pH 5. 0 - 5. 2 before curd formation {{to simplify the}} cheese making process. It was demonstrated that the process can be made commercially feasible. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration of whole milk were done so that the desired level of residual lactose {{was left in the}} retentate. Retentate was inoculated with lactic starter culture and incubated (prefermented) until all lactose was converted to lactic acid. The final pH stabilized at about 5. 0 - 5. 2; the desired pH of the cheese curd. Incubation at 25 °C allowed the retentate to remain liquid during prefermentation and easily pumped through pipes. After prefermentation, retentate was passed through a mechanical curd former where rennet was injected and mixed. The retentate-rennet mixture coagulated as it traveled upward through a cylinder. The curd emerged from the curd former and was cut into cubes by a grid of knives. The curd cubes were treated for removal of moisture by <b>cooking</b> in <b>liquid</b> and evaporation under vacuum. After moisture removal, curd was drained. salted and pressed. Cheddaring and milling were unnecessary. Experiments were performed to determine proper methods for preparing retentate. Diafiltration level was significantly related to lactose concentration in retentate (p=. OOO 1) and final pH of fermented retentate (p=. OOO 1). Acidified permeate and acidified, deionized water were evaluated as <b>cooking</b> <b>liquids.</b> Cheese made from curd cooked in permeate had acid defects. but curd cooked in water produced cheese with a pH similar to conventionally produced Cheddar cheese. Moisture content of all finished cheese was excessive for Cheddar cheese. Body and texture of cheese made from curd cooked in water was close to conventionally produced Cheddar cheese. Diafiltration may be used to control final pH of fermented retentate. Prefermentation of retentate prior to cheese making will simplify equipment and shorten manufacturing time. Commercial application of the process is discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Most braises {{follow the}} same basic steps. The food to be braised (meats, vegetables, mushrooms, etc.) is first pan-seared to brown its surface and enhance its flavor (through the Maillard reaction). If the food will not produce enough liquid of its own, {{a certain amount of}} <b>cooking</b> <b>liquid</b> that often {{includes}} an acidic element (e.g., tomatoes, beer, balsamic vinegar, wine) is added to the pot, often with stock. A classic braise is done with a relatively whole cut of meat, and the braising liquid will cover two-thirds of the food in the pan. Then, the dish is covered and cooked at a very low simmer, until the meat becomes so tender that it can be [...] "cut" [...] with just the gentlest of pressure from a fork (versus a knife). Often the <b>cooking</b> <b>liquid</b> is finished to create a sauce or gravy, as well.|$|E
50|$|A tamale (tamal, tamalli) is a {{traditional}} Mesoamerican dish made of masa or dough (starchy, and usually corn-based), which is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaf. The wrapping is discarded before eating.

50|$|A {{successful}} braise intermingles {{the flavors}} of the foods being cooked {{with those of the}} <b>cooking</b> <b>liquid.</b> This cooking method dissolves the meat's collagen into gelatin, which can greatly enrich and thicken the liquid.

2500|$|Schwedenfackel, or Schwedenfeuer ( [...] , German Wikipedia). Roughly translated, {{it means}} [...] "Swedish fire torch"; {{it is also}} known by other names, {{including}} Swedish (log) candle, and Swedish log stove. It is unique because it uses only one piece of fair-sized wood as its fuel. The log is either cut (usually only partially, but other variants do include totally splitting) and then set upright (ideally, the log needs to be cut evenly and on a level surface for stability). Tinder and kindling {{are added to the}} preformed chamber, from the initial cuts. Eventually, the fire is self-feeding. The flat, circular top provides a surface to place a kettle, or pan for <b>cooking,</b> boiling <b>liquids,</b> etc. The elevated position of the fire can serve as a better beacon than the typical ground based campfire in some instances.|$|R
