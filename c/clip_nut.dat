50|$|A {{cage nut}} or caged nut (also called a captive or <b>clip</b> <b>nut)</b> {{consists}} of a (usually square) nut in a spring steel cage which wraps around the nut. The cage has two wings that when compressed allow the cage to be inserted into the square holes, for example, in the mounting rails of equipment racks. When the wings are released, they hold the nut in position behind the hole. Cage nuts conforming to this description were patented in 1952 and 1953.|$|E
5000|$|In rock climbing, a nut (or chock or chockstone) is a metal wedge {{threaded}} on a {{wire and}} is used for protection by wedging it into {{a crack in the}} rock. Quickdraws are <b>clipped</b> to the <b>nut</b> wire by the ascending climber and the rope threads through the quickdraw. Nuts {{come in a variety of}} sizes and styles, and several different brands are made by competing manufacturers. Most nuts are made of aluminum. Larger nuts may be threaded on Dyneema cord instead of wire, but this has become unusual.|$|R
40|$|DE 1004054754 A UPAB: 20060607 NOVELTY - The {{connection}} has a borehole (2) {{formed in}} a wall of a high pressure pipe, where an end of an injection pipe is introduced into the borehole and broadened in the borehole up to an inner diameter of the borehole. A sealing ring (3) formed complementary to the broadening is inserted into the borehole and protected with a retaining clip (8) in a circulating nut (7) of the borehole against a movement from the borehole. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a common-rail-system with a common rail and injector lines. USE - Used between an injector line and a common rail of a common rail system (Claimed) in a motor vehicle. Can also {{be used in a}} hydraulic system and a gaseous high-pressure system. ADVANTAGE - The connection avoids the need for complex, cost-intensive and polluting preparation of forgings, such that the connection requires small material usage, thus reducing manufacturing costs of the connection, and hence reducing fuel consumption of the motor vehicle. The sealing ring is protected with the retaining <b>clip</b> in the <b>nut</b> of the borehole against the movement from the borehole, such that the connection can be assembled and disassembled in a faster and cost-effective manner...|$|R
