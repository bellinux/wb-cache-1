5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Chelsea {{at home in}} {{the first}} weekend of October. The team found themselves two goals down after 20 minutes, but a converted Dixon penalty and goals from Wright and Campbell turned the score around in their favour. Arsenal <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Old Trafford with a point against league leaders Manchester United on 19 October 1991. After a midweek European football match, Arsenal beat Notts County by two goals, a result which moved them fourth in the table.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking {{of the internal}} subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|A 1–0 {{victory against}} Coventry City meant Arsenal were five points behind Sheffield Wednesday, who lay in third spot. Arsenal {{continued}} their strong finish {{to the season}} by scoring seven goals {{in the space of}} three days – three away to Norwich City and four at home to Crystal Palace. The team, without the suspended Wright for the trip to Sheffield United <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Bramall Lane with a point. Arsenal beat Liverpool 4–0 on 21 April 1992, which marked the opposition's biggest defeat in nine years. A draw at Chelsea ended Arsenal's chances of finishing in a UEFA Cup place. Arsenal ended the league campaign with a 5–1 win against Southampton at home. Wright overtook Tottenham striker Gary Lineker as the league's top goalscorer by scoring three on the day which took his total to 29 (24 of those scored for Arsenal) – one more than Lineker.|$|E

5|$|The committee's {{first choice}} {{to lead the}} mission was Count Folke Bernadotte, the {{vice-chairman}} of the Swedish Red Cross {{and a member of}} the Swedish Royal Family. When Bernadotte's proposed appointment was rejected by the Hungarians, Lauer suggested Wallenberg as a potential replacement. Olsen was introduced to Wallenberg by Lauer in June 1944 and <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the meeting impressed and, shortly thereafter, appointed Wallenberg to lead the mission. Olsen's selection of Wallenberg met with objections from some US officials who doubted his reliability, in light of existing commercial relationships between businesses owned by the Wallenberg family and the German government. These differences were eventually overcome and the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs agreed to the American request to assign Wallenberg to its legation in Budapest as part of an arrangement in which Wallenberg's appointment was granted in exchange for a lessening of American diplomatic pressure on neutral Sweden to curtail their nation's free-trade policies toward Germany.|$|E

25|$|As a youth, Edge {{demonstrated}} {{a desire to}} succeed in business and he acquired an interest in politics. At the age of ten, he and another boy started a four-page weekly newspaper devoted to social news, the Pleasantville Bladder, which had a circulation of approximately one hundred. Edge also attended Pleasantville Republican party rallies and later recounted that he <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> these events feeling great excitement and a growing determination to someday participate in politics himself.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{comprehension}} {{and production of}} these few words demonstrated that she distinguished speech from other environmental sounds and could hear individual phonemes when listening to people talking, two critical early components of language acquisition. Nonetheless, based on their observations both Children's Hospital doctors and the linguists who later worked with her concluded {{that she had not}} acquired a first language during childhood. Due to the lack of physical or mental explanations for her lack of speech, Kent and Hansen attributed it to the extreme isolation of her childhood. Kent <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his first encounters with Genie extremely pessimistic about her prognosis on all fronts.|$|E
25|$|India {{failed to}} reach {{the final of the}} Asia Cup yet again in 2014. In the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 hosted in Bangladesh, India {{narrowly}} missed out on another ICC trophy by losing to Sri Lanka in the final. This tournament saw the rise of Virat Kohli {{as one of the best}} limited overs batsmen in world cricket as he was adjudged the man of the series. India soon comprehensively beat Sri Lanka and West Indies in ODI series to cement their position at the top of the ODI rankings. India toured Australia towards the end of 2014 for a 4-match Test series, which is remembered for MS Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket after the end of the second Test. Virat Kohli was appointed captain of Team India in Test matches but he was unable to turn the series around and India lost 2–0. Kohli's first series win as captain <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home in a 3-match Test series vs Sri Lanka which signalled the beginning of an unbeaten Test series run for India.|$|E

25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E
25|$|In May and June 1958, Blackpool {{embarked}} {{on a tour of}} Australia. En route, they stopped in Los Angeles on 29 April to face a Los Angeles All Stars team in Inglewood. The visitors won 13–2. Their first fixture Down Under was against Australia in Sydney on 3 May. The following day they travelled to Wallsend to face a New South Wales team. On 10 May they returned to Sydney to face Australia again, before moving on to Wollongong the next day for another game against New South Wales. On 13 May, Blackpool faced a Queensland XI in Brisbane. The tour continued with games against Australia (Brisbane, 17 May), Northern Districts (Cessnock, 20 May), Australia (Adelaide, 24 May), Victoria (Melbourne, 25 May), Australia (Melbourne, 31 May), Western Australia (Perth, 2 June) and South Australia (Adelaide, 4 June). Blackpool <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the twelve-game Australian leg with a 100% record. This record was maintained after their two games against in Hong Kong against a Hong Kong XI (8 June) and a Combined Chinese XI (10 June). Both fixtures were played at the Government Stadium in front of 28,000 fans. Blackpool scored 93 goals and conceded 13. The sixteen Blackpool players (goals scored) who partook in the tour were Jimmy Armfield (2), Ray Charnley (28), George Farm, Ewan Fenton (1), Tommy Garrett, Roy Gratrix (1), Jimmy Hagan (21), Peter Hauser (4), Hughie Kelly (4), Jimmy Kelly (2), Barrie Martin, Stanley Matthews (4), Bill Perry (14), Brian Snowdon, Malcolm Starkey (11) and Jackie Wright (1). New manager Ron Suart did not make the trip, preferring instead to learn the ropes at Bloomfield Road.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 2012, Dempsey joined Tottenham Hotspur on {{a three-year}} {{contract}} for a fee {{believed to be in}} the region of $9million. The deal made Dempsey the highest salaried U.S. soccer player of all time. With the 23 shirt that he wore at Fulham and the number 8 that he usually wears on international duty unavailable, he opted for the number 2 jersey, more usually associated with the right-back, which he wore at Furman University. Dempsey scored his first and the eventual match-winning goal for Tottenham in a 3–2 win over Manchester United. It {{was the first time in}} 23 years that Tottenham had won at Old Trafford. He scored his second goal for Spurs in the 39th minute in an away game at Southampton in October. Dempsey's third and fourth goals were scored against Everton in an eventual 2–1 loss and a deflected effort against Reading on New Year's Day to help his Spurs side win 3–1. In the FA Cup 3rd round he scored a double against Coventry City. On January 20, 2013, in driving snow at White Hart Lane against league leaders Manchester United, Dempsey was able to salvage a dramatic 1–1 draw for Spurs by slotting home a pass from Aaron Lennon in the 93rd minute. The goal was his fourth in four appearances in 2013. On January 27, 2013, Dempsey scored a looping header against Leeds United at Elland Road, in the FA Cup to bring the score to 2–1, however Tottenham Hotspur couldn't draw level throughout the rest of the game, leaving the result at 2–1 to Leeds at the whistle. Dempsey was unable to make an impression against his old club on March 17, when Fulham <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> White Hart Lane with a 1–0 victory. On April 21, Dempsey scored the first of three goals for Tottenham in a 3–1 win over Manchester City at White Hart Lane. On May 12, Dempsey scored a long range goal and added an assist while playing against Stoke City to help Spurs win 2–1 and keep them in contention for the fourth Champions League spot.|$|E

25|$|The {{month of}} the December started early for Bengaluru FC as the club took on Shillong Lajong on 1 December 2013 at the Bangalore Football Stadium. Bengaluru FC {{eventually}} came out as the victors in the match after two early goals from captain Sunil Chhetri in the 7th and 34th minute (from a penalty) sealed a 2–1 win for the team. The victory pushed Bengaluru FC {{to the top of}} the I-League table to begin the month. Their second match of the month <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home at the Duler Stadium. Bengaluru FC took on the reigning champions from last season, Churchill Brothers. Bengaluru FC took an early second half lead of 2–0 thanks to strikes from Sean Rooney and Sunil Chhetri. Churchill Brothers brought a goal back with a strike from Balwant Singh before Chhetri sealed the match for Bengaluru FC by scoring his second goal of the match as Bengaluru FC won 3–1. The team then continued their away form in Kolkata on 11 December 2013 when they defeated Mohammedan at the Salt Lake Stadium by a score of 3–2. After taking an early 21st-minute lead through Johnny Menyongar it was Josimar who scored the equalizer for Mohammedan in first-half stoppage time. Sunil Chhetri then restored the lead for Bengaluru FC in the 48th minute before Josimar once again equalized for Mohammedan in the 57th minute but in the 71st minute it was Sunil Chhetri who scored his second goal of the match and the eventual winner for the Bangalore side. However, the club then slipped to their third loss of the season in their next match against East Bengal - thus their second loss to East Bengal this season - at the Bangalore Football Stadium on 15 December 2013. Both goals for East Bengal were scored by James Moga and Chidi Edeh. It was in this match that Bengaluru FC managed to draw 8,216 fans into the Bangalore Football Stadium, the most the team has had till that point. Despite the loss though, Bengaluru FC still managed to end the month of December and the year 2013 with a victory on 21 December 2013 against Salgaocar at the Bangalore Football Stadium in which penalty goals from Sunil Chhetri and Robin Singh (his first of the season) sealed a 2–1 win for the team.|$|E

500|$|Although Diodorus {{says that}} Philip {{defeated}} the new tyrants, Buckler considers {{it more likely}} that Philip's appearance on the scene allowed the Aleuadae to negotiate a peace settlement with Pherae from a position of greater strength. Philip seems to have come away from the expedition with new wives from both Larissa (Philinna) and Pherae (Nicesipolis, Jason's niece), which is suggestive of a negotiated settlement; certainly, as Buckler says, [...] "Philip <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Thessaly with a foot in both camps".|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{voted in}} favor of Vietnam {{military}} appropriations in 1966 through 1968, not wanting to deprive U.S. forces of necessary equipment. Nevertheless, his anti-war rhetoric increased throughout 1967. Over the years, Johnson had invited McGovern and other Senate doves to the White House for attempts to explain the rationale for his actions in Vietnam; McGovern <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the final such visit, in August 1967, shaken by the sight of a president [...] "tortured and confused... by the mess he has gotten into in Vietnam." ...|$|E

Admiral Rodman, for instance, later wrote that he <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his service in the Grand Fleet as probably the most anglophile officer in the U.S. Navy, and many a relationship was forged among the junior officers that served both nations well in World War II.|$|E
500|$|A live match {{audience}} witnessed Arsenal trounce Nottingham Forest at the City Ground {{in early}} November. Steve Bould, Brian Marwood Adams, Smith each scored {{as the team}} {{came back from a}} goal behind to win. [...] "It was a performance of true quality which must have made excellent viewing," [...] was Graham's verdict and he described it as [...] "satisfying" [...] to beat Forest at their home ground. Arsenal were not at their fluent best against Newcastle United though <b>came</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> St James' Park with a cleansheet and a 1–0 win – Bould scored for the second successive match. Paul Merson scored twice against Middlesbrough as Arsenal recorded a 3–0 win and moved into second place, just two points behind Norwich City. Arsenal's five England internationals, who featured against Saudi Arabia a week before, were lauded in The Times for their performances, despite playing tamely for country. The match reporter suggested the club versus country dilemma could be solved by including more Arsenal players, something Graham was sceptical about when put to him. [...] "I want England to do very well. It's just I want Arsenal to do better," [...] he said. Arsenal's unbeaten run came to an end against Derby County, where at the Baseball Ground a debatable penalty was awarded to the home side which allowed them {{to get back into the}} game.|$|E
