40|$|AbstractCutaneous sensory neurons that detect {{noxious stimuli}} project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, while those innervating muscle stretch receptors project to the ventral horn. DRG 11, a paired {{homeodomain}} transcription factor, {{is expressed in}} both the developing dorsal horn and in sensory neurons, {{but not in the}} ventral spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Mouse</b> embryos deficient in DRG 11 display abnormalities in the spatio-temporal patterning of cutaneous sensory afferent fiber projections to the dorsal, but not the ventral spinal cord, as well as defects in dorsal horn morphogenesis. These early developmental abnormalities lead, in adults, to significantly attenuated sensitivity to noxious stimuli. In contrast, locomotion and sensori-motor functions appear normal. Drg 11 is thus required for the formation of spatio-temporally appropriate projections from nociceptive sensory neurons to their central targets in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), the {{disruption}} of blood-spinal cord barrier by activation of the endothelin (ET) system is a critical event leading to leukocyte infiltration, inflammatory response and oxidative stress, contributing to neurological disability. In the present study, we showed that blockade of ET receptor A (ETAR) and/or ET receptor B (ETBR) prevented early inflammatory responses directly via the inhibition of neutrophil and monocyte diapedesis and inflammatory mediator production following traumatic SCI in mice. Long-term neurological improvement, based {{on a series of}} tests of locomotor performance, occurred only in the spinal cord-injured mice following blockade of ETAR and ETBR. We also examined the post‑traumatic changes of the micro‑ environment within the injured spinal <b>cord</b> of <b>mice</b> following blockade of ET receptors. Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase in spinal cord-injured mice treated with vehicle, whereas blockade of ETAR and ETBR reversed the oxidation state imbalance. In addition, hemeoxygenase‑ 1, a protective protease involved in early SCI, was increased in spinal cord-injured mice following the blockade of ETAR and ETBR, or only ETBR. Matrix metalloproteinase- 9, a tissue-destructive protease involved in early damage, was decreased in the injured spinal <b>cord</b> of <b>mice</b> following blockade of ETAR, ETBR or a combination thereof. The findings of the present study therefore suggested an association between ETAR and ETBR in regulating early pathogenesis of SCI and determining the outcomes of long-term neurological recovery...|$|R

As {{a first step in}} clarifying its pathogenesis, we examined the distribution of viral RNA in the spinal cord using in situ hybridization. At 3 days post inoculation (DPI), in the spinal <b>cord</b> of <b>mice</b> showing slight paralysis, viral RNA was observed in capillary endothelial cells and a few adjacent glia cells in the funiculus lateralis from thoracic to lumbar enlargement. At 7 DPI, in the spinal <b>cord</b> of <b>mice</b> showing apparent paralysis, viral RNA was observed in a larger number of glia cells in the demyelinated lesion associated with infiltration of macrophages in the funiculus lateralis and in a small number of degenerated neurons in the cornu ventrale. In the funiculus lateralis, viral RNA could not be observed after 28 DPI. On the other hand, viral RNA was observed in degenerated neurons in the cornu ventrale of mice showing the second phase paralysis at 42 DPI. Many CD 4 +T cells infiltrated around these degenerated neurons. These results suggest that: (1) the viral entry zone was the capillary endothelial cells in the funiculus lateralis; (2) first phase paralysis was due to demyelination caused by EMC-D and associated with macrophage infiltration; (3) second phase paralysis was due to degeneration of motor neurons bearing viral RNA associated with infiltration by CD 4 +T cells...|$|R

Using flow cytometry, we detected three distinct microglial populations within the spinal <b>cord</b> of <b>mice</b> overexpressing mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) : mature microglial cells (CD 11 b(+), CD 45 (low)), myeloid precursor cells (CD 11 b(+), CD 45 (int)), and macrophages (CD 11 b(+), CD 45 (high)). Characterization of cell proliferation within the CNS of SOD 1 (G 93 A) mice revealed that the expansion in microglial cell population is mainly attributable to the proliferation of myeloid precursor cells. To assess the contribution of proliferating microglia in motor neuron degeneration, we generated CD 11 b-TK(mut- 30); SOD 1 (G 93 A) doubly transgenic mice that allow the elimination of proliferating microglia on administration of ganciclovir. Surprisingly, a 50 % reduction in reactive microglia specifically in the lumbar spinal cord of CD 11 b-TK(mut- 30); SOD 1 (G 93 A) doubly transgenic mice {{had no effect on}} motor neuron degeneration.

Up to 90 % of patients are seropositive for aquaporin- 4 autoantibodies (AQP 4 Ab). The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying clinical onset and relapse of NMO are uncertain. Objective: Study the pathogenicity of AQP 4 Ab {{in the absence of}} complement activation. Methods: Female C 57 BL/ 6 N mice (human IgG cannot activate mouse complements) pretreated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, day 0) and pertussis toxin (PTx, day 0 and day 2) were transferred with IgG isolated from serum of healthy subjects or NMO patients (AQP 4 Ab-positive or negative) intraperitoneally (day 7 - 9). Mice were observed for signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by standard 6 -grade EAE scores. Spinal cord was obtained at day 11 for immunohistochemistry. Results: None of the mice had clinical signs of encephalomyelitis, inflammatory cells infiltration or demyelination of spinal cord. CFA and PTx induce BBB breakdown evidenced by leakage of human IgG into cord parenchyma. Patchy areas of AQP 4 loss were observed in spinal <b>cord</b> of <b>mice</b> transferred with IgG from AQP 4 Ab-positive NMO patients but not in mice transferred with IgG from AQP 4 Ab-negative NMO patients or healthy subjects; but there was no loss of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in all mice.

Onset-treatment with 4 types of HBPDS (extracted using distilled water and 30 %/ 70 %/ 100 % ethanol as the solvent) alleviated neurological signs, and HBPDS extracted within 30 % ethanol (henceforth called HBPDS) was more effective.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) and its {{animal model}} experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS). It is believed that MS and EAE are initiated by autoreactive T lymphocytes that recognize myelin antigens; however, the mechanisms responsible for neurodegeneration in these diseases remain elusive. Data indicate that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) plays a {{role in the development of}} MS and EAE. Interestingly, VEGF-A is regarded as a neurotrophic factor in the CNS that promotes neuron survival and neurogenesis in various neurodegenerative diseases by activating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR 2). In this study, we sought to explore the role of the VEGF-A/VEGFR 2 signaling in neurodegeneration in MS and EAE. We showed that the expression of VEGF-A was decreased in the spinal cord during EAE and that VEGFR 2 was activated in lower motor neurons in the spinal <b>cord</b> of EAE <b>mice.</b> Interestingly, we found that treatment with SU 5416, a selective VEGFR 2 inhibitor, starting after the onset of EAE clinical symptoms exacerbated lower motor neuron loss and axon loss in the lumbar spinal <b>cord</b> of <b>mice</b> undergoing EAE, but did not alter Purkinje neuron loss in the cerebellum or upper motor neuron loss in the cerebral cortex.

Further, apoptotic cell rate and apoptosis-related protein expressions were monitored. We observed an impaired autophagic flux and increased neuronal damage in the spinal <b>cords</b> of EAE <b>mice.</b> We also found that rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, mitigated EAE-induced autophagy decrease, inflammation, demyelination and neuronal injury, as well as the abnormal clinical score. In addition, rapamycin suppressed cell apoptosis, and decreased Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio and cleaved caspase- 3 expression. Conversely, the effect of autophagy inhibitor 3 -MA on EAE mice resulted in completely opposite results. These results indicated that autophagy deficiency, at least in part, contributed to EAE-induced neuronal injury and that pharmacological modulation of autophagy might be a therapeutic strategy for MS. </p...|$|R
25|$|A {{more recent}} study on motor {{functional}} recovery after spinal <b>cord</b> injuries in <b>mice</b> showed that after human-induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} were transplanted into the mice, the cells differentiated into three neural lineages in the spinal cord. The cells stimulated regrowth of the damaged spinal cord, maintained myelination, and formed synapses. These positive outcomes were observed for over 112 days after the spinal cord injury, without tumor formation. Nevertheless, a follow-up study by the same group showed distinct clones of human-induced pluripotent stem cells eventually formed tumors.|$|R
50|$|The {{mammalian}} {{and mouse}} Npas2 gene was first sequenced and characterized in 1997 Dr. Steven McKnight's lab {{and published by}} Yu-Dong Zhou et al. The gene’s cDNAs encoding mouse and human forms of NPAS2 were isolated and sequenced. RNA blotting assays were used to demonstrate the selective presence of the gene in brain and spinal <b>cord</b> tissues of <b>mice.</b> In situ hybridization indicated that the pattern of Npas2 mRNA distribution in mouse brain is broad and complex, and is largely non-overlapping with that of Npas1.|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay between}} {{demyelination}} and remyelination {{is critical in}} the progress of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In the present study, we explored the capacity of glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone) to affect the demyelination process and/or lead to remyelination in mice inflicted by chronic EAE, using both scanning electron microscopy and immunohistological methods. Spinal cords of untreated EAE mice revealed substantial demyelination accompanied by tissue destruction and axonal loss. In contrast, in spinal <b>cords</b> of GA-treated <b>mice,</b> in which treatment started concomitantly with disease induction (prevention), no pathology was observed. Moreover, when treatment was initiated after the appearance of clinical symptoms (suppression) {{or even in the}} chronic disease phase (delayed suppression) when substantial demyelination was already manifested, it resulted in a significant decrease in the pathological damage. Detection of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) expressing the NG 2 or O 4 markers via colocalization with the proliferation marker BrdU indicated their elevated levels in spinal <b>cords</b> of GA-treated <b>mice.</b> The mode of action of GA in this system is attributed to increased proliferation, differentiation, and survival of OPCs along the oligodendroglial maturation cascade and their recruitment into injury sites, thus enhancing repair processes in situ...|$|R
40|$|A {{subset of}} {{patients}} of {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) present with mutation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1), and such mutants caused an ALS-like disorder when expressed in rodents. These findings implicated SOD 1 in ALS pathogenesis and made the transgenic animals a widely used ALS model. However, previous studies of these animals have focused largely on motor neuron damage. We report herein that the spinal <b>cords</b> of <b>mice</b> expressing a human SOD 1 mutant (hSOD 1 -G 93 A), besides showing typical destruction of motor neurons and axons, exhibit significant damage in the sensory system, including Wallerian-like degeneration in axons of dorsal root and dorsal funiculus, and mitochondrial damage in dorsal root ganglia neurons. Thus, hSOD 1 -G 93 A mutation causes both motor and sensory neuropathies, and as such the disease developed in the transgenic mice very closely resembles human ALS...|$|R
