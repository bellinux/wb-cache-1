In six girls cyclical hyperglycaemia occurred {{and in one}} cyclical hypoglycaemia. The index case is described in detail, and is then included in {{a description of the}} main clinical features of all seven cases. <b>Cyclical</b> <b>disturbance</b> of diabetic control may present in diabetic girls from age 9 years onwards. Home blood glucose monitoring records may reveal <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbance,</b> usually hyperglycaemia, and usually occurring at 21 - 34 day intervals and lasting for two to five days. Serious illnesses and hospital admission can be averted by educating parents to make appropriate changes to insulin regimen or diet. Our hypothesis is that the disturbance of diabetic control is caused by the onset of cyclical hormonal changes, a 'menstrual' cycle before menstruation. The precise mechanism for the changes in carbohydrate tolerance is unknown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Droughts are a <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbance</b> in Medi-terranean {{ecosystems}} {{and climate change}} models forecast an increase of their frequency and severity. Some experi-mental and observational {{studies have shown that}} co-occurring species may cope with drier conditions with different strategies and present different responses. Here, we investigate sap flow response to drought in order to explain the observed differential growth and mortality of Quercus ilex and Phillyrea latifolia at Prades Holm oak forest (NE Spain). We measured sap flow of these species and compared their diurnal, nocturnal and seasonal patterns and their relationship with environmental variables. Both species described qualitatively similar daily patterns, either during daylight or night. Sap flow rates were significantly higher in P. latifolia except in autumn and spring. P. lat-ifolia was more sensitive to soil moisture. Nocturnal sap flow was detected in both species with no significant dif-ferences and hourly rates suffered a progressive increase from 3 a. m. to dawn in most sampled nights. Our results indicate a better adaptation of P. latifolia to this site as it can take better advantage of wet periods while maintaining higher sap flow rates during dry periods. Along with pre-vious ecophysiological studies at the same location it may be inferred that at its drier distributional limit Q. ilex would be at disadvantage with respect to other species like P. latifolia, as the latter would cope better with increasing xeric conditions already occurring and further predicted for Mediterranean ecosystems. Our results also show nocturnal sap flow to be relevant in individual water losses in these two species as they can be up to 35 – 40 % of daily sap flow. Further research on the underlying mechanisms of this nocturnal sap flow is required since it may also enhance early morning CO 2 fixation or nutrient supply to leaves...|$|E
40|$|Variability in the {{information}} flows within asupplynetwork requires production companies to either track the variations, hence leading to increased production on-costs, or to buffer themselves via the use of inventory which leads to stock holding costs. Customer demands generate variability, often {{in the form of}} seasonal patterns, but must be satisfied. In contrast, “rogueseasonality”, i. e. unintended variability, may be generated by acompany’s own internal processes such as inventory and production control systems. Importantly, rogueseasonality may propagate through asupplynetwork. Thus there is a motivation for automated detection of network-wide rogueseasonality and for the diagnosis of its root cause. In this article, a data-driven technique known as spectral principal component analysis is used to detect and characterise <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> in a supply network that indicate seasonality. All {{the information}} and material flows participating in each disturbance are detected, and the distribution of each disturbance enables a hypothesis to be reached about its root cause. The technique is applied to a supply network consisting of four autonomous business units in the steel industry. Two main <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> were detected and diagnosed. One was found to be rogue seasonality and the other was externally induced by the pattern of customer orders...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} new {{macroeconomic}} modelling project at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, considerable effort has been directed towards constructing an historical estimate of the productive capacity of the New Zealand economy. The technique documented in this paper augments the stochastic-trend estimation approach of the Hodrick-Prescott (1997) filter with information from broad macroeconomic relationships. This strategy is designed to improve the accuracy with which the filter identifies supply (trend) and demand (<b>cyclical)</b> <b>disturbances</b> in New Zealand real output data. The evolution of inflation over the historical period is now more highly correlated with the estimated demand cycles. Further, the conditioning information improves the updating properties of the estimation technique, relative to the Hodrick-Prescott filter. ...|$|R
40|$|Faced {{with the}} two {{extremes}} of fixed and rigid parities on the one hand, and a system of floating rates on the other, many economists have proposed a system based on official sliding parities. According to this line of reasoning, floating exchanges is unachievable politically and therefore this solution would be the maximum concession towards floating that one may hope to negotiate. In this paper, the authors develop a different argument in favour of sliding pegs as compared to either extremes and conclude that such a system combines the advantages of short-run fixity in mitigating propagation of <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> with long-run or structural changes in surplus or deficit.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} harvesting strategies on {{the mean and}} variation in size of the fish stock and net revenues are investigated. The strategies analyzed are constant catch, constant effort, and constant escapement. A Gordon-Schaefer model affected by <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> and stochastic disturbances is applied. Factors explaining {{the differences between the}} strategies are the length of the recruitment cycles and the presence of stochasticity. With short recruitment cycles the constant catch strategy somewhat surprisingly produces least variation and highest mean with respect to stock size and net revenue, while constant escapement produces most variation and lowest mean. With longer recruitment cycles or pure stochasticity, constant escapement produces highest average stock size and net revenue as well as lowest variation in the stock size, but not in the net revenue. Constant effort is in most cases ranked between the other two strategies. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{synchronization}} between the business cycles of US and Mexican regions. Regional economic activity in Mexico is measured using regional coincident indexes recently developed at Banco de M 9 xico, while US aggregate economic activity is measured {{with the national}} coincident index of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The framework for the empirical analysis is the structural linear times series model. We find a regional pattern in the covariance between <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the US and in the Mexican regions: it is higher in the Northern than in the Central and Southern regions of the country. We also find that the elasticity of Mexican regional economic activity {{with respect to the}} US's aggregate economic activity exhibits a similar pattern. Moreover, while the variance of the business cycles in the Northern, North-Central, and Central regions is mostly associated with shocks to the US economy, in the Southern region it is mostly related to specific shocks to the Mexican economy...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances in supply chains may {{be either}} {{exogenous}} or endogenous. The ability automatically to detect, diagnose, and {{distinguish between the}} causes of disturbances is of prime importance to decision makers {{in order to avoid}} uncertainty. The spectral principal component analysis (SPCA) technique has been utilized to distinguish between real and rogue disturbances in a steel supply network. The data set used was collected from four different business units in the network and consists of 43 variables; each is described by 72 data points. The present paper will utilize the same data set to test an alternative approach to SPCA in detecting the disturbances. The new approach employs statistical data pre-processing, clustering, and classification learning techniques to analyse the supply network data. In particular, the incremental k-means clustering and the RULES- 6 classification rule-learning algorithms, developed by the present authors’ team, have been applied to identify important patterns in the data set. Results show that the proposed approach has the capability automatically to detect and characterize network-wide <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> and generate hypotheses about their root cause...|$|R
40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} is a common, complex, and severe psychiatric disorder with <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> of mood {{and a high}} suicide rate. Here, we describe a family with four siblings, three affected females and one unaffected male. The disease course was characterized by early-onset bipolar disorder and co-morbid anxiety spectrum disorders that followed the onset of bipolar disorder. Genetic risk factors were suggested by the early onset of the disease, the severe disease course, including multiple suicide attempts, and lack of adverse prenatal or early life events. In particular, {{drug and alcohol abuse}} did not contribute to the disease onset. Exome sequencing identified very rare, heterozygous, and likely protein-damaging variants in eight brain-expressed genes: IQUB, JMJD 1 C, GADD 45 A, GOLGB 1, PLSCR 5, VRK 2, MESDC 2, and FGGY. The variants were shared among all three affected family members but absent in the unaffected sibling and in more than 200 controls. The genes encode proteins with significant regulatory roles in the ERK/MAPK and CREB-regulated intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways are central to neuronal and synaptic plasticity, cognition, affect regulation and response to chronic stress. In addition, proteins in these pathways are the target of commonly used mood stabilizing drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants, lithium and valproic acid. The combination of multiple rare, damaging mutations in these central pathways could lead to reduced resilience and increased vulnerability to stressful life events. Our results support a new model for psychiatric disorders, in which multiple rare, damaging mutations in genes functionally related to a common signaling pathway contribute to the manifestation of bipolar disorder...|$|R
40|$|The entire Mediterranean basin is {{characterized}} by landscape patterns whose compositions result from countless, long and complex cultural and historical processes. This paper traces the historic and “agri-cultural” processes that have characterized these complex agricultural systems and landscapes {{in order to better}} define: •	the concept of a traditional rural Mediterranean landscape (TML); •	the concept and importance of the complex-forms of polycultural (coltura promiscua) systems and landscapes, by following the historic development of this landscape; •	their most important structural characters, configuration and bio-diversity at the landscape level, because of its environmental complexity and cultural heritage. The characteristics of the Mediterranean polycultural landscape are identified beginning with a historic description of the territory of Sicily (central Mediterranean) : the analysed Halaesa landscape (Greek colony founded in 403 BC) {{as one of the first}} historical detailed description of a complex TML. The analysis of these landscapes reveal a rich spatial configuration and patchiness of the land mosaic, usually made up of relatively small patches and corridors, and had a great species and interspecies diversity as a consequence of the <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> introduced by rotational grazing, cutting and coppice regimes, fire management, as well as of cultivation and other human land use practices. The results show a polycultural agro-silvo-pastoral system and landscape which guarantees biological complexity and richness, environmental and cultural functions. Comparing these results at a wider regional scale, through the other main TML of Sicily, rise the high “bio-diverse” value of these polycultural landscapes. The presence of historical features, of traditional crops and land-uses, and the conservation of the rural architecture and other material and non-material cultural heritage, related to the agricultural activity, are particularly important aspects considered by international and European organization toward their valorisation and conservation...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 89 - 96) The {{belief in}} the power of the moon to influence life on our planet has existed from earliest recorded history, and plays an important role in the history of religion, folklore, and superstition. The conviction that man is to same degree controlled by the forces of the moon continues with great vigor into modern times. In the last several decades, psychologists and other researchers have exhibited an increased interest in the "lunar effect" on human beings, and particularly on human emotions and behavior. Numerous studies have been designed to explore possible relationships between phases of the moon and variables such as suicide, homicide, assault, arson, crisis center calls, psychiatric hospital admissions. While results have been mixed, there are several which show considerable positive correlation between lunar phases and violent or erratic behavior. Most impressive among these is the 1972 study performed in Dade County, Florida by Lieber and Sherin, which shows significant peaks in homicides at full and new moons. Studies such as this indicate the importance of further research on the effect of lunar rhythms on man: Among those who have become convinced of the possibility of a lunar effect on human behavior, several theories have been advanced, based on research in such fields as biochemistry, biometeorology, physics, and psychology. Perhaps the most convincing explanation for the moon' s influence on man is the "biological tides" theory, which involves gravitational influences on body water distribution, and its subsequent effect on the nervous system. Studies such as that of Lieber and Sherin, and other recent evidence relating to various aspects of biological rhythms, indicate the importance of further research in this field. This information is important on a conceptual level in studying issues such as environmental influences on man. It is of critical importance to the psychological clinician in relation to areas such as testing; and in recognition and treatment of <b>cyclical</b> <b>disturbances</b> such as bipolar mental disorders...|$|R
30|$|In {{the last}} 30  years, Peruvian GDP has {{undergone}} important changes, ranging from deep losses and periods of fast growth, to drastic {{changes in the}} production structure. This supports {{the hypothesis that the}} aggregate output has a non-linear behavior that includes discrete changes in its trend or its potential growth rate. These changes can be originated by positive or negative disturbances that take place with a small probability, but have a large impact on the dynamic of output in the long term, for example, periods of economic reforms, internal conflict or institutional reform. On the other hand, during recessions, the magnitude of the variation of output tends to be larger than during expansion periods, but the duration of this high variance period is relatively short. This can be explained by an asymmetrical <b>cyclical</b> component where <b>disturbances</b> of large magnitude, which take place infrequently, have a serious impact on output in the short term, for example, in the event of adverse external shocks and monetary or fiscal policies.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} that two relatively unknown {{features of the}} employment cycle in U. S. manufacturing industries can provide a clue to understanding the role of sectorial shocks {{in the evolution of}} aggregate employment. First, interindustry wage differentials rise in expansions and fall in contractions. Second, periods of increasing aggregate employment are associated with relatively good price and productivity shocks to capital-intensive sectors. The paper presents a simple general-equilibrium model where bargaining at the industry level and rents due to sector-specific capital generate a wage structure with higher wages in capital-intensive sectors but where the response of wages to sector-specific shocks is greater in labor intensive sectors. Empirical evidence is presented to support such implications of the model. The asymmetry of wage adjustments imply that aggregate employment responds more to shocks in capital-intensive industries and that procyclical wage differentials can only result from asymmetric <b>disturbances.</b> <b>Cyclical</b> unemployment, interindustry wage differentials, sector-specific wages...|$|R
30|$|PMU data {{reflects}} {{the behaviors of}} the model at 30 to 60 samples/s. They basically are phasor measurements synchronized with GPS clock. PMU data {{have been widely used}} in power systems analysis [5, 37]. In [38], the authors proposed a new application of PMU data. PMU data have been utilized to locate the sites of disturbance sources. A hybrid dynamic simulation method is used to locate the forced oscillations. Basically, the idea is to replace part of dynamic states and algebraic variables with measurements, which in this case is PMU data, and run a power system model. Mismatch between simulation data and PMU data indicates the location of forced oscillations. Although the method shows promising results, it is only applicable in post-fault analysis studies. Using dynamic state variables, an energy based method is applied to locate the source of forced oscillations in [39, 40]. Although both methods shows promising results, they require detailed information of the model which makes the applicability and the validity of these methods unclear. In [41], after visually detecting oscillations, Prony analysis is applied to extract the oscillations’ characteristic (i.e. frequency, Magnitude, Phase and Damping ratio) and consequently damping torque of the generator is used to locate the source of forced oscillations. The authors detected the forced oscillations at a frequency of 0.56  Hz which is close to the mode frequency and the source of oscillation is not discussed in the paper. Thus, it is interesting to study the performance of this method for two different scenarios: forced oscillations with very small frequency (i.e. 0.13) imposed on a generator and applicability of method on a large power system. Reference [42] analyzed the forced oscillations at 0.7475  Hz based on extended equal-area criterion (EEAC) theory and then located the forced oscillations in two steps: ➀ identify the disturbance cluster by comparing steady phase relationships; ➁ locate the disturbance source by comparing transient response trajectories phase of observation points in identified disturbance clusters. However, the applicability of the proposed method for forced oscillations with high frequency (i.e. 14  Hz) is questionable. Reference [43] studied the differences between the free and forced oscillations in terms of their energy conversions. Considering the <b>cyclical</b> load <b>disturbance</b> as a cause of forced oscillations, an increase of potential power is proposed {{that can be used to}} locate the disturbance source of forced oscillations. As it is listed in Sect. 2, the <b>cyclical</b> load <b>disturbance</b> is one of the possible sources of forced oscillations besides malfunctioning generators, PSS limits on generators, nuclear accelerators and etc. So, it is important to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in [43] for different sources (especially when forced oscillations’ frequencies are considerably small). Reference [44] proposed a new approach based on power dissipation to locate the disturbance source of forced oscillations. As can be seen in Table  1 from the reported event, the forced oscillation frequencies can be expected to be between 0.12  Hz to 14  Hz, and it is not necessarily equal to the natural oscillations’ mode frequencies. Thus, the performance of the proposed method is questionable when forced oscillation frequencies are not equal to the system’s mode frequency. In [23], it was proposed that the location of forced oscillations can be determined using mode shape magnitude when there is not a strong resonant effect. However, in the case of resonance when frequency of forced oscillations is close to that of system modes, mode shape estimation may not be useful to locate the source of forced oscillations.|$|R
