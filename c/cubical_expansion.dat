40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the change in {{refractive}} index with temperature of a crystal is different from what is calculated from the accompanying change in volume and the piezo-optic coefficients. The difference, which is a pure temperature effect, is explained as being due to the change in polarizability of the atoms produced by a change in the amplitude of vibration. The polarizability (α) can be expanded as a Taylor series in the changes of the distance (r) between the atoms and it is found that while the piezo-optic coefficient depends only on ∂α/∂r, the pure temperature effect is a function of ∂ 2 a/∂r 2. Making use of the experimental data, the values of a and its first two derivatives can be determined. These values are foundto be of the same order as those deduced from the intensities of Rayleigh and Raman scattering of light. The theory predicts that dn/dT should vary as the coefficient of <b>cubical</b> <b>expansion</b> at different temperatures and this is verified to be true. Finally, calculations are made of the thermo- and piezo-optic coefficients, considering the electrostatic interaction between the atoms. These do not adequately explain the observed facts, since no provision is made for the distortion of electron atmospheres around the atoms and the consequent changes in polarizability...|$|E
40|$|Adhesives. The effects {{obtained}} when diols and triols {{are used}} to cure Adiprene L- 213 are discussed. Most of the formulations are very viscous and present difficulties in degassing operations. Ionium Project. Four plant samples having 1 ppm or more of Th/sup 2 //sup 3 //sup 0 / were analyzed for Th/sup 2 //sup 3 //sup 0 / in two different ways, one using HNO/sub 3 / digestion and the other using HClO/sub 4 / digestion. The {{difference between these two}} methods found for one sample is attributed to insolubility induced by calcining. Half Life of Radium- 223. The decay of a purified Ra/sup 2 //sup 2 //sup 3 / sample was followed by alpha counting for 109 days; the results indicate that a long-lived impurity may be the cause of the nonconvergence of the probable error in the resolution time range. Purification of a composite sample containing Ac/sup 2 // sup 2 //sup 7 / to give a source of Ra/sup 2 //sup 2 //sup 3 / is described. Determination of Coincidence Correction. The coincidence correction was determined for a proportional alpha counter with Pb/sup 2 //sup 1 //sup 1 /, and the best resolution times and half lives are given. Plutonium Alloy Research. The density of liquid Ce was measured from 825 to 1000 deg C with the vacuum pycnometer method; the thermal coefficient of <b>cubical</b> <b>expansion</b> is found to be very small, 33 x 10 /sup -//sup 6 / cm/sup 3 // cm/sup 3 // deg C, and the volume change of fusion is also estimated to be small, less than 0. 5 %. The viscosities of molten La and Pr were determined from their melting points up to 996 deg C. Qualitative tests were made to study the wetting properties of Pu alloys on Ta. Pure liquid Pu did not wet Ta surfaces, but a Fu [...] 43 at. % Co alloy had improved wetting properties. Plutonium-bearing Glass Fibers. Leaching tests were made at room temperature on glass fibers containing 10 wt. % Pu oxide. Reaching in water, 0. 1 N HCl, and 0. 5 N HNO/sub 3 / for 2206, 2183, and 1363 hr, respectively, resulted in respective losses of 0. 15, 0. 24, and 0. 65 % of the Pu oxide from the fibers. Additional leaching data for glass fibers containing 15 wt. % Pu oxide indicate that the rate of dissolution of Fu oxide is not related to the concentration of the Pu oxide but to that of the alkali metal oxides in the glass. Preliminary results are presented for the tensile strengths of glass fibers containing 20 wt. % Pu oxide. (D. L. C. ...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} aspect of efficient use of a hypercube computer to solve a given problem is the assignment of subtasks to processors {{in such a way}} that the communication overhead is low. The subtasks and their inter-communication requirements can be modeled by a graph, and the assignment of subtasks to processors viewed as an embedding of the task graph into the graph of the hypercube network. We survey the known results concerning such embeddings, including expansion /dilation tradeoffs for general graphs, embeddings of meshes and trees, packings of multiple copies of a graph, the complexity of finding good embeddings, and critical graphs which are minimal with respect to some property. In addition, we describe several open problems.
