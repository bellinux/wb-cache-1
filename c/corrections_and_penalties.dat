2500|$|In 2010, a {{nationwide}} shortage of the lethal injection drug, sodium thiopental, led the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to instead consider pentobarbital, which {{is commonly used}} for animal euthanasia. Oklahoma state law is not specific in prescribing {{the use of a}} fast-acting barbiturate, allowing flexibility for such a substitution. Duty and two other inmates on death row filed a federal appeal that the new protocol would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In a hearing before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the professor of anesthesia from Harvard Medical School testified for the defense that pentobarbital might not succeed in preventing [...] "severe, excruciating pain". However, the professor of anesthesiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst countered in a deposition for the state that 5grams of pentobarbital would be sufficient to cause unconsciousness and death in minutes. Representatives from the Oklahoma Department of <b>Corrections</b> <b>and</b> the Death <b>Penalty</b> Information Center both testified that no other state had used pentobarbital and that they believed Duty would be the first person to be executed by the drug. On December 14, 2010, the Circuit Judges Jerome Holmes and Neil Gorsuch joined Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe in a unanimous decision upholding the use of the drug, citing that the state witness had demonstrated [...] "substantially more clinical experience with the use of pentobarbital". A petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States over the constitutionality of the state's execution protocol was also denied.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of Amnesty Plus <b>and</b> <b>Penalty</b> Plus, {{influencing}} firms' whistle blowing incentives in one market, on their self-reporting decision in another market. Amnesty Plus <b>and</b> <b>Penalty</b> Plus are proactive US strategies which aim at triggering multiple confessions by increasing the incentives of already convicted firms to report in another market where they collude. Predictably, conditional on conviction of one cartel, Amnesty Plus <b>and</b> <b>Penalty</b> Plus strengthen firms' incentives to report the remaining cartel. However, Amnesty Plus <b>and</b> <b>Penalty</b> Plus have an ambiguous impact on firms' incentives to apply for amnesty in the first place: On the one hand, Amnesty Plus <b>and</b> <b>Penalty</b> Plus may help to sustain a cartel, otherwise reported under the EC policy. On the other hand, Amnesty Plus <b>and</b> <b>Penalty</b> Plus may induce immediate reporting of both cartels whereas only one of them would have been reported under the EC Leniency Program...|$|R

The study on duality <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> methods for nonconvex multiobjective optimization problems is very limited. In this paper, we introduce vector-valued nonlinear Lagrangian <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> functions <b>and</b> formulate nonlinear Lagrangian dual problems <b>and</b> nonlinear <b>penalty</b> problems for multiobjective constrained optimization problems. We establish strong duality and exact penalization results. The strong duality is an inclusion between {{the set of}} infimum points of the original multiobjective constrained optimization problem {{and that of the}} nonlinear Lagrangian dual problem. Exact penalization is established via a generalized calmness-type condition. Department of Applied MathematicsAuthor name used in this publication: Yang, X. Q...|$|R
