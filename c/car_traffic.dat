5|$|A 2006 {{poll shows}} {{a high degree}} of {{satisfaction}} with the work of the local police department. More than half the people surveyed during a 2005–2006 poll declared themselves satisfied (62.3%) or very satisfied (3.3%) with the activity of the county police department. The study found the highest satisfaction with <b>car</b> <b>traffic</b> supervision, the presence of officers in the street, and road education; on the negative side, corruption and public transport safety remain concerns.|$|E
50|$|Post the Second World War, {{and with}} the greater use of the motorbus and private <b>cars,</b> <b>traffic</b> on the line fell considerably. Unstaffed as a station from September 1949, the line closed to regular {{passenger}} services on 15 September 1952.|$|R

5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing <b>car</b> <b>traffic</b> in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, the {{population}} of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor of Paris. In 2007, {{in an effort to}} reduce <b>car</b> <b>traffic</b> in the city, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was <b>car</b> <b>traffic,</b> which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Nordberg {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involves a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, installation of third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The third rail {{made it impossible to}} cross the line in-grade, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations. The transport authorities decided to close Nordberg, arguing that the access roads to the station were steep and dangerous, and icy during the winter. The residents of Nordberg opposed the closure of the station, arguing that it had served the area well with its central position in the area. Nevertheless, the station was closed, along with the level crossing that formerly had allowed for <b>car</b> <b>traffic</b> to cross the tracks. An underpass for pedestrians was constructed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Car</b> <b>traffic</b> {{increased}} explosively in {{the post-war}} years, leading to severe capacity {{problems on the}} ferry services. In 1954, {{it was decided to}} establish a new car ferry service between Halsskov and Knudshoved, slightly north of the existing Korsør–Nyborg service and connected to a newly constructed motorway. The service opened on May 28, 1957.|$|E
25|$|Walking and cycling ("non-motorized transport") enjoy {{increasing}} favor (more pedestrian {{zones and}} bike lanes) in American and Asian urban transportation planning, {{under the influence}} of such trends as the Healthy Cities movement, the drive for sustainable development, and the idea of a carfree city.

25|$|The {{social costs}} of {{transport}} include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity, time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive <b>cars.</b> <b>Traffic</b> congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people's time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services.|$|R

25|$|Traditional street {{functions}} such as kids' play, strolling and socializing {{are incompatible}} with traffic flow, which the open, uniform grid geometry encourages. For these reasons, cities such as Berkeley, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, among many others, transformed existing residential streets part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac. This transformation retains the permeability and connectivity of the grid for the active modes of transport but filters and restricts <b>car</b> <b>traffic</b> on the cul-de-sac street to residents only.|$|E

25|$|The first {{purpose-built}} {{pedestrian street}} in Europe is the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam, opened in 1953. The first pedestrianised shopping centre in the United Kingdom was in Stevenage in 1959. A {{large number of}} European towns and cities have made part of their centres car-free since the early 1960s. These are often accompanied by car parks {{on the edge of}} the pedestrianised zone, and, in the larger cases, park and ride schemes.
