40|$|Road User Charging (RUC) is {{designed}} to reduce congestion and collect revenue {{for the maintenance of}} transportation infrastructure. In order to determine the charges, it is important that appropriate Road User <b>Charging</b> <b>Indicators</b> (RUCI) are defined. This paper focusses on Variable Road User Charging (VRUC) as the more dynamic and flexible compared to Fixed Road User Charging (FRUC), and thus is a better reflection of the utility of the road space. The main issues associated with VRUC are the definition of appropriate <b>charging</b> <b>indicators</b> and their measurement. This paper addresses the former by proposing a number of new <b>charging</b> <b>indicators,</b> considering the equalization of the charges and marginal social cost imposed on others. The measurement of the indicators is addressed by a novel data fusion algorithm for the determination of the vehicle state based on the integration of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with Dead Reckoning (DR) and road segment information. Statistical analyses are presented in terms of the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) parameters of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability, based on simulation and field tests.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{problems}} affecting residential and light commercial heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are slow refrigerant leaks and dirty air filters. Equipment users {{are usually not}} aware of a problem until most of the refrigerant has escaped or the air filter is clogged with dirt. While a dirty air filter can be detected with a technology based on the air pressure differential across the filter, such as a ''whistling'' indicator, {{it is not easy}} to incorporate this technology into existing HVAC diagnostic equipment. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is developing a low-cost, nonintrusive refrigerant <b>charge</b> <b>indicator</b> and dirty air filter detection sensor. The sensors, based on temperature measurements, will be inexpensive and easy to incorporate into existing heat pumps and air conditioners. The refrigerant <b>charge</b> <b>indicator</b> is based on the fact that when refrigerant starts to leak, the evaporator coil temperature starts to drop and the level of liquid subcooling drops. When the coil temperature or liquid subcooling drops below a preset reading, a signal, such as a yellow warning light, can be activated to warn the equipment user that the system is undercharged. A further drop of coil temperature or liquid subcooling below another preset reading would trigger a second warning signal, such as a red warning light, to warn the equipment user that the unit now detects a leak and immediate action should be taken. The warning light cannot be turned off until it is re-set by a refrigeration repairman. To detect clogged air filters, two additional temperature sensors can be applied, one each across the evaporator. When the air filter is accumulating buildup, the temperature differential across the evaporator will increase because of the reduced airflow. When the temperature differential reaches a pre-set reading, a signal will be sent to the equipment user that the air filter needs to be changed. A traditional refrigerant <b>charge</b> <b>indicator</b> requires intrusion into the system to measure the refrigerant high-side and low-side pressures. Once the pressures are known, based on the equipment's refrigerant charging chart? or in most cases, based on the technician's experience? the refrigerant charging status is determined. However, there is a catch: by the time a refrigeration technician is called, most of the refrigerant has already escaped into the atmosphere. The new technology provides a real-time warning so that when, say, 20 % of the refrigerant has leaked, the equipment users will be warned, even though the equipment is still functioning properly at rated capacity. Temperature sensors are becoming very accurate and very low in cost, compared with pressure sensors. Using temperature sensors to detect refrigerant charge status is inherently nonintrusive, inexpensive, and accurate. With the addition of two temperature sensors for detecting dirty air filters, the capability of the diagnostic equipment is further enhanced with very little added cost. This report provides laboratory test data on the change of indoor coil refrigerant temperature and subcooling as a function of refrigerant charge for a 2 -ton split heat pump system. The data can be used in designing the indicators for refrigerant loss and dirty air filter sensors...|$|R
