Synoptic {{situations}} that encourage these summertime thunderstorms typically involve elevated instability that promotes dry lightning thunderstorms, where less than 0. 1 in of precipitation reaches the ground. On 21 June 2008, a poorly forecasted dry lightning outbreak was responsible for starting more than 1, 500 wildfires across California, and specifically the Monterey region.

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a simple theory for {{the transformation of}} non-precipitating, shallow convection into precipitating, deep convective clouds. In {{order to make the}} pertinent point a much idealized system is considered, consisting only of shallow and deep convection without large–scale forcing. The transformation is described by an explicit coupling between these two types of convection. Shallow convection moistens and cools the atmosphere, whereas deep <b>convection</b> <b>dries</b> and warms, leading to destabilization and stabilization respectively. Consequently, in their own stand–alone modes, shallow convection perpetually grows, whereas deep convection simply damps: the former never reaches equilibrium, and the latter is never spontaneously generated. Coupling the modes together {{is the only way to}} reconcile these undesirable separate tendencies so that the convective system as a whole can remain in a stable periodic state under this idealized setting. Such coupling is a key missing element in current global atmospheric models. The energy–cycle description as originally formulated by Arakawa and Schubert, and presented herein is suitable for direct implementation into models using a mass–flux parameterization, and would alleviate the current problems with the representation of these two types of convection in numerical models. The present theory also provides a pertinent framework for analyzing large–eddy simulations and cloud–resolving modelling...|$|R

It {{has been confirmed}} that drying the rhizomes in temperature lower than 70 оC increased the yield of ginger oil, without any effect on transformation of 6 -gingerol to 6 -shogaol, while temperature higher than 70 оC promoted transformation of 6 -gingerol to 6 -shogaol [12]. The essential oil from mature freeze-dried ginger rhizome (Hsinchu, Taiwan), which extracted by hydro-distillation method and low temperature extraction using liquid CO 2 method, resulted in degradation of non-volatile gingerol contents [13]. Furthermore, zingiberene (27.8 %), β-phellandrene (12.9 %), sesquiphellandrene (10.4 %), geranial (6.6 %), α-curcumene (5.8 %), and β-bisabolene (5.7 %) were as {{the main components of}} fresh ginger oil, while drying at 80 оC for 1 h was resulted in zingiberene (26.4 %), sesquiphellandrene (10.2 %), β-phellandrene (10.0 %), camphene (7.6 %), geranial (6.6 %), ar-curcumene (6.0 %), and β-bisabolene (5.4 %) as its main components. Drying these rhizomes by microwave at 700 W for 2 min resulted in zingiberene (37.1 %), β-sesquiphellandrene (12.8 %), β-bisabolene (12.8 %), ar-curcumene (8.5 %), and β-phellandrene (7.4 %) as the main compounds. Essential oil of silica gel dried rhizome had been zingiberene (30.2 %), sesquiphellandrene (12.2 %), geranial (8.1 %), β-phellandrene (7.7 %), ar-curcumene (6.3 %), and β-bisabolene (6.2 %) [12]. Drying the fresh ginger by <b>convection</b> <b>drying,</b> and microwave drying methods at PL 100 resulted in 2.9 and 3 % v/w yield oil versus 3.2 % for ginger oil from fresh rhizome. Zingiberene (23.5 %), α-farnesene (12.0 %), β-sesquiphellandrene (10.3 %) and ar-curcumene (5.5 %) were the main components of fresh ginger oil. The concentration of zingiberene decreased in essential oils from rhizome dried by <b>convection</b> <b>drying</b> or microwave PLS higher than 100. The extracted essential oil from dried ginger rhizome by microwave PL 100 had higher gingerol content (about 7 %) due to reduction in drying time [14]. Therefore, the drying method, freshness or dryness and time exposure of rhizome to heat [14] can influence on chemical composition and yield of essential oils. The number of phytochemical compounds in ginger oil from dried rhizomes had higher than the oils from fresh ones (115 vs. 63) [15].|$|E

The results show that the most intensive heat and mass transfer occur in the transition region where both capillary flow and vapor diffusion play a significant role. The length of the transition region is determined clearly by analyzing the liquid flux distribution in the material, its value depends very much on the permeability of the material. The model proves that the assumption of evaporation front is valid for drying of very permeable materials.
