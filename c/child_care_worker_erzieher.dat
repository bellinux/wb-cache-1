40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 82 - 85) Although {{there has}} been considerable research concerning {{the health and safety}} of <b>children</b> in <b>child</b> <b>care,</b> {{there has been}} very little research concerning the health and safety needs of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> staff working in <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centers. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether or not <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> experience more health- related problems as a result of their employment than persons who are not employed in <b>child</b> <b>care.</b> A questionnaire was developed based on a review of issues relative to health and safety in <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centers. The questionnaire was mailed to nine randomly- selected <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centers in northwestern Illinois and to a control group of 100 secretaries at Northern Illinois University. After the questionnaires had been returned, the data was analyzed in order to determine whether or not <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> experience more health-related problems than persons who are not employed in <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centers. In addition, <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> who work with infants and toddlers in diapers were compared to <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> who work with toilet-trained toddlers and older children in order to determine if there was a difference in the number of health-related problems between these two groups. Based on the results of this study, <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> are at greater risk than secretaries to common childhood illnesses, suffer more musculoskeletal problems as a result of lifting children older than two years of age, and are subject to more on-the-job stress and stress- related illnesses. In addition, <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> who are responsible for infants or children in diapers are more at risk to illness than <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> who are responsible for toilet-trained children. Because significant growth is expected in the day care industry over the next decade, it is important that health and safety considerations for <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> be incorporated into plans for new day care centers and into licensing regulations as they are updated by the states.

The study investigated carers working in formal <b>child</b> <b>care</b> [long day care (LDC) and family day care (FDC) ]. Results : Questionnaires to caregivers in centres showed that 86 % had taken sick leave in the previous year and 75 % of staff had taken leave for infectious illness.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 119 - 133. The idea {{of racial}} and {{cultural}} integration in children's residential facilities has been taboo in South Africa until recently, {{as a result of}} the racial policies of the current and previous governments. Since 1990 the government has repealed most of its apartheid legislation. Integration of residential facilities is only now able to be considered as a possible solution to the accommodation crisis of black disadvantaged children. The aim of the present research study was to use an exploratory -descriptive design to ascertain the attitudes of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> practitioners regarding racial and cultural integration in residential facilities. A questionnaire was constructed and completed by respondents from the two purposive sample groups viz. the Principals Group and the <b>Child</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Workers</b> Forum of the National Association of <b>Child</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Workers.</b> A total of 68 questionnaires was distributed of which 46 were returned Findings indicated that 70 % of the <b>Child</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Workers</b> are working with children of other race groups. Although 94 % of the <b>Child</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Workers</b> and all of the Principals (100 %) felt that children would gain much from an integrated living environment, 45 % of the <b>Child</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Workers</b> and 55 % of the Principals felt that residential facilities should remain racially exclusive. The implications of such findings are that the preparation for racial and cultural ·integration of staff and children is foreseen. Indications are given that extra resources would be required i. e. money, time, staff. In view of the current and anticipated needs of residential <b>care</b> for disadvantaged <b>children</b> in South Africa, it is recommended that all <b>child</b> <b>care</b> practitioners participate in some form of ethnic and culturally sensitive training programme in order to adequately prepare them for work with children of other races and cultures...|$|R

The objective of the present study is to investigate how the psychosocial factors of the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model influence musculoskeletal symptoms (MS) and the risk of burnout. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the association between the factors of the ERI model and MS in <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b> Data from 199 <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> were examined in a cross-sectional study. Psychosocial factors were recorded with the ERI questionnaire. MS was recorded with the Nordic Questionnaire and risk of burnout with the Personal Burnout scale of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Multivariate analysis was performed using linear and logistic regression models. The response rate was 57 %. In most of the sample (65 %), an effort-reward imbalance was observed. 56 % of the <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> were at risk of burnout and 58 % reported MS. Factors associated with risk of burnout were subjective noise exposure (OR: 4. 4, 95 %CI: 1. 55 - 12. 29) and overcommitment (OR: 3. 4; 95 %CI: 1. 46 - 7. 75).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was {{to look at the}} level of {{understanding}} of child growth and development of selected kindergarten and first grade teachers and their counterparts in before- and after-school programs. Three hypotheses were tested: 1. There would be {{a significant difference in the}} understanding of the principles of child growth and development, as measured by a questionnaire, between credentialed teachers and <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b> 2. There would be a significant difference between those teachers and <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> with backgrounds in Early Childhood Education in comparison to those teachers and <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> with only minimal training. 3. There would be a significant difference between experienced teachers and <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> (more than five years) and those who were new to their respective positions. A questionnaire was formulated to survey the selected population. Questions were based on research of developmentally sound early childhood practices for children, ages five through seven, in the areas of social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development. A Likert rating scale of 1 - 5 was used for the answers, with 5 indicating the greatest level of agreement with sound practices. The population surveyed included fourteen elementary schools and fifteen <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centers in one school district. The district had more than 30, 000 students and was in the seventy-fifth percentile on the socioeconomic level. It was eighty percent Caucasian, upper-middle class, and suburban. There were 141 questionnaires distributed, and eighty were completed and returned. Results of the survey supported hypotheses one and three. The second hypothesis examined respondents' answers according to the amount of educational training they had. The results were examined first by using only the early childhood education (ECE) units for all respondents, and second by separating respondents according to the credential held. Because there was not enough separation between those having ECE and those not having formal training, and because there was clearly a difference when the formal standardized training for the credential was added, the second hypothesis could not be resolved.
