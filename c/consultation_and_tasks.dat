40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were: (1) to identify tasks performed by secondary school counselors when serving students with disabilities, and (2) to determine if there was a relation between a counselor 2 ̆ 7 s years of experience, number of college credit hours completed in special education, total student caseload, and number of students with disabilities on the counselor 2 ̆ 7 s caseload in counseling, <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> coordination <b>tasks</b> identified by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) on the Counselor Role Survey (CRS). ^ A survey of 250 Nebraska secondary school counselors was conducted during the 1995 - 96 year. A coefficient procedure was used to analyze correlations between counseling tasks on the CRS and the following independent variables: years of counseling experience; number of credit hours completed in special education; total student caseload; and number of students with disabilities on the counselor 2 ̆ 7 s caseload. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine if there was a difference in items identified as counseling, <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> coordination <b>tasks</b> on the CRS and the independent variables previously stated. The results of the study were: (1) tasks most frequently performed by counselors when serving students with disabilities were consultation tasks; (2) a significant correlation was found between the CRS and college credit hours completed in special education and number of students with disabilities on the counselor 2 ̆ 7 s caseload; (3) a significant difference was found between coordination items on the CRS and counselor 2 ̆ 7 s years of experience, college credit hours completed in special education and number of students with disabilities on the counselor 2 ̆ 7 s caseload. ^ Recommendations based on this research were: (1) counselors would benefit from completing courses in special education when serving students with disabilities; (2) counselors would benefit from an expanded array of coordination tasks when serving students with disabilities; (3) counselor training programs may need to increase counseling strategies for students with disabilities; and (4) Nebraska counselors should continue to serve students with disabilities utilizing a team approach. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{fields of}} quality {{assurance}} {{in higher education}} and e-learning, or technology-enhanced learning, are current and topical, yet seldom overlap (Reid, 2003). Higher education institutions are experiencing pressure to become more client focused and compete on the global stage, especially with respect to technology-enhanced learning. We are {{on the brink of}} a genuine pedagogical revolution (Moon, 2003) and calls for quality promotion, accountability, self-evaluation, value for money and client satisfaction cannot go unheeded. Three knowledge domains provide the context for this study: quality assurance, higher education and web-supported learning. Their intersection locates the research problem that was investigated, namely the quality assurance of web-supported learning in higher education. The research design is an instrumental case study, focusing on web-supported learning as a supportive medium in a flexible, blended learning model at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. The research methods include the literature survey, case analysis meetings, a student survey, lecturer interviews, expert <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> teaming. The conceptual framework for this study (Figure 2. 5) is based on the confluence of the existing theories: quality assurance theory, instructional systems design and systems theory. The updated conceptual framework (Figure 7. 1) and the synthesized findings (Table 7. 1) reflect the holistic nature of the process-based quality management system for web-supported learning that characterises this study. The value of this study to the academic community is in the findings, which include a taxonomy of critical success factors for web-supported learning, the identification of factors which promote student and lecturer satisfaction (or frustration) with web-supported learning experiences, and lessons learnt by applying standard quality assurance theory to the instructional design process. The self-evaluation exercise in an academic support unit provides a precedent and contributes criteria that will be useful to the Higher Education Quality Committee in South Africa, as well as to other higher education institutions.

40|$|WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region (WHO Standard) was {{released}} in 2008. Initially, there were 92 / 361 controversial acupuncture points (acupoints). Through seven informal <b>consultations</b> <b>and</b> four <b>task</b> force team meetings, 86 points were agreed upon among the 92 controversial acupoints, leaving 6 remaining controversial acupoints, demanding active research in the future. This will enhance the reproducibility and validity of acupuncture studies. It will also lead {{to a better understanding}} of acupuncture mechanisms in order to optimize its clinical efficacy for a range of diseases and syndromes. This book has two parts: General Guidelines for Acupuncture Point Locations and WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations. First of all, familiarity with the General Guidelines for Acupuncture Point Locations in this book can help the reader to understand and use the contents of this book in depth. I would like to thank all of the participating experts and scholars for this great work, who have overcome the limits of previous acupuncture references.

40|$|Virtual {{discussion}} {{between students}} and lecturers nowadays become easier and effective by using computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools. The issue on geographical distance {{is no longer a}} problem but there are some aspects that need attention, such as the consultation documentation, record log and the ability to see the records of these virtual relationships. Most current virtual communications software is focused on the communication and less on the process of before and after the virtual communication. In order to enhance the virtual communication process, we have designed and developed an Online Instructional Consultation (OICon) model to facilitate student-lecturer consultation for higher education mentor-mentee system in Malaysia. The model consists of 5 interrelated domains that are personalization, <b>consultation</b> processes <b>and</b> <b>task</b> involved, features <b>and</b> multimedia components, <b>consultation</b> content <b>and</b> <b>consultation</b> document. It provides alternative means on delivery of the contents and services as well as provides participants a range of option. By this way, students and lecturer can involve actively through online consultation at remote places, not just between lecturer and students but also on post-session discussion among peers. Point of correspondence includes implementation of CMC tools to facilitate online consultation processes for academic advisory purpose. OICon model was then transformed into a prototype system to verify the model. Based on the evaluation conducted, we found that users are relatively positive towards implementation of multimedia communication tools for consultation in higher education and they agreed that the OICon model is crucial for enhance and promote interactivity for <b>consultation</b> among students <b>and</b> lecturers...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive {{networks}} {{consist of}} a collection of agents with adaptation and learning abilities. The agents interact with each other on a local level and diffuse information across the network through their collaborations. In this work, we consider two types of agents: informed agents and uninformed agents. The former receive new data regularly <b>and</b> perform <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> in-network <b>tasks,</b> while the latter do not collect data and only participate in the consultation tasks. We examine the performance of adaptive networks {{as a function of the}} proportion of informed agents and their distribution in space. The results reveal some interesting and surprising trade-offs between convergence rate and mean-square performance. In particular, among other results, it is shown that the performance of adaptive networks does not necessarily improve with a larger proportion of informed agents. Instead, it is established that the larger the proportion of informed agents is, the faster the convergence rate of the network becomes albeit at the expense of some deterioration in mean-square performance. The results further establish that uninformed agents play an important role in determining the steady-state performance of the network, and that it is preferable to keep some of the highly connected agents uninformed. The arguments reveal an important interplay among three factors: the number and distribution of informed agents in the network, the convergence rate of the learning process, and the estimation accuracy in steady-state. Expressions that quantify these relations are derived, and simulations are included to support the theoretical findings. We further apply the results to two models that are widely used to represent behavior over complex networks, namely, the Erdos-Renyi and scale-free models. Comment: 35 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
