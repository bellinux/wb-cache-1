40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} intertemporal {{volatility}} structure of Eurocurrency rates of five different maturities ranging from seven days to twelve months for six Euro CD <b>currency</b> <b>denominations</b> spanning the 1986 - 1992 period. the analysis used the common ARCH-feature testing methodology recently developed by Engle and Kozicki (1993). First, the results indicate presence of ARCH effects in the Eurocurrency rate series. This result suggests that modelling of Eurocurrency rates requires the inclusion of time-varying risk premia. Second, our evidence reveals that short- and long-term Eurocurrency rate series have the same volatility process. the results point out that a common time-varying volatility process characterises most Eurocurrency rate series across maturities and <b>currency</b> <b>denominations.</b> Hence, the common ARCH results imply that a common time-varying variance model would be the appropriate specification of the conditional heterscedasticity for most Eurocurrency rates.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{significance}} of an intertemporal relation between expected returns on countries' stock market portfolios and their risk exposures to the world market portfolio. We find that the intertemporal risk-return relation differs significantly under different <b>currency</b> <b>denominations.</b> The slope coefficient is the largest at around seven when the returns are denominated in Japanese yen, moderate at about five when the returns are denominated in the Canadian or US dollars, and the smallest at around three when the returns are denominated in pound or euro and its predecessors. The ranking of the risk-return coefficients across different <b>currency</b> <b>denominations</b> remains the same when we replace country equity indices with global industry portfolios in estimating the intertemporal relations, when we change the return frequency from monthly to daily, and when we consider different specifications for the conditional covariance process.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of inflationary trends, {{which has been}} a macroeconomic concern in Nigeria over the last decade, is considered to be very hazardous to the aggregate economic activity of any country. In order to determine the practical effect of higher currency note introduction on the Nigerian economy, an empirical investigation on the casualty between inflation, <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> fiscal deficit and broad money supply was carried out using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model (Forecast Variance and Impulse Response) model.

The Cholesky ordering (<b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> inflation, fiscal deficit and broad money supply) is used in the VAR estimates, which indicates that the shocks in <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> affect the other variables and result to inflation. It is therefore recommended that the Nigerian government should implement inflation management policies and also ensure that lower currency notes in circulation are more than higher currency notes in circulation...|$|E
