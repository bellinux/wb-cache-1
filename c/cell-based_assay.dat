40|$|Several {{factors are}} known to {{increase}} the noise and variability of <b>cell-based</b> <b>assays</b> used for high-throughput screening. In par-ticular, edge effects can result in anunacceptably highplate rejection rate in screening runs. In an effort tominimize these vari-ations, the authors analyzed {{a number of factors}} that could contribute to edge effects in <b>cell-based</b> <b>assays.</b> They found that pre-incubation of newly seeded plates in ambient conditions (air at room temperature) resulted in even distribution of the cells in eachwell. In contrast, when newly seeded plateswere placed directly in theCO 2 incubator, an uneven distribution of cells oc-curred inwells around the plate periphery, resulting in increased edge effect.

50|$|Unlike karyotypes {{obtained}} from conventional cytogenetics, virtual karyotypes are reconstructed by computer programs using signals {{obtained from}} disrupted DNA. In essence, {{the computer program}} will correct translocations when it lines up the signals in chromosomal order. Therefore, virtual karyotypes cannot detect balanced translocations and inversions. They also can only detect genetic aberrations in regions of the genome that are represented by probes on the array. In addition, virtual karyotypes generate a relative copy number normalized against a diploid genome, so tetraploid genomes will be condensed into a diploid space unless renormalization is performed. Renormalization requires an ancillary <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay,</b> such as FISH, if one is using arrayCGH. For karyotypes obtained from SNP-based arrays, tetraploidy can often be inferred from the maintenance of heterozygosity within a region of apparent copy number loss. Low-level mosaicism or small subclones may not be detected by virtual karyotypes because the presence of normal cells in the sample will dampen the signal from the abnormal clone. The exact point of failure, {{in terms of the}} minimal percentage of neoplastic cells, will depend on the particular platform and algorithms used. Many copy number analysis software programs used to generate array-based karyotypes will falter with less than 25-30% tumor/abnormal cells in the sample. However, in oncology applications this limitation can be minimized by tumor enrichment strategies and software optimized for use with oncology samples. The analysis algorithms are evolving rapidly, and some are even designed to thrive on ‘normal clone contamination’, so it is anticipated that this limitation will continue to dissipate.|$|E

40|$|Background: Recombinant {{human brain}} natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) is an {{important}} peptide-based therapeutic drug indicated {{for the treatment of}} acute heart failure. Accurate determination of the potency of therapeutic rhBNP is crucial for the safety and efficacy of the drug. The current bioassay involves use of rabbit aortic strips, with experiments being complicated and time-consuming and markedly variable in results. Animal-less methods with better precision and accuracy should be explored. We have therefore developed an alternative <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay,</b> which relies on the ability of BNP to induce cGMP production in HEK 293 cells expressing BNP receptor guanylyl cyclase-A. Methodology/Principal Findings: An alternative assay based on the measurement of BNP-induced cGMP production was developed. Specifically, the bioassay employs cells engineered to express BNP receptor guanylyl cyclase-A (GCA). Upon rhBNP stimulation, the levels of the second messager cGMP in these cells drastically increased and subsequently secreted into culture supernatants. The quantity of cGMP, which corresponds to the rhBNP activity, was determined using a competitive ELISA developed by us. Compared with the traditional assay, the novel <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay</b> demonstrated better reproducibility and precision. Conclusion/Significance: The optimized <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay</b> is much simpler, more rapid and precise compared with the traditional assay using animal tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a novel and viable alternative assay fo...|$|E

Defects in PARK 2 protein are the cause of Parkinson?s disease type 2 (PARK 2), also known as early-onset parkinsonism with diurnal fluctuation (EPDF) or autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson?s disease (PDJ). In mouse model, Parkin is critical for removing dysfunctional mitochondria via autophagy. The absence of Parkin does not affect turnover under normal conditions.

40|$|In this study, two {{different}} methods are introduced for micropatterning Teflon-AF surfaces {{in order to}} establish site-specific cell adhesion in an array format on a digital microfluidic chip. By using digital microfluidics, adherent <b>cell-based</b> <b>assays</b> can be executed automatically on these surfaces in a high-throughput context. On this analysis platform, <b>cell-based</b> <b>assays</b> are executed in small nanolitre-volume droplets using the principle of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). A closed EWOD system is developed in which the hydrophobic layer of the bottom surface is patterned by microfabrication techniques. Wet lift-off lithography and a dry lift-off method using a parylene-C mask are introduced to define local poly-L-lysine (PLL) zones surrounded by a cytophobic Teflon-AF matrix. Cells selectively adhere onto these patterned surfaces when being submerged in cell suspension. By using digital microfluidics, MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells are transported to the local PLL-islands and are allowed to adhere to these cell adhesion sites. Cell viability is assessed using the life-stain Calcein AM. In a final phase, a cytotoxicity assay is executed in which MCF- 7 cells are treated with hydrogen peroxide (an oxidative stress inducer in cells) by performing all liquid handling automatically on-chip.

In this study, we investigated the magnitude and molecular nature of Fc gamma (Fcγ) receptor-dependent toxin neutralization observed in commonly used forms of the anthrax toxin neutralization assay. Significantly more Fcγ receptor-dependent neutralization was observed in the J 774 A. 1 <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay</b> than in the RAW 264. 7 <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay,</b> a finding that {{could be due to}} the larger numbers of Fcγ receptors that we found on J 774 A. 1 cells by using flow cytometry. Thus, the extent to which Fcγ receptor-dependent neutralization contributes to the total neutralization measured by the assay depends on the specific cell type utilized in the assay. Using Fcγ receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies, we found that at least three murine Fcγ receptor classes, IIB, III, and IV, can contribute to Fcγ receptor-dependent neutralization. When antibodies elicited by immunization of rabbits with protective-antigen-based anthrax vaccines were analyzed, we found that the magnitude of Fcγ receptor-dependent neutralization observed in the J 774 A. 1 <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay</b> was dependent on the concentration of protective antigen utilized in the assay. Our results suggest that the characteristics of the antibodies analyzed in the assay (e. g., species of origin, isotype, and subclass), as well as the assay design (e. g., cell type and protective antigen concentration), could significantly influence the extent to which Fcγ receptor-dependent neutralization contributes to the total neutralization measured by anthrax toxin neutralization assays.

Here we describe the development and qualification of a sensitive <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay</b> for the detection of residual infectious West Nile Virus (WNV). The results of the assay are in good agreement with the assumption that at low concentrations the number of infectious units in relatively small samples follows a Poisson distribution.

Furthermore, we show equivalence in sensitivity between the <b>cell-based</b> <b>assay</b> and an in vivo assay for detection of infectious WNV.
