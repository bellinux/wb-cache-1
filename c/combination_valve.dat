50|$|Valve tremolo: Many {{notes on}} the trumpet can be played in several {{different}} <b>valve</b> <b>combinations.</b> By alternating between <b>valve</b> <b>combinations</b> on the same note, a tremolo effect can be created. Berio makes extended use of this technique in his Sequenza X.|$|R
5000|$|The boiler, {{of which}} the barrel was 11/16 in thick, was fitted with four Ramsbottom safety valves, 3+1/2 in in diameter. It was fed by two injectors, {{arranged}} {{on the underside of}} the footplate at the sides, with the <b>combination</b> <b>valves</b> placed on the back of the firebox. The Belpaire firebox was constructed with a forward [...] "rake" [...] of the throat and back plates to keep the distance between the boiler's tube plates reasonably short at 18 ft. It had a finger bar firegrate which was operated by hand lever from the cab.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Commonwealth and United States [...] "Reveilles" [...] can {{be played}} with any <b>combination</b> of <b>valves</b> (or all open valves), because they were first played on a bugle, which lacks valves and plays only notes from the {{harmonic}} series.|$|R
25|$|In most {{trumpets}} and cornets, {{the compensation}} {{must be provided}} by extending the third valve slide with {{the third or fourth}} finger, and the first valve slide with the left hand thumb (see Trigger or throw below). This is used to lower the pitch of the 1-3 and 1-2-3 <b>valve</b> <b>combinations.</b> On the trumpet and cornet, these <b>valve</b> <b>combinations</b> correspond to low D, low C, low G, and low F, so chromatically, to stay in tune, one must use this method.|$|R
50|$|Because certain <b>combinations</b> of check <b>valve</b> failure and/or system {{backpressure}} {{cause the}} relief valve to discharge, the device must be mounted in a location where the drain will not become flooded.|$|R
40|$|Multivalvular disease (MVD) {{is common}} among {{patients}} with valvular disease, {{and has a}} complex pathophysiology dependent on the specific <b>combination</b> of <b>valve</b> lesions. Diagnosis is challenging because several echocardiographic methods commonly used {{for the assessment of}} stenosis or regurgitation have been validated only in patients with single-valve disease. Decisions about the timing and type of treatment should be made by a multidisciplinary heart valve team, on a case-by-case basis. Several factors should be considered, including the severity and consequences of the MVD, the patient's life expectancy and comorbidities, the surgical risk associated with combined valve procedures, the long-term risk of morbidity and mortality associated with multiple valve prostheses, and the likelihood and risk of reoperation. The introduction of transcatheter valve therapies into clinical practice has provided new treatment options for patients with MVD, and decision-making algorithms on how to combine surgical and percutaneous treatment options are evolving rapidly. In this Review, we discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of MVD, focusing on the <b>combinations</b> of <b>valve</b> pathologies that are most often encountered in clinical practice.

30|$|Here, {{we report}} a 50 -year-old DCM patient with severe {{symptoms}} {{of heart failure}} with severe MR and treat by the <b>combination</b> of mitral <b>valve</b> replacement (MVR) and autologous myoblast sheet transplantation and have achieved long-term survival with functional preservation.|$|R
50|$|A {{relay valve}} is an {{air-operated}} valve typically used in air brake systems to remotely control the brakes {{at the rear}} of a heavy truck or semi-trailer in a tractor-trailer <b>combination.</b> Relay <b>valves</b> are necessary in heavy trucks in order to speed-up rear-brake application and release, since air takes longer to travel {{to the rear of the}} vehicle than the front of the vehicle, where the front service brakes, foot-valve, parking-control valve, and trailer-supply valve (if applicable) are located.|$|R
50|$|Bag and <b>valve</b> <b>combinations</b> {{can also}} be {{attached}} to an alternate airway adjunct, instead of to the mask. For example, it can be attached to an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway. Small heat and moisture exchangers, or humidifying / bacterial filters, can be used.|$|R
50|$|The Valvetronic {{system is}} a BMW {{variable}} valve lift system which, in <b>combination</b> with variable <b>valve</b> timing, allows infinite adjustment of the intake valve timing and duration. The system claims to improve fuel economy and emissions, and negates {{the need for a}} throttle body in regular use.|$|R
5|$|Yoke valves {{are rated}} between 200 and 240 bar, and {{there does not}} appear to be any {{mechanical}} design detail preventing connection between any yoke fittings, though some older yoke clamps will not fit over the popular 232/240 bar <b>combination</b> DIN/yoke cylinder <b>valve</b> as the yoke is too narrow.|$|R
50|$|The <b>combination</b> {{throttle}} <b>valve</b> {{connected to}} check valve is called one way flow control valve, while air passes from one direction to other the check valve {{will not allow}} the air flow (As the check valve allows flow only in one direction) while through the restricted way of throttle compressed air flow takes place. While the air comes out from other way both the ways of throttle {{as well as the}} check valve opens to pass the compressed air therefore the piston moment in one direction can be controlled.|$|R
5000|$|Kulindroplax {{is about}} 2 cm wide and 4 cm long. It {{is the first}} known mollusk showing an {{unambiguous}} <b>combination</b> of <b>valves,</b> or exterior shells, and a worm-like body. It bears seven similar, unarticulated valves, with a shorter head valve and a taller caudal one, lacking ornaments and also several densely packed, 1-2 mm long [...] It has no discernible foot, and the radula is not preserved. A gill array is present, along with a respiratory cavity opening posteriorly. These features make it more reminiscent of caudofoveate aplacophorans.|$|R
50|$|However, {{with both}} variable- and constant-flow systems, fully {{automatic}} balancing {{can enhance the}} performance of the HVAC system, eliminating any problems caused by high or excessive system pressures, including noise from the valves and, ultimately, poor control of room temperature. The way the system is balanced will also {{have a major impact on}} energy usage, by minimising pumping costs. In variable-flow systems the use of <b>combination</b> <b>valves,</b> when fitted with a 0 to 10 V, 3 point or thermal motor, integrates the three functions of motorised control valve, differential pressure control valve and a double-regulating valve commissioning set into one product. Applications for this type of product include the control of fan-coil units, chilled beams and air-handling units in variable-volume heating and cooling systems and the control of secondary flow on plate heat exchangers. This integrated approach significantly reduces installation and commissioning costs, since the three control functions are specifically matched to ensure optimum system performance and only one valve has to be mounted in the system instead of three. The problem of high and varying pressure drops across traditional 2-port control valves is also effectively eliminated, ensuring a control-valve authority of 100%. It also saves on space, an important concern in, for example, air handling unit installations where the available plant room space for valve installation is often severely restricted.|$|R
25|$|A core {{standard}} valve layout {{based on}} the action of three valves had become almost universal by (at latest) 1864 as witnessed by Arban's Method published in that year. The effect of a particular <b>combination</b> of <b>valves</b> {{may be seen in}} the table below. This table is correct for the core 3-valve layout on almost any modern valved brass instrument. The most common four-valve layout is a superset of the well-established 3-valve layout and is noted in the table, despite the exposition of four-valve and also five-valve systems (the latter used on the tuba) being incomplete in this article.|$|R

40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2006 The goal of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} ductile valve for a {{surgical}} sheath, which will be used primarily for non-invasive surgical procedures utilizing the femoral artery as an entry point. Procedures that enter through the major arteries, such as the femoral artery, are becoming more common and larger sheaths, to be used for these procedures, are also needed. It is of interest to develop a new <b>valve</b> or a <b>combination</b> of <b>valves</b> that will provide a suitable seal between the sheath, guide wire, and surgical tools so that blood loss will not occur through the sheath during the procedure...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{radially}} inbound pumping by the event-triggered {{addition of}} water to on-board stored baking powder in <b>combination</b> with <b>valving</b> by an immiscible, high-specific weight liquid on a centrifugal microfluidic platform. This technology allows making efficient use of precious real estate {{near the center of}} rotation by enabling the placement of early sample preparation steps as well as reagent reservoirs at the spacious, high-field region on the perimeter of the disc-shaped rotor. This way the number of process steps and assays that can be integrated on these of this “Lab-on-a-Disc” (LoaD) cartridge can be significantly enhanced while maintaining minimum requirements on the intrinsically simple, spindle-motor based instrumentation...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{trumpets}} {{have three}} (or infrequently four) piston valves, {{each of which}} increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (2 semitones), the second valve by a half step (1 semitone), and the third valve by one-and-a-half steps (3 semitones). When a fourth valve is present, as with some piccolo trumpets, it usually lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (5 semitones). Used singly and in <b>combination</b> these <b>valves</b> make the instrument fully chromatic, i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of classical music. For {{more information about the}} different types of valves, see Brass instrument valves.|$|R
25|$|In {{instruments}} with {{a fourth}} valve, such as tubas, euphoniums, piccolo trumpets, etc. that valve lowers the pitch by a perfect fourth; this {{is used to}} compensate for the sharpness of the <b>valve</b> <b>combinations</b> 1-3 and 1-2-3 (4 replaces 1-3, 2-4 replaces 1-2-3). All three normal valves may be used in addition to the fourth to increase the instrument's range downwards by a perfect fourth, although with increasingly severe intonation problems.|$|R
50|$|The fourth valve is used {{in place}} of {{combinations}} {{of the first and}} third valves, and the second and fourth used in combination are used in place of the first three <b>valves</b> in <b>combination.</b> The fourth <b>valve</b> can be tuned to lower the pitch of the main tube accurately by five semitones, and thus its use corrects the main problem of combinations being too sharp. By using the fourth valve by itself to replace the first and third combination, or the fourth and second valves in place of the first, second and third <b>valve</b> <b>combinations,</b> the notes requiring these fingerings are more in tune. The fourth <b>valve</b> used in <b>combination</b> with, rather than instead of, the first three valves fills in the missing notes in the bottom octave allowing the player to play chromatically down to the fundamental pitch of the instrument. For the reason given in the preceding paragraph some of these notes will tend to be sharp and must by 'lipped' into tune by the player.|$|R
50|$|Falset is the {{latitude}} for a brasswind player's pitch-control of a harmonic by adjusting lip or air pressure. While only just sufficient in {{middle and high}} registers to allow for intonation adjustment, this latitude becomes very wide in the low register in the flattening direction. Without this ability for adjustment, the conventional system of three valves would be problematic owing to the sharpness of certain <b>valve</b> <b>combinations.</b> Previously also falset referred to falsetto.|$|R
40|$|Inability {{to speak}} during {{mechanical}} ventilation (MV) increases psycho-emotional distress during ICU treat-ment [1]. Although relevant for all ICU patients, this problem becomes more prominent {{in patients with}} a prolonged weaning period. One way to enable speech in tracheotomised patients during the weaning period is to alternate MV with time-limited trials of cuff-deflated spontaneous breathing in <b>combination</b> a speaking <b>valve.</b> However, not all patients tol-erate such interruptions of MV [2]. Although not commonly used, M...|$|R
50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, {{variable valve timing}} (VVT) {{is the process of}} altering the timing of a valve lift event, and is often used to improve performance, fuel economy or emissions. It is increasingly being used in <b>combination</b> with variable <b>valve</b> lift systems. There are many ways in which this can be achieved, ranging from mechanical devices to electro-hydraulic and camless systems. Increasingly strict emissions regulations are causing many automotive manufacturers to use VVT systems.|$|R
40|$|Endocarditis {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of brucellosis {{but it is the}} main cause of the mortality in this disease. The accepted treatment for Brucella endocarditis (BE) is a <b>combination</b> of <b>valve</b> replacement and antibiotics. Conservative antibiotic treatment alone is not recommended by most of the authors as it is considered ineffective and increase the risk of fatality. In our litera-ture search, we found 14 adult patients with BE treated only with antibiotics with a favorable outcome. In this report, we described a patient treated with antibiotics alone and reviewed the literature. Depending on the data from the growing literature and our patient we suggest that in selected patients with BE who do not have congestive heart failure, valvular destruction, abscess formation, or a prosthetic valve, conservative antibiotic treatment may be a valid alter...|$|R
50|$|The valves add tubing to {{the main}} tube of the instrument, thus {{lowering}} its fundamental pitch. The first valve lowers the pitch by a whole step (two semitones), the second valve by a semitone, and the third valve by three semitones. Used in <b>combination,</b> the <b>valve</b> tubing is too short and the resulting pitch tends to be sharp. For example, a BB tuba becomes (in effect) an A tuba when the first valve is depressed. The third valve is long enough to lower the pitch of a BB tuba by three semitones, {{but it is not}} long enough to lower the pitch of an A tuba by three semitones. Thus, the first and third <b>valves</b> used in <b>combination</b> lower the pitch by something just short of five semitones, and the first three <b>valves</b> used in <b>combination</b> are nearly a quarter tone sharp.|$|R
40|$|Over the years, many {{surgical}} {{methods have}} evolved {{for the treatment}} of ascending aortic aneurysm in <b>combination</b> with aortic <b>valve</b> regurgitation; however, precise guidelines for optimal surgical techniques for varying presentations have not been defined. We describe the use of a stentless porcine bioprosthesis (Medtronic Freestyle) in a patient with an ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic regurgitation. We used the complete root replacement method, and anastomosed a Dacron graft (Hemashield) between the bioprosthetic valve and the native aorta to replace the distal part of the aneurysm...|$|R
50|$|Today, {{music for}} the horn is {{typically}} written in F and sounds a perfect fifth lower than written. The limitations on {{the range of the}} instrument are primarily governed by the available <b>valve</b> <b>combinations</b> for the first four octaves of the overtone series and after that by the ability of the player to control the pitch through their air supply and embouchure. The typical written ranges for the horn start at either the F immediately below the bass clef or the C an octave below middle A.|$|R
25|$|Damaged {{valves and}} endocardium {{contribute}} to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged part of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as part of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This <b>combination</b> of damaged <b>valves,</b> bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis.|$|R
25|$|Some modern flugelhorns {{feature a}} fourth valve that lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (similar {{to the fourth}} valve on some euphoniums, tubas, and piccolo trumpets, or the trigger on trombones).

More often, however, players use the fourth valve {{in place of the}} first and third <b>valve</b> <b>combination,</b> which is {{somewhat}} sharp (compensated for on trumpets and cornets and some three-valve flugelhorns by an easily-movable slide for the first or third valve).|$|R

40|$|Hysteresis and {{nonlinearity}} {{exist in}} most valves that are utilized in building HVAC systems, {{such as in}} cooling or heating coil valves. The hysteresis mainly comes from the manufacturing clearance in an actuator gearbox and nonlinearity in the variation of the regulated flow with respect to control signal originates from <b>valve</b> design. The <b>combination</b> of <b>valve</b> hysteresis and nonlinearity poses significant difficulties in obtaining a satisfactory control performance when utilizing a conventional PI controller. This paper presents experimental testing results {{of a set of}} valves in an operating HVAC system serving an office building. The test valves include VAV reheat coil and AHU cooling coil valves provided by two main-stream manufacturers. Open-loop experiments were carried out {{that can be used to}} analyze the valve performance in terms of hysteresis and nonlinearity. Valve closed-loop performance was also investigated and the results showed that valves with significant hysteresis and nonlinear characteristics could lead to unsatisfactory supply air or zone air temperature controls with severe temperature oscillation and control chattering. ...|$|R
