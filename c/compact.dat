The influence of <b>compacted</b> layers or pans on plant growth and development, although much studied, is not clearly understood. This greenhouse experiment evaluated {{the influence of}} uniformly <b>compacted</b> soil and thin layers of <b>compacted</b> soil placed at various depths on early growth of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Artificially <b>compacted</b> soil [Alliance silt loam, Aridic Argiustoll (Eluviated Brown Chernozem); A horizon] profiles were constructed in polyvinyl chloride tubes of 150 -mm diameter by 350 mm long. Treatments were: (1) uniformly noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3) soil; (2) uniformly <b>compacted</b> (bulk density 1. 80 Mg m- 1) soil; (3) a <b>compacted</b> (bulk density 1. 80 Mg m- 3) soil layer at 100 - to 120 -mm depth with the remaining soil noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3); or (4) a <b>compacted</b> (bulk density 1. 80 Mg m- 3) soil layer at 180 - to 200 -mm depth with the remaining soil noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3). Generally, winter wheat grown in cores that were uniformly <b>compacted</b> or <b>compacted</b> in the upper layer responded similarly. Plant height, {{at the end of}} the experiment (32 d after planting), for the uniformly <b>compacted</b> and upper <b>compacted</b> layer treatments was 280 mm, compared to 323 mm for the control (uniformly noncompacted). Leaf area development was similar to the response indicated for plant height throughout the growth period. Root mass and length tended to be less in layered or <b>compacted</b> soil than in noncompacted soil. Roots accumulated within or immediately above <b>compacted</b> soil layers.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} <b>compacted</b> and reconstituted soils in terms of microstructure, and hydraulic and mechanical response. It is commonly assumed that reconstituted and <b>compacted</b> soils exhibit a fundamentally different behaviour due to different microstructures. However, the variety of pore size distributions observed in both <b>compacted</b> and reconstituted/natural soils suggests that the boundary between <b>compacted</b> and reconstituted states is more blurred. In the paper, an attempt is made to recognize similarities and differences between <b>compacted</b> and reconstitutes states based on a number of recent experimental studies where the microstructure and the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils in <b>compacted</b> and reconstituted states have been investigated.

40|$|Yttria-doped zirconia/ruthenia powders {{were made}} by co-precipitation. The {{calcined}} powders were <b>compacted</b> into green <b>compacts</b> using standard pressing techniques such as isostatical compaction compared to explosive compaction. Explosive compaction (EC) led to the highest density, but also to cracking of the <b>compacts.</b> The zirconia/ruthenia powders <b>compacted</b> by isostatical pressing could not be densified by pressureless sintering (58 %), but sinterforging these green <b>compacts</b> led to dense <b>compacts</b> (96 %), which showed large-scale phase separation between the yttria-doped zirconia and ruthenia phase. The explosively densified green <b>compacts</b> could be further densified to 92 % by pressureless sintering, without the occurrence of the large-scale phase separation that took place within the isostatically pressed (IP) and sinterforged (SF) samples. The microstructure of the explosively densified composites was more fine-grained and homogeneous. Thus, by tuning the green density of yttria-doped zirconia/ruthenia <b>compacts</b> the phase separation after sintering can be tuned. This phase separation largely determines the electrical properties of these materials, which means that these electrical properties will be tunable as well...|$|R

40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, earthworms {{are often}} observed to burrow through <b>compacted</b> soil layers, {{leading to the}} general assumption that these animals {{play a significant role}} in regenerating <b>compacted</b> soils in agricultural plots. To demonstrate this role under field conditions, the abundance of earthworm macropores inside <b>compacted</b> zones was estimated on plots under reduced (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Then, different types of <b>compacted</b> zones typically found in CT (plough pan and <b>compacted</b> clods) and RT plots (<b>compacted</b> volume under wheel tracks) were experimentally simulated in wooden boxes, buried in the field and inoculated with different earthworm species. After 6 weeks of incubation, the number of macropores inside the <b>compacted</b> zones was examined. Field observations showed that approximately 10 % and 30 % of the <b>compacted</b> zones were colonised by at least one macropore in CT and RT plots, respectively. A significantly greater number of anecics was found in RT plots, but we could not conclude that this ecological type of earthworm plays a more major role in the regeneration process in these plots since there were fewer <b>compacted</b> zones and these covered a smaller area in CT. The semi-field experiment provided evidence that earthworm-mediated regeneration of <b>compacted</b> zones is possible and its nature varies between ecological types of earthworm. Lumbricus terrestris, which makes individual burrows that are vertical and deep, was the main species to cross through the plough pan. The other three earthworm species (Aporrectodea giardi, A. caliginosa and A. rosea) did burrow inside the other types of <b>compacted</b> zones (“wheel tracks” and “compacted clods”). In every case, however, macropore density was far greater in non-compacted zones, illustrating that avoidance of <b>compacted</b> soil by earthworms is important and should be taken into account when extrapolating results from laboratory studies...|$|R
