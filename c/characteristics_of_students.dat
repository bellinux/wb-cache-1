40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> engagement in a local public university. Student engagement refers {{to the concept of}} “students learn from what they do in college” and has been in literature for more than 70 years. A survey form adapted from College Student Experience Questionnaire (CSEQ) was distributed to a total of 64 first and second year students. This study employed descriptive research design as to address the research objectives, namely to identify the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> engagement and to differentiate student background <b>characteristics,</b> including year <b>of</b> study and gender, <b>of</b> <b>student</b> engagement based on five indices. The results of the study indicated that students scored high intermediate on the level <b>of</b> <b>student</b> engagement. Further investigation on the five indices <b>of</b> <b>student</b> engagement revealed that students rated highest on “life-long learning” index, followed by the indices of “active learning”, “cooperation among students”, “experience with diversity” and lastly was “student-faculty interaction” index. While comparing the student engagement and its indices across year of study and gender, the empirical study revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} on year of study. However, females showed significantly more engagement than males. The same result applied for “active learning” and “experience with diversity” indices. As a result, some suggestions have been given to address the issues raised as to further enhance the “student-faculty interaction” and the solutions for relatively low engagement <b>of</b> male <b>students...</b>|$|R
