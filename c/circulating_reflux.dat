50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the liquid collected in a vessel is known as reflux drum which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as overhead reflux, and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as <b>circulating</b> <b>reflux,</b> and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene draw plate, the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the atmospheric distillation column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors. Residual oil present at the bottom of the column is known as reduced crude oil (RCO). The temperature of the stream at the bottom is 340 °C-350 °C, which is below the cracking temperature of oil.|$|E
40|$|Polyaluminocarbosilanes (PACS) with {{different}} Al contents were synthesized by reacting liquid polyearbosilane(LPCS) with aluminum acetylacetonate[Al(AcAc) (3) ]. Compared with those reported in literatures, this route {{is considered to}} be more convenient and safer since no <b>circulating</b> <b>reflux</b> is needed. It was shown that the composition and structure of LPCS heated and kept at the synthesis temperature of PACS remained fairly stable. The chemical elemental analysis results of PACS indicated that through this route the Al contents were almost fully introduced into PACS from Al(AcAc) (3), and with the increasing of Al contents, the O contents also increased. Furthermore, the formation of AlO(4), AlO(5) and AlO(6) was confirmed by (27) Al MAS NMR results. On the base of the structure analysis it was suggested that LPCS reacted with Al(AcAc) (3) by consuming Si-H bonds. Then Si-O-Al crosslinking bonds were formed, leading to the increases of the number average molecular weight and the polydispersion index in molecular weight with the increase of Al contents in PACS...|$|E
