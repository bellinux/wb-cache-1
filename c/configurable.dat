5|$|Windows 10 adds native game {{recording}} and screenshot capture ability using the newly introduced game bar. Users {{can also have}} the OS continuously record gameplay in the background, which, then, allows the user to save the last few, user <b>configurable,</b> moments of gameplay to the hard disk.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Unix File System, {{which is}} {{typically}} the default file system on BSDs, DragonFly BSD supports HAMMER file system. It was developed specifically for DragonFly BSD {{to provide a}} feature-rich yet better designed analogue of the increasingly popular ZFS. HAMMER supports <b>configurable</b> file system history, snapshots, checksumming, data deduplication and other features typical for file systems of its kind.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Smartsheet started {{introducing}} closer integrations with Microsoft Office products, in part {{thanks to}} changes Microsoft was making in {{their products to}} work better with third-party software. In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login. Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook. In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a <b>configurable</b> dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.|$|E
25|$|Fully <b>configurable</b> and scriptable via Windows Management Instrumentation.|$|E
25|$|User <b>configurable</b> system cooling policy, {{minimum and}} maximum {{processor}} states.|$|E
25|$|Vertical {{synchronization}} is now <b>configurable.</b> You can configure these settings {{using the}} corresponding {{option in the}} virtual machine video configuration page.|$|E
25|$|A set of AArch64 {{load and}} store {{instructions}} {{that can provide}} memory access order that is limited to <b>configurable</b> address regions.|$|E
25|$|School Street Fields: Located off School Street near Route 2 {{is a large}} grass surface <b>configurable</b> {{to several}} multi-dimension playing fields.|$|E
25|$|Great Hill: Contains a large <b>configurable</b> field, {{a smaller}} single soccer field, and a playground. This {{is located in}} the front portion of the {{conservation}} area.|$|E
25|$|Most of arm's {{attributes}} are <b>configurable</b> {{through an}} optional armrc configuration file. It runs on any platform supported by curses including Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like variants.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{policies and procedures}} and access records, information technology documentation should also include a written record of all configuration settings on {{the components of the}} network because these components are complex, <b>configurable,</b> and always changing.|$|E
25|$|SRWare Iron is a {{freeware}} {{release of}} Chromium for Windows, macOS and Linux, offering both installable and portable versions. Iron disables certain <b>configurable</b> Chromium features that could share information with third parties {{as well as}} additional tracking features that Google adds to its Chrome browser.|$|E
25|$|Windows 10 Enterprise {{provides}} all {{the features}} of Windows 10 Pro, with additional features to assist with IT-based organizations, and is functionally equivalent to Windows 8.1 Enterprise. Windows 10 Enterprise is <b>configurable</b> on three branches, Current branch (CB), Current branch for business (CBB), and Insider Program.|$|E
25|$|The XPS print path can {{automatically}} calibrate color profile settings {{with those}} {{being used by}} the display subsystem. Conversely, XPS print drivers can express the <b>configurable</b> capabilities of the printer, by virtue of the XPS PrintCapabilities class, to enable more fine-grained control of print settings, tuned to the individual printing device.|$|E
25|$|At its launch, the Taurus was {{available}} in two models, the GL, which was the entry level/value model, and the LX, which was {{the top of the}} line model. The GL was basic, and didn't have many optional features, while the LX came with many standard features and was highly <b>configurable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{higher level}} APIs {{such as the}} Waveform-Audio Interface (waveXxx functions) and DirectSound use shared mode, which results in {{pre-mixed}} PCM audio that {{is sent to the}} driver in a single format (in terms of sample rate, bit depth and channel count). This format is <b>configurable</b> by the end user through Control Panel.|$|E
25|$|Some {{traditional}} nested RAID configurations, such as RAID51 (a {{mirror of}} RAID5 groups), are not <b>configurable</b> in ZFS. Vdevs {{can only be}} composed of raw disks or files, not other vdevs. However, a ZFS pool effectively creates a stripe (RAID0) across its vdevs, so {{the equivalent of a}} RAID50 or RAID60 is common.|$|E
25|$|Using AnyLogic model {{development}} environment, developers can upload their {{models to}} AnyLogic Cloud {{and set up}} sharable web dashboards to work with models online. These dashboards can contain <b>configurable</b> input parameters and output data {{in the form of}} charts and graphs. Model users can set input data on the dashboard screen, run the model, and analyze the output.|$|E
25|$|TLS {{supports}} {{many different}} methods for exchanging keys, encrypting data, and authenticating message integrity (see Algorithm below). As a result, secure configuration of TLS involves many <b>configurable</b> parameters, {{and not all}} choices provide all of the privacy-related properties described in the list above (see authentication and key exchange table, cipher security table, and data integrity table).|$|E
25|$|Air circuit breakersRated current up to 6,300 A {{and higher}} for {{generator}} circuit breakers. Trip characteristics are often fully adjustable including <b>configurable</b> trip thresholds and delays. Usually electronically controlled, though some models are microprocessor controlled via an integral electronic trip unit. Often used for main power distribution in large industrial plant, where the breakers {{are arranged in}} draw-out enclosures for ease of maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The Alcubierre {{drive or}} Alcubierre warp drive (or Alcubierre metric, {{referring}} to metric tensor) is a speculative idea {{based on a}} solution of Einstein's field equations in general relativity as proposed by Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre, by which a spacecraft could achieve apparent faster-than-light travel if a <b>configurable</b> energy-density field {{lower than that of}} vacuum (that is, negative mass) could be created.|$|E
25|$|The Java {{platform}} {{has become}} the main development platform for many software tools and platforms that are produced by third-party software groups (commercial, open source and hybrid) and are used as <b>configurable</b> (rather than programmable) tools by companies. Examples in this category include Web servers, application servers, databases, enterprise service buses, business process management (BPM) tools and content management systems.|$|E
25|$|Ditto blocks: <b>Configurable</b> data {{replication}} per filesystem, with zero, {{one or two}} extra copies requested per write for user data, and with that same base number of copies plus one or two for metadata (according to metadata importance). If the pool has several devices, ZFS tries to replicate over different devices. Ditto blocks are primarily an additional protection against corrupted sectors, not against total disk failure.|$|E
25|$|Boeing 717 Business Express was a {{proposed}} corporate version of 717-200, unveiled at the EBACE Convention in Geneva, Switzerland in May 2003. <b>Configurable</b> for 40 to 80 passengers in first and/or business class interior (typically, 60 passengers with seat pitch of 52 inch, 132cm). Maximum range in HGW configuration with auxiliary fuel and 60 passengers was 3,140 nmi (5,815km; 3,613mi). The version complements BBJ family.|$|E
25|$|The June 28, 2015 {{failure of}} Falcon 9 Flight 19 meant a delay {{of at least}} six months on the Falcon 9 launches. On February 3, 2016, Lockheed Martin {{announced}} that it had been awarded an order for JCSAT-17 for delivery in 2019. Because of its <b>configurable</b> S band payload, it would be able to redirect capacity to concentrate on disaster relief efforts or other high-volume events.|$|E
25|$|Nathaniel Allen Recreation Area (NARA): Originally {{named the}} North Acton Recreation Area, NARA's name was changed in 2012 to honor an Acton {{resident}} who {{was awarded the}} Medal of Honor for his actions in the Civil War. It contains a softball diamond, a large <b>configurable</b> field used for multiple sports, a swimming pond, playground, a performance stage with amphitheater, and a handi-cap accessible softball diamond with a synthetic surface- The Joseph Lalli Miracle Field. NARA is also used for the town's Fourth of July Fireworks Celebration.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} featured raised seating in {{the second}} row, a hard point on the passenger’s side of the center console to provide support {{for a range of}} optional accessories (e.g., an optional shopping bag holder), rear-seat table, waste basket and cargo net integrated into the rear seat backs. Standard interior features included a coat hook integrated {{into the side of the}} front passenger's headrest, glove compartment with pen holder and toll card, <b>configurable</b> center console and rear seating with a two position backrests — one position favoring cargo and the other favoring comfort.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the {{abandoned}} East Race canal in South Bend, whose outlets were {{both at the}} river, was converted into the East Race Waterway, North America's first artificial whitewater waterway and {{the first of four}} in the United States. Locals first proposed in 1973 that the 19th-century waterway be reopened; construction began in August 1982 and the East Race reopened on June 29, 1984. Through the use of movable barriers and obstacles, the East Race provides a <b>configurable</b> whitewater course for recreational and competitive canoeing, kayaking and rafting.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Super FX, its {{designers}} were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose <b>configurable</b> microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.|$|E
25|$|Xorro {{is a new}} slot {{using an}} {{industry}} standard PCIe ×8 form factor to give access to the 'Xena' I/O. This will be the route to Xena's 64 I/O lines, which are dynamically <b>configurable</b> as input, output, or bidirectional. 'Xorro' will allow bridging Xena to external hardware for control purposes, to internal systems, or to other XCore processors. This last point is worth more exploration; XCore is a parallel processing architecture; more XCores can be chained together if more computing power is required.. Reference boards have been made with up to 256 cores, offering a theoretical 102400 MIPS.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} and most discussed security features included with Windows Vista include User Account Control, Kernel Patch Protection, BitLocker Drive Encryption, Mandatory Integrity Control, Digital Rights Management, TCP/IP stack security improvements, Address Space Layout Randomization and Encrypting File System and cryptography improvements. Additionally, Windows Vista includes a range of parental controls, which give owners of a computer a set of tools to limit what other accounts on a computer can do, and an improved Windows Firewall which supports both inbound and outbound packet filtering, IPv6 connection filtering and more detailed <b>configurable</b> rules and policies.|$|E
25|$|As direct-contact {{membrane}} keyboards became popular, {{the available}} rollover of keys was optimized {{by analyzing the}} most common key sequences and placing these keys {{so that they do}} not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or <b>configurable</b> layouts in different games.|$|E
25|$|One {{criticism}} of the original Galactic Civilizations was its lack of ship design features. New ships simply became available when the appropriate technology was researched to create them. Galactic Civilizations II includes a highly <b>configurable</b> 3D ship design editor. Technological research now unlocks components that players use {{to create their own}} custom ship designs in 3D from a variety of hull bases. The users' ships are rendered in real time and shown on both the main screen and in fleet battles. Other than component selection, the design of a ship has no effect on its combat abilities, since tactical combat is not a feature of the game.|$|E
25|$|Mario Kart Wii {{features}} multiple game modes: Grand Prix, Time Trials, Versus, and Battle. All modes support single-player gameplay; Versus and Battle support local multiplayer {{for up to}} four players, with {{or without}} computer-controlled players. In Grand Prix, the player participates in four three-lap races {{from one of the}} eight selectable cups against eleven opponents. The player is awarded points {{at the end of each}} race based on their ranking. The total number of points collected determines the player's overall rank. Versus mode is similar to Grand Prix, but the presented courses and items may be <b>configurable.</b> In Time Trials, the player must quickly complete the race in the fastest time possible— there are no opponents or items except for three Mushrooms given at the start of each race. The player can compete against a ghost character, which mimics a player's movements from an earlier race. Ghost data can be saved in the Wii console memory.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is <b>configurable</b> through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E
