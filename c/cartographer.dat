He also sponsored historical studies, including the collection, cataloging and copying of historical manuscripts.

40|$|The ancient Greek <b>cartographers</b> {{have been}} among the world’s most significant. Their work is usually briefly {{mentioned}} in Cartography and Geography courses, all over the world, and only some of them, such as Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Skylax, Strabo, Ipparkhos and Ekataios are widely known. However, these are not the only ones. Yet, there have been other ancient Greek <b>cartographers</b> also, less well known, or almost unknown to modern <b>cartographers,</b> whose works may appear astonishing by modern standards. Yet, considering their work is important nowadays, given the increasing significance of the convergence among geosciences, history and archaeology. Oddly enough though, the high importance of the ideas of ancient <b>cartographers</b> and their achievements has rarely ever been studied from within a modern perspective, either in Greece or in other countries. For instance, it has passed unnoticed in Cartography courses the fact that ancient maps also served for managing the networks of ancient cities, instead of depicting precisely defined boundaries among states (a situation very much resembling today’s networks of cities). Consequently, this paper aims to: a) give an overview of the main achievements of the most important ancient Greek <b>cartographers,</b> b) present the significance of these achievements in the context o...|$|R

Triangulus Septentrionalis was a name used to distinguish it from Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius excised three faint stars—6, 10 and 12 Trianguli—to form the new constellation of Triangulum Minus in his 1690 Firmamentum Sobiescianum, renaming the original as Triangulum Majus. The smaller constellation was not recognised by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) when the constellations were established in the 1920s.|$|E
