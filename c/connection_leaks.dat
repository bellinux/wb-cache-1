Closed in summer sun, the compartment temperature can exceed 20 K above ambient, without cooling using vapour compression usually referred to as air-conditioning. The fuel consumption due to air-conditioning is usually less than that due to opening the windows above 60 km/hour. Car air-conditioners use a simple reversed Rankine cycle (ASHRAE 1995). Power is most efciently available if the compressor is bolted to the motor and driven through a belt and electrically operated clutch. A shaft seal is necessary which leaks. Flexible hoses must carry vapour to and from the compressor to reduce transmission of motor vibrations to the chassis and avoid uctuating stresses causing fatigue fracture.

40|$|The {{functioning}} of an essential facility, {{such as a}} hospital, after an earthquake relies heavily on proper {{functioning of}} its nonstructural components such as fire suppression and water distribution systems, elevators and medical equipment. In recent earthquakes, nonstructural components in hospitals and medical buildings have suffered {{a large amount of}} damage, which resulted in a significant reduction of the functionality of the facilities. This paper presents findings from shake table experiments on typical hospital piping systems. A welded and a threaded piping system were tested with and without seismic restraints. The research identifies the capacity characteristics of a hospital piping system with and without bracings as well as the system’s weak points.

40|$|When {{establishing}} oil wells, pipe sections {{are connected}} {{by means of}} threaded couplings. In an effort to minimize the possibility of failure by jumpout, standard buttress connections were introduced. Part of their strength is directly acquired {{as a result of}} radial interference during make-up. This paper discusses the results of a numerical study evaluating the effect of make-up on the performance of a standard 4. 5 inch API buttress connection when axial tensile force is applied. In order to characterize the structural performance, the load distribution along the coupling length is evaluated, combined with a parameter defining thread separation. The latter is indicative for jumpout and the tendency of creating a leak path throughout the thread helix. From the results it is clear that relative axial displacement within the coupling occurs, even when made up, because of an initial clearance among the load and stab flanks. This clearance may cause a <b>connection</b> to <b>leak</b> through the thread helix when available thread compound cannot heal this leak path.

The samples were analyzed for total coliform, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and enterococci to identify locations with high bacterial concentrations or hot spots. Then, a tracer study was conducted near a hot spot to determine if pathways exist between the sewer system and the stormwater drains. It was shown that sewers near building <b>connections</b> can <b>leak</b> into the stormwater drains, probably through preferential pathways such as concrete cracks or soil macropores.

The DB 606 engine had first been introduced on the Heinkel He 119 and later used on other aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 261 where they functioned as intended, but the extremely tight cowlings on the He 177A led to considerable problems, the most common being in-flight engine fires and engine overheating. There were several reasons for the flammability of the DB 606 engine as installed in the Greif's engine nacelle accommodations, one of which was the common [...] "central" [...] exhaust manifold, serving a total of 12 cylinders, on the two inner cylinder banks of the twinned DB 601 component engines making up a DB 606.

When the pilot throttled back there was a tendency for the mechanical fuel injection pump on each component DB 601 engine to [...] "lag" [...] in their response in such situations, and deliver more fuel than was required by the engine, in addition to which the fuel injection pump <b>connections</b> often <b>leaked.</b> To reduce the aircraft's weight no firewall had been provided, and the aft end of each DB 606 was fitted so close to the main spar — with the rear two-thirds of the component powerplants' engine blocks being placed behind the wing's leading edge — that there was insufficient space for the fuel/oil fluid lines and electrical harnesses. The engines' exterior surfaces within the cowlings were frequently saturated with fuel and oil from <b>leaking</b> <b>connections.</b> At high altitude the oil tended to foam due to a badly designed oil pump, reducing its lubricating qualities. Insufficient lubrication resulted in the disintegration of the connecting rod bearings, resulting in the conrods sometimes bursting through either one of the component engine crankcases and puncturing the oil tanks, the contents of which would pour on to the often-overheated central exhaust pipe collector. The tightly packed nature of the [...] "power system" [...] engine installations on the He 177A, with the extreme rearwards location of the component engines in their nacelles, also led to poor maintenance access as well as very poor ventilation.

After traveling around the world helping facilities turn these exchangers from chronic leakers (from internal tubesheet and external diaphragm and B style shell leaks) {{to one of the}} most reliable heat exchangers in the plant, it is very clear to me that manufacturers, engineers and mechanics struggle to correctly understand the interactions between gaskets, internal pressure, the two circles of external push bolts that are part of A style exchangers and all the internal parts. Some manufactuers have given up on trying to make these <b>connections</b> operate <b>leak</b> free, and prefer to weld in the tubesheets and diaphragms. This significantly adds to the cost and time needed to open and close these exchangers, as special equipment is needed to machine out the parts and weld them back together again. There are a handful of equipment manufacturers that build these exchangers, and while there are differences from one manufacturer to the next, once the basic design is understood, the reader should be able understand that they are all basically the same when it comes to the few critical steps that must be followed when opening and closing these exchangers.

40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} ''WW'' threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This work was a continuation of testing performed by SES as reported in August of 1999. The connection design tested was identified as ''WW''. The samples were all integral (no coupled connections) and contained a wedge thread form with 90 {sup o} flank angles relative to the pipe centerline. The wedge thread form is a variable width thread that primarily engages on the flanks. This thread form provides very high torque capacity and good stabbing ability and makeup. The test procedure selected {{for one of the}} samples was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections, which is currently going through the ISO acceptance process. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test procedure was performed with one sample. Four samples were tested to failure. Table 1 contains a summary of the tasks performed by SES. The project started with the delivery of test samples by Mr. Watts. Pipe from the previous round of tests was used for the new samples. Figure 1 shows the structural and sealing results relative to the pipe body. Sample 1 was used to determine the torque capacity of the connection. Torque was applied to the capacity of SES's equipment which was 28, 424 ft-lbs. From this, an initial recommended torque range of 7, 200 to 8, 800 ft-lbs. was selected. The sample was disassembled and while there was no galling observed in the threads, the end of the pin had collapsed inward. Sample 2 received three makeups. Breakouts 1 and 2 also had collapsing of the pin end, with no thread galling. From these make/breaks, it was decided {{to reduce the amount of}} lubricant applied to the connection by applying it to the box or pin only and reducing the amount applied. Samples 3 and 4 received one makeup only. Sample 5 initially received two make/breaks to test for galling resistance before final makeup, No galling was observed. Later, three additional make/breaks were performed with no pin end collapse and galling over 1 / 2 a thread occurring on one of the breakouts. During the make/break tests, the stabbing and hand tight makeup of the WW connection was found to be very easy and trouble free. There was no tendency to crossthread, even when stabbed at an angle, and it screwed together very smoothly up to hand tight. During power tight makeup, there was no heat generated in the box (as checked by hand contact) and no jerkiness associated with any of the makeups or breakouts. Sample 2 was tested in pure compression. The maximum load obtained was 1, 051 kips and the connection was beginning to significantly deform as the sample buckled. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 3 was capped-end pressure tested to failure. The capped-end yield pressure of the pipe was 16, 572 psi and the sample began to leak at 12, 000 psi. Sample 4 was tested in pure tension. The maximum load obtained was 978 kips and the connection failed by fracture at the pin critical section. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 5 was tested in combined tension/compression and internal gas pressure. The sample was assembled, setup and tested four times. The first time was with a torque of 7, 298 ft-lbs and the <b>connection</b> <b>leaked</b> halfway to ISO Load Point 2 with loads of 693 kips and 4, 312 psi. The second time the torque was increased to 14, 488 ft-lbs and a leak occurred at 849 kips and 9, 400 psi, which was ISO Load Point 2. The third time the makeup torque was again increased, to 20, 456 ft-lbs, and a leak occurred at 716 kips and 11, 342 psi, ISO Load Point 4. The fourth test was with the same torque as before, 20, 617 ft-lbs, and the connection successfully tested up to load step 56, ISO Load Point 6 (second round) before leaking at 354 kips and 11, 876 psi. At this point, time and funds prevented additional testing to be performed...|$|R
40|$|A Professional Project Report {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resouces Program, University of New Mexico. Whereas the demand for safe drinking water increases {{and the availability of}} fresh drinking water decreases, it becomes evermore important for water systems to make effective use of the drinking water they produce. As populations grow water systems are increasingly in search of new water sources; however, as the competition for new water sources increases, water systems must look at how water is lost in their distribution systems. Water that never makes it to the consumer, or for which no revenue is received is known as “water loss,” and is used to represent the water that a water system produces, puts into the distribution system, but then is lost as a result of poor record keeping, illegal <b>connections</b> or <b>leaks</b> in the distribution system. Water loss can be divided into two groups, apparent and real losses. These losses are important to consider because water loss results in a water system having to pump, treat, and deliver additional water to meet customer’s demands and reduces revenues, which negatively impact both the water source and the water system. Water systems can better track their real losses by switching from the outdated and ambiguous method of reporting water loss as “Unaccounted-for Water,” and adopt the new and tested method of the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI). This project will evaluate the ILI for 30 water systems in New Mexico as a means to display its usefulness in assessing water system efficiencies. Water loss due to leaks from the distribution systems are called real losses; the losses are costly and can affect a water system’s ability to provide water to its customers. There are a number of leak detection methods and strategies available to water systems to reduce real losses. However, leak detection is a costly process and only identifies some fraction of the real losses, thus there is a tradeoff between the benefit of reduced real losses and the cost of leak detection. This project developed a process that assist water systems in allocating resources to leak detection activities called the Economic Leakage Level, which is based on the value of the water lost, the faction of real losses recovered using leak detection, and the cost of leak detection method. The process was illustrated by applying it to selected community water systems in New Mexico...|$|R

The input motion of 1 g was amplified to almost 2. 6 g {{at the top of the}} braced and unbraced piping systems. There was no significant damage to the piping system due to the high displacements and accelerations. Two of the eleven braces failed at the highest input excitation, the 2 ” diameter vertical hanger rods failed during the unbraced tests, and a flanged <b>connection</b> began to <b>leak</b> during a pushover test. Preliminary results show that the braces limited the displacements, but they did not significantly reduce the accelerations of the system. Background The functioning of an essential facility, such as a hospital, after an earthquake relies heavily on proper functioning of its nonstructural components such as fire suppression and water distribution systems, elevators and medical equipment. In recent earthquakes, nonstructural components in hospitals and medical buildings have suffered a large amount of damage, which resulted in a significant reduction of the functionality of the facilities. The 1971 San Fernando Earthquake caused severe damage to many hospitals and medical facilities. As a result of that damage, four of the 11 damaged medical facilities in the area had to be evacuated (Wasilewski 1998). Due to this unacceptable performance, the State of California passed the Hospital Seismic Safety Act, which required that medical facilities be designed and built to remain operational after an earthquake event (Ayres and Phillips, 1998). The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) was charged with certifying that bracing components installed in California hospitals met a certain level of strength...|$|R
5000|$|A {{video was}} leaked to TMZ in October 2012 which showed Nicki Minaj erupting in a tirade against Mariah Carey during the {{audition}} in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was also claimed that Minaj was heard saying off-camera, [...] "If I had a gun, I would shoot that bitch." [...] Minaj however denied {{that she had}} made the threat. [...] Ryan Seacrest said that the dispute [...] "went a little too far", while Keith Urban jokingly said [...] "I was the UN", and the feud elicited a comment from President Barack Obama that Carey and Minaj will [...] "sort it out". In an interview with Barbara Walters on The View aired on January 7, 2013, Carey said that, due to Minaj's threats, it [...] "felt like an unsafe work environment," [...] and claimed that she had boosted her personal security. Minaj has stated that Barbara Walters never attempted to contact her for comment regarding her side of the story. Carey also said that she has since made up with Minaj. Carey's then husband Nick Cannon claimed that the feud was used by American Idol producers to generate interest and ratings. Producer Nigel Lythgoe however denied that he was responsible for leaking the video or that it was a publicity stunt, and said that he had no plans to use the footage in advance of or during the season. [...] Fox executive Mike Darnell described the buzz due to the feud as being great, but later said that [...] "a rogue crew member probably took the video and sent it to TMZ. We did not encourage it." [...] The aired episode of the Charlotte audition did not show the tirade and what was shown appeared to have no real linear <b>connection</b> with the <b>leaked</b> footage.|$|R
40|$|Premium tubular {{connections}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as rotary shouldered thread connections), are commonly used to complete a production string in a well in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These are attached to threaded pipe ends using a bucking unit and a pre-defined torque value. The torque value is calculated using the coefficient of friction between the two surfaces and a well-known torque equation. The existing technology relies on the coefficient of friction approximated by interpolation, or extrapolation, of empirical data. This may become inaccurate due to the variation of surface finish and/or operation conditions and lead to over or under torque of the connections. A failure such as a <b>leaking</b> <b>connection</b> can result in high financial implications as well as environmental ones. The project was aimed to develop a bench test which adequately represents field conditions. This benchmark test was then used to investigate how CoF was affected by changes in the main variables so that these variables can be better controlled. Therefore, a propriety laboratory test system was developed to allow measurements of friction and galling under these conditions and to examine the sensitivity of friction to initial surface topography, contact pressure, sliding speed and lubricant type. Samples were produced to represent variables which were possible within the oil and gas industry. A set of data was produced to identify the different frictional values for each combination of variables. The results showed that the initial surface topography and the burnishing in repeated sliding have significant effects on friction. iv In order to understand the correlation between the effects of initial surface roughness and burnishing during the sliding process on the coefficient of friction, a theoretical approach was taken to produce a mathematical model whichutilised the data from the laboratory testing. This gave predictions of the wear, roughness and friction with sliding distance. This data was then compared to the physical testing and found to be in line with the results. The results helped to understand how friction is related to external circumstances in the operation of premium tubular connections. Hunting Energy Service...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{moisture}} damages {{have been}} noticed in rendered, undrained stud walls. The design {{is built on}} the principle one-stage tightening which {{means that there is}} no air gap in the construction. The damages have occurred when water has permeated through the rendering in <b>leaking</b> <b>connections</b> and fittings for windows, doors, canopies, balconies, terraces and awnings. Behind the plaster carrier, which consists of either polystyrene or rigid mineral wool, plasterboard has often been used as a wind protection barrier. In many cases the wind protection barrier and the underlying wooden studs have been exposed to mould and in some cases even rot. It has been shown that damp in the structure is difficult to dry out. The aim of the thesis has been to examine how the energy consumption is affected when this type of construction is damp, partly because energy is required to dry up damp, partly because the insulation ability for a material decreases when it is affected by moisture. Previous research and relevant literature has been used in this thesis, to provide: A comprehensive picture of the problem, an explanation for the calculations used and an understanding of the conclusions drawn. The energy consumption has been calculated for 1 m 2 wall area on two types of wall designs. The calculations have been performed in both dry and damp condition. To calculate the energy consumption in damp condition, three different types of calculation models have been used in three different ways. Since no measurements have been made, the calculations are to some extent based on assumed values. The amount of damp that have entered the structure has, according to the calculation models used, been shown to produce small differences in energy consumption compared to the dry structure. The main problem for these types of walls seems instead to be the growth of microorganisms. Nevertheless, the microorganisms seem not to have affected the indoor environment in any significant manner...|$|R
