5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these <b>counteract</b> gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to <b>counteract</b> both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E

5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to <b>counteract</b> the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or <b>counteract</b> males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to <b>counteract</b> heat loss.|$|E
40|$|It is {{not known}} how {{dopamine}} antagonists, L-NAME, L-arginine and stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC- 157 would interact with lower esophageal and pyloric sphincter pressure in rats (LES, PS). We revealed a fall in pressure within LES and PS as an indicative class effect of peripherally and centrally acting antipsihotics. In addition, given intraperitoneally alone and/or combined, all agents once daily through seven days, last application 24 h before pressure assessment, BPC- 157 mostly dose-dependently, <b>counteracts</b> all pressure falls induced by all antipsihotics; L-NAME induced a marked fall in both sphincters and worsened haloperidol and domperidone-failure; Larginine induced a smaller fall in both sphincters, but reversed L-NAME effect, and partly <b>counteracted</b> dopamine antagonists failure effect (haloperidol (LES)) as well as worsening of both haloperidol (LES) and domperidone (PS) - failure induced by L-NAME. Additional <b>counteracting</b> effect of BPC- 157 was general, including all pressure decrease otherwise induced by L-NAME or Larginine, as well as complete counteraction of both spihnicters pressure worsening of haloperidol and domperidone (PS) -failure otherwise induced by L-NAME administration. In conclusion, <b>counteracting</b> potential of BPC- 157 (as well as <b>counteracting</b> potential of L-arginine) can be against the conditions of dopamine receptor blockade and NOS-blockade...|$|R
