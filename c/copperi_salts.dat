Indirect cathodic-stripping voltammetric methods of determining TMT at sub-ppb levels in standard solutions are reported here. These methods might prove suitable for the determination of TMT in effluent at levels lower than is currently possible. TMT can be accumulated and determined indirectly at pH 9. 0 as its mercury salt down to sub-ppb levels. Accumulation is made at 0 V and the mercury TMT reduction peak is at - 0. 47 V. Alternatively, by adding nickel(II), TMT can be determined optimally at pH 7. 8, using the catalytic nickel peak at - 0. 73 V and accumulating between - 0. 10 and - 0. 60 V: at this pH the HgTMT peak at - 0. 47 V is small.

40|$|Highly {{reactive}} copper {{was prepared}} by the lithium naphthalide reductions of various copper(I) salt/ligand complexes. In particular, the reductions of copper(I) halide/phosphine complexes resulted {{in the production of}} active copper which reacted with a variety of organic halides to form highly functionalized, stable organocopper species. The nature and reactivity of the active copper was found to be highly dependent upon the choice of <b>copper(I)</b> <b>salt</b> and particularly upon the choice of ligand (phosphine). Organocopper species containing ester, nitrile, chloride, and even remote ketone and epoxide groups were prepared directly from the corresponding organic iodides or bromides. These highly functionalized copper reagents were utilized in a variety of reactions including conjugate additions to unsaturated carbonyl systems, epoxide-opening reactions, reactions with acid chlorides to form ketones, and cross-coupling reactions with other organic halides. Additionally, the copper was used to effect homocoupling of various organic halides under very mild conditions. ^ Active nickel was used effectively for the room temperature generation of o-xylylene intermediates from the corresponding α,α'-dihalo-o-xylene species. These highly reactive intermediates were efficiently trapped in situ with electron-deficient olefins, yielding substituted 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene cycloadducts in moderate to good yields. Isoindene and 2, 3 -dihydronaphthalene intermediates were generated and trapped in an analogous fashion to give the one- or two-carbon bridged cycloadducts, respectively. ^ Active zinc was used for preparing organozinc halide species directly from organic halides. The organic halides could contain considerable functionality such as ester, nitrile, and chloride groups. The organozinc halides were prepared readily from organic iodides and even bromides at room temperature. Significantly, functionalized arylzinc halides were prepared directly from the corresponding aryl halides. The organozinc halides underwent facile transmetallation with copper(I) cyanide complexes, generating highly functionalized cuprate species.

30|$|Despite of toxicity, <b>copper(I)</b> <b>salts</b> {{have been}} less used as {{catalyst}} for this cyclization {{in view of the}} fact that they are thermodynamically instable and the formation of undesired alkyne-alkyne coupling products which is sometimes observed in their existence (Tornøe et al. 2002; Aucagne and Leigh 2006). On the other hand, these homogeneous processes suffer from one or more disadvantages such as difficulty in separation of the product from the reaction medium. These homogenous catalysts are usually non-recyclable, have low regioselectivity and long reaction times. However, nitrogen or phosphorus-based ligands have been shown to protect the metal center from oxidation and disproportionation, while enhancing its catalytic activity (Gerard et al. 2006; Marra et al. 2008; Broggi et al. 2008).

40|$|The thesis reports new {{applications}} of monoorganocopper compounds, RCu(LiI), and iodotrimethylsilane in conjugate additions. The present investigation demonstrates conjugate addition of alkylcopper compounds and iodotrimethylsilane to reactive. alpha.,. beta. -unsaturated ketones and esters. The reactions are fast {{and in many}} cases proceed at - 78 °C. Conjugate addition of alkylcopper compounds and iodotrimethylsilane at - 78 °C to allylic. alpha.,. beta. -unsaturated esters gives allylic silyl ketene acetals, which are essentially allyl vinyl ethers. These undergo Claisen rearrangement at room temperature to afford diastereomeric mixtures of. gamma.,. delta. -unsaturated carboxylic acids after hydrolytic work-up. Monoorganocopper compounds, RCu(LiI), and iodotrimethylsilane give mainly addition via the s-trans conformation of an allylic acrylate. Lithium diorganocuprates, alone or in the presence of chlorotrimethylsilane, give mainly reaction via the s-cis conformation. In strong contrast, lithium diorganocuprates in the presence of bromo- or iodotrimethylsilane give mainly reaction via the s-trans conformation. The ratio of diastereomers in the organocuprate reactions is strongly influenced by the type of halotrimethylsilane used as additive. Copper acetylides, normally unreactive in conjugate additions, readily add to reactive. alpha.,. beta. -unsaturated ketones and aldehydes in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane. The preferred conformation of the substrate is important for the reactivity. Enones with fixed or preferred s-trans geometries give high yields of product. The conjugate addition of copper acetylides requires the presence of LiI in the reaction mixture. Tetrahydrofuran as solvent gives faster reactions than diethyl ether or dichloromethane. Several different additives were investigated and iodotrimethylsilane was superior to other additives such as trimethylsilyl triflate or bromotrimethylsilane. The choice of <b>copper(I)</b> <b>salt</b> used for the preparation of the acetylides is important and copper iodide gives far better results than copper bromide or copper cyanide. The present results further support coordination of iodide to copper as mechanistically important in iodotrimethylsilane-promoted conjugate additions of organocopper compounds...|$|R
