25|$|Behavior {{therapy is}} a rich tradition. It is well {{researched}} with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict {{the way we think}} and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysis. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as <b>contingency</b> <b>management</b> and exposure therapy have come from this tradition.|$|E

2500|$|A 2011 {{review of}} studies {{suggested}} that naltrexone, when taken by mouth, was not superior to placebo or to no medication, {{nor was it}} superior to benzodiazepine or buprenorphine. [...] Because of the poor quality of the reviewed studies, the authors found insufficient evidence to support naltrexone therapy when taken by mouth for an opioid use disorder. [...] While some patients do well with the oral formulation, it must be taken daily, and a patient whose cravings become overwhelming can obtain opioid intoxication simply by skipping a dose. Due to this issue, the usefulness of oral naltrexone in opioid use disorders {{is limited by the}} low retention in treatment. [...] Oral naltrexone remains an ideal treatment only for {{a small part of the}} opioid-addicted population, usually those with a stable social situation and motivation.

Making automation decisions {{is one of several}} decision areas that emerge as a consequence of choosing a certain type of production system.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the autonomy is an essential step inside the roadmap {{for the development of}} UAV systems. This capability would allow performing some of mission functionalities with better efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover it allows mitigating some of the problems related to the latency in the operational control of the system, reducing the need for high performance communication infrastructure and increasing the robustness of the system against intentional or unintentional interference. Some of the key technologies required to support the {{implementation of}} the autonomy in the UAV have reached an adequate maturity levels allowing the development of demonstration on ground and in flight, essential before the migration of such solutions to products. The roadmap for such demonstrations cannot forget the implications of the UAV autonomy from the air traffic control and certification authorities and Customer community. One of the key questions is which level of autonomy is acceptable by air traffic authority and by type certification requirements. Also in the military field similar issues are important for the {{implementation of the}} appropriate level of autonomy: the trade-off is between the level of autonomy that is desirable for an effective use of the weapon system and the one that is compatible with the legal constraints and need for compliance with the Rule of Engagement. Alenia Aeronautica is working in addressing these issues from the conceptual and technologies demonstration point of views. Indeed, Alenia Aeronautica is sustaining both a number of applied researches in UAV autonomy and UAV demonstrator programs, like Sky-X and Neuron. The intended demonstrations will include: automatic takeoff and landing, initially with landing aids, for evolving to a full autonomous TOL after an autonomous taxi, autonomous mission re-planning, <b>contingency</b> <b>managements</b> and mission automation. Further demonstration will address the capabilities of performing a full autonomous attack phase that include: autonomous target detection, recognition and classification, autonomous attack plan definition along with re-planning, and ordnance release management in coordination with GCS for human consent when needed...|$|R

Boundary stretching SOCIAL NETWORK <b>CONTINGENCY,</b> SYMBOLIC <b>MANAGEMENT,</b> AND BOUNDARY STRETCHING A firmâ€™s structural position within corporate networks may affect the extent to which it engages in boundary stretching practices. Since social norms support low CEO compensation, offering high CEO compensation in China can be seen as a boundary stretching practice. Setting up a compensation committee (CC) may be viewed as a form of symbolic management in China. We argue that firms operating within central corporate network positions opt to pay higher CEO compensation without engaging in symbolic management. On the other hand, firms operating in structural hole positions tend to either pay lower CEO compensation or use CCs as a symbolic management tool in order to pay higher CEO compensation. Our hypotheses are largely supported based on 7, 618 firm-year observations in China. Keywords...|$|R
