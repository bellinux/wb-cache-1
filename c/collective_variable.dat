40|$|A {{computational}} {{technique is}} proposed which combines the string method with a sampling technique to determine minimum free energy paths.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the ϕ 4 kink {{scattering}} from a spatially localized PT-symmetric defect {{and the effect}} of the kink’s internal mode (IM) is discussed. It is demonstrated that if a kink hits the defect from the gain side, a noticeable IM is excited, while for the kink coming from the opposite direction the mode excitation is much weaker. This asymmetry is a principal finding of the present work. Similar to the case of the sine-Gordon kink studied earlier, it is found that the ϕ 4 kink approaching the defect from the gain side always passes through the defect, while in the opposite case it must have sufficiently large initial velocity, otherwise it is trapped by the loss region. It is found that for the kink with IM the critical velocity is smaller, meaning that the kink bearing IM can pass more easily through the loss region. This feature, namely the “increased transparency” of the defect as regards the motion of the kink in the presence of IM is the second key finding of the present work. A two degree of freedom <b>collective</b> <b>variable</b> model offered recently by one of the co-authors is shown to be capable of reproducing both principal findings of the present work.
