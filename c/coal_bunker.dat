5|$|Two {{years later}} Hogue became the boys' {{training}} ship for the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. She {{was reduced to}} reserve at Devonport in 1908 and then assigned to the reserve Third Fleet at the Nore the next year. On 26 November 1909 a <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> explosion killed two crewmen. The ship received a lengthy refit at Chatham Dockyard in 1912–13 and {{was assigned to the}} 7th Cruiser Squadron shortly after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler and <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> {{caused the}} locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 Great Britain was {{converted}} into a sailing ship to transport bulk coal. She made her final voyage in 1886, after loading up with coal and leaving Penarth Dock for Panama on 8 February. After a fire on board en-route she was found on arrival at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to be damaged beyond economic repair. She was sold to the Falkland Islands Company and used, afloat, as a storage hulk (<b>coal</b> <b>bunker)</b> until 1937, when she was towed to Sparrow Cove, 3.5miles from Port Stanley, scuttled and abandoned. As a bunker, she coaled the South Atlantic fleet that defeated Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee's fleet in the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Second World War, some of her iron was scavenged to repair , one of the Royal Navy ships that fought the Graf Spee and was badly damaged during the Battle of the River Plate.|$|E

25|$|A {{steam shovel}} {{is a large}} steam-powered {{excavating}} machine designed for lifting and moving material such as rock and soil, typically in the mining industry. The steam shovel is composed of a bucket, boom and 'dipper stick', boiler, water tank and <b>coal</b> <b>bunker,</b> a steam engine, and a winch. The steam shovel was invented in 1835 by William Otis, later receiving a patent for his invention on February 24, 1839.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} torpedo damage alone, {{striking the}} ship on the starboard <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> of boiler room no. 1, {{would probably have}} sunk the ship without a second explosion. This first blast was enough to cause, on its own, serious off-centre flooding, although the sinking would possibly have been slower. The deficiencies of the ship's original watertight bulkhead design exacerbated the situation, as did the many portholes which had been left open for ventilation.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 the Dutch Limburgsche Tramweg Maatschappij (LTM) 'Limburg tramway company' {{ordered a}} single {{standard}} gauge Garratt, numbered LTM 51, from Henschel (Germany) with builder's number 22063. This design was slightly different {{in that the}} <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> was located on the boiler frame and both machines only holding the watertanks. More importantly, {{it was the only}} Garratt with inside cylinders. The wheel arrangement was C+C (0-6-0+0-6-0). Due to abandonment of the line in 1938 the loc was sold to a metal merchant, who in turn sold it to an engineers' bureau, that sold it in 1941 to Germany. Further whereabouts of this machine are unknown, but it is presumed scrapped.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years there was an {{increase}} in the necessity of vegetal coal, as it was implanted siderurgical industries in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, causing the creation of <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers,</b> which represent a serious environmental problem. According to the Geography and Statistics Brazilian Institute (IBGE, 2007) the State was the Brazilian main producer of vegetal coal with was obtained from the material extracted from the vegetation. Believing in the concept that all the forest fire is a heat focus, but not all the heat focus is a forest fire, it was verified if there is a relation between <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers</b> and the data of heat focus (only registered if the temperature was higher than 470 C) caught in the ground surface by the sensors AVHRR, VAIN and MODIS, provided by the National Institute for Space Research - INPE, downloaded gratuitously. This data had been classified according to the sensor type and the period of the registration. Combining these data with the localization of the <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers,</b> using only one base, it was possible to relate the persistent heat focus and the <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers.</b> To sum up, it was shown {{that it is possible to}} monitor remotely this kind of activity.

25|$|Concerned {{that she}} was damaged and believing the Lady Elgin had gotten safely away, the Augusta made for Chicago. Aboard the Lady Elgin, Captain Wilson ordered that cattle and cargo be thrown {{overboard}} to lighten the load and raise the gaping hole in the Lady Elgin's port side above water level while the steward was down in the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> {{trying to stop the}} leak with mattresses. Captain Wilson ordered a lifeboat lowered on the starboard side to check the extent of the damage but it never regained the steamer. Within twenty minutes, the Lady Elgin broke apart, and all but the bow section rapidly sank. The night was lit up at intervals by flashes of lightning showing the scattered wreckage.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, 1911, Augustus Charles Kick, an {{experienced}} {{man who had}} served as Sechelts chief engineer from about March 4 to March 17, 1911, testified that her bilge pumps were inadequate and she tended to ship {{a lot of water}} when the engine was working, this was apparently the result of the loss of two of her propeller blades. The engineer considered Sechelt unstable unless she were well-ballasted, and if cargo were carried only on the main deck (instead the hold, which was entirely used for a <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> except for some ballast forward), in his opinion her instability would increase. The engineer testified that he had left Sechelt for this reason. Kick described the weather conditions {{on the day of the}} sinking, which he ascribed entirely to the vessel's instability.|$|E
25|$|These small 0-4-0 tank engines {{were and}} are the {{standard}} shunter locomotives of the system, built between 1927 and 1937 by the firm of Breda in Milan. They have short side tanks, a rear <b>coal</b> <b>bunker,</b> and a unified, oval dome containing the steam dome inside a larger sand dome. This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the sand dome, helped both to insulate the steam dome {{and to keep the}} sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder's plates adorn the domes. They utilise Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves and superheating, and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the fire remains unknown. Theories include that the fire {{was a result of}} {{spontaneous}} combustion in the ship's <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers,</b> which contained 130 tons of fuel.|$|R

25|$|In 1993, Dr. Robert Ballard, {{the famous}} {{explorer}} who discovered Titanic and Bismarck, conducted an in-depth {{exploration of the}} wreck of Lusitania. Ballard tried to confirm John Light's findings of a large hole {{on the port side}} of the wreck, and he didn't find anything. During his investigation, Ballard noted a large quantity of coal on the sea bed near the wreck, and after consulting an explosives expert advanced the theory of a coal dust explosion. He believed dust in the bunkers would have been thrown into the air by the vibration from the explosion; the resulting cloud would have been ignited by a spark, causing the second explosion. In the years since he first advanced this theory, {{it has been argued that}} this is nearly impossible. Critics of the theory say coal dust would have been too damp to have been stirred into the air by the torpedo impact in explosive concentrations; additionally, the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> where the torpedo struck would have been flooded almost immediately by seawater flowing through the damaged hull plates.|$|E
25|$|Wegner {{suggests}} {{that a combination of}} naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maines building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With {{an increase in the number}} of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maines explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.|$|E

Most {{associated}} with the class during this period was the LSWR passenger light sage green livery with purple-brown edging, creating panels of green. This was further lined in white and black with [...] "LSWR" [...] in gilt on the water tank sides, and the locomotive number on the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> sides. [...] The National Railway Museum has chosen a non-typical green for the livery on No 245.|$|E

500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} all Coronation Class tenders {{was that they}} were fitted with a steam-operated coal pusher to bring the coal down to the firing plate. When this was in {{operation}} a plume of steam could be seen rising from the rear face of the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> backwall. This equipment greatly helped the locomotive's fireman to meet the high demands for power during the non-stop run of [...] between London Euston and Glasgow Central, when operating the Coronation Scot train.|$|E
500|$|The {{engine rooms}} on these ships were {{lengthened}} {{to accommodate the}} larger Parsons steam turbines, which meant the after boiler room had to be eliminated. The remaining boiler rooms were widened by {{to do this and}} maintain adequate underwater and <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> protection, the ships were made [...] beamier than the Delawares. Funnel spacing was therefore closer than in the Delawares. Also, the wider beam increased the vessels' metacentric height, a quality in which the Delawares were notably deficient. This improvement allowed the Floridas to accommodate their larger medium-caliber guns without any real penalty in topweight.|$|E
500|$|The {{rebuilding}} programme {{that followed}} the derailment of K class No. A800 [...] "River Cray" [...] at Sevenoaks began at Ashford works in June 1928. The work involved in converting a 2-6-4 tank engine to a 2-6-0 tender locomotive included {{the removal of the}} side water tanks, rear <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> and trailing axles, although the 6ft (1.83 m) driving wheels, right-hand drive and N class–type boiler were retained. The aesthetic aspects inherited from the K class were the former Midland Railway engineer James Clayton’s contributions to the design, creating a simple, functional locomotive similar to the N class.|$|E
50|$|Other {{changes to}} various {{locomotives}} over their long lives were Belpaire fireboxes, enlarged <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers,</b> and even superheaters. One or two were fitted with spark-arresting chimneys. 21 were fitted for working autotrains.|$|R
