25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> have an engaged stance. The first is {{about the fact that}} there is climate change and that it is human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
500|$|Politicians {{generally}} reacted along party lines, with Senator Mundt stating, [...] "Nixon's {{speech is}} complete vindication {{against one of}} the most vicious smears in American history." [...] Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico stated, [...] "I wish he had talked about the 18,000 bucks—not the puppy dog... Suppose someone sets up a fund to buy my meals. I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> didn't get one red cent of the money." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, {{the song}} {{continued}} to draw commentary from listeners. [...] By now Kaukonen was offering {{the view that}} the [...] "blood-stained banders" [...] of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. He continued to find meaning in performing [...] "Good Shepherd" [...] and other songs like it that celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching, saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture: [...] "I guess you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> loved the Bible without even knowing it. The spiritual message is always uplifting – it's a good thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{an awful}} bore. What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> {{was not going to}} {{pronounce}} judgment against the poor devil. I daresay he was good enough for Mr. Jawstock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{got your}} letter, but I could not answer it. What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> wish {{it had not}} been so;--but it is done. You have chosen for yourself, and I will not reproach you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never had}} such a flow of {{language}} in my life; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> anything <b>I</b> wanted to.|$|R
500|$|The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{never would}} have {{amounted}} to anything in the theatre if it hadn't been for Orson Welles," [...] Lee recalled. [...] "The way I looked at acting, it was interesting and it was certainly better than going hungry. But I didn't have a serious approach to it until … I bumped into Orson Welles. He was putting on a Federal Theatre production of Macbeth with Negro players and, somehow, I won the part of Banquo. He rehearsed us for six solid months, but when the play finally went on before an audience, it was right—and {{it was a wonderful}} sensation, knowing it was right. Suddenly, the theatre became important to me. I had a respect for it, for what it <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> had the ambition—I caught it from Orson Welles—to work like mad and be a convincing actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a period}} of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: [...] "You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold myself by two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, and got my money back. But for this once, I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> never was bought {{in my life and}} this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often I must have been accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the {{disappointed}} betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ".|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{what the}} devil <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> don't know their names; {{never even heard}} them. But the eldest is the eldest, all the world over. Perhaps <b>I</b> ought to <b>say</b> the youngest, seeing that I am only a railway contractor." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, Sir, what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> {{knew well}} enough {{that there was}} not a tittle of solid {{evidence}} against the man Nicolet, nor had I the power to move the police of His Majesty the King from their decision. In my heart of hearts I had the firm conviction that the ginger-polled ruffian knew all about Carissimo and all about the present whereabouts of that rascal Theodore. But what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> Sir? What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? ...|$|R
60|$|Once more, what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> {{saw from}} my father's hurried and alarmed manner, {{that nothing could}} vex him so much as failing in the point he had {{determined}} to carry, and once more intimated my readiness to do my best, under every disadvantage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not on your life," [...] quoth Jones. [...] "They can't prove it. You <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> said so, and I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> didn't say so, and {{a hell of}} a {{lot that}} {{evidence}} would amount to with a jury." ...|$|E
6000|$|He cast {{around the}} {{apartment}} his usual sharp, quick glance of observation, and, advancing to Nigel, said--"My lord, I wish I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{was happy to}} see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I've been to {{the camp}} since I left you last night. I couldn't stand with you--there--before all our friends, till I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> had no other man's money in my pockets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> something; <b>I</b> can't." [...] Lady Caroline {{spoke in}} a harsh, {{grunting}} voice that few people had ever heard her use.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Mr. Woodcourt," [...] said I, [...] "before we part to-night, {{something}} is left {{for me to}} <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it as <b>I</b> wish--I never shall--but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{what could}} I do? I could not deny Dora {{and my own}} heart. When he told me I had better take a week to {{consider}} {{of what he had}} said, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't take a week, yet how could I fail to know that no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, madam," [...] said Stead, {{with much}} stumbling. [...] "But I {{have seen him}} in Bristol. My Lady Elmwood knew of me, and Sir George Elmwood too, and the Dean <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was honest." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Locker {{took off}} his hat, and rubbed his head. [...] "No," [...] said he, [...] "I didn't; but I wish I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> did. But that's impossible. I presume I am right in {{assuming}} this impossibility?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then Aunt Lily {{said all}} manner of cross things about giving notes between us. I was so glad I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> didn't, for you know I didn't give it to you, and it wasn't between us.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{would do}} myself the pleasure; {{and then he}} still waited a moment to say that his brother Arthur could not recover from his dismay at his {{greeting}} to Miss Torwood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say,</b> exactly. <b>I</b> presume, one thing, he's {{only been}} here summers till this year, since his wife died, {{and he never}} did {{have much to do}} with the place, before." ...|$|R
60|$|I was silent. What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> Her {{argument}} was indeed unanswerable.|$|R
60|$|AUSTIN. I am rejoiced to hear it. I wish I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was as {{pleased with}} my journey, Menteith. This {{is the first}} time I ever came to the Wells in another person's carriage; Duke or not, it shall be the last, Menteith.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was stupid}} of me," [...] she said, [...] "but I {{have been so}} unhappy. It's over now--but I was wretched. And there was nothing I <b>could</b> <b>say....</b> <b>I</b> prayed.... It isn't the poverty I feared ever, but the disgrace. Now--I'm happy. I'm happy again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{liked you}} {{the better for}} it,' said John, pleasantly; 'only I don't know {{whether it would be}} a safe precedent. It has made us feel well acquainted, I hope. Don't make a {{stranger}} of me,' he continued, 'don't forget that we are brother and sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "G'way," [...] responded Mary. [...] "If {{you knew}} {{some of the}} words <b>I</b> <b>COULD</b> <b>say</b> if <b>I</b> liked you wouldn't make such a fuss over darn. And you know very well I hain't ever told any lies since I come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you do, Mr. Sabin?" [...] he said. [...] "Don't {{remember}} me, I daresay. Met {{you once}} or twice {{last time you were}} in London. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> was glad to see you here again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to be said,--nothing which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say,</b> which <b>I</b> would not <b>say</b> at the town cross if it were possible. As to this money, I do not know whether I stole it or whether I did not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, master; but you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{was carried}} {{off as a}} slave, when I was a boy. You see, I do speak a little Arabic, and could {{understand}} simple orders; just as any slave boy would, {{if he had been}} eight or ten years among the Arabs." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had nothing}} to say. At least I had nothing {{in my mind that}} I <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> had an {{undefined}} impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate, but I could hardly have explained why even to myself. Or, if to myself, certainly not to anybody else.|$|E
6000|$|The Dervish whined to Said, [...] "Thou didst not tarry while I prayed. Beware {{the fire}} that Eblis burned," [...] But Saadi coldly thus returned, [...] "Once with manlike love and fear I gave thee for an hour my ear, I kept the sun and stars at bay, And love, for words thy tongue <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> cannot sell my heaven again For all that rattles in thy brain." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine his <b>saying.</b> <b>I</b> heard the strong ring {{of his voice}} through her mocking mimicry.|$|R
5000|$|Françoise {{disliked the}} convent life, but she grew to love {{one of the}} nuns there, Sister Céleste, who persuaded Françoise to take her First Communion. [...] "I loved her more than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to sacrifice myself for her service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Suppose,' I said, 'that Mr. Williamson Green should {{wake up and}} see me; what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> {{explain my}} situation?' ...|$|R
