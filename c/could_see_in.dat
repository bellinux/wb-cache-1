5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

Lynceus, named for the lynx because he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the dark, spied Castor hiding in the tree. Idas and Lynceus {{immediately}} understood what was happening. Idas, furious, ambushed Castor, fatally wounding him with a blow from his spear—but not before Castor called out to warn Pollux. In the ensuing brawl, Pollux killed Lynceus. As Idas was about to kill Pollux, Zeus, who had been watching from Mt. Olympus, hurled a thunderbolt, killing Idas and saving his son.|$|E
500|$|The 42 {{men of the}} 2nd Platoon, B Company, 23rd Infantry held outpost {{positions}} on seven hills covering a [...] front along the east bank of the Naktong north of Pugong-ni. Across the river in the rice paddies they <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon of August 31, two large groups of North Korean soldiers. Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them. Just before dark, the platoon saw a column of North Koreans {{come out of the}} hills and proceed toward the river. They immediately reported to the battalion command post. The artillery forward observer, who estimated the column at 2,000 people, thought they were refugees. Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column, reducing its number. However the North Koreans continued their advance.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Chamberlain damaged his {{reputation}} in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated. In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> hindsight how the interview {{could have been}} instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier {{was asked about the}} most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position." ...|$|E

500|$|Statistically, Chamberlain {{was again}} outstanding, posting 34.7 ppg and 22.9 rpg {{for the second}} half of the season. After {{defeating}} the Cincinnati Royals led by Oscar Robertson in the 1965 NBA Playoffs, the Sixers met Chamberlain's familiar rival, the Boston Celtics. The press called it an even matchup in all positions, even at center, where Bill Russell was expected to give Chamberlain a tough battle. Indeed, the two teams split the first six games, and because of the better season record, the last game was held in the Celtics' Boston Garden. In that Game 7, both centers were marvelous: Chamberlain scored 30 points and 32 rebounds, and Russell logged 16 points, 27 rebounds and eight assists. In the final minute, Chamberlain hit two clutch free throws and slam dunked on Russell, bringing Boston's lead down to 110–109 with five seconds left. Russell botched the inbounds pass, hitting a guy-wire over the backboard and giving the ball back to the Sixers. Coach Schayes called timeout, and decided to run the last play over Hal Greer rather than Chamberlain, because he feared the Celtics would intentionally foul him because he was a poor foul shooter. But when Greer attempted to inbound the ball, John Havlicek stole it to preserve the Celtics' lead. For the fifth time in seven years, Russell's team deprived Chamberlain of the title. According to Chamberlain, that was the time that people started calling him [...] "loser". Additionally, in an April 1965 issue of Sports Illustrated Chamberlain conducted an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League" [...] where he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> hindsight how the interview was instrumental in damaging his public image.|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak of TVLine complimented [...] "Max Adler's {{surprisingly}} nuanced performance" [...] as Karofsky in [...] "Born This Way": [...] "The complex play {{of emotions}} in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously {{came out to}} him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous." [...] He added, [...] "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky." [...] VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode {{and the next one}} where the character appears, [...] "Prom Queen". He said in his review of the latter, [...] "the characters I'm most interested in at this point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people {{trying to do the right}} thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic praised Karofsky's [...] "tearful apology to Kurt" [...] in that episode as being [...] "painful and poignant", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... ou <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping Glee will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.|$|E

[...] That was very same day when Vladimir Putin replaced Nikolay Kovalyov as the Director of the Federal Security Service, with help from Berezovsky Litvinenko reported to Putin on corruption in the FSB, but Putin was unimpressed. Litvinenko said to his wife after the meeting: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> his eyes that he hated me." [...] Litvinenko said later {{that he was doing}} an investigation of Uzbek drug barons who received protection from the FSB, and Putin tried to stall the investigation to save his reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Property {{damage was}} {{particularly}} severe: Allan Andreson, a CBC reporter, described that the [...] "marsh {{was just like}} one vast lake. All you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the distance {{sticking out of the}} water was the steeple of the Springdale Christian Reformed Church." [...] Highway 400, which bisects the marsh, was under five to ten feet [...] of water. The majority of the properties in the marsh were inundated with water, and homes and their contents were either seriously damaged or completely destroyed. Many of these houses were contaminated by the flood, or the rotting vegetables (the crop was recently harvested), and became unfit for habitation. A few homes were taken off their foundations by the waters and floated around the marsh; one, the DePeuter residence, which contained the parents, twelve children and a cat, spent the night floating on the marsh for [...] As a result of the flooding, 3000 people were left homeless as [...] of the marsh became a lake.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{location}} in New York, executive producer Stephanie Savage said [...] "We were quickly told {{it would be}} too expensive, too complicated" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} series. She told it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park but they eventually filmed the series in New York. Savage explained their choice to film there: [...] "There's no New York City on TV, or there wasn't when we started making the pilot, except what you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We've never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people." [...] Schwartz added: [...] "What's funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn't about them. And I think they've probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show." [...] Many scenes were filmed in the Empire Hotel on the Upper West Side.|$|E

2500|$|Decisions {{were made}} by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Nothing, however, stopped jurors from talking informally among {{themselves}} during the voting procedure and juries could be unruly, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The voting procedure was public and transparent. Each heliast had received two votes, one [...] "not guilty" [...] and one [...] "guilty". Then the herald (κήρυξ) would, first, ask the heliasts {{if they wanted to}} submit any objections against the witnesses and, then, he would call them to cast their votes in two different amphoras, one of copper for the [...] "non-guilty" [...] votes and one of wood for the [...] "guilty" [...] votes. The voting was secret, since each juror had to cover the vote with his fingers, so that nobody <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> which amphora he threw it. In the civil cases the voting procedure was different, because the amphoras were as many as the litigant parties and the jurors had to vindicate one of them by casting their vote.|$|E
2500|$|Despite hearing heavy gunfire {{from the}} north, {{including}} distinct volleys at 4:20pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Benteen's apparent reluctance to reach Custer prompted later criticism {{that he had}} failed to follow orders. Around 5:00pm, Capt. Thomas Weir and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer. They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the [...] "Last Stand Hill" [...] at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill. The destruction of Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by Crazy Horse, White Bull, Hump, Chief Gall and others. Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing native attacks around Weir Ridge forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.|$|E
