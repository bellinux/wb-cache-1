5|$|In 2010, a team {{of doctors}} from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of {{training}} at the <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} SP-A1 to total SP-A has been {{correlated}} with lung disease (e.g. asthma, <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis)</b> and aging. Methylation of SFTPA1 promoter sequences {{has also been}} found in lung cancer tissue.|$|E
5|$|CASS4 {{has been}} {{reported}} to play a modifying role in <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> severity, progression and comorbid conditions. The CAS family member NEDD9 has also been shown to interact directly with AURKA (encoding Aurora-A kinase) to regulate cell cycle and ciliary resorption; it is possible that CASS4 may similarly interact with aurora-A kinase.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{disorders}} include <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> pulmonary hypoplasia (an incomplete {{development of}} the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. An azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency in SP-A {{levels is}} {{associated}} with infant respiratory distress syndrome in prematurely born infants with developmental insufficiency of surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs. Alterations of the relative levels of SP-A1 and SP-A2 {{have been found in}} BALF from patients with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> asthma, and infection.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis).</b> Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is more common in}} the winter, and should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of anaerobic organisms.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular moieties, it may be challenging to generate such an agent. However, CASS4 may ultimately be relevant in clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other types of cancer). At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as <b>Cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, {{and culture of the}} sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (CF), a {{progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E
5|$|An evasion {{strategy}} used {{by several}} pathogens {{to avoid the}} innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms {{to protect themselves from}} the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).|$|E
5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|CFTR, the {{transporter}} {{involved in}} the disease <b>Cystic</b> <b>Fibrosis,</b> is also considered part of this subfamily. <b>Cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> occurs upon mutation and loss of function of CFTR.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} and renowned CF programs in the city, the Saint Vincent's <b>Cystic</b> <b>Fibrosis</b> therapy program offered care for patients with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and attracted patients from around the region.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> genetic {{mutation}} known as delta-F508 in humans {{has been said}} to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis)</b> are more resistant to V. cholerae infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons of <b>cystic</b> <b>{{fibrosis}}</b> against non-cystic fibrosis airway {{epithelial cells}} shows that various miRNAs are differentially regulated {{in response to}} the disease. mir-126 is suspected {{to play a role in}} regulating the innate immune responses within <b>Cystic</b> <b>Fibrosis</b> affected lungs.|$|E
25|$|So far, no {{large-scale}} research {{involving the}} incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in adults with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> has been conducted. This is likely because {{the vast majority of}} people with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|In Europe E. dermatitidis {{tends to}} be {{associated}} with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> and is frequently found to have colonized the lungs of CF patients. In one study, E. dermatitidis could be isolated from 6.2% of <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> patients using erythritol-chloramphenicol agar culture dishes. Exophiala dermatitidis has also been reported as the etiological agent of lung infections causing pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|The large {{intestine}} also secretes K+ and Cl-. Chloride secretion increases in <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the CFTR gene, which is a chloride channel.|$|E
25|$|In 1955 {{he married}} Shirley Anne Webb. Their two {{children}} died in childhood from <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{no strong}} {{evidence}} that people with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> can prevent osteoporosis by increasing their intake of vitamin D. Bisphosphonates taken by mouth or intravenously {{can be used to}} improve the bone mineral density in people with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> When taking bisphosphates intravenously, adverse effects such as pain and flu-like symptoms can be an issue. The adverse effects of bisphosphates taken by mouth on the gastrointestinal tract are not known.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Addison's disease, {{pituitary}} insufficiency, or <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> {{sometimes have}} a hyper-sensitivity {{to the five}} primary tastes.|$|E
25|$|Bush is the honorary {{chairman}} of the Annual AT Jeb Bush Florida Golf Classic, a fundraiser that benefits the <b>Cystic</b> <b>Fibrosis</b> Foundation. He first {{became involved in the}} benefit after meeting with committee member Lawson Dutton, whose child suffered from <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Supporters raised more than 722,000 in 2014 at the , exceeding their goals in attendance and revenues raised. Since the event’s inception 19 years ago, the total revenue netted has reached over 7.478 million.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{completed}} {{on the effectiveness of}} introducing inhaled glutathione to people with <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> with mixed results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> transmembrane {{conductance}} regulator (CFTR) is a {{membrane protein}} and chloride channel in vertebrates that is encoded by the CFTR gene.|$|E
25|$|Some {{diseases}} are hereditary and run in families; others, such as infectious diseases, {{are caused by}} the environment. Other diseases come {{from a combination of}} genes and the environment. Genetic disorders are diseases that are caused by a single allele of a gene and are inherited in families. These include Huntington's disease, <b>Cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. <b>Cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> for example, is caused by mutations in a single gene called CFTR and is inherited as a recessive trait.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} lung diseases (panbronchiolitis, asthma, <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> bronchitis). Both doxycycline and minocycline {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} predisposing lung diseases—such as {{persistent}} asthma or <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (or rarer {{diseases such as}} chronic granulomatous disease or Hyper-IgE syndrome)—several factors lead to {{an increased risk of}} ABPA. These include immune factors (such as atopy or immunogenic HLA-restricted phenotypes), as well as genetic factors (such as CFTR gene mutations in both asthmatics and <b>cystic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> patients). By allowing Aspergillus spores to persist in pulmonary tissues, it permits successful germination which leads to hyphae growing in mucus plugs.|$|E
