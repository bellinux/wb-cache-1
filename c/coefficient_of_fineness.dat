The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320mm diameter. The middle turret and the vessel's central tower were eliminated.

To identify loci associated with wool production traits, we performed a genome-wide association study on a total of 765 Chinese Merino sheep (JunKen type) genotyped with 50 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the present study, five wool production traits were examined: fiber diameter, fiber diameter <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation, <b>fineness</b> dispersion, staple length and crimp. We detected 28 genome-wide significant SNPs for fiber diameter, fiber diameter <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation, <b>fineness</b> dispersion, and crimp trait in the Chinese Merino sheep. About 43 % of the significant SNP markers were located within known or predicted genes, including YWHAZ, KRTCAP 3, TSPEAR, PIK 3 R 4, KIF 16 B, PTPN 3, GPRC 5 A, DDX 47, TCF 9, TPTE 2, EPHA 5 and NBEA genes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash on expansion of fly ash-cement mortar in magnesium sulfate solution. Fly ash from the Mae Moh {{power plant in}} Thailand was classified in to three different levels <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> Blaine of 3215, 4440 and 5890 cm 2 /g with a median particle size of 25. 57, 7. 69, and 4. 81 microns, respectively. Fly ash at each level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> was used to replace Portland cement type I and type V at percentages of 0, 20, 30, and 40 by weight of the cementitious material, to cast mortar bars of 2. 5 x 2. 5 x 30 cm 3. Expansion of the fly ash-cement mortar bars, which were immersed in 5 % by weight of magnesium sulfate solution, were measured {{at the age of}} 1 to 540 days. The results showed that the replacement of Portland cement type I and type V by fly ash reduced expansion of the mortar bars. When the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> and same percent of replacement of fly ash were used in the mortar bars, the replacement of Portland cement type V by fly ash produced less expansion than that of Portland cement type I. For the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash, the mortar bars made with 40 % fly ash replacement had less expansion than those made with 20 and 30 % replacement. The mortar bars with 20 - 25 % replacement of fine fly ash (Blaine <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 4440 or 5890 cm 2 /g) and the mortar bars with 40 % replacement of original fly ash (Blain <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 3125 cm 2 /g) had the same expansion. The smaller particle size of fly ash not only reduced expansion of the fly ash-mortar bars but also produced higher strength activity index of mortar than the bigger particle size of fly ash. Therefore, very fine fly ash could be used effectively for reducing the expansion and improving sulfate resistance of mortar...|$|R

A total of 12 Corriedale lambs {{was used in this}} study. A few staples on the threes body regions were cut from each lamb on the day of docking, and the wool samples to be examined were taken from these staples. The samples were washed by immersing them in bath of ether, and were then mounted with balsam, and microscopically examined. The diameters of the wool fibres were subsepuently measured with an ocular, micrometer and then the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> variation of the degree <b>of</b> the fibre <b>fineness</b> were calculated. The results obtained are as follows; 1. In general, the mean diameter of the tail wool was greater than those of the shoulder and thigh wool in such early age as in dccking time of the Corriedale lamb. 2. In the early age of lamb, relatively high positive correlations of the degree of fibre finenss between the tail and shoulder and thigh wool were found and thus, {{it can be said that}} more the mean diameter of the tall wool greater, the more those of the shoulder and thigh wool greater. 3. Positive correlations of the variability of the degree <b>of</b> the fibre <b>fineness</b> were found between the tail and the shoulder and thigh wool, and especially between the tail and thigh wool, a high correlation of the variability of the degree <b>of</b> the fiber <b>fineness</b> was found. So it may be concluded that generally the more the variability of the degree <b>of</b> the fibre <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the tail wool greater, the more those of the shoulder and thigh wool greater, especially the variability of the degree <b>of</b> the fibre <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the thigh wool greater. 4.

The rate of hydration and most cement properties depend on the <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> the cement particles.

Research indicated that an increase in <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> cement slightly improves the workability of concrete mix, but its likely to have a detrimental effect on loss of workability as cement with a higher rate of hydration will loose workability more rapidly.
