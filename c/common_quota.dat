40|$|We study two {{generalised}} stable matching problems {{motivated by}} the current matching scheme used in the higher education sector in Hungary. The first problem {{is an extension of}} the College Admissions problem in which the colleges have lower quotas as well as the normal upper quotas.

The second problem is a different extension in which, as usual, individual colleges have upper quotas, but, in addition, certain bounded subsets of colleges have <b>common</b> <b>quotas</b> smaller than the sum of their individual quotas. Again, we show that a stable matching may not exist and the related decision problem is NP-complete. On the other hand, we prove that, when the bounded sets form a nested set system, a stable matching can be found by generalising, in non-trivial ways, both the applicant-oriented and college-oriented versions of the classical Gale–Shapley algorithm. Finally, we present an alternative view of this nested case using the concept of choice functions, and {{with the aid of a}} matroid model we establish some interesting structural results for this case...|$|R

Under a competitive equilibrium, individual fishermen fail to fully account for the external effects of their harvest decisions on the season length, leading to excessive discards, drastically shortened seasons, and large shares of un-harvested quota for all but the smallest of fishery sizes. These results are robust for even very efficient (low-bycatch) fishing gears. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in output prices, discard costs, quota allocations and differing degrees of spatial correlation of target and bycatch species.

40|$|Much of the {{existing}} literature on fisheries bycatch {{has focused on the}} technological aspects of hycatch control. By contrast, there has been precious little consideration of the role of incentives in fostering or hindering bycatch avoidance and even less thought to the incentive structures found in many real-world fisheries. This thesis addresses this gap by developing analytical and empirical models for a particular case study: the flatfish fisheries of the Eastern Bering Sea. These fisheries are managed under a system of multiple <b>common</b> pool <b>quotas</b> on bycatch and target species enforced by quota-triggered closures. We develop a game theoretic model to explain how this system fosters suboptimal bycatch avoidance behavior due to fishermen's inability to fully capture the benefits of bycatch avoidance. We derive the bycatch penalty that aligns private incentives with the rent-maximizing solution and find, surprisingly, that this penalty must increase with improvements in the bycatch efficiency of the harvesting technology. We then develop an empirical discrete choice model of fishing location choice at a fine level of spatial and temporal resolution in order to reveal the implicit cost of bycatch to fishermen. We uncover substantial avoidance in the waning moments of the season but little otherwise. This avoidance is driven by a number of theoretically important factors on the fishing grounds. Even at its greatest, the implicit cost attached to bycatch is well below its value to the entire fleet. We also find substantial evidence that the <b>common</b> property <b>quota</b> system fosters excessive inertia in the movements of vessels over the fishing grounds. Finally, we combine several modeling approaches to weigh the success of a voluntary program of information sharing and hycatch avoidance. The presence of data {{both before and after the}} program's inception and the initial nonparticipation of one cohort of vessels make our problem amenable to several variants of the difference-in-differences approach. Ultimately we find no basis for a positive impact of the voluntary program upon either bycatch outcomes or the implicit cost of bycatch to participating fishermen. We close by considering a number of hypotheses for the apparent failure of the cooperative program...|$|R

Because of this, they are extremely susceptible to being overfished. The greatest risk to this species is trawling or net fishing. Using this method, large numbers are caught quickly. Once caught, the fish are sold as whitefish or silver trumpeter fillets, most often served in fish and chips. The most common location of export is Australia. Under the World Conservation Union (IUCN), the three extant species of Callorhinchidae are all listed as [...] "Least Concern", as they remain <b>common.</b> While fishing <b>quotas</b> are in place in Australia and New Zealand, this is the furthest that the conservation effort spans.

50|$|To {{prevent the}} fleets of other EU members (particularly Spain) {{taking up the}} UK's <b>Common</b> Fisheries Policy <b>quota,</b> the UK sought to create a {{framework}} that discriminated between British- and Spanish-owned boats, regardless of flag flown, so that its waters wouldn't be over-fished by foreign-owned trawlers.

However, when the Single European Act was implemented, in 1987, this became illegal under EU law, and a Spanish company successfully challenged the right of the British government to prevent Spanish fishermen taking up the British quota in what has now become known as the Factortame case.

40|$|The New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries {{relies on}} fishery {{assessments}} to determine suitable catch quotas for exploited fisheries. Currently, 628 fish stocks are managed in New Zealand using the Quote Management System, {{which includes the}} 8 com- mercial flatfish species caught within the Exclusive Economic Zone. These eight species of flatfish, which includes four species of flounder, two species of sole, brill and turbot, are currently managed using a combined catch quota. Since these eight species are managed using a <b>common</b> catch <b>quota,</b> there is concern {{that some of the}} individual species may be under or over-fished. This thesis describes work involving the flatfish species caught in the FLA 3 man- agement area, around the south island of New Zealand. The FLA 3 management area contains three key species: New Zealand sole, lemon sole, and sand flounder. Due to the nature and limitations of the data available, simple biomass dynamic models were applied to these species. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian goodness of fit techniques were used to estimate the model parameters. Three models were used: the Fox model, the Schaefer model and the Pella-Tomlinson model with m = 3. As a mathematical/statistical exercise, these models were used to conduct a risk analysis to analyse {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} six management options for setting a TACC. However, because of issues over the way that the parameter K has been modelled (due to necessity caused by the lack of data), this should not be seen as an appropriate method for estimating the fish stock.

40|$|Many {{fisheries}} {{around the}} world are plagued with the problem of bycatch [...] the inadvertent harvesting and discard of non-targeted species. Bycatch occurs when targeted and non-targeted species coincide in the same habitat and gear is imperfectly selective. One of the prevailing methods of controlling bycatch is the common-pool quota system. Under this system, biologists set total allowable catches (TACs) for both the targeted and non-targeted species, and the fishing season is closed when one of these TACs binds. We develop a predictive model of a renewable resource that is regulated with this kind of common-pool quota system. The model demonstrates that the equilibrium will generally be characterized by excessive discards, shortened seasons, and foregone target species harvest. These results occur even with very efficient (low bycatch) fishing gear. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in technological parameters and degrees of spatial correlation of target and non-target species. Finally, we derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its significance in light of various policy options available to regulators.

Under certain conditions, the cost of building formal institutions is repaid by a large gain in efficiency. On the other hand, the users themselves had to create and administer the formal institutions, and since the benefits of formal regulations are a public good, each individual has an incentive to free ride. The collective action problem of providing regulatory services was surmounted thanks to the repeated interaction among users. The paradox is thus resolved...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} Hospitals / Residents problem (HR) is a many-to-one bipartite matching problem involving preferences, {{motivated by}} centralised matching schemes arising in entry level labour markets, {{the assignment of}} pupils to schools and higher education admissions schemes, among its many applications. The particular requirements of these matching schemes may lead to generalisations of HR that involve additional inputs or constraints on an acceptable solution. In this thesis we study such variants of HR from an algorithmic and integer programming viewpoint. The Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples (HRC) is a variant of HR that is important in practical applications because it models the case where couples submit joint preference lists over pairs of (typically geographically close) hospitals. It is known that an instance of HRC need not admit a stable matching. We show that deciding whether an instance of HRC admits a stable matching is NP-complete even under some very severe restrictions on the lengths {{and the structure of}} the participants’ preference lists. However, we show that under certain restrictions on the lengths of the agents’ preference lists, it is possible to find a maximum cardinality stable matching or report that none exists in polynomial time. Since an instance of HRC need not admit a stable matching, it is natural to seek the ‘most stable’ matching possible, i. e., a matching that admits the minimum number of blocking pairs. We use a gap-introducing reduction to establish an inapproximability bound for the problem of finding a matching in an instance of HRC that admits the minimum number of blocking pairs. Further, we show how this result might be generalised to prove that a number of minimisation problems based on matchings having NP-complete decision versions have the same inapproximability bound. We also show that this result holds for more general minimisation problems having NP-complete decisions versions that are not based on matching problems. Further, we present a full description of the first Integer Programming (IP) model for finding a maximum cardinality stable matching or reporting that none exists in an arbitrary instance of HRC. We present empirical results showing the average size of a maximum cardinality stable matching and the percentage of instances admitting stable matching taken over a number of randomly generated instances of HRC with varying properties. We also show how this model might be generalised to the variant of HRC in which ties are allowed in either the hospitals’ or the residents’ preference lists, the Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples and Ties (HRCT). We also describe and prove the correctness of the first IP model for finding a maximum cardinality ‘most stable’ matching in an arbitrary instance of HRC. We describe empirical results showing the average number of blocking pairs admitted by a most-stable matching as well as the average size of a maximum cardinality ‘most stable’ matching taken over a number of randomly generated instances of HRC with varying properties. Further, we examine the output when the IP model for HRCT is applied to real world instances arising from the process used to assign medical graduates to Foundation Programme places in Scotland in the years 2010 - 2012. The Hungarian Higher Education Allocation Scheme places a number of additional constraints on the feasibility of an allocation and this gives rise to various generalisations of HR. We show how a number of these additional requirements may be modelled using IP techniques by use of an appropriate combination of IP constraints. We present IP models for HR with Stable Score Limits and Ties, HR with Paired Applications, Ties and Stable Score limits, HR with <b>Common</b> <b>Quotas,</b> Ties and Stable Score Limits and also HR with Lower Quotas, Ties and Stable Score limits that model these generalisations of HR. The Teachers’ Allocation Problem (TAP) is a variant of HR that models the allocation of trainee teachers to supervised teaching positions in Slovakia. In TAP teachers express preference lists over pairs of subjects at individual schools. It is known that deciding whether an optimal matching exists that assigns all of the trainee teachers is NP-complete for a number of restricted cases. We describe IP models for finding a maximum cardinality matching in an arbitrary TAP instance and for finding a maximum cardinality stable matching, or reporting that none exists, in a TAP instance where schools also have preferences. We show the results when applying the first model to the real data arising from the allocation of trainee teachers to schools carried out at P. J. Safarik University in Kosice in 2013...|$|R
