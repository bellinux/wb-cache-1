25|$|The multi-touch screens {{of mobile}} devices allow {{implementation}} of virtual on-screen <b>chorded</b> keyboards. Buttons are fewer, {{so they can}} be made larger. Symbols on the keys can be changed dynamically depending on what other keys are pressed, thus eliminating the need to memorize combos for characters and functions before use. For example, in the <b>chorded</b> GKOS keyboard which has been adapted for the Google Android, Apple iPhone, MS Windows Phone and Intel MeeGo/Harmattan platforms, thumbs are used for chording by pressing one or two keys at the same time. The layout divides the keys into two separate pads which are positioned near the sides of the screen, while text appears in the middle. The most frequent letters have dedicated keys and do not require chording.|$|E

5000|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{a dominant}} seventh is a four-note <b>chord</b> combining a major <b>chord</b> and a minor seventh. For example, the C7 dominant seventh <b>chord</b> adds B to the C-major <b>chord</b> (C,E,G). The naive <b>chord</b> (C,E,G,B) spans six frets from fret 3 to fret 8; such seventh <b>chords</b> [...] "contain some pretty serious stretches {{in the left}} hand". An illustration shows a naive C7 <b>chord,</b> which would be extremely difficult to play, besides the open-position C7 <b>chord</b> that is conventional in standard tuning. The standard-tuning implementation of a C7 <b>chord</b> is a second-inversion C7 drop 2 <b>chord,</b> in which the second-highest note in a second inversion of the C7 <b>chord</b> is lowered by an octave. Drop-two <b>chords</b> are used for sevenths <b>chords</b> besides the major-minor seventh with dominant function, which {{are discussed in the}} section on intermediate <b>chords,</b> below. Drop-two <b>chords</b> are used particularly in jazz guitar. Drop-two second-inversions are examples of openly voiced <b>chords,</b> which are typical of standard tuning and other popular guitar-tunings.|$|R

50|$|In Western {{classical}} music during the common practice period, <b>chord</b> progressions {{are used to}} structure a musical composition. The destination of a <b>chord</b> progression {{is known as a}} cadence, or two <b>chords</b> that signify the end or prolongation of a musical phrase. The most conclusive and resolving cadences return to the tonic or I chord; following the circle of fifths, the most suitable <b>chord</b> to precede the I <b>chord</b> is a V <b>chord.</b> This particular cadence, V-I, is known as an authentic cadence. However, since a I-V-I progression is repetitive and skips most of the circle of fifths, it is common practice to precede the dominant <b>chord</b> with a suitable predominant <b>chord,</b> such as a IV <b>chord</b> or a ii <b>chord</b> (in major), in order to maintain interest. In this case, the 50s progression uses a IV <b>chord,</b> resulting in the ubiquitous I-IV-V-I progression. The vi <b>chord</b> before the IV <b>chord</b> in this progression (creating I-vi-IV-V-I) is used as a means to prolong the tonic <b>chord,</b> as the vi or submediant <b>chord</b> is commonly used as a substitute for the tonic <b>chord,</b> and to ease the voice leading of the bass line: in a I-vi-IV-V-I progression (without any chordal inversions) the bass voice descends in major or minor thirds from the I <b>chord</b> to the vi <b>chord</b> to the IV <b>chord.</b>|$|R

The hold times for the <b>chords</b> in a unit formed a distinct long-short-long rhythm (151 ms, 133 ms and 144 ms). The rate of errors was smallest for the first <b>chord</b> (27. 1 %) followed by the last <b>chord</b> (34. 8 %) and largest for the middle <b>chord</b> in a unit (38. 1 %). Practice manifested itself in significantly shorter inter-chord time and <b>chord</b> hold times. <b>Chords</b> were built and released in steps, where the time to add a finger, or release a finger, {{was related to the}} number of fingers already used. Moreover, it took longer to release a <b>chord</b> (25 ms) than to construct a <b>chord</b> (16 ms). The <b>chord</b> hold times were related to the Hamming distance between successive <b>chords.</b> Both the inter-chord times and the <b>chord</b> hold times were reduced through practice. <b>Chord</b> transitions with a Hamming distance of one resulted in most errors and <b>chord</b> transitions with two identical or complementary <b>chords</b> had the lowest error rate. Implications of these results are that <b>chording</b> speed may increase if frequent <b>chord</b> transitions are designed to have a small Hamming distances.
