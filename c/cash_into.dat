5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by John Duff and Frank Clement, Barnato {{agreed to}} finance Bentley's business. Barnato had {{incorporated}} Baromans Ltd in 1922, which effectively existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested {{in excess of}} £100,000, saving {{the company and its}} workforce. A subsequent agreed wind-up of the original Bentley company was agreed, with all existing creditors paid off for £75,000, but with existing shares devalued from £1.00 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares, meaning that he controlled the company, and became chairman. Barnato injected further <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> the business: £35,000 as a debenture in July 1927; £40,000 in 1928; £25,000 in 1929.|$|E

25|$|The Champions Trophy was {{the brainchild}} of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was ICC {{president}} in the late 1990s. It had a dual aim of spreading the game to emerging nations and raising money for the ICC in between World Cups, thus enabling it to pump more <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> those fledgling cricket countries. The first tournament, labelled as a mini World Cup, was staged in Dhaka in October 1998 and raised more than £10 million. The second, in Nairobi, was a commercial success although the crowds stayed away. By the time the 2002 event was held – and there was disquiet as it was so close to the World Cup five months later – the idea of playing in developing nations had been ditched and as revenue-generation was the main raison d'etre, it needed to be in one of the main countries as this allowed the format to be expanded. In 2004 the jamboree moved to England and it became clear the format of group games led to too many meaningless games. By the time the 2006 tournament in India came into view, the event was under fire from some quarters, and at one time there were even hints that India might decline to take part in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Bridgewater Associates {{launched}} its flagship fund, Pure Alpha, in 1989. The fund {{is described as}} a [...] "diversified alpha source" [...] that invests across a group of asset classes. It was designed to balance risk among a variety of non-correlated assets through active management. It includes 30 or 40 simultaneous trading positions in bonds, currencies, stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area. After placing some of the company's excess <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> the Pure Alpha hedge fund to increase its [...] "investing discretion." [...] The fund was closed to new investors in 2006 when it reached its pre-determined maximum funds level. [...] Bridgewater’s Pure Alpha II has posted a historic average return of 12 percent with only 3 losing years. The success of Pure Alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes.|$|E
500|$|In 1898, Knut Wicksell {{proposed}} a monetary theory centered on interest rates. His analysis used two rates: the market interest rate, {{determined by the}} banking system, and the real or [...] "natural" [...] interest rate, determined by the {{rate of return on}} capital. In Wicksell's theory, cumulative inflation will occur when technical innovation causes the natural rate to rise or when the banking system allows the market rate to fall. Cumulative deflation occurs under the opposite conditions causing the market rate to rise above the natural. Wicksell's theory did not produce a direct relationship between the quantity of money and price level. According to Wicksell, money would be created endogenously, without an increase in quantity of hard currency, as long as the natural exceeded the market interest rate [...] In these conditions, borrowers turn a profit and deposit <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> bank reserves, which expands money supply. This can lead to a cumulative process where inflation increases continuously without an expansion in the monetary base. Wicksell's work influenced Keynes and the Swedish economists of the Stockholm School.|$|E

The United States began Marshall Plan aid in 1948 that pumped <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> the economy, fostered modernization of business, and encouraged economic cooperation. The 1948 elections led to a new coalition led by Labor's Willem Drees. [...] He led four successive cabinets Drees I, Drees II, Drees III and Drees IV until late 1958. His terms saw four major political developments: the traumas of decolonization, economic reconstruction, the establishment of the Dutch welfare state, and international integration and co-operation, including the formation of Benelux, the OEEC, NATO, the ECSC, and the EEC.|$|E
2500|$|The policy also {{compounded}} inflationary pressures. The British administration released significant {{funds for}} cash purchases of boats; {{the threat of}} punitive force {{and the fear of}} reported Japanese war crimes against captives were also employed. Compensation was paid [...] "lavishly" [...] for the boats and boat crews: owners were paid [...] "the market value of the craft [...] three months' average earnings when the boat had been used as sole means of livelihood", while [...] " [...] received a month's wages". Many boat owners initially responded enthusiastically; authorities were able to obtain 25,000 boats within the first few days after the introduction of the policy. Cash was disbursed in lump sums of one-rupee notes. These notes, however, were immediately spent on rice and cloth, both of which were already becoming scarce, since the paper they were printed on was frequently damaged by white ants. This sudden injection of <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> the local economy, and subsequent increase in demand for goods, compounded the inflationary pressures.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} address {{problems}} related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble, several new tools have been created. The first new tool, called the Term Auction Facility, was added on December 12, 2007.

Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities Lending Facility, was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject <b>cash</b> <b>into</b> the banking system whereas the Term Securities Lending Facility is used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008.
