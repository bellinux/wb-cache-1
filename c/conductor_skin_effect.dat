50|$|The EMF of a {{transformer}} {{at a given}} flux density increases with frequency. By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed {{to achieve the same}} impedance. However, properties such as core loss and <b>conductor</b> <b>skin</b> <b>effect</b> also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight. Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50-60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages (e.g. 15 kV) were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of harmonics in power systems has increased substantially {{due to the}} use of solid state controlled loads and other high frequency producing devices. An important consideration when evaluating the impact of harmonics is their effect on power system components and loads. Transformers are major components in power systems. The increased losses due to harmonic distortion can cause excessive winding loss and hence abnormal temperature rise. Existing standards give a procedure to determine the capability of an existing transformer subject to non-sinusoidal load currents based on conservative assumptions. The eddy current loss generated by the electromagnetic field is assumed to vary with the square of the rms current and the square of the frequency (harmonic order h). Actually, due to skin effect, the electromagnetic flux may not totally penetrate the strands in the winding at high frequencies. In addition, the temperature rise due to harmonics is estimated based on constant harmonic load currents and the average daily or monthly temperatures to which a transformer would be subjected while in service. It is the purpose of this research effort to quantify the increased winding losses due to harmonics and the corresponding temperature rise in transformers. This is accomplished using a 2 -D FEM model adapted for winding loss calculation. A corrected harmonic loss factor that considers <b>conductor</b> <b>skin</b> <b>effect</b> is proposed and verified by measurements. Thermal dynamic models are investigated and modified to consider a time varying distorted load cycle.

The resonance frequencies, determined from the amplitude versus frequency (AF) response of such resonators, are mainly determined by the permittivity of the fluid while damping arises from dielectric losses. Even though this methodology has been extensively reported in the literature, without almost any exception these studies refer to (near) ideal behavior regarding for example, geometry and negligibly low conductivity of the fluid studied. Online stub resonator-based sensors (i. e., flow-through) in use for industrial applications, however, quite often suffer from high dielectric losses, non-ideal material choice of the conductors from an electrical point of view and unconventional resonator geometry.

Those interfaces, which also provide a voltage step-up or step-down function, are of particular interest because renewable energy sources do not always have voltages compatible with the connecting grid. Among them, the so-called “power electronic transformer” or “solid-state transformer” (SST) is the focus of significant research. Advantages such as bidirectional power flow, improved system control, reduced size, and premium power quality at the output terminals, increase the interest of the SST for future electric grids.

This paper presents an optimum design method that can be employed to build a high-frequency transformer for a SST intended to interface a renewable energy source (e. g., a photovoltaic system) to the electric grid.

On-Chip interconnect has become the dominant factor in deep sub-micrometer (DSM) integrated circuits (ICs). With increasing levels of on-chip integration, more functional units are integrated onto a single die, such as a multi-core microprocessor and a system-on-chip. Global interconnect, which acts as a communication media among these functional units, plays an increasingly important role and can significantly limit the performance of advanced systems. Accurate noise and delay modelling for RLC lines is thus critical for timing and signal integrity analysis. <b>Skin</b> <b>effect</b> basically affects the resistance and also the inductance, which in turn affects the system integrity in particular and its response as a whole.
