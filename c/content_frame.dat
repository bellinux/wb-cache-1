This has no effect on the picture other than eliminating the need for 3:2 pulldown and thus film judder as a matter of course (since 120 is evenly divisible by 24). Eliminating judder results in motion that is less [...] "jumpy" [...] and which matches that of a theater projector. Motion interpolation can be used to reduce judder, but it is not required in order to do so.|$|E

50|$|Success after Struggle:Whitman conveys {{this theme}} through an entire novel of hardship. After battling times of intemperance since he {{first arrived in}} New York, Evans finally {{achieves}} some sort of satisfaction at the end. As a middle aged man {{at the conclusion of}} the novel, Evans states: “So, at an age which was hardly upon the middle verge of life, I found myself possessed of a comfortable property; and, as the term is ‘unincumbered’ person-which means I have no wife to love me-no children to please me, and be the recipients of my own affection, and no domestic hearth around which we might gather, as the center of joy and delight.” (Whitman 107). Readers can see that for someone as ill-behaved as Evans, whose poor judgement lost him nearly everything in his life, amends could still be made. He came to terms with his life and set himself on a reformed path. It seemed as though nothing remotely good could come out of Evans's situation after lost jobs, wives, and money, but that would have taken away from Whitman's lesson that immense struggle will be balanced out with sort of success, or in Evans's case, <b>content</b> <b>frame</b> of mind.|$|E

The first method, fragment identifier messaging, provides confidentiality without authentication, which we repair using concepts from a well-known network protocol. The second method, postMessage, provides authentication, but we discover an attack that breaches confidentiality. We modify the postMessage API to provide confidentiality and see our modifications standardized and adopted in browser implementations. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a visual quality and content based {{approach}} {{for creating a}} lecture video capsule which essentially contains {{the highlights of the}} original lecture video. We first segment and recognize the activities in the instructional video using a hidden Markov model(HAIM). The activities are classified into three categories : talking head, writing hand and slide show. Then a no-reference objective quality assessment of the non-content frames, i. e., talking head frames, are performed to detect a few high quality frames for highlight creation. A new method of defining the visual quality of <b>content</b> <b>frames,</b> i. e., writing hand and slide show frames which are very crucial in a lecture video, is proposed in this paper. Statistical parameters of the intensity histogram along with the horizontal projection profile(HPP) of the the <b>content</b> <b>frames</b> are used to derive an objective quality measure of these frames. This allows us to extract the high quality <b>content</b> <b>frames,</b> which are 'well-written'. Finally on media re-creation to produce the video capsule, we select the video segments of a few seconds duration around these good quality frames along with the audio and merge with suitable proportion of the detected classes of instructional activity.

40|$|Framing {{has become}} one of the most popular {{concepts}} in the study of news coverage. However, the process of frame-building (Scheufele, 1999), i. e. what factors influence how the news is being framed, has been treated shabbily for a long time (Borah, 2011). Among frame-building studies, the role of journalists and newsrooms remains rather unexplored. This study attempts to bridge the framing tradition with the field of news production. To this end, a multiple-method strategy is adopted: <b>content</b> <b>frame</b> analysis of news stories go together with ethnographic research methods, such as newsroom observations and reconstruction interviews. Thereby, the focus lies on newsrooms in the Low Countries. Following a constructionist approach to framing (Gamson & Modigliani, 1989; Van Gorp, 2007), frames are considered as the unintentional result of journalistic routines, such as the application of news values. The factors that influence frame-building are investigated on different levels (cf. Shoemaker & Reese, 1996), with a focus on individual (e. g., journalistic roles), organizational (e. g., newsroom organization), and institutional (e. g., relationships with sources) influences. nrpages: 287 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the selection and}} framing of domestic news in the Flemish press using a multilevel analysis. Shoemaker and Reese’s hierarchical model of news influences is empirically tested {{through a combination of}} <b>content</b> <b>frame</b> analysis and in-depth interviews with journalists. The study provides a bridge between studies of news texts and studies of production contexts. The question of how frames arise is largely sidestepped in framing research. Therefore framing research can learn from sociological news production studies. However, many of the classic news ethnographies are criticized because of a narrow focus on routines and because they leave little room for the agency of the individual journalist. My research looks at the journalist as an active agent as well as examines higher influences than those of the individual journalist. This study collects material from four newsrooms, belonging to two different media groups (Corelio, The Persgroep), each with a quality newspaper (De Standaard, De Morgen) and a popular newspaper (Het Nieuwsblad, Het Laatste Nieuws). For a six-week period, the output of 20 journalists was content analyzed. Regularly semi-structured interviews, supplemented by newsroom observations and logbook analysis, lead to a reconstruction of the production of 680 articles. This paper highlighted the difficulties of winning trust of journalists, who suffered from much criticism from academicians, and interviewing them, a method they are so familiar with. It explores that interviewing, although time-consuming, is a useful way to complement content analysis in framing research. Such multi-method approach can help us to better understand the influences on the choice of topics and how they are brought. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Mediating gendered politics: Ghanaian {{politicians}} and news discourse Research {{has shown that}} there are gendered differences in media coverage of political candidates. Kittilson and Fridkin (2008) have shown that women, irrespective of what countries they live in, tend to be systematically stereotyped. Female candidates receive less coverage {{and the content of}} the coverage often focuses on their age, style, appearance and family status (Ross, 2010). Over the past decades, several studies have also shown that because of the media’s agenda-setting role, slanted coverage helps create and maintain barriers to the political aspirations of female electoral candidates (Bystrom & Dimitrova, 2014). This research considers {{the extent to which these}} patterns and trends can be found in African contexts where rather less research has been undertaken on this particular set of mediated relations, taking a case study approach by focusing on the coverage of mixed gender election campaigns in Ghana. In particular, this study explores how the news media in Ghana frame women candidates and what women candidates and elected representatives say about their relationships with and portrayal by the media. Coverage of three election campaigns was analysed and generated a series of related, comparative datasets which focused on both national and party election campaigns, which took place between 2008 and 2011. Eighteen women candidates who stood in the 2012 parliamentary elections were also interviewed across all main parties. The methods of data analysis were a synthesis of <b>content,</b> <b>frame,</b> and discourse. The analyses of both data (news stories and interviews) were framed and interrogated from a feminist perspective. Findings from the analysis of 198 news items suggest that viable women were covered more frequently than men in terms of visibility and less viable women trailed; in terms of tone, coverage tended to be generally more negative for some of the women than the men and it increased with the level of authority of the office. Coverage focused on the women’s personal attributes, especially their familial relationships and novelty, and for the men, their professional attributes. Again, the focus of coverage was mainly, gendered and prejudicial against women, especially in terms of their character traits, familial relationship, and professional (expertise) attributes. The interview findings, also, demonstrated that women were covered more negatively in sexualised and familial frames, compared to their male colleagues. Some women themselves seem to also have very negative attitudes towards the media. Largely, these findings corroborate many other studies on women candidates...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} framing of the {{so-called}} ‘Syria warriors’ {{through the eyes of}} journalists. The news about young Belgian Muslims fighting in the Syrian war became an unfolding story in the Flemish press when Belgium {{turned out to be one}} of the countries with the highest number of foreign fighters in Syria. Among studies of frame building, the role of journalists and newsrooms remains rather unexplored. The question how frames originate is largely ignored in framing research (Borah, 2011; Matthes, 2009). This study understands the relation between journalists and sources on a continuum between frame-sending and frame-setting (Brüggemann, 2014). A distinction is made between actor frames, other media frames, newsroom frames and journalist frames. The main research questions concerns the responsibility for the framing, to what extent journalists maintain or change the framing of the source(s) and under which circumstances they are more likely to maintain or change the framing of the source(s). Methodologically, this study combines <b>content</b> <b>frame</b> analysis with news ethnography. The goal of the content analysis was to identify episodic and thematic frames (Iyengar, 1991) as well as cultural frames (by the constructionist approach to framing of Van Gorp, 2007 / 10). The ethnography consisted mainly of newsroom observations and reconstruction interviews, in which the ‘biographies’ of news stories were reconstructed (Brüggemann, 2013; Reich, 2009). This case study is part of a broader research project on the origin of news frames in Flemish newspapers, conducted in March and April 2013, the period in which the story of the ‘Syria warriors’ emerged. It collects material from the two most widespread popular newspapers (Het Laatste Nieuws and Het Nieuwsblad) and the two most widespread quality newspapers (De Morgen and De Standaard) in Flanders. The daily output of 20 reporters – five per newsroom – was investigated by content analysis as well as by reconstruction interviews. Additional interviews were held with copy editors, news managers and editors-in-chief. This lead to the reconstruction of 680 news stories. Results show how the dominant cultural frames (the terrorist and the victim frame) relates to generic frames (thematic and episodic respectively) and how this can be traced back a different emphasis on certain frame actors (official vs citizen sources). Also discussed is the linkage of these frames with the kind of newspaper and news beat. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} framing {{practices}} of Flemish newspaper journalists, {{focusing on the}} production side of framing. In the selection and construction of events into news stories, the use of frames {{is seen as an}} inevitable journalistic practice to translate those events to the audience. This study departs from the idea that frames are part of culture and looks for frame packages in which cultural phenomena (as narratives, archetypes, myths and values) function as a central theme (Van Gorp, 2006). In framing research, the question how frames arise is largely sidestepped (Borah, 2011; Matthes, 2009). Although the classic news ethnographies offer interesting insights, many of those production studies are criticized because of an outdated focus on ‘bureaucratic’ routines. While those studies leave little room for the agency of the individual journalist, our research intends to examine higher news influences with respect to the journalist as an active agent. Methodologically, this study combines <b>content</b> <b>frame</b> analysis with news ethnography. The goal of the content analysis was to identify episodic and thematic frames (Iyengar, 1991) as well as cultural frames (by the constructionist approach to framing of Van Gorp, 2006 / 10). The ethnography consisted mainly of newsroom observations and reconstruction interviews, in which the ‘biographies’ of news stories were constructed (Brüggemann, 2013; Reich, 2009). This study collects material from the two most widespread popular newspapers (Het Laatste Nieuws and Het Nieuwsblad) and the two most widespread quality newspapers (De Morgen and De Standaard) in Flanders. For a six-week period, the output of 20 domestic news reporters – five per newsroom – was investigated by content analysis as well as by reconstruction interviews. Additional interviews were held with copy editors, news managers and editors-in-chief. This lead to the reconstruction of 680 news stories. The results highlight the importance of ‘a distinctive angle’ (often used as a frame for the article). Because of the prevalence of news on the web and because of the media dependency, newspapers often select the same events as news. That does not mean they are telling the same stories. The added value of newspaper stories is seen in ‘offering a perspective’. Although newspaper reporters still consider true ‘news hunting’ as a core business, a significant amount of stories departs from ‘the search of an own angle’ for events already brought by other news media. In this search, cultural frames, moving further away from the actor frames of the initial source(s), come into action. Also discussed {{is the role of the}} news manager as initiator of angles. Rather than being pushed to write a story in a certain way, reporters ‘internalized’ his vision of news making. They have learnt what topics and angles get a chance to be approved. status: publishe...|$|E
