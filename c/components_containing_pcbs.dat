In the UK, for example, it is estimated that over 90 % of PCB emissions arise from leaks from transformers and capacitors and from fragmentising operations (APARG, 1995). Recent estimates of the European emissions in 1990 indicate that as much as 94 % of PCB emissions come from this source (Berdowski et al., 1997). Electrical equipment <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> is unlikely to be a significant source of any pollutant other than PCBs.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to create the awareness among the general public and especially those who work directly with the transformers on the adverse health effects that are associated with the exposure to transformer oils that may <b>contain</b> <b>PCBs.</b> Knowledge of PCBs and the adverse effects on humans and the environment were assessed among Electricity Company of Ghana staff members, Volta River Authority staff members and the general public. Evidence obtained from the use of structured questionnaire analysed with Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS) version 16 shows that Staff members of the technical departments of ECG/VRA (71. 4 %) as well as a few welders (16. 7 %) have come in contact with the transformer oil that may possibly <b>contain</b> <b>PCBs.</b> About 26. 1 % of female from ECG and VRA indicated they still work with and/or on transformer, thereby increasing the potential adverse effect associated to exposure to transformer oils that may <b>contain</b> <b>PCBs.</b> About 55. 6 % of the ECG/VRA staff members do not wear any protective clothing when working on transformers thus exposing themselves to PCBs.

40|$|In Poland {{there were}} {{originally}} manufactured two technical PCB formulations of moderate (40 %) and high (63. 6 %) chlorine content. A moderate chlorinated PCB mixture called Tarnol (or Chlorowany bifenyl) was synthesized in 1971 - 1976 {{and used as}} dielectric oil in home manufactured transformers, while the highly chlorinated mixture Chlorofen {{was used as a}} lubricant and hydraulic fluid mainly in mining equipment. There is no data available indicating when materials and products <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> appeared {{for the first time in}} Poland. In Poland there were also originally manufactured two PCN formulations of low (mono-chloronaphthalene) and high (tri- to octachloronaphthalene) chlorine content. Due to historical reasons some materials and equipment containing PCB/PCT/PCN could reach the present country's territory before 1945, i. e. at the same time when they were available in neighbouring Germany. Some foreign technical PCB mixtures as well as materials, products and equipment <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> were imported from abroad after 1945. After World War II PCN formulations were synthesized in Poland. There is not yet a whole country-based register of materials, products and equipment <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs,</b> PCTs and/or PCNs. Nevertheless, some preliminary inventory work was done in the mid- 1990 s and includes the public electric power supply sector.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the remedial action to achieve compliance with 29 CFR 1910 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements of fluorescent light fixtures <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> at K- 25 site. This remedial action {{is called the}} Remediation Plan for Fluorescent Light Fixtures <b>Containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> at the K- 25 Site (The Plan). The Plan specifically discusses (1) conditions of non-compliance, (2) alternative solutions, (3) recommended solution, (4) remediation plan costs, (5) corrective action, (6) disposal of PCB waste, (7) training, and (8) plan conclusions. The results from inspections by Energy Systems personnel in 2 buildings at K- 25 site and statistical extension of this data to 91 selected buildings at the K- 25 site indicates that there are approximately 28, 000 fluorescent light fixtures containing 47, 036 ballasts. Approximately 38, 531 <b>contain</b> <b>PCBs</b> and 2, 799 of the 38, 531 ballasts are leaking PCBs. Review of reportable occurrences at K- 25 for the 12 month period of September 1990 through August 1991 shows that Energy Systems personnel reported 69 ballasts leaking PCBs. Each leaking ballast is in non-compliance with 29 CFR 1910 - Table Z- 1 -A. The age of the K- 25 facilities indicate a continued and potential increase in ballasts leaking PCBs. This report considers 4 alternative solutions {{for dealing with the}} ballasts leaking PCBs.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} obtain thermal energy from the combustion of synthetic gas, produced by the pyrolysis of insulating oil <b>containing</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (<b>PCBs)</b> in a high temperature and high pressure reactor. The average synthetic gas generated was 59. 67 Am 3 /hr via the steady state gasification of insulating oil waste (20 kg/hr) with average concentrations (standard deviation) of CO 2, CO, and H 2 in the synthetic gas of 38. 63 ± 3. 11 %, 35. 18 ± 1. 93 %, and 28. 42 ± 1. 68 %, respectively. The concentrations of the PCBs in the transformer insulating oil and synthetic gas after its gasification, and the concentrations of the dioxins that could be produced from the incomplete degradation of PCBs were measured. It was revealed that the PCBs in the insulating oil were composed of the series from tetrachlorobiphenyl to octachlorobiphenyl. However, only the # 49, # 44, # 52, and # 47 / 75 / 48 congeners were detected from the synthetic gas after gasification of the insulating oil and in the flue gas from the combustor. In conclusion, the experimental con-ditions suggested {{in this study were}} very useful for the appropriate treatment of insulating oil <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs.</b> Also, fuel gas containing CO and H 2 can be obtained from the pyrolysis of insulating oil <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs...</b>|$|R
30|$|Goods used by {{millions}} of people (dissipative use) are hardly collected separately, even {{if they can be}} identified by a special form or label. Therefore, nearly all small items <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> have been disposed with household waste. Electric and electronic devices are collected separately since a couple of years to fulfil the WEEE directive. Capacitors <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> and “electrolyte capacitors containing substances of concern” must be separated in sorting plants [20]. These capacitors with a unit weight between 100 and 300 g (a third of this being PCBs) [21] have been used {{until the end of the}} 70 ies, may be also in the 80 ies of the last century. From a technical point of view, more than 95 % of all PCB in electronic waste can be separated by the first step in a sorting plant [22]. In a report of the German government, it is assumed that about 3.5 Mg capacitors contaminated with PCBs were separated and disposed in 2008 by proper sorting [23]. But PCB contaminations have been found in sorting plants for e-scrap probably caused by accidentally destroyed capacitors [24, 25].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{retention}} {{properties of}} PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) {{were examined in}} the mussel (Mytilus edulis) {{over a period of}} 89 days. Mussels were transferred from a site of relatively high PCB contamination to a site of relatively low PCB concentration in Puget Sound, Washington. Retention of PCB components increased with increasing chlorine content. Concentrations of PCB decayed logarithmically with calculated half-lives ranging from 3 days for a PCB component with two and three chlorines to 50 days for a PCB component with six and seven chlorines. Components chosen to best repre-sent the commercial PCB mixtures, Aroclor | 1242, 1254, and 1260, were estimated to have half-lives of 8, 23, and 39 days, respectively. The selective retention of the higher chlorinated biphenyls appear {{to be the result of}} lower water solubility of these components. Widespread environmental contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been documented (Risebrough et al. 1968, Hammond 1972, Peakall and Lincer 1970). The determination f the environmental impact of PCBs has been complicated by the varied chemical structure and properties of the individual components. Environmental samples from different levels on the food chain have been reported to <b>contain</b> <b>PCBs</b> varying in their component make-up (Koeman et al. 1969, Jensen et al. 1969).
