He {{is one of a}} number of photographers with trademark calendars widely covered in the media. Over the years top Bollywood stars have appeared on his calendar. Every year the launch of the calendar becomes a major event featuring top celebrities, 24 of them for each year. 18 of the 24 celebrities, including Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, Bipasha Basu and Arjun Rampal are a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> on his calendar. For the 2012 edition, the photographer shot a video with some behind-the-scenes moments for each celebrity, which were made available on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} an interim state of souls after death {{developed}} only gradually, partly because it was of little interest as long as Christians looked for an imminent end of the world. The Eastern Church came to admit {{the existence of an}} intermediate state, but refrained from defining it, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the belief in prayer for the dead that was a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of both Eastern and Western liturgies, and which is unintelligible without belief in an interim state in which the dead may be benefited. Christians in the West demonstrated much more curiosity about this interim state than those in the East: The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity and occasional remarks by Saint Augustine give expression to their belief that sins can be purged by suffering in an afterlife and that the process can be accelerated by prayer.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} 2004, fifteen years {{after the fall of}} the regime, that the {{theological}} writings started being reprinted. These events also signified that the full corpus of his literature could see print: work on his complete writings was taken up by Mariana and Victor Iova. Prăbușirea and other manuscripts only saw print in and after 1997. The project ended in 2002 and, Voncu notes, Agârbiceanu returned to a [...] "discouraging anonymity" [...] until 2014, when Ilie Rad began work on a revised critical edition. This also included material never published in the Pienescu edition—adding as much as 75% new content. As suggested by Manolescu in 2013, Agârbiceanu once seemed [...] "the most promising Transylvanian writer of the dawn of a new century, after Coșbuc and before Rebreanu." [...] However, and despite Fefeleaga being a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of literature textbooks, Agârbiceanu became [...] "two-thirds forgotten". According to Ornea, and to various others, Agârbiceanu mostly endures in cultural memory as a [...] "second-shelf writer".|$|E

500|$|Grimani's {{libretto}} {{is full of}} irony, which Handel reflects in the music. His settings sometimes illustrate {{both the}} surface meaning, as characters attempt to deceive each other, and the hidden truth. For instance, in her aria in act 1, [...] "Non ho cor che per amarti", Agrippina promises Poppaea that deceit will never mar their new friendship, while tricking her into ruining Otho's chances for the throne. Handel's music illuminates her deceit in the melody and minor modal key, while a simple, emphasised rhythmic accompaniment hints at clarity and openness. In act 3, Nero's announcement that his passion is ended {{and that he will}} no longer bound by it (in [...] "Come nube che fugge dal vento") is set to bitter-sweet music which suggests that he is deceiving himself. In Otho's [...] "Coronato il crin" [...] the agitated nature of the music is the opposite of what the [...] "euphoric" [...] tone of the libretto suggests. Contrasts between the force of the libretto and the emotional colour of the actual music would develop into a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of Handel's later London operas.|$|E
500|$|West Indies' loss of form {{continued}} in late 1997 when they lost every international match during their tour of Pakistan. Ambrose played in {{two out of}} West Indies' three matches in an ODI tournament, taking one wicket, but his performance in taking one wicket in the two Test matches he played—he missed the third match with injury—prompted Fazeer Mohammed, writing in Wisden, to describe Ambrose as [...] "a shadow of his former self". Any danger that Ambrose might have retired after this series was forestalled when Brian Lara was appointed West Indies captain and immediately spoke to Ambrose and Walsh {{to ask them to}} continue in the team. When England toured the West Indies between January and April 1998, he took 30 wickets at 14.26 to top the bowling averages for the series. Many of the pitches during the tour were poor for batting, but Ambrose was very effective, particularly in the second, third and fourth Tests. In addition, he dismissed Mike Atherton, the England captain, six times in the series. Scyld Berry wrote in Wisden that Ambrose was [...] "back to something near his peak form... defied every prediction that he was finished after his tour of Pakistan." [...] In the second Test, Ambrose took eight wickets; he conceded only 23 runs from 26 overs in the first innings and bowled a spell of five wickets for 16 runs from 47 deliveries in the second to complete figures of five for 52. Having won the second match, West Indies lost the third, but according to Matthew Engel, [...] "Ambrose's abiding power was the most <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of a fluctuating match". His eight wickets in the game, including five for 25 in the first innings, took him past fifty Test wickets in Trinidad. He followed up with six wickets in West Indies victory in the fourth Test, taking four for 38 in the final innings. Tony Cozier wrote that Ambrose [...] "thundered in, arms and knees pumping like pistons, to generate all of his old pace." [...] Following the Test series, which West Indies won 3–1, Ambrose played in the first three matches of the ODI series, and took three wickets.|$|E

2500|$|The Bishop of Chiapas, Samuel Ruiz, and the Diocese of Chiapas reacted by {{offering}} to mediate between the rebels and authorities. However, {{because of this}} diocese's activism since the 1960s, authorities accused the clergy of being involved with the rebels. [...] There was some ambiguity {{about the relationship between}} Ruiz and Marcos and it was a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of news coverage, with many in official circles using such to discredit Ruiz. Eventually, the activities of the Zapatistas began to worry the Roman Catholic Church in general and to upstage the diocese's attempts to re establish itself among Chiapan indigenous communities against Protestant evangelization. This would lead to a breach between the Church and the Zapatistas.|$|E
2500|$|Square dancers' {{response}} to clashes with residents over noise has been mixed. While {{one group of}} dancers in Xi'an's Weiyang District voluntarily agreed to limit its routines to certain times and noise levels, others have been more defiant. [...] "The louder the music, the more fun it is," [...] one dancer told The New York Times in 2015. Song Jiahong, a humanities professor at Yunnan University, says this apparent insensitivity to loud noise is another effect of the Cultural Revolution, when propaganda read over loudspeakers was a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of daily Chinese life. [...] "The intimate memories of the loudspeakers are lodged deep in the subconscious of the old Red Guards," [...] he wrote. [...] "They have no concept that this can actually annoy others." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{companion}} figurenbsp&– {{generally a}} humannbsp&– {{has been a}} <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> in Doctor Who since the programme's inception in 1963. One of {{the roles of the}} companion is to remind the Doctor of his [...] "moral duty". The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin. Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes— or loves— on worlds they have visited. Some have died {{during the course of the}} series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rejection}} of the dynastic claims of the House of Orange therefore {{was not just a}} matter of defending the political patronage of one particular political faction, against the aspirations to lucrative political office of another faction. It was a matter of principle to the States Party: they were against the notion of any [...] "eminent head" [...] of the Dutch state, not just the Prince of Orange. The absence of such an [...] "eminent head" [...] was to them a mark of superiority of the Dutch political system over other forms of government. The fact that compromise was a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of the Dutch political landscape, and that often the pace of decision-making was glacial, was also viewed in a not necessarily negative light. (Besides, as was abundantly proved during the reign of William III, when he had obtained the stadtholdership after 1672, an [...] "eminent head" [...] did not necessarily eliminate the need for compromise, or speed up decision-making). Like his contemporaries as statesmen, such as Mazarin, De Witt was a raison d'état statesman, but his raison d'état had a different content. Unlike the princely version, his disdained territorial aggrandizement, military capability for its own sake, and concentration of power in the central state. Instead, he strove to ensure security of the Dutch state, its independence from outside interference, and advancement of its trade and industry, all elements being intended to benefit the society of which the regent class were the proper representatives. The Republic, in De Witt's view, sought to attain goals which were commensurate with the interests of its citizens, not in conflict with them, as the goals of absolutist rulers often were.|$|E
60|$|Fleda found Mrs. Gereth in modest {{apartments and}} {{with an air of}} fatigue in her {{distinguished}} face--a sign, as she privately remarked, of the strain of that effort to be discreet of which she herself had been having the benefit. It was a <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> of their relation that this lady could make Fleda blench a little, and that the effect proceeded from the intense pressure of her confidence. If the confidence had been heavy even when the girl, in the early flush of devotion, had been able to feel herself most responsive, it drew her heart into her mouth now that she had reserves and conditions, now that she couldn't simplify with the same bold hand as her protectress. In the very brightening of the tired look, and at the moment of their embrace, Fleda felt on her shoulders the return of the load, so that her spirit frankly quailed as she asked herself what she had brought up from her trusted seclusion to support it. Mrs. Gereth's free manner always made a joke of weakness, and there was in such a welcome a richness, a kind of familiar nobleness, that suggested shame to a harried conscience. Something had happened, she could see, and she could also see, in the bravery that seemed to announce it had changed everything, a formidable assumption that what had happened was what a healthy young woman must like. The absence of luggage had made this young woman feel meagre even before her companion, taking in the bareness at a second glance, exclaimed upon it and roundly rebuked her. Of course she had expected her to stay.|$|E
6000|$|In Mr. Trimen's {{paper on}} [...] "Mimetic Analogies among African Butterflies," [...] in the Transactions of the Linnæan Society, for 1868, he has argued {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} Mr. Bates' views as to the higher position of the Danaidæ and the lower grade of the Papilionidæ, and has adduced, among other facts, the undoubted resemblance of the pupa of Parnassius, a genus of Papilionidæ, to that of some Hesperidæ and moths. I admit, therefore, that he has proved the Papilionidæ to have retained several characters of the nocturnal Lepidoptera which the Danaidæ have lost, but I deny that they are therefore to be considered lower in the scale of organization. Other characters may be pointed out which indicate that they are farther removed from the moths even than the Danaidæ. The club of the antennæ is the most prominent and most <b>constant</b> <b>feature</b> by which butterflies may be distinguished from moths, and of all butterflies the Papilionidæ have the most beautiful and most perfectly developed clubbed antennæ. Again, butterflies and moths are broadly characterised by their diurnal and nocturnal habits respectively, and the Papilionidæ, with their close allies the Pieridæ, are the most pre-eminently diurnal of butterflies, most of them lovers of sunshine, and not presenting a single crepuscular species. The great group of the Nymphalidæ, {{on the other hand}} (in which Mr. Bates includes the Danaidæ and Heliconidæ as sub-families), contains an entire sub-family (Brassolidæ) and a number of genera, such as Thaumantis, Zeuxidia, Pavonia, &c., of crepuscular habits, while {{a large proportion of the}} Satyridæ and many of the Danaidæ are shade-loving butterflies. This question, of what is to be considered the highest type of any group of organisms, is one of such general interest to naturalists that it will be well to consider it a little further, by a comparison of the Lepidoptera with some groups of the higher animals.|$|E
