5|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, Pflueger was already {{working with a}} number of artists such as Haig Patigian, Jo Mora and Arthur Mathews who {{provided}} fine detail and <b>craftsmanship</b> to his larger designs.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{considered}} the game an improvement on the Breakout formula and praised its gameplay <b>craftsmanship</b> and {{incorporation of the}} Kirby series. It was included in multiple top Game Boy game lists and was later emulated on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console.|$|E
5|$|Critics in {{the media}} noted BA's build quality faults, such as {{inconsistent}} gaps between trim sections and joints, although other commentators praised the interior design and <b>craftsmanship.</b> In the used car market, BA Falcons tend to suffer from poor depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market {{and because of the}} cost of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the knife was true to Emerson's {{original}} design, {{and even though}} it did not have the <b>craftsmanship</b> of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with their own version of Emerson's work at a lower price point and without the five-year wait.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Schindel and Weston Woods Studios {{made the}} 18-minute Robert McCloskey, a {{documentary}} which is sometimes screened in art schools. The film shows McCloskey sitting in Boston Public Garden and intercuts pages from his sketchbook drawings for Make Way for Ducklings. The illustrator discusses experiences that have influenced {{his work and}} the relationship of <b>craftsmanship</b> to inspiration.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of Historicism {{in the second half}} of the century, special {{importance}} was attached to high standards of <b>craftsmanship</b> and proper use of materials. This can be seen in Copenhagen's University Library (1861) designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt and inspired by St Fermo's Church in Verona.|$|E
5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by <b>craftsmanship</b> and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|Early in Ahmedabad's history, under Ahmed Shah, {{builders}} fused Hindu <b>craftsmanship</b> with Persian architecture, {{giving rise}} to the Indo-Saracenic style. Many mosques in the city were built in this fashion. Sidi Saiyyed Mosque {{was built in the}} last year of the Sultanate of Gujarat. It is entirely arched and has ten stone latticework windows or jali on the side and rear arches. Private mansions or haveli from this era have carvings. A Pol is a typical housing cluster of Old Ahmedabad.|$|E
5|$|Economically, {{the area}} depends on agriculture. Maize, rice, yuca, cotton and heart of palm are {{produced}} and exported. Cattle ranching {{and the industrial}} processing of milk and cheese have been developed extensively in recent years. Crafts, often carved of wood using the same techniques as in colonial times, provide additional income. Since {{the launch of the}} Jesuit Mission Circuit– a marketing label to promote regional tourism– in 2005, <b>craftsmanship</b> and tourism have been closely related.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{was also}} an {{innovator}} {{in the realm of}} <b>craftsmanship,</b> conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces ("trencadís") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented a new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of primary colours, and sometimes a neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's work is {{normally}} classed as modernista, and {{it belongs to}} this movement because of its eagerness to renovate without breaking with tradition, its quest for modernity, the ornamental sense applied to works, and the multidisciplinary character of its undertakings, where <b>craftsmanship</b> plays a central role. To this, Gaudí adds a dose of the baroque, adopts technical advances and continues to use traditional architectural language. Together with his inspiration from nature and the original touch of his works, this amalgam gives his works their personal and unique character {{in the history of}} architecture.|$|E
5|$|Massenet {{composed}} {{many other}} smaller-scale choral works, {{and more than}} two hundred songs. His early collections of songs were particularly popular and helped establish his reputation. His choice of lyrics ranged widely. Most were verses by poets such as Musset, Maupassant, Hugo, Gautier and many lesser-known French writers, with occasional poems from overseas, including Tennyson in English and Shelley in French translation. Grove comments that Massenet's songs, though pleasing and impeccable in <b>craftsmanship,</b> are less inventive than those of Bizet and less distinctive than those of Duparc and Fauré.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2001, {{the first}} sculpted stone was laid. The team of eight sadhus {{consisted}} of {{scholars in the}} field of the Pancharatra Shastra, a Hindu scripture on architecture and deity carving. The sadhus watched over stone work as well as the research on carvings on Indian <b>craftsmanship</b> from between eighth and twelfth century. This research was done at various sites such as Angkor Wat, as well as Jodhpur, Jagannath Puri, Konark & temples of Bhubaneswar of Odisha and other temples in South India.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a <b>craftsmanship</b> attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E
5|$|The artistic {{workshops}} {{established by}} Æthelwold reached {{a high standard}} of <b>craftsmanship</b> in manuscript illustration, sculpture and gold and silver, and were influential both in England and on the Continent. In his monasteries, learning reached a high standard, producing competent prose and poetry in the elaborate hermeneutic style of Latin favoured in tenth-century England. His Winchester school {{played an important role}} in creating the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language, and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer.|$|E
5|$|The {{arts and}} crafts of Marrakesh have had a wide and {{enduring}} impact on Moroccan handicrafts to the present day. Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, ceramics, woodwork, metal work and zelij. Carpets and textiles are weaved, sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women who practice <b>craftsmanship</b> are known as Maalems (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Berber carpets and shawls made of sabra (cactus silk). Ceramics are in monochrome Berber-style only, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{anthropologists have}} {{dominated}} the study of Navajo textiles. Most historic examples of these works belong to ethnological collections rather than fine art collections, which means items have been exhibited and analyzed {{with an eye toward}} normative or average works rather than emphasizing technical or artistic excellence. These priorities have artificially inflated the market value for items of inferior <b>craftsmanship.</b> In general, this tendency has affected most non-European art to some degree.|$|E
5|$|A C Benson was {{a friend}} of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement. A {{correspondence}} ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole to lunch at the Reform Club in London. They developed a close friendship, described by James's biographer Leon Edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and <b>craftsmanship</b> of his protégé's early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such <b>craftsmanship</b> that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Burghs had unique layouts and {{economic}} functions. They were typically {{were surrounded by}} a palisade or possessed a castle, and usually had a marketplace, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross (market cross), beside houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants. The foundations of around 15 burghs {{can be traced to}} the reign of David I and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts. Excluded from international trade they mainly acted as local markets and centres of <b>craftsmanship.</b> In general, burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands than nationally or internationally, relying on them for food and raw materials.|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality <b>craftsmanship</b> (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E
5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the <b>craftsmanship</b> of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E
5|$|Hoysala {{architecture}} is the building style developed {{under the rule}} of the Hoysala Empire between the 11th and 14th centuries, in the region known today as Karnataka, a state of India. Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the Southern Deccan Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. Other examples of Hoysala <b>craftsmanship</b> are the temples at Belavadi, Amruthapura, Hosaholalu, Mosale, Arasikere, Basaralu, Kikkeri and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, {{the time required to}} import building materials from the east, and the <b>craftsmanship</b> required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log cabin in which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into the part of the mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction {{on the rest of the}} house was finished. Federal Hill was once believed to be the first brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and <b>craftsmanship,</b> {{and the difficulty of}} maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films.|$|E
5|$|Most notable of {{the many}} {{buildings}} dating from this period are the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district, the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi in the Gadag district, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti in the Bellary district and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali in the Davangere district. Other monuments notable for their <b>craftsmanship</b> include the Kaitabheshvara Temple in Kubatur and Kedareshvara Temple in Balligavi, both in the Shimoga district, the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri in the Haveri district, the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district, the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag, and the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, both in the Gadag district.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{adopted the}} Romanesque style {{relatively}} late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much {{of the best}} Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact {{of time and the}} Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native <b>craftsmanship</b> can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration {{can be seen in the}} illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Homestead is {{a two-story}} Colonial-style home in Ledyard, Connecticut {{that was built}} circa 1696. Evidence {{suggests}} that the house may have begun as a single-story, one-room house and later expanded to a two-story, two-room house by 1726. The house underwent major additions and renovations by Theophilus Avery and later his grandson, Theophilus Avery. In the mid-1950s, Amos Avery began a decade-long restoration effort to return the house to its 18th-century appearance. The Avery Homestead is historically significant as a well-preserved example of an 18th-century farmhouse with fine <b>craftsmanship.</b> The home is also historically important because more than twelve generations of the Avery family have resided there {{over the course of}} three centuries. The Avery Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Baltic {{settlement}} {{patterns were}} being altered {{beginning in the}} 5th century by the Migration Period population shifts and the pressure from the westbound movement of the Slavic peoples. The Western Balts took over the lands left by the Wielbark culture people and reached {{the eastern part of}} the mouth of the Vistula. A major trade route connecting the southeastern Baltic areas with the Black Sea shores went now through the regions controlled by the Balts. Expansion of the Old Prussian tribes, for example the previously mentioned Galindians and Yotvingians, encompassed today's northeast Poland and the adjacent territories further north. Galindia (today's western Masuria), including the Olsztyn group, became in 6th and 7th centuries the most affluent of the Baltic people settled lands, with highly developed local <b>craftsmanship</b> supplementing the wealth of items brought from distant countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{artefacts}} recovered include {{fragments of}} pottery, charcoal, bone and a whetstone (a stone for sharpening blades). Later, on excavation, spinning whorls and weaving combs were found, suggesting textile production, although {{this may have}} been for domestic use rather than industry. Evidence of bronze-casting and iron-smelting were found. Fine jewellery made from bronze bone have also been found showing a high degree of <b>craftsmanship.</b> Files and hammer heads were examined by metallography which showed that carbon compositions were found to be generally low. In 1905 an early British tin coin was discovered, believed to be from the 1st century A.D, which was sent to the British Museum. Various other objects from the excavation are also help by the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{objects in}} the collection display a high quality of <b>craftsmanship</b> such that scholars doubt an indigenous origin. Taylor (1879), {{in one of the}} earliest works discussing the find, speculates that the objects could represent a part of the plunder acquired by Goths in the raids made on the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace (238 - 251). Another early theory, probably first proposed by Odobescu (1889) and picked up again by Giurascu (1976), identifies Athanaric, pagan king of the Gothic Thervingi, as the likely owner of the hoard, presumably acquired through the conflict with the Roman Emperor Valens in 369. The Goldhelm catalogue (1994) suggests that the objects could also be viewed as having been gifts made by Roman leaders to allied Germanic princes.|$|E
5|$|The undulating garland motif {{against a}} black {{background}} {{found in the}} masonry-style mural paintings at Delos were also featured in earlier Greek works of art ranging from vases to 4th-century-BC Macedonian mosaics of Pella, particularly the Stag Hunt Mosaic. However, the painters of Delos arguably invented their own decorative genre {{using a combination of}} these older elements with new naturalistic coloring. Aside from the black background, mosaics like the Stag Hunt Mosaic were also inspired by the illusionist, three-dimensional qualities of Greek paintings. At Delos, paintings and mosaics inherited the same Classical Greek standards of <b>craftsmanship,</b> lighting, shading, and coloring. Sculptors, painters, and mosaic artists may have all been part of the same system of patronage at Delos, which in some instances would have necessitated the importation of foreign artists.|$|E
5|$|White Star then {{ordered a}} new 212-foot bow section from Harland and Wolff in Belfast, which was {{launched}} head-first in October 1907. It was popularly {{said at the}} time that Suevic was the longest ship in the world, with her bow in Belfast and her stern in Southampton. The new bow was then towed to the shipyard of J.I. Thornycroft in Southampton, where it arrived on 26 October. By mid-November it was in position and being joined {{to the rest of the}} ship. The bow was a good fit, a testimony to the <b>craftsmanship</b> of the Harland and Wolff shipwrights. Ten months later, after the largest ship rebuilding effort ever undertaken at the time, on 14 January 1908, Suevic was completed and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|Work from Ahmose's reign {{is made of}} much finer {{material}} {{than anything}} from the Second Intermediate Period, though the <b>craftsmanship</b> from his reign does not always match the best work from either the Old or Middle Kingdoms. With the Delta and Nubia under Egyptian control once more, access was gained to resources not available in Upper Egypt. Gold and silver were received from Nubia, Lapis Lazuli from distant parts of central Asia, cedar from Byblos, and in the Sinai the Serabit el-Khadim turquoise mines were reopened. Although {{the exact nature of}} the relationship between Egypt and Crete is uncertain, at least some Minoan designs have been found on objects from this period, and Egypt considered the Aegean to be part of its empire. Ahmose reopened the Tura limestone quarries to provide stone for monuments and used Asiatic cattle from Phoenicia to haul the stone, according to his quarry inscription.|$|E
