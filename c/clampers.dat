50|$|In 1991 {{there were}} 50,000 <b>Clampers</b> in 62 lodges.|$|E
50|$|A {{clamping}} circuit (also {{known as a}} clamper) will bind the upper or lower extreme of a waveform to a fixed DC voltage level. These circuits are also known as DC voltage restorers. <b>Clampers</b> can be constructed in {{both positive and negative}} polarities. When unbiased, {{clamping circuit}}s will fix the voltage lower limit (or upper limit, in the case of negative <b>clampers)</b> to 0 Volts.These circuits clamp a peak of a waveform to a specific DC level compared with a capacitively coupled signal which swings about its average DC level.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clamper</b> - Another lifter variant, the <b>clamper</b> adds an arm or claw that descends {{from above}} {{to secure the}} {{opposing}} robot in place on a lifting platform. The entire assembly then lifts and carries the opponent wherever the operator pleases. Two-time BattleBots super heavyweight champion Diesector was an electric <b>clamper.</b>|$|R
50|$|A New Zealand wheel <b>clamper</b> made {{national}} {{headlines in}} 2013 after he secretly recorded {{a police officer}} allegedly threatening to not help if an aggrieved member of the public attacked him. It {{was not the first}} time the <b>clamper</b> involved had been in the news.|$|R
50|$|By using {{a voltage}} source and resistor, the <b>clamper</b> can be biased to bind the output voltage to a {{different}} value. The voltage supplied to the potentiometer will be equal to the offset from zero (assuming an ideal diode) {{in the case of}} either a positive or negative <b>clamper</b> (the <b>clamper</b> type will determine the direction of the offset). If a negative voltage is supplied to either positive or negative, the waveform will cross the x-axis and be bound to a value of this magnitude on the opposite side. Zener diodes can also be used in place of a voltage source and potentiometer, hence setting the offset at the Zener voltage.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, {{she made}} a guest {{appearance}} on the British TV show As Yet Untitled and told an anecdote about her car being double clamped by over efficient <b>clampers</b> to whom she was rude over the phone. Alan liked her stories enough to consider naming the episode after one of her quotes: [...] "Would you ever fuck off?".|$|E
50|$|In early 2011, he {{recorded}} {{a series of}} four live performances called Tom Wrigglesworth's Open Letters for BBC Radio 4. Each episode was based on different examples of maddening corporate policies {{in areas such as}} utility companies and wheel <b>clampers.</b> Each episode highlighted the sometimes infuriating rationales behind huge organisations, and featured a letter from his grandmother to try {{to get to the bottom}} of the comedic issues raised in the programme. A second series of the same format was then aired in May 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The {{speech is}} also parodied in the 2001 British drama film Mean Machine, {{starring}} Vinnie Jones. In the film, {{at the conclusion}} of the match between the guards and the prisoners at the fictional Longmarsh prison, in a 3-2 win for the prisoners, the commentators, Bob Likely (Jason Flemyng) and Bob Carter (Jake Abraham) quoted [...] "Guards of Pentonville, Guards of Wandsworth, Walton nick in Liverpool, Policemen of Britain, Traffic Wardens, Parole officers, Wheel <b>clampers,</b> your boys have taken a helluva beating today, a helluva beating!" ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>clamper</b> is an {{electronic}} circuit that fixes either the positive or the negative peak excursions of {{a signal to}} a defined value by shifting its DC value. The <b>clamper</b> does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level. A diode clamp (a simple, common type) consists of a diode, which conducts electric current in only one direction and prevents the signal exceeding the reference value; and a capacitor which provides a DC offset from the stored charge. The capacitor forms a time constant with the resistor load which determines the range of frequencies over which the <b>clamper</b> will be effective.|$|R
50|$|A circuit {{designer}} may intentionally use a clipper or <b>clamper</b> {{to keep a}} signal within a desired range.|$|R

50|$|In 1994, Lambert {{became the}} {{founding}} editor of BBC2's main documentary strand of the 1990s, Modern Times. While running Modern Times, he executive produced {{some of the}} first BBC1 docu-soaps, including The <b>Clampers</b> and Lakesiders, as well as the fly-on-the-wall series about Sunderland A.F.C., Premier Passions and the five part Royal Television Society award-winning series about the Department of Social Security called The System. Lambert also started a long working relationship with the film-maker Adam Curtis, executive producing his series The Mayfair Set, winner of the 1999 BAFTA best factual series award.|$|E
50|$|The BPA {{welcomed the}} {{change as a}} move to marginalise rogue <b>clampers,</b> but felt that the {{legislation}} took away a valuable form of enforcement for landowners {{to use in the}} protection of their land. In order to ensure that private enforcement remained with a robust solution, the BPA's discussions with Government resulted in a form of keeper liability being introduced with the Protection of Freedoms Act, allowing the private operator in England and Wales to pursue the registered keeper of a vehicle if a named driver cannot be traced or denies liability.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} order {{appears to have been}} to initiate new members. When a stranger came to town, <b>Clampers</b> would inform him that to do business in the town it was essential to join the local secret society. The initiation rite was a parody of Freemasonic, Oddfellow and other orders, and took many forms, including rowing the initiate down in a wheelbarrow, hoisting him into the air and leaving him there, or dropping him into a vat of water. Afterwards, the initiate had to buy the other members a round of drinks.|$|E

5000|$|The conspirators found {{a number}} of ways of trying to tip off Bolton without {{actually}} coming forward themselves. V. L. VanderHoof, a fellow <b>Clamper</b> and Berkeley professor, actually created a spoof of the plate only {{a few weeks after the}} announcement of the find, hoping to show Bolton that modern tools could make a plate that looked remarkably like the [...] "real" [...] plate. <b>Clamper</b> Edwin Grabhorn, a Western history publisher, published a spoof letter from the [...] "Consolidated Brasse and Novelty Company" [...] offering a [...] "special line of brass plates" [...] guaranteed to [...] "make your home-town famous." ...|$|R
50|$|Michael {{heads to}} Delgado's Pool Hall, a nearby snooker bar, {{in search of}} a man known as The Mutt (Liam Cunningham), who {{provides}} loans. There, Michael's friend Clifford (Domhnall Gleeson) explains that The Mutt was recently thrown out of the bar after assaulting a man who insulted his snooker skills. Leaving the bar, Michael clashes with two <b>clampers</b> (Ned Dennehy and Glenn Speers), who vow to find him and clamp his car later. Michael goes home to find his father, Jim McCrea (Jim Broadbent), waiting outside. Their relationship is not good, and Michael is reluctant to talk. However, Jim reveals that he is dying of cancer and wishes to reconcile. The two go to a pub to drink, but while there, Michael learns of The Mutt's location in another pub. He abandons his father, promising to talk later.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{many other}} mining towns, fire was its bane {{and the town}} was {{destroyed}} three times by flames, in 1859, 1874, and 1893. After the second major fire, there was little gold left to mine, and so the town was never rebuilt to its boomtown condition. However, Murphys continued to thrive as a merchant center, supplying many of the silver mines in Nevada with provisions via Ebbetts Pass. The town is registered as California Historical Landmark #275. A [...] "Hall of Comparative Ovations" [...] built by a chapter of the <b>clampers</b> still stands in Murphys. The picture below labeled [...] "Murphys' Famous Residents Wall" [...] {{is a picture of}} the [...] "Wall of Comparative Ovations" [...] at the [...] "Old Timer Museum" [...] in Murphys, CA. The plaques on the wall are installed and maintained by members of [...] "E Clampus Vitus." ...|$|E
30|$|VanLehn at ASU {{prepared}} {{a document that}} covers the following scope and sequence of topics based on the Navy curriculum at A-school: circuit analysis, Ohm’s law, series circuits, parallel circuits, PN junctions, diode limiters, diode <b>clampers,</b> transistors, CE amplifiers, CC amplifiers, CB amplifiers, multistage amplifiers, and push-pull amplifiers. That being said, the Navy and individual instructors may have different visions on the selection of topics and the order of topics in the course. Such changes {{can be made in}} the Course Calendar facility of ElectronixTutor.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Clamper</b> {{meetings}} {{were held in}} the Hall of Comparative Ovations, generally {{the back room of}} a saloon. Some chapters even built their own Halls of Comparative Ovations. One still stands in Murphys. The <b>Clamper</b> flag was a hoop skirt, with the words [...] "This is the flag we fight under." [...] Meetings were held [...] "at any time before or after a full moon." [...] New members were called [...] "Poor Blind Candidates." [...] They were required to present a poke of gold dust, although the value of the poke was left to the discretion of the brotherhood, and was frequently waived entirely if the prospective member could not afford it.|$|R
30|$|The LearnForm {{problems}} {{available for}} ElectronixTutor are organized {{in two different}} sections: basic circuits and advanced circuits. The basic circuits section includes 46 problems. These were developed by two teachers along with problems in other topics in a high school-level physics course (e.g., electrostatics) that {{are not part of}} the target curriculum of ElectronixTutor. The basic circuit problems cover three types of resistor circuits (series, parallel, and complex). An additional 16 problems included in the advanced circuits section were developed by one electronics subject matter expert. These problems introduce transistor- and diode-based circuits, including diode limiters, diode <b>clampers,</b> and five configurations of transistor-based amplifiers (common emitter, common collector, common base, push-pull, and multi-stage).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} an Ambient Intelligence system that targets energy consumption awareness and savings. The system was deployed at the School of Science and Technology of the International Hellenic University and follows a three-layer approach. The first layer hosts devices (currently smart plugs, sensor boards and smart <b>clampers)</b> {{suited for the}} purpose. The second layer, namely the aWESoME middleware (a WEb Service MiddlewarE), resolves interoperability issues on the first layer, by universally exposing all actuator functions and sensor data through Web Services. Finally, a prototype application, named iDEALISM, has been developed to reside on the topmost layer. iDEALISM {{presents an}}d manages all heterogeneous devices in the same place, enabling users to make comparisons, and take informed decisions on saving energy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a mechanism {{specifically designed for}} locomotion in the wet, collapsible and tortuous human gastrointestinal (GI) tract (the colon in particular). Previous works peformed in the authors ’laboratory were devoted to the fabrication of semi-autonomous inchworm locomotion devices for navigation in the colon; in this paper a firther analysis of limitations and problems of these devices has been performed. The main limitation consists of the poor eflciency of these devices to negotiate acute bends (due to what the authors termed as the “accordion effect’.) and, in general, to advance in the scarcely supported colon tissue. Thus a direrent approach to locomotion has been developed based on ‘‘sliding <b>clampers</b> ”. This locomotion principle has been implemented in a minirobot system and has demonstrated (both theoretically and experimentally) {{to be effective in}} reducing the “accordion effect’’. 1...|$|E

40|$|A single-switch fully-controlled {{three-phase}} rectifier is presented, {{which provides}} high AC power factor and wide DC voltage regulation while allowing high-frequency insulation. Owing to one-cycle control, output voltage ripple is also eliminated. Moreover, switch voltage stress {{is limited by}} a lossless <b>clamper</b> circuit, resulting in safe operation and high efficiency...|$|R
50|$|In {{general the}} <b>clamper</b> {{includes}} a capacitor, {{followed by a}} diode in parallel with the load. The <b>clamper</b> circuit relies on {{a change in the}} capacitor's time constant which {{is the result of the}} diode changing the current path of the capacitor with the changing polarity of the AC input voltage. The magnitude of R and C are chosen so that the time constant, , is large enough to ensure that the voltage across the capacitor does not discharge significantly during the diode's non-conducting interval. However this kind of discharge only happens when the load resistor is very big, which takes the capacitor a lot of time to discharge, and can be ignored at high frequencies. On the other hand, the capacitor is chosen small enough to allow it to charge quickly during the diode's conducting interval. At the same time, the AC supply voltage frequency should be chosen low enough for the capacitor to fully charge in one quarter of a cycle.|$|R
40|$|Antiferroelectrics (AFE) can {{exhibit a}} “shape memory {{function}} controllable by electric field”, with huge isotropic volumetric expansion (0. 26 %) {{associated with the}} AFE to Ferroelectric (FE) phase transformation. Small inverse electric field application can realize the original AFE phase. The response speed is quick (2. 5 ms). In the Pb 0. 99 Nb 0. 02 [(Zr 0. 6 Sn 0. 4) 1 -yTiy] 0. 98 O 3 (PNZST) system, the shape memory function is observed in the intermediate range between high temperature AFE and low temperature FE, or low Ti-concentration AFE and high Ti-concentration FE in the composition. In the AFE multilayer actuators (MLAs), the crack is initiated {{in the center of}} a pair of internal electrodes under cyclic electric field, rather than the edge area of the internal electrodes in normal piezoelectric MLAs. The two-sublattice polarization coupling model is proposed to explain: (1) isotropic volume expansion during the AFE-FE transformation; and (2) piezoelectric anisotropy. We introduce latching relays and mechanical <b>clampers</b> as possible unique applications of shape memory ceramics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAutomated {{assembly}} {{systems in}} automotive industry require thorough digital validation procedures prior to commissioning and ramp-up processes. One essential validation procedure is Virtual Commissioning, {{a method to}} test and validate real PLC-programs based on a virtual 3 D-model of the production system using a HiL-approach. In order to increase the level of maturity of Virtual Commissioning and enrich {{the quality of the}} virtual 3 D-model of the production system an innovative simulation approach using physics-based simulation capabilities based on game engine technology has been adopted. In particular, a physics-based model of pneumatic components (cylinders, <b>clampers,</b> etc.) typically found in automated assembly systems has been developed. The physics-based pneumatic model (PPM) enables more realistic simulations in real-time and is expected to be used within the next generation of Virtual Commissioning. However, before being utilized in industrial application PPM has to be validated. Kinematic and dynamic accuracy as well as compressed air consumption - a key performance indicator for energy consumption of the entire production system - of the PPM model are analytically and experimentally validated. In detail, validation was carried out considering different internal and external model parameters, such as pressure level, throttle valve settings, etc. and analyzing their impact on the PPM's informative value. Overall, PPM's validation shows promising results throughout all three different aspects (kinematics, dynamics, and compressed air consumption) and has thus a high potential for application in Virtual Commissioning...|$|E
