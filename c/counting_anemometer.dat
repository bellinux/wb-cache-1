50|$|The {{resulting}} term is {{one that}} can be easily calculated from the results of two simple measurements: a pressure survey by the gauge and tube method and a flowrate survey with a <b>counting</b> <b>anemometer.</b> This is a major strength and is the reason why Atkinson resistance remains in use today.|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{droplet size}} and {{velocity}} measurements by a particle <b>counting</b> Laser Doppler <b>Anemometer</b> (LDA) in kerosene fuel sprays under burning and non-burning conditions are presented. Particle sizes {{are derived from}} pulse height analysis of the mean LDA signals and velocities are simultaneously determined by measuring Doppler shift frequencies. The measurements show that droplet velocity {{is a function of}} droplet diameter for burning and non-burning conditions, and spatially averaged size distributions are derived from velocity data. A comparison of results obtained under burning and non-burning conditions show changes in size distribution due to preferential vaporization of small droplets, acceleration due to thermal expansion of gases, and corresponding changes in droplet momentum...|$|R
