5|$|Atomic <b>carbon</b> {{is a very}} {{short-lived}} species and, therefore, <b>carbon</b> is stabilized {{in various}} multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes. The three relatively well-known allotropes of <b>carbon</b> are amorphous <b>carbon,</b> graphite, and diamond. Once considered exotic, fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include buckyballs, <b>carbon</b> nanotubes, <b>carbon</b> nanobuds and nanofibers. Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as lonsdaleite (questionable), glassy <b>carbon,</b> <b>carbon</b> nanofoam and linear acetylenic <b>carbon</b> (carbyne).|$|E

5|$|<b>Carbon</b> is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic <b>carbon</b> (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of <b>carbon</b> under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises <b>carbon</b> atoms bonded to three other <b>carbon</b> atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{citric acid}} cycle is an 8-step process {{involving}} 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes. [...] During the cycle, acetyl-CoA (2 <b>carbons)</b> + oxaloacetate (4 <b>carbons)</b> yields citrate (6 <b>carbons),</b> which is rearranged {{to a more}} reactive form called isocitrate (6 <b>carbons).</b> Isocitrate is modified to become α-ketoglutarate (5 <b>carbons),</b> succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, finally, oxaloacetate.|$|R
25|$|Short-chain {{alcohols}} have alkyl {{chains of}} 1–3 <b>carbons.</b> Medium-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 4–7 <b>carbons.</b> Long-chain alcohols (also known as fatty alcohols) have alkyl chains of 8–21 <b>carbons,</b> and very long-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 22 <b>carbons</b> or longer.|$|R
40|$|Carbon- 13 {{chemical}} {{shifts of}} the cyclopropyl <b>carbons</b> of eleven 4 -substituted cyclopropylbenzenes have been measured under conditions effectively corresponding to infinite dilution in DCCI_ 3. The substituent-induced chemical shifts (SCS) {{of both the}} α and β <b>carbons</b> of the cyclopropane ring {{were found to be}} downfield with electron-attracting groups and upfield for electron-donating groups. The trends for the β <b>carbons</b> correspond to those observed for the β <b>carbons</b> of 4 -substituted phenylethenes, while the trends of the α <b>carbons</b> are similar to those found for the α <b>carbons</b> of 4 -substituted isopropyl benzenes. The results for the β <b>carbons</b> can be rationalized by postulating a substantial contribution from a hyperconjugative resonance effect involving the σ system of the benzene ring (and its 4 -substituent) and the C-α—C-β bonds of the cyclopropane ring. The effects on the α <b>carbons</b> are in accord with a very reasonable smaller inductive polarization of the C-α-C-β bonds than encountered for the <b>carbons</b> of corresponding ethenyl- or ethynylbenzenes...|$|R
5|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively-cycled <b>carbon</b> {{in the world}} and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of <b>carbon</b> they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic <b>carbon</b> that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic <b>carbon</b> is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges <b>carbon</b> between these two layers.|$|E
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} <b>carbon</b> on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use <b>carbon</b> must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of <b>carbon</b> in the environment form the <b>carbon</b> cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw <b>carbon</b> dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of <b>carbon</b> fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some <b>carbon</b> is exhaled by animals as <b>carbon</b> dioxide. The <b>carbon</b> cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some <b>carbon</b> dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases <b>carbon</b> when burned.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% <b>carbon</b> (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The <b>carbon</b> no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of <b>carbon.</b> One way for <b>carbon</b> to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} <b>carbon</b> in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% <b>carbon),</b> the <b>carbon</b> will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of <b>carbon</b> in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% <b>carbon),</b> at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% <b>carbon</b> (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of <b>carbon,</b> at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the <b>carbon</b> to migrate.|$|E

40|$|Mongolian {{different}} rank coals {{were used}} as raw material to prepare activated <b>carbons</b> by physical activation method. The coal derived <b>carbons</b> were oxidized with nitric acid in order to introduce surface oxygen groups. The ultimate elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, surface area, pore size distribution analysis and selective neutralization method were used to characterize the surface properties of activated <b>carbons,</b> oxidized <b>carbons</b> and raw coals. The effect of coal grade on the adsorption properties of the <b>carbons</b> were studied. It was concluded that Naryn sukhait bituminous coal could be serve as suitable raw material for production of activated <b>carbons</b> for removal of heavy metal ions from solution.

50|$|Signals from {{quaternary}} <b>carbons</b> {{and other}} <b>carbons</b> with no attached protons are always absent (due {{to the lack}} of attached protons).|$|R
5|$|All {{of these}} {{temperatures}} {{could be reached}} with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond , {{it is important that}} smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using <b>carbon</b> to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy (pig iron) that retains too much <b>carbon</b> to be called steel. The excess <b>carbon</b> and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the <b>carbon</b> will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the <b>carbon</b> has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of <b>carbon</b> and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the <b>carbon</b> content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% <b>carbon,</b> it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher <b>carbon</b> content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
5|$|By August 2012, {{the very}} low European <b>carbon</b> prices dragged the NZU price down to $NZ4.55 per tonne of <b>carbon.</b> In mid September 2012, NZUs were selling for $NZ4.20 a tonne. In late October 2012, New Zealand <b>carbon</b> prices dropped to about $NZ1 a tonne for {{some types of}} credits. On 10 December 2012, the NZU spot price was $2.70 and it had {{declined}} by 72 percent over the 2012 year. In February 2013, Westpac's <b>carbon</b> dealing desk noted that imported European <b>carbon</b> credits were trading for 28 NZ cents and the price for NZUs was $NZ2.50.

40|$|The aim {{of work is}} {{to study}} the {{adsorption}} of a common volatile organic compound such as toluene using activated <b>carbons</b> prepared by chemical activation with phosphoric acid of a lignocellulosic precursor, almond shell, under different conditions. The Impregnation ratio, temperature and time of activation were modified to obtain activated <b>carbons</b> with different characteristics. Regarding {{the characteristics of the}} activated <b>carbons,</b> the effects of porous structure and surface chemistry on the toluene adsorption capacity from toluene isotherms have been analysed. Results show that the control of properties of the activated <b>carbons,</b> particularly porous structure, highly dependent on the preparation conditions, plays a decisive role on the toluene adsorption capacity of the activated <b>carbons.</b> Concerning the experiments of toluene adsorption conducted in dynamic mode, activated <b>carbons</b> prepared at low temperatures of activation show higher breakthrough times than those obtained for activated <b>carbons</b> prepared at higher activation temperatures. The amount of toluene adsorbed in presence of water vapor in the gas stream lead to a decrease ranging from 33 to 46 % except for <b>carbons</b> prepared at higher temperatures activated that show only a slight decrease in the amount of toluene adsorbed. Activated <b>carbons</b> can be regenerated with soft heat treatment showing a slight decrease in the adsorption capacity. The high toluene adsorption capacities as well as the high breakthrough times obtained in presence of water vapor make these activated <b>carbons</b> suitable for commercial applications...|$|R
50|$|Both isoprenoid chains, geranylgeranyl {{pyrophosphate}} (GGpp) and farnesyl pyrophosphate {{are products}} of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. The product of HMG CoA reductase is mevalonate. By combining precursors with 5 <b>carbons,</b> the pathway subsequently produces geranyl pyrophosphate (10 <b>carbons),</b> farnesyl pyrophosphate (15 <b>carbons)</b> and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (20 <b>carbons).</b> Two farnesyl pyrophosphate groups can also be combined to form squalene, the precursor for cholesterol. This means that statins, which inhibit HMG CoA reductase, inhibit the production of both cholesterol and isoprenoids.|$|R
