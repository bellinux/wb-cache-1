40|$|Plastics {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used materials today in an immense range of applications. Since plastics originate from petroleum, which is not a renewable resource, we need to find alternatives to achieve environmentally sustainable goals. One of our most abundant renewable resources is cereals; wheat gluten is recognized as a replacement for synthetic plastics. Another <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> is pennisetin from pearl millet, which can grow in more arid areas and is therefore an important crop in times of climate change. In contrast to gluten, the material properties of pennisetin have as yet been relatively unexplored. This work evaluated the mechanical and barrier properties of pennisetin films, including three different plasticizers (glycerol only, glycerol/citric acid mixture, and glycerol/lactic acid/polyethylene glycol mixture). The films were cast from ethanol solutions. It was found that all of the three plasticizers resulted in approximately equal thermomechanical properties in the pennisetin films. However, the glycerol/citric acid mixture seemed to give more beneficial tensile and barrier properties. The advantage of this plasticizer mixture was believed to be due to the altered microstructure of the films. The material properties of pennisetin were found to be fully comparable to those of other <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> materials...|$|E

During the past 25 y, deficiency of zinc in humans due to nutritional factors and several disease states has now been recognized. The high phytate content of <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins</b> is known to decrease the availability of zinc, thus the prevalence of zinc deficiency {{is likely to be}} high in a population consuming large quantities of <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins.</b> Alcoholism, malabsorption, sickle cell anemia, chronic renal disease, and chronically de-bilitating diseases are now known to be predisposing factors for zinc deficiency.

40|$|Materials {{that are}} {{renewable}} and biodegradable are demanded for environmental reasons. Biopolymeric materials, such as materials from starch and cereal proteins, are both renewable and biodegradable. However, starch and <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> materials are generally rather brittle and therefore {{need to be}} plasticized to become more flexible. Investigations were made of physical properties, such as thermomechanical, tensile and barrier properties, of starch and proteins from maize, oats and sorghum with different levels of plasticizers. Avenin was weaker {{than the other two}} cereal proteins but more extensible at low plasticizer contents. Zein was the most extensible of the films with high plasticizer content. The manufacturing conditions of films made of high amylose maize starch affected the molecular structure of the starch as determined by light microscopy and size exclusion chromatography, which in turn affected the film forming properties. The mechanical properties were not significantly affected by the manufacturing conditions, however, and the films were found to be equally strong and extensible as zein and kafirin films with similar plasticizer contents. The mechanical properties of native starches were highly dependent on their amylose content, and to some extent also on their phosphate content. Films from pure amylose were the strongest, even stronger than <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> films at a similar plasticizer content. Films made of potato starch with a low phosphate content seemed to possess an optimal combination of amylose and phosphate content since they displayed superior extensibility and wet resistance. Kafirin and zein exhibited approximately the same barrier properties, whereas avenin was more permeable. Due to the troublesome fragility of cereal proteins, the plasticization effect of water, glycerol and 2 -mercaptoethanol in zein films were investigated in thermomechanical and spectroscopy (infrared and dielectric) studies. It was found that the mechanisms of water and glycerol did not differ significantly from each other by the hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein. Neither had any greater effect on the protein conformation. 2 -mercaptoethanol seemed only to have a small plasticizing effect, completely different from the effects of water and glycerol...|$|E

Distinction between the various genotypes of any cereal species is important to segregate grains according to utilization type.

Although it is generally accepted that <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> activation {{of the immune system}} is involved in CD progression, a non-immunomediated cytotoxic activity of gliadin-derived peptides on the jejunal/duodenal tract cannot be excluded. In this work, considering that (a) little has been reported about the intracellular metabolic events associated with gliadin toxicity, and (b) an important role for free radicals in a number of gastrointestinal disease has been demonstrated, we investigated the in vitro effects of gliadin-derived peptides on redox metabolism of Caco- 2 intestinal cells during a kinetic study in which cells were exposed to peptic–tryptic digest of bread wheat up to 48 h. We found that the antiproliferative effects displayed by gliadin exposure was associated with intracellular oxidative imbalance, characterised by an increased presence of lipid peroxides, an augmented oxidised (GSSG) /reduced (GSH) glutathione ratio and a loss in protein-bound sulfhydryl groups. Significant structural perturbations of the cell plasma membrane were also detected. Additional experiments performed by using the specific GSH-depleting agent buthionine sulfoximine provide evidence that the extent of gliadin-induced cell growth arrest critically depends upon the ‘basal’ redox profile of the enterocytes. On the whole, these findings seem to suggest that, besides the adoption of a strictly gluten-free diet, the possibility for an adjuvant therapy with antioxidants may be considered for CD patients...|$|E

A market overview conducted as part of this thesis on nutritional and sensory quality of commercially available gluten free breads and pasta showed that improvements are necessary.

Since the life-long avoidance of the <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> gluten means a major change to the diet, it is important to also consider the nutritional value of products intending to replace staple foods such as bread or pasta.

Thus, higher productivity must be reached through sustainable production by taking into account climate change, resources rarefaction like phosphorus and water, and losses of fertile lands. Enhancing crop diversity is increasingly recognized as a crucial lever for sustainable agro-ecological development. Growing legumes, a major biological nitrogen source, is also a powerful option to reduce synthetic nitrogen fertilizers use and associated fossil energy consumption. Organic farming, which does not allow the use of chemical, is also regarded as one prototype to enhance the sustainability of modern agriculture while decreasing environmental impacts.

Our review {{is based on a}} literature analysis reinforced with integration of an original dataset of 58 field experiments conducted since 2001 in contrasted pedo-climatic European conditions in order to generalize the findings and draw up common guidelines. The major points are that intercropping lead to: (i) higher and more stable grain yield than the mean sole crops (0. 33 versus 0. 27 kg m(- 2)), (ii) higher <b>cereal</b> <b>protein</b> concentration than in sole crop (11. 1 versus 9. 8 %), (iii) higher and more stable gross margin than the mean sole crops (702 versus 577 a,not signaEuro parts per thousand ha(- 1)) and (iv) improved use of abiotic resources according to species complementarities for light interception and use of both soil mineral nitrogen and atmospheric N- 2.

In contrast, mice raised on the wheat-based diet responded poorly to immunization with either whole gliadin or omega-gliadin and were virtually non-responsive to enzymic digest of gluten. Diet {{had little effect on}} the magnitude of the antibody response to wheat salt-soluble proteins, with both groups showing a 300 -fold increase in titre. Similarly, tolerance to alpha-zeins, the alcohol-soluble proteins of maize, did not occur on either diet. However, some oral tolerance was observed to maize glutelin. The specificity of the various antibody responses was then analysed by immunoblotting. Following immunization with gluten proteins or digests, antibodies from the maize-fed mice bound more or less equally to each of the main gliadin bands and to the glutenins while the mice on the wheat-based diet had antibody specific for omega-gliadin proteins. Serum antibodies from the maize-fed mice, immunized with either alpha-zein or maize glutelin, showed even labelling of the major maize endosperm proteins while antibodies from mice on the wheat diet showed strong labelling of the Mr 27, 000 and 58, 000 bands. These results show that diet influenced the specificity, as well as the magnitude of serum antibody responses to <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins.</b> In addition, oral tolerance appeared to affect the humoral response to some <b>cereal</b> <b>proteins</b> more than others. Both of these findings have important implications for our understanding of coeliac disease...|$|R
