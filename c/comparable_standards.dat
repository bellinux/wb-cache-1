40|$|Transnational or {{cross-border}} {{education is}} one of the fastest growth areas for higher education. Whether institutions are establishing offshore campuses, delivering programs with partners or developing joint or double degrees, the assurance of academic standards is critical. This paper explores the notion of equivalent and <b>comparable</b> <b>standards</b> in transnational education and provides evidence of what institutions consider important to demonstrate these standards. The assessment of student outcomes and the moderation of assessment are critical. Moderation provides effective calibration of standards to ensure that judgements of achievement are comparable across different locations. Despite this the process of moderation is not well researched. This paper explores the process of moderation further and suggests how moderation is not only able to assure and demonstrate standards, but also provides on going dialogue around contextualization and opportunities for professional development...|$|E
