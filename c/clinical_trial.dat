40|$|Summary: The {{goal of the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) <b>Clinical</b> <b>Trials</b> Program is {{to foster}} <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> that will provide the {{evidence}} needed to inform clinical care. The NINDS currently supports clinical research in over 150 neurological disorders. The rapid pace of preclinical discovery and the diversity of neurological diseases, however, present challenges for <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> There is {{a growing number of}} potential interventions to be tested in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> The NINDS <b>Clinical</b> <b>Trials</b> program is therefore exploring ways of making drug selection for <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> more evidence-based. Additionally, NINDS supports pilot <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> that focus on the timely and efficient testing of agents to determine if resource-intensive comparative efficacy trials are warranted. In concert with the National Institutes of Health Roadmap, NINDS is planning to expand <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> infrastructure. This infrastructure is intended to enable the conduct of <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> for rare diseases and diseases without previous trials experience and facilitate the recruitment of a broad range of participants. Rigorous programs to select agents, and design and monitor <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> will encourage the efficient use of this <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> infrastructure and will ensure that NINDS-funded studies meet the highest scientific and ethical standards...|$|R

5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E

5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term <b>clinical</b> <b>trial</b> of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
