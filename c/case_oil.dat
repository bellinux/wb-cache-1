50|$|Generally, a {{shallower}} cooking vessel is {{used for}} pan frying than deep frying. (Using a deep pan {{with a small amount}} of oil, butter or bacon grease does reduce spatter.) A denser cooking vessel is better than a less dense pan because that mass will improve temperature regulation. An electric skillet can be used analogously to an electric deep fryer and many of these devices have a thermostat to keep the liquid (in this <b>case,</b> <b>oil)</b> at the desired temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{palm oil}} {{industry}} has had {{both positive and}} negative impacts on workers, indigenous peoples and residents of palm oil-producing communities.

The use of illegal immigrants in Malaysia has also raised concerns about working conditions within the palm oil industry.|$|R

5000|$|This {{experiment}} introduces {{students to}} the concept of an index of refraction in a liquid. Glass rods are placed in beakers of liquid, in this <b>case</b> <b>oil</b> and water.

In the oil, however, the glass rods seem to disappear because they have a refractive index very similar to that of glass, so the light doesn't bend as it crosses the glass/oil interface.|$|E
