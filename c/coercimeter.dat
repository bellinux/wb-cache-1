40|$|A special {{instrument}} {{has been built}} to measure the coercivity directly on steel sheets without having to cut samples. It {{will be used to}} perform the 8000 coercivity measurements which will be needed during the production of the 11 ' 000 ton of steel sheets for the LEP dipole magents. The <b>coercimeter</b> allows local and directional coercivity measurements to be made on a steel sheet with an accuracy of 3 % and a reproductibility of better than 1 %. The permeability can also be measured with similar precision...|$|E

Here "coercivity {{metering}} " or "coercimetry " (c. m.) means a {{non-destructive testing}} of the mechanical properties, deflected mode and fatigue capacity based on measurements of the magnetic characteristic of metal – i. e. coercivity. All listed below merits are most fully achieved when working with <b>coercimeters</b> (magnetic structure scopes) of SSE Company. And it is so not because the authors represent this company but rather because these devices feature a number of consumer and technical merits, which those of other manufacturers do not. Among them, {{the main thing is}} the highest clearance insensitivity i. e. when the device readings depend only on the properties of the metal, they do not depend on confounding factors, such as protective coating (paint, film, etc.) up to 6 mm (!) thick on the tested metal, or equivalent to such clearance corrosion layers, roughness, curvature of the surface, etc...|$|R
