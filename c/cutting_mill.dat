40|$|Abstract. Laboratorial {{studies were}} carried out to characterise the {{influence}} of different cutting systems (grab shredder and <b>cutting</b> <b>mill)</b> on the physical processing efficiency of spent Zn-MnO 2 batteries. The grab shredder operate based on an indented cutting rotor which applies shear and abrasion stresses with a moderate rotation speed, while the <b>cutting</b> <b>mill</b> operation is based on shear and impact stresses at higher rotation speed. After shredding with the grab shredder, two fractions of material were obtained (above and below the 6 mm discharge grid), which allows a previous separation of the scrap. With the <b>cutting</b> <b>mill,</b> all the grinded material passed the bottom grid (with the same 6 mm opening). Results obtained showed that alkaline batteries were more efficiently shredded than saline batteries, mainly with the grab shredder. Average diameters (d 50) for saline and alkaline batteries fragmented with the grab shredder were 2. 29 and 1. 47 mm respectively, while with the <b>cutting</b> <b>mill</b> were 3. 09 and 1. 54 mm respectively.

40|$|Methods for {{processing}} feedstuffs before analysis can affect analytical results. Effects of drying temperature (corn silage), preservation method (corn grain), and grinding method (corn silage and grain) on starch analysis values were evaluated. Corn silage samples dried at 55 or 105 °C and grain samples dried at 55 °C were ground {{to pass the}} 1 -mm screen of an abrasion mill or <b>cutting</b> <b>mill</b> and analyzed for free glucose and starch corrected for free glucose. Starch analyses were performed in triplicate to assess the effect of treatment on precision of starch determination. Drying at 105 °C decreased free glucose and tended to decrease starch detected in silage. Decreased free glucose and starch values in silages dried at 105 °C may {{have been caused by}} the destruction of glucose and production of Maillard products through nonenzymatic browning. Maillard products with reducing activity could potentially interfere with the glucose oxidase-peroxidase glucose detection method used. Compared with the <b>cutting</b> <b>mill,</b> grinding samples through the abrasion mill increased the precision of starch measures in silage, likely due to the effect of the finer particle size produced by the abrasion mill allowing more accurate subsampling of a more homogeneous matrix. Starch values were greater for grain ground with an abrasion mill than with a <b>cutting</b> <b>mill,</b> with the difference greater for dry-rolled than for high-moisture corn. For starch analysis of corn silage and corn grain, drying at lower temperatures (55 °C) in forced-air ovens and grinding through the 1 -mm screen of an abrasion mill or its equivalent is recommended...|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} use {{of biomass}} in pulverized fuel coal fired power stations, the impact of mill type on biomass size and shape is fundamental in optimizing mill and burner performance. The impact of mill type on the energy consumption, particle size and particle shape of four different biomasses commonly combusted in pulverized fuel boilers was investigated in this paper. Miscanthus, mixed wood, and steam exploded pellets, along with powdered olive cake, were comminuted in a planetary ball mill, Bond ball mill and <b>cutting</b> <b>mill.</b> For pelletized miscanthus, milling showed little impact on the particle {{size and shape of}} the pellets, with the milling action only reducing the pellets back to their original particle size distribution. This was also observed for the steam exploded pellets and mixed wood pellets in the <b>cutting</b> <b>mill.</b> For non-densified biomasses, such as olive cake, fines below the screen size should be removed before milling in a hammer mill as they pass straight through the mill, resulting in wasted mill capacity and energy consumption. Pellets should be composed of particles close to the required size for conveyance and combustions, and sphericity and roundness are crucial in determining this size. Olive cake showed the most spherical and round particles, but a coarser milled product size than the steam exploded pellets. Miscanthus and mixed wood pellets showed needle like shape profiles, as well as similar particle size distributions. Optimization of the particle size based on the Stokes shape factor is key to optimizing mill, conveyance and burner performance...|$|E
40|$|Now {{that there}} is a need to {{increase}} a processing capacity, curved <b>cutting</b> edge <b>mills</b> find ever-growing use. Also known as “rough end”, “full-side”, and “heavy-duty” mills, they provide the increased depth and width values of milling owing to the width-sized chip separation. The analysis of produced mills allowed us both to reveal their basic design components (type of a shaft or basic opening, diameter and length of the <b>cutting</b> part, <b>mill</b> length, quantity of teeth, a tilt angle of a screw flute) and to make their classification. The paper presents a classification of the profile types of cutting edges, which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the cutting edge is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of crests spherical radius of crest. A review of the curved cutting edge profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the chip load made by the cutting edge from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the cutting edge profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the chip load. The chip load thickness provided by the curved <b>cutting</b> edge <b>mills</b> exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” <b>cutting</b> edge <b>mills.</b> A thickening degree of the chip load is changed with changing form and sizes of the <b>cutting</b> edge <b>mill</b> profile. Larger thickening is observed if the chip load is limited from below and from above by the marks of a single tooth (the first or second etc.), and a length of the other teeth marks is minimum. The most achievable chip load thickness is equal to feed per revolution. Studying the references allowed us to formulate some rules to choose a cutting edge profile depending on a type of the processed material and a desirable roughness of the processed surface. It is important to note the following. When choosing a profile of the cutting edge it is possible to be guided by the rule: as a hardness of the processed material increases and a desirable roughness of the processed surface decreases it is necessary to use mills with a profile of the smaller height and pitch. </p...|$|R
