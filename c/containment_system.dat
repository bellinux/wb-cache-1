25|$|On January 30th, TEPCO {{inserted}} a camera into the unit 2 <b>containment</b> <b>system</b> {{to investigate the}} region underneath the reactor vessel. TEPCO was able to estimate radiation levels of 530 Sv/hr, the highest level measured since the March 2011 accident when the previous high was measured at 73 Sv/hr. This doesn't represent an increase in radiation, however {{is the first time}} measurements in the containment were taken at this location. This investigation provided visual evidence that the core melt partially breached the reactor vessel.A 1x1 meter hole in the grating of the undervessel Control Rod Drive inspection platform was identified along with various deposits of core debris and sediment.TEPCO is using this information to help plan an upcoming robot entry to the under-vessel region of the concrete-floored containment. These radiation levels are indicative of the presence of corium.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, 18,000 litres (4,755 gallons) {{of uranium}} {{solution}} containing natural uranium were accidentally released from Tricastin Nuclear Power Centre. Due to cleaning and repair work the <b>containment</b> <b>system</b> for a uranium solution holding tank was not functional when the tank filled. The inflow exceeded the tank's capacity and 30 cubic metres of uranium solution leaked, with 18 cubic metres spilled on the ground. Testing found elevated uranium {{levels in the}} nearby Gaffière and Lauzon rivers. The liquid that escaped to the ground contained about 75kg of natural uranium, which is toxic as a heavy metal, but only slightly radioactive. Estimates for the releases were initially higher, up to 360kg of natural uranium, but revised downward later. French authorities banned the use {{of water from the}} Gaffière and Lauzon for drinking and watering of crops for 2 weeks. Swimming, water sports and fishing were also banned. This incident has been classified as Level 1 (anomaly) on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Shortly after the first incident, approximately 100 employees were exposed to minor doses of radiation (1/40 of the annual limit) due to a piping failure.|$|E
500|$|In December 1981, President Reagan, {{reacting}} to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, signed a major economic and military aid package for Pakistan that included 40 F-16As. The offer was in keeping with U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union, {{and the idea of}} [...] "containment" [...] within a ring of U.S.-friendly countries. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was initially viewed as an attempt {{to break out of the}} arranged <b>containment</b> <b>system,</b> thus the U.S. placed a priority on quickly building up a new layer of defense.

500|$|In 1991, the Navy {{discovered}} nine metals, two semi-volatile {{organic compounds}} and a polychlorinated biphenyl in Ford Island's soil, groundwater and marine sediment. Suspected sources were nine [...] fuel tanks on the east-central {{side of the}} island (from 1924 to 1954), a [...] landfill on the southwestern shore (from 1930 to 1960) and ordnance bunkers on the northeastern side. An investigation suggested covering the contaminated areas with clean soil. In 1994, the Navy considered removing the contaminated soil and installed six wells to monitor groundwater, but decided to follow the original recommendation in 1995 and capped the contaminated soil with topsoil and erosion-resistant vegetation (including Bermuda grass). The <b>containment</b> <b>system</b> was completed in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|Damage to the {{temporary}} cooling systems on unit 2 from {{the explosion in}} unit 3, plus problems with its venting system, meant that water could not {{be added to the}} extent that unit 2 was in the most severe condition of the three reactors. An explosion in the [...] "pressure suppression room" [...] causes some damage to unit 2’s <b>containment</b> <b>system.</b> A fire breaks out at unit 4. Radiation levels at the plant rise significantly but subsequently fall. Radiation equivalent dose rates of 400 millisieverts per hour (400mSv/h) are observed at one location in the vicinity of unit 3.|$|E
