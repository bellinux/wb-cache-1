25|$|A {{condenser}} microphone, {{also called}} a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, {{one of these}} plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a <b>charge</b> <b>current</b> occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.|$|E

This circuit enables the <b>charge</b> <b>current</b> to be cut off when charging is complete, cuts off power if the plug is removed from the vehicle (the plug and socket are both unshuttered), prevents both rapid and fast charging being done simultaneously and also prevents the vehicle from being driven while the plug is inserted. For “fast charging”, the control box (mounted at the roadside) is limited to 20 amps enabling a charge time (from depletion) of four hours. For “slow charging”, [...] a non-captive lead/cord is provided with the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Mennekes connector at the other. [...] The Mennekes plug has a retaining trigger with a hole for a padlock to prevent the plug from being removed from the car if deemed necessary.

50|$|The {{current in}} the I-phase (stage 1) should be chosen {{depending}} on {{the capacity of the}} battery. In practice, it depends on the capability of the charger.

For example, for a battery with C = 40 Ah, a current C/(10 h) (usually written as C/10, omitting the 'hours' as time unit) is equal to 4 A. The <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> is a compromise between charging time (favoring high currents), the prevention of damage due to overheating or gassing (favoring low currents), and cost of the <b>charger</b> (favoring low <b>currents).</b> Recommendations for the maximum <b>charging</b> <b>current</b> vary between C/10 and C/2.

50|$|Stage 2 {{is called}} the Uo-phase, constant-voltage boost stage, {{absorption}} stage, or topping charge.
