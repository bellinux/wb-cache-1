2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b> We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E

6000|$|... "Did you <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> {{to tell me}} that?" [...] said Thorne, who now realy felt {{angry at}} the impertinent petulance of the man before him: [...] "you should consider, Scatcherd, that my time may be of value to others, if not to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Maggie! whose {{pain can}} {{have been like}} mine? Whose injury is like mine? Who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself into my soul, so that no other image can come there? Maggie, <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to you! <b>Call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to life and goodness! I am banished from both now. I have no motives; I am {{indifferent}} to everything. Two months have only deepened the certainty that I can never care for life without you. Write me one word; say 'Come!' In two days I should be with you. Maggie, have you forgotten {{what it was to}} be together,--to be within reach of a look, to be within hearing of each other's voice?" ...|$|E
60|$|As I was on {{the point}} of {{returning}} indoors with the foils under my arm, Andrea <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} that I was dismissed, and I thanked her and turned away. But she almost immediately <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|For {{the second}} time I {{attempted}} to leave the cell. For {{the second time}} this impenetrable woman <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He lies in slumber on his bed, {{and in his}} slumber he mutters {{the name}} of a woman, and tells her that he loves her, but that duty is more than love. Oh! <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> I cannot stay; a Presence guards him, and thrusts me thence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure that}} I ought {{to be happy with}} such a friend,' said Henrietta Temple, 'and I am happy. How {{different}} is the world to me from what it was before I knew you!

60|$|Well {{done for}} Robinson! I {{was afraid that}} it had missed fire, or that my message to him had gone wrong. It was {{on the second day}} of my visit that I sent word to him to invent an accident--something, anything--to <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b> I thought the message had failed. I had lost hope. But it is all right now, though he {{certainly}} pitched the note pretty high.|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} to take my leave, having {{apparently}} completed my work, when M. Ernest Berty <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> with a curt command.|$|R
60|$|I {{had hardly}} walked half-way towards {{the house when}} Sir Percival, who had {{withdrawn}} in the opposite direction, suddenly stopped and <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|We assented, and I {{ran to the}} camels {{that lay}} resting just outside the arch. Before I reached them, however, Quick <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the {{appearance}} of my landlady added a great load of anxiety to what I already suffered. It was plain {{that she had not}} slept; equally plain that she had wept copiously. She sighed, she groaned, she drew in her breath, she shook her head, as she waited on table. In short, she seemed in so precarious a state, like a petard three times charged with hysteria, that I did not dare to address her; and stole out of the house on tiptoe, and actually ran downstairs, in the fear that she might <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b> It was plain that this degree of tension could not last long.|$|E
6000|$|... "No need {{of memory}} when you roared {{it over and}} over for the thousandth time till half the inn was a-knock at the door to spit you for the sleep- killer you were. And when I had you decently in the bed, did you not call me to you and command, if the devil called, to tell him my lady slept? And did you not <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again, and, with a grip on my arm that leaves it bruised and black this day, command me, as I loved life, fat meat, and the warm fire, to call you not of the morning save for one thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{had reached}} the yard. Nathaniel was {{standing}} with his head stretched out above the closed half of his stable door. I noticed points of resemblance between him and Veronica herself: there was about him a like suggestion of resignation, of suffering virtue misunderstood; his eye had the same wistful, yearning expression with which Veronica will stand before the window gazing out upon the purple sunset, while people are calling to her from distant parts {{of the house to}} come and put her things away. Miss Janie, bending over him, asked him to kiss her. He complied, but with a gentle, reproachful look that seemed to say, [...] "Why <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again to earth?" ...|$|E
60|$|So I rose to go, but as I went some impulse {{seemed to}} take him and he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> and made <b>me</b> sit down again.|$|R
60|$|With a heavy {{heart at}} his cheerful sigh, I was turning to go, when--is it possible? {{the old man}} <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back,</b> and invited <b>me</b> in.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{seeing that}} I was not wanted, I took my cudgel {{and started down}} the {{bridle-path}} towards the common footbridge, when suddenly my mother <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stop, stop, town crier! The lost is found. O, my pretty Annie, {{we forgot}} to tell your mother of our ramble, and she is in despair, and has sent the town crier to bellow {{up and down the}} streets, afrighting old and young, for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go my hand! Well, let us hasten homeward; and as we go, forget not to thank Heaven, my Annie, that, after {{wandering}} a little way into the world, you may return at the first summons, with an untainted and unwearied heart, and be a happy child again. But I have gone too far astray for the town crier to <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Blondel de Nesle!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} joyfully--"welcome from Cyprus, my king of minstrels!--welcome to the King of England, who rates {{not his own}} dignity more highly than he does thine. I have been sick, man, and, by my soul, I believe it was for lack of thee; for, were I half way to the gate of heaven, methinks thy strains could <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b> And what news, my gentle master, {{from the land of}} the lyre? Anything fresh from the TROUVEURS of Provence? Anything from the minstrels of merry Normandy? Above all, hast thou thyself been busy? But I need not ask thee--thou canst not be idle if thou wouldst; thy noble qualities are like a fire burning within, and compel thee to pour thyself out in music and song." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Unknown God Whom always I {{have sought}} and Whom now I think that I have found, or am near to finding; O Power that sent me forth to taste of Life and gather Knowledge, and Who at Thine own hour wilt <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again, hear the prayer of Isobel and of Godfrey her lover. This {{is what they}} ask of Thee: that be their time {{together}} on the earth long or short, it may endure for ever in the lives and lands beyond the earth. They ask also that all their sins, known and unknown, great or small, may be forgiven them, and that with Thy gifts they may do good, and that if children come to them, they may be blessed in such fashion as Thou seest well, and afterwards endure with them through all the existences to be. O Giver of Life and Love Eternal, hear this, the solemn marriage prayer of Godfrey and of Isobel." ...|$|E
60|$|We rode {{together}} {{to the edge}} of the town, where he desired that I should separate from him. I had saluted, and was turning my horse, when he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Cho has apologized publicly, {{and said}} [...] "God forbid, if God <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> today, I {{will still be}} able to go to the Kingdom of God," [...] {{acknowledging}} his wrongdoings.|$|R
60|$|I {{bowed and}} walked to the door. He <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> and gave <b>me</b> the letter which I had seen him place on the table by itself at the {{beginning}} of our interview.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the letter}} was {{prepared}} with great care and elaboration. It was signed Alfred Fairchild, and was written in an easy and friendly spirit. It stated that the bearer was the bosom friend of the writer's son, and was of good parts and sterling character, and it begged the Commodore to be kind to the young stranger for the writer's sake. It went on to say, [...] "You may have forgotten me, in this long stretch of time, but you will easily <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> out of your boyhood memories when I remind you of how we robbed old Stevenson's orchard that night; and how, while he was chasing down the road after us, we cut across the field and doubled back and sold his own apples to his own cook for a hat-full of doughnuts; and the time that we----" [...] {{and so forth and}} so on, bringing in names of imaginary comrades, and detailing all sorts of wild and absurd and, of course, wholly imaginary schoolboy pranks and adventures, but putting them into lively and telling shape.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and distinguished of the senators, named Proculus, one who it seems had not been present among the other senators in attendance upon Romulus at the time when he disappeared, came forward one day before a grand assembly which had been convened for the purpose, and announced to them in the most solemn manner, that the spirit of Romulus had appeared to him in a visible form, and had assured him that the story which the other senators had told of the ascension of their chieftain to heaven in a flame of fire was really true. [...] "I was journeying," [...] said Proculus, [...] "in a solitary place, when Romulus appeared to me. At first I was exceedingly terrified. The form of the vision was taller than that of a mortal man, and it was clothed in armor {{of the most}} resplendent brightness. As soon as I had in some measure recovered my composure I spoke to it. 'Why,' said I, 'have you left us so suddenly? and especially why did you leave us at such a time, and in such a way, as to bring suspicion and reproach on the Roman senators?' 'I left you,' said he, 'because it pleased the gods to <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again to heaven, whence I originally came. It was no longer necessary for me to remain on earth, for Rome is now established, and her future greatness and glory are sure. Go back to Rome and communicate this to the people. Tell them that if they continue industrious, virtuous, and brave, the time will come when their city will be the mistress of the world; and that I, no longer its king, am henceforth to be its tutelar divinity.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{expected}} to be kept a long while from the ticket-wagon by the crowd, {{but there was no}} crowd, and perhaps there never used to be much of a crowd. I bought my admittances without a moment's delay, and the man who sold me my reserve seats had even leisure to <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> and ask to look at the change he had given me, mostly nickels. [...] "I thought I didn't give you enough," [...] he said, and he added one more, and sent me on to the doorkeeper with my faith in human nature confirmed and refreshed. It was cool enough outside, but within it was very warm, as it should be, to give the men with palm-leaf fans and ice-cold lemonade a chance. They were already making their rounds, and crying their wares with voices from the tombs of the dead past; and the child of the young mother who took my seat-ticket from me was going to sleep at full length on the lowermost tread of the benches, so that I had to step across its prostrate form. These reserved seats were carpeted; but I had forgotten how little one rank was raised above another, and how very trying they were upon the back and legs. But for the carpeting, I could not see how I was advantaged above the commoner folk in the unreserved seats, and I reflected how often in this world we paid for an inappreciable splendor. I could not see but they were as well off as I; they were much more gayly dressed, and some of them were even smoking cigars, while they were nearly all younger by ten, twenty, forty, or fifty years, and even more. They did not look like the country people whom I rather hoped and {{expected to}} see, but were apparently my fellow-villagers, in different stages of excitement. They manifested by the usual signs their impatience to have the performance begin, and I confess that I shared this, though I did not take part in the demonstration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen, {{having had}} my say, I will take my leave of you, as duty <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to my regiment. I trust that the frankness with which I have spoken {{will not be}} misunderstood." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was running}} {{to the door to}} welcome him, when my mother <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b> I turned and looked at her. She smiled. So did I. Without uttering a word we both sat down to finish our breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at me," [...] said Alfred, {{taking her}} hands. [...] "Let {{me see your}} eyes. I believe you care a little for me, or else you wouldn't have <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>back.</b> I love you. Can you {{understand}} that?" ...|$|R
