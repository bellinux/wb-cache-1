5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} the price and format, looking for a {{profitable}} combination. Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of Wonder Stories. With the November 1930 issue Wonder Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him <b>cost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications Thrilling Wonder remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{distributed}} as freeware, with donations {{in the amount}} of $1 requested to defray bandwidth costs. Initially, the game attracted little attention, and was downloaded 10,000 times in its first year. In April 2006 Patrick Dugan of web site Gamasutra wrote about the game after meeting its host at Game Developers Conference. Impressed, Dugan sent an email to Georgia Institute of Technology professor Ian Bogost, who blogged about the game. Brian Crecente of gaming news site Kotaku and the Rocky Mountain News subsequently interviewed Bogost, and the Associated Press and mainstream media picked up the story. The increased visibility resulted in increased coverage, controversy, and downloads; {{in the first half of}} May 2006 the game was downloaded more than 30,000 times. Ledonne announced in September 2006 that the game was no longer available for download directly through its website (instead providing download links), as the title's popularity <b>cost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to sustain; in a single day in September, he reported 8,000 downloads.

25|$|The project again caused {{significant}} controversy, but {{was eventually}} terminated. In early October 1997, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry proposed legislation giving National Children's Island, Inc., a 99-year lease on Kingman and Heritage islands. Although it initially {{appeared that the}} legislation would pass quickly, opposition from the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund led several Council members to withdraw {{their support for the}} lease. Opponents pointed out, too, that the company had performed none of the studies required by the 1993 Council vote. The delay doomed the project. In 1995, Congress had imposed a Financial Control Board on the D.C. government in an attempt to help the city avoid impending bankruptcy. The Control Board had the power to override decisions made by the mayor and city council. On March 5, 1999, the Financial Control Board exercised that power and voided the city's agreements to build Children's Island. The Control Board said the project would <b>cost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> and was not financially viable. The decision {{was the first time the}} panel overturned a decision by city officials.|$|E

500|$|Peyton {{explained}} the writing by saying [...] "it always {{comes out of}} an emotional place." [...] One of the writers was Karen Walton, who had previously written the Canadian werewolf film Ginger Snaps. [...] The producers chose the type of animation due to Peyton's personal interest in it, although he later claimed that a day's work could lead to seconds' worth of material. [...] A factory was needed with 8 to 10 teams, {{with some of the}} animators having previously worked on the Tim Burton film Corpse Bride. [...] The characters were made out of plastic and foam. [...] Additionally, some animation was done through computers. [...] Each character's figure had a number of add-on lips to express various sounds, and their eyes and eyebrows were also adjusted frequently during production. [...] The figures could also be fastened into a surface, moved and fastened in again to portray movement. [...] Peyton remarked that [...] "The hardest thing is timing and pacing." [...] Still, he also liked to emphasize that the series did not <b>cost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> money to produce.|$|E
500|$|Lang's {{relationship}} with his curates was generally formal. They were aware of his ambition and felt that he sometimes {{spent too much time}} on his outside interests such as his All Souls Fellowship, but were nevertheless impressed by his efficiency and his powers of oratory. The Church historian Adrian Hastings singles out Portsea under Lang as an example of [...] "extremely disciplined pastoral professionalism". Lang may have realised that he was destined for high office; he is reported to have practised the signature [...] "Cosmo Cantuar" [...] during a relaxed discussion with his curates ("Cantuar" [...] is part of the Archbishop of Canterbury's formal signature). In January 1898 he was invited by Queen Victoria to preach at Osborne House, her Isle of Wight home. Afterwards he talked with the Queen who, Lang records, suggested that he should marry. Lang replied that he could not afford to as his curates <b>cost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> He added: [...] "If a curate proves unsatisfactory I can get rid of him. A wife is a fixture." [...] He was summoned on several more occasions and in the following January was appointed an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. These visits to Osborne were the start of a close association with the Royal Family which lasted for the rest of Lang's life. As one of the Queen's chaplains, he assisted in the funeral arrangements after her death in January 1901.|$|E
500|$|Windows RT {{was also}} met with lukewarm {{reaction}} from manufacturers; in June 2012, Hewlett-Packard cancelled its plans to release a Windows RT tablet, stating that its customers felt Intel-based tablets were more appropriate for use in business environments. In January 2013, Samsung cancelled the American release of its Windows RT tablet, the Ativ Tab, citing the unclear positioning of the operating system, [...] "modest" [...] demand for Windows RT devices, plus the effort and investment required to educate consumers on the differences between Windows 8 and RT as reasons for the move. Mike Abary, {{senior vice president of}} Samsung's U.S. PC and tablet businesses, also stated that the company was unable to build the Ativ Tab to meet its target price point—considering that lower cost was intended to be a selling point for Windows RT devices. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang expressed disappointment over the market performance of Windows RT, but called on Microsoft to continue increasing its concentration on the ARM platform. Huang also commented on the exclusion of Outlook from the Office 2013 suite included on the device, and suggested that Microsoft port the software for RT as well (in response to public demand, Microsoft announced the inclusion of Outlook with future versions of Windows RT in June 2013). In May 2013, reports surfaced that HTC had scrapped plans to produce a 12-inch Windows RT tablet as it would <b>cost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to produce, and that there would be greater demand for smaller devices.|$|E

500|$|The major {{purpose for}} the silver penny in the 18th century was as Maundy money. Most silver pennies after 1727 were likely used {{for that purpose}} or for other royal largesse; the mintages were enough to provide for this, but not enough for general circulation. [...] In some years, the Maundy money may have been {{composed}} entirely of pennies, though there are accounts of the twopence, threepence, and groat being used as well. At times, there were gaps in the dating as enough for several years was struck at once, to be held against need. There were enough silver pennies in circulation that Maundy recipients could spend their gifts. By 1727, the price of silver guaranteed that pennies were struck at a loss. [...] When other regal coins began use of a bust showing George II as an older man in 1740–1743, the penny remained unaltered. Brian Robinson, in his book on the Royal Maundy, suggested that a new bust for a coin issued only in small quantities {{would not have been}} worth the 12 weeks' work it would have taken a Mint engraver to create new dies. In any event, between 1727 and 1816, silver <b>cost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for there to be much coinage of it. George II's pennies had a left-facing bust of him and the inscription GEORGIVS II DEI GRATIA continuing onto the other side with MAG BRI FR ET HIB REX and the date around the crowned [...] "I". Pennies were minted in 1729, 1731, 1732, 1735, 1737, 1739, 1740, 1743, 1746, 1750 and 17521760. No pennies were issued dated 1733 or 1744, likely because the year in Britain still began on 25 March, and Maundy Thursday did not occur during those twelve-month periods.|$|E
