30|$|Stretcher {{type and}} {{brackets}} changed the failure location at the joint between the back or front post and side rail. In this study, strengthening the frames of <b>chairs</b> includes stretcher and bracket {{used in the}} control samples. The maximum front to back load was obtained with the curved frames of <b>chairs</b> when compared to control samples. One-piece and two-piece type <b>chairs</b> have an important advantage in comparison with control samples, if only the front to back load is noted. The comparisons with custom <b>chairs</b> very clearly show the superior performance of the curved frames of one-piece type and two-piece type <b>chairs.</b> The high load at front to back was obtained with the curved frames, especially for one-piece type <b>chairs.</b> The front to back loads of first, two-piece type <b>chairs,</b> and custom <b>chairs</b> are equal to 1.72 E 3, 1.42 E 3, and 1.02 E 3  N, respectively. The increasing strength of <b>chairs</b> with curved frames {{is due to the}} removal of joints when compared with <b>chairs</b> of solid wood.|$|R
