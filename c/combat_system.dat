5|$|Australian Submarine Corporation {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the delivery of the Rockwell <b>combat</b> <b>system,</b> but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver the <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the combat system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> software was delivered; because of ongoing delays {{in the provision of}} the software, the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> had become the major area of concern for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. The <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> software—was continually postponed.|$|E
5|$|The {{hardware}} for {{the original}} <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> was based around the Motorola 68000 family of processors. The replacement <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> consists of the tactical and fire control components from the Raytheon CCS Mk2 system, combined with the sonar interfaces developed for the improved <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> used aboard Sheean and Dechaineux. Countermeasures include a Condor CS-5600 ESM intercept and warning unit, and two SSE decoys. The boats are fitted with a Marconi SDG-1802 degaussing system, and a receive-only Link 11 combat information exchange datalink. In October 2006, Sagem Défense Sécurité was selected to fit the Collins class with SIGMA 40XP gyrolaser inertial navigation systems.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the public}} {{focus on the}} various {{physical}} issues with the boats, the major problem with the submarines was {{the development of the}} Rockwell <b>combat</b> <b>system.</b> The problems had started during the funded study, when Singer Librascope and Thomson CSF, who were partnering with Rockwell to develop the <b>combat</b> <b>system,</b> refused to release their intellectual property or their software code for Rockwell to sell. It was proposed that Computer Sciences of Australia, a division of Computer Sciences Corporation and a minor partner in the consortium, take over the role of writing the software for the <b>combat</b> <b>system,</b> although this meant that Singer Librascope, which had prior experience in creating submarine combat systems, was reduced to a minor role in the project. Other major problems with the system, to which most of the later difficulties were attributed, were that the original concept was beyond the technology of the day, and that the system architecture required by the RAN was both overly ambitious and flawed. This was compounded by the rate of advancement in computer technology: equipment had to be designed from scratch and custom manufactured {{at the start of the}} project, but by the time these were installed, they were obsolete compared to commercially available hardware and software.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} multiple cultural references. Cyril asks Archer if he'll get {{to learn}} karate. Archer replies that karate is the Dane Cook of martial arts.

5|$|The {{game was}} well received, with reviews {{generally}} praising the deep <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> and the matching up of fighters from different SNK franchises, though {{the inability to}} choose team lineups in Team Battle Mode was a near-universal complaint among critics.|$|E

40|$|The <b>combat</b> <b>systems</b> of a {{naval ship}} are {{essential}} to the operational effectiveness of the maritime unit; less obviously, this is also true for several marine systems. The operation of the <b>combat</b> <b>systems,</b> the control of (battle) damage, and the ship’s mobility all depend on functions provided by a subset of the marine systems: the electrical system, chilled water system, fire fighting systems, propulsion system, and steering system. And these functions are just as much essential to the maritime unit’s operational effectiveness as the functions provided by the <b>combat</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis <b>Combat</b> <b>System</b> and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery shells and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> {{proposals}} saw Signaal {{fall out}} of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced <b>combat</b> <b>system.</b> The new version offered the ability for the player to pause repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their weapons at a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E

5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger abilities are enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} slow time down while aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy foe, or, later in the game, brand the foe to become an ally of Talion. The <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a foe of focus or performing an area focus attack. With the <b>combat</b> <b>system,</b> they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a critical element in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm will sound and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E

5|$|Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were {{approached}} to provide tenders {{to design and}} assemble a new <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the Defence Science and Technology Organisation tested operational versions of the proposed combat software packages, the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon's. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli Dolphin-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN Los Angeles-class submarine, {{it was decided that}} the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions about the security problems and possible leaks involved with a European <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> linked to American weapons, and desires to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a joint development program with the United States, with a formal agreement signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) developed by tri-Ace {{and published by}} Sega for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released in January 2010 in Japan and March 2010 in Western territories. In contrast to other RPGs of the time, the game uses a fast-paced strategic <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> revolving around different types of firearms and combination moves between the three playable characters.|$|E
5|$|The <b>combat</b> <b>system</b> is turn-based {{instead of}} real-time.
