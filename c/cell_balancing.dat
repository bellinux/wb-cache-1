The <b>cell</b> <b>balance</b> {{equations}} of Alt are rigorously {{studied and}} perturbatively expanded into forms similar to Segel’s one-dimensional phenomenological <b>cell</b> <b>balance</b> equations {{by considering the}} simplifying case of bacterial density possessing symmetry in the x and y directions responding to an attractant gradient present only in the z direction. We prove that for shallow attractant gradients the lumped integrals involving the tumbling probability frequency distribution and bacterial density distribution in the θ direction can be explicitly expressed {{as a product of}} three quantities: the mean tumbling frequency, the bacterial subpopulation density, and a reversal probability. We also derive expressions for the bacterial net flux in the Fickian form from which two macroscopic transport parameters, the random motility coefficient and the chemotactic velocity, are explicitly related to individual cell properties and chemical gradients...|$|R
40|$|This study proposes an {{improved}} <b>cell</b> <b>balancing</b> circuit for fast equalization among lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. A simple voltage sensorless charge balancing circuit {{has been proposed}} in the past [1]. This <b>cell</b> <b>balancing</b> circuit automatically transfers energy from high-to low-voltage battery cells. However, the circuit requires a switch with low on-resistance because the balancing speed {{is limited by the}} on-resistance of the switch. Balancing speed decreases as the voltage difference among the battery cells decrease. In this study, the balancing speed of the <b>cell</b> <b>balancing</b> circuit is enhanced by using the auxiliary circuit, which boosts the balancing current. The charging current is determined by the nominal battery cell voltage and thus, the balancing speed is almost constant despite the very small voltage differences among the batteries.

40|$|Commensalism is {{critical}} to a healthy Th 1 /Th 2 <b>cell</b> <b>balance.</b> Polysaccharide A (PSA), which is produced by the intestinal commensal Bacteroides fragilis, activates CD 4 + T cells, resulting in a Th 1 response correcting the Th 2 cell skew of germ-free mice. We identify Toll-like receptors as crucial to the convergence of innate and adaptive responses stimulated by PSA. Optimization of the Th 1 cytokine interferon-γ in PSA-stimulated dendritic cell–CD 4 + T cell co-cultures depends on both Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and antigen presentation. Synergy between the innate and adaptive responses was also shown when TLR 2 −/− mice exhibited impaired intraabdominal abscess formation in response to B. fragilis.

The BMS performs several functions concerning to the battery system, its key task being balancing the battery cells. Battery cell unbalancing hampers electric vehicles’ performance, with differing individual cell voltages decreasing the battery pack capacity and cell lifetime, leading to the eventual failure of the total battery system. Quite a lot of <b>cell</b> <b>balancing</b> topologies have been proposed, such as shunt resistor, shuttling capacitor, inductor/transformer based and DC energy converters. The shuttling capacitor balancing systems in particular have not been subject to much research efforts however, due to their perceived low balancing speed and high cost.
