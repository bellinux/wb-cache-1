25|$|The {{introduction}} of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with {{the completion of}} Robert of Chester's translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy. Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe {{at the time of}} his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century Toledo, Spain, through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath. Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum, and the works of Avicenna and al-Razi. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, <b>carboy,</b> elixir, and athanor are examples.|$|E

Rauzan founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Clotilde for the education of young ladies. The royal family assisted him financially and gave him the Mount Valerian, at that time the center of piety, and later one of the principal forts protecting the capital.|$|E
2500|$|At a zoological gardens, {{the proud}} and opinionated British Public gather {{to look at}} the animals. [...] Æsculapius <b>Carboy</b> is {{discovered}} standing on a chair with a rope around his neck. [...] The chorus insist that if he is going to commit suicide, he must first tell them the reason why. [...] <b>Carboy</b> happily obliges. [...] He had wooed Lætitia Grinder, the daughter of a prosperous grocer. [...] Her father, Mr. Grinder, disapproved of their relationship, but <b>Carboy,</b> an apothecary (pharmacist), was able to communicate with her [...] "in prescriptions." [...] But one day, the labels for a dose of peppermint for Lætitia and a lotion for her father's back were mixed up. [...] <b>Carboy,</b> believing that he has killed his love, has despaired of all hope. [...] He intends to kill himself, but Eliza Smith, the no-nonsense keeper of the refreshment stall at the zoo, forbids it.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Grinder arrives {{looking for}} <b>Carboy</b> and Lætitia, but the {{no one will}} help him. [...] Eliza returns and is upset to find that Thomas has disappeared. [...] The amused crowd tell her, mysteriously, that he will return soon. [...] Still upset, Eliza laments {{that she is a}} simple little child who cannot {{understand}} why wealthy men have always showered her with gifts and invitations. [...] Grinder returns, confronting his disobedient daughter and her beloved apothecary. Lætitia begs her father to let her marry <b>Carboy,</b> but Grinder once again refuses. [...] Hearing this, <b>Carboy</b> asks the crowd for a rope with which to hang himself.

2500|$|Thomas Brown re-enters, now {{dressed as}} befits the Duke of Islington, and he grandly proposes to make Eliza his Duchess.

2500|$|Thomas then faints, and {{the male}} zoogoers argue with their wives about how to revive him. <b>Carboy,</b> {{explaining}} {{that he is a}} physician, asks the crowd to stand back and steps in to help. After making a quick examination, he writes a prescription, which Eliza takes to be filled. Thomas now revives briefly, and before passing out again, makes a delirious comment that implies that he is of noble birth. <b>Carboy</b> unfastens his patient's jacket, and the crowd are shocked to find that Thomas is a Knight of the Garter. Thomas revives, {{and it turns out that}} he is the Duke of Islington (a joke reference, since Islington was then a working-class Cockney neighbourhood). He had disguised himself as a commoner so that he could search for a humble, virtuous wife without revealing his true rank.

60|$|And just then, {{around the}} corner of the house, stepped the steward. In his hand he carried a large {{galvanized}} pail, and my casual thought was that he had come to get rain-water from the barrels. Even as I thought it, he made a sweeping half-circle with the pail and sloshed its contents into the ventilator-opening.

60|$|With {{the morning}} {{there came a}} letter from Messrs. Kenge and <b>Carboy</b> to Mr. Boythorn informing him {{that one of their}} clerks would wait upon him at noon.
