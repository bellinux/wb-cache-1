40|$|There {{has been}} a net {{propensity}} {{over the last decade}} for Best’s to downgrade property-liability insurers. This could reflect a general deteriorating credit worthiness of the industry or an increase in the performance thresholds Best’s has deemed necessary to achieve a given rating class. Consistent with a recent study of corporate bond ratings, we find evidence there {{has been a}}n increase in rating stringency. Moreover, we show pressure for insurers to maintain their existing rate levels provides a plausible explanation of the dramatic build up of capital in the industry during the 1990 's. Moreover, we find evidence Best’s has raised the bar in terms of the capital required to maintain the highest ratings differentially relative to the increase in standards they have required for lower rating categories. We the actual pattern of <b>capital</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> across firms in different rate categories is consistent with an attempt by high quality firms to defend these ratings...|$|E
40|$|Group-based {{microfinance}} programmes, {{based on}} trust and solidarity among members, currently dominate development {{policy and practice}} as the approach compensates for individual poor’s lack of material resources and market imperfections. Despite strong evidence of its social and economic impact, few researches take an in-depth, empirical {{look at how the}} group models manifest and create social capital. Applying social capital theory, this paper seeks to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the social capital building aspect of group-based microfinance by analyzing empirical data from a CEDAC supported village saving project in rural Cambodia. The study asserts that group-based microfinance scheme can indeed bring positive changes to social and gender relations beyond individual loans and savings. These changes are largely influenced by the type of social capital (norms, networks and trust) promoted by microfinance project’s social intermediation processes. The study reveals that group homogeneity and elite avoidance may not matter at all. The study further identifies that the social <b>capital</b> <b>build</b> <b>up,</b> especially where structural and institutional exclusion is addressed to harness all bonding, bridging and linking social capital, has the potential of enabling the poor and marginalized to participate and organize themselves in the community development and society transformation processes...|$|E

It was the first television station to operate in Ventura County, since KKOG-TV (channel 16) shut down in 1969. The original owner, Don Sterling (no relation to the former Los Angeles Clippers owner of the same name), fighting ongoing losses, sold the station in 1988 to billionaire Meshulam Riklis, the then-husband of actress Pia Zadora. Riklis changed the call letters to KADY-TV {{in honor of his}} and Zadora's daughter Kady, who in turn was named for the character Zadora played in Butterfly, financed by Riklis, a role which won Zadora the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} capital flows and international reserve holdings {{in the context of}} increasing financial integration. The analysis suggests that for emerging market countries the sensitivity of reserves to net capital flows was negative in the 1980 – 90 period, but became positive after the Asian crisis when these countries used net <b>capital</b> flows to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> reserves. For advanced countries, the pattern, if any, has been the opposite. This suggests that even though funding opportunities for emerging markets have expanded with international financial integration, these countries have stockpiled reserves with heightened concern about the risk of sudden stops and loss of access to international capital markets...|$|R

The imperial officials were all apprehensive, because An had the strongest troops of the realm at the time, except for Yang, who believed that An could be suppressed easily. Emperor Xuanzong commissioned the general Feng Changqing as military governor of Fanyang and Pinglu, intending to have him replace An after An's rebellion was defeated. The Emperor also sent Feng to the eastern <b>capital,</b> Luoyang, to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> the defense there; another general, Gao Xianzhi, was ordered to command a secondary defense at Shan Commandery (陝郡, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). He executed An Qingzong and An's first wife Lady Kang, and forced An Qingzong's present wife, Lady Rongyi, to take her own life.|$|R
