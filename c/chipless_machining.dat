The work material used was Titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al - 4 V.

40|$|AbstractBurnishing is a <b>chipless</b> <b>machining</b> {{process that}} modifies the surface {{integrity}} by severe plastic deformation (SPD) of the burnished material. The application of cryogenics during the burnishing process acts to rapidly cool the burnished work material; thus, leading to surface modification. In this research work cryogenic burnishing {{was performed to}} produce the SPD layer to obtain improved properties in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. In the SPD layer produced by cryogenic burnishing, increased hardness, refined grain structure, and a drastically improved surface finish, along with compressive residual stresses are achieved. The cryogenic burnishing of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was shown to be superior to flood-cooled and dry burnishing in terms of surface integrity and the likely functional performance of components during the service life of such components...|$|E

The burnishing is <b>chipless</b> <b>machining</b> which can be used to improve the surface roughness and surface hardness on any metal work piece. The purpose of the research was to demonstrate the roller burnishing process on Cu-Zn-AL to enhance the mechanical properties of Cu-Zn-Al shape memory alloy and improve surface quality and surface microhardness. The experiments were carried on Cn-Zn-Al SMA using CNC turning machine with various spindle rotations, feed rates and depth of penetration, where a roller burnishing tool was designed and manufactured to be used in this investigation. It was found that the surface roughness and microhardness on various Cu-Zn-Al SMA were improved by high spindle speed, The best results were attained at 212 N burnishing force, 50 mm/min feed rate and 1120 rpm...|$|E
40|$|Burnishing is a <b>chipless</b> <b>machining</b> process. It {{produces}} smooth finishing both on {{round and}} flat surfaces. It easily produces work hardened surface by plastic deformation of surface irregularities. The burnishing {{is carried out}} by pressing a freely rotating hardened ball or roller against a rotating or flat or stationery work piece. The surface roughness is produced by the planetary rotation of ball / roller. The resulting cold working process produce smooth surface roughness, induces compressive strength, resist wear, corrosion resistance and improves fatigue life of the work part. The ball burnishing improves circularity of the work pieces. The burnishing process also improves surface hardness on the work piece surface considerably. Various spindle speeds, feed and depth of penetration are used to perform the experiments. High spindle speed and feed for the same depth of penetration produced lower value in surface roughness. The surface hardness on the surface was also increased by increasing depth of penetration for given spindle rotation and feed. The surface hardness can be increased to certain value, however, there is a limitation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{one of the}} <b>chipless</b> <b>machining</b> processes, {{burnishing}} {{has been}} performed on manufactured components as the final operation to improve the surface integrity, including reduced surface roughness and increased surface and subsurface hardness. Refined surface layers with ultra-fine grains or nano-grains could be generated during the burnishing process due to imposed severe plastic deformation and the associated dynamic recrystallization (DRX). These harder layers with compressive residual stresses induced by the burnishing process also provide added benefits by enhancing wear/corrosion resistance and increasing the fatigue life of the components. The research findings {{presented in this paper}} show the effects of cryogenic burnishing with roller burnishing tool on Al 7050 -T 7451 alloy, using liquid nitrogen as the coolant. Burnishing forces and temperatures are measured to compare the differences between dry and cryogenic burnishing. Higher tangential forces and lower temperatures are observed from cryogenic burnishing due to the work-hardening and the rapid cooling effects introduced by cryogenic burnishing. Also, refined layers with nano-grains (grain size of approximately 40 nm) are formed in the cryogenicallyburnished surface, in which an average hardness increase of 9. 5 %, 17. 5 % and 24. 8 % within the 200 Î¼m depth are achieved in comparison with the hardness values obtained from dry burnishing, at the corresponding burnishing speeds of 25, 50 and 100 m/min. A finite element model (FEM) is developed to simulate the burnishing forces and temperatures for validation of the experimental results, based on the modified Johnson-Cook flow stress model combined with the constitutive equations concerning DRX. Good agreement is obtained between the predicted and experimental results...|$|E
