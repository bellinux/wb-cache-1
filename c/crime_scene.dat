5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return to the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E

5|$|Private {{investigator}} George Newman {{claimed in}} 2001 that Chobert had recanted his testimony. Commentators {{also noted that}} police and news photographs of the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> did not show Chobert's taxi, and that Cynthia White, the only witness at the trial to testify to seeing the taxi, had previously provided <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> descriptions that omitted it. Cynthia White was declared to be dead {{by the state of}} New Jersey in 1992, but Pamela Jenkins claimed that she saw White alive as late as 1997. Mumia supporters often claim that White was a police informant and that she falsified her testimony against Abu-Jamal.|$|E

5|$|Within {{days of the}} murder, D.C. police {{alleged that}} the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> had been {{tampered}} with, but no charges were filed for over two years. In late 2008, police charged Price, Zaborsky and Ward with obstruction of justice and conspiracy related to alleged tampering with the <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010. No one {{has been charged with}} Wone's killing. In November 2008, Wone's widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Price, Zaborsky and Ward; the suit was settled on August 3, 2011 for an undisclosed sum and agreement.|$|E

5|$|Remains {{that were}} {{recovered}} from the Pentagon were photographed, and {{turned over to the}} Armed Forces Medical Examiner office, located at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The medical examiner's office was able to identify remains belonging to 179 of the victims. Investigators eventually identified 184 of the 189 people who died in the attack. The remains of the five hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, and were turned over as evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On September 21, the ACFD relinquished control of the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to the FBI. The Washington Field Office, National Capital Response Squad (NCRS), and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) led the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> investigation at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} silencer {{might not have been}} used during the killings, that the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E

5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the killer}} is hunting {{for his next}} victim. While unknown to him, the murderer is trapped {{in a world of}} {{grotesque}} hallucinations. Later that night, local police officers spot his latest victim. Frank visits the <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> which gives him a vision of the crime, again startling his colleague Bletcher. Later on, Frank presents his finding to the local homicide department, saying that the murderer is obsessed with apocalyptic prophecies and maddened by twisted sexual guilt.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Megan (Dana Delany) {{is shocked}} after {{the victim in}} a {{shooting}} is a previous patient {{when she was a}} neurosurgeon; however she only remembers the procedure of the woman. Detective Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Detective Baker (Sonja Sohn) lead the case, interviewing many leads from the <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> which results in finding the unexpected killer. Meanwhile; Megan tries to build a better relationship with her colleagues.|$|E

5|$|Investigation {{into the}} assault began even before Udin's death. The police began their {{investigation}} on 13 August, but were hampered as the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> had been contaminated during the commotion after the assault. Under {{the command of}} Sergeant Major Edy Wuryanto, the police began by collecting Udin's notes and blood from his family; the family had received several bags of blood from Bethesda and were planning to bury it with the body.|$|E
5|$|Magazine editor Daphne Zimmer (Mam Smith), who edits for the Society Fair magazine, {{is found}} dead in her {{swimming}} pool. Daphne {{is a friend of}} Megan's (Dana Delany) mother, Joan Hunt (Joanna Cassidy). At the <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> Megan finds evidence to suggest that there was a struggle near the pool, as well as bruising on the Daphne's stomach, which indicates that she died several days ago instead of that morning as was originally believed. At Daphne's workplace, Megan, Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch), and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) tell the employees of Daphne's death. Bud questions Daphneâs employees, Stephen Burnett (Neal Bledsoe) and Lauren Matthews (Nadia Dajani), finding out that one of Daphne's enemies is Colin Lloyd (Robert Walsh), a wealthy man whose career Daphne ruined. Megan examines Daphneâs body, noticing that Daphne has kidney damage. Whilst Dr. Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) is working on maggots found on Daphneâs body, Dr. Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) determines that hair, which was found at the <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> is human, and there are traces of arsenic and lead.|$|E
5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{arrives at}} the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and meets NOPD detective Franklin Potter, who has called her in out of his belief that the murders are related to satanism. Reyes merely answers the detective {{that it was not}} devil worship, and that the killer {{probably}} was under stress. As she is leaving, she witnesses one of the bodies carbonize into a charred corpse in front of her, only to have it revert to normal.|$|E
