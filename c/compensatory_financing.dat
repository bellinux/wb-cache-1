50|$|She {{has worked}} on {{practical}} policy applications of these ideas. She has advocated reform of <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> at the IMF {{in the face of}} external shocks to make it larger, speedier and with less conditionality. Similarly she was an early supporter of expanding development banks - nationally, regionally and multilaterally - and their role in counter-cyclical lending. She has also advocated the issue of GDP-linked bonds as a counter-cyclical mechanism {{to reduce the risk of}} financial crises. She has long supported the idea of counter-cyclical regulation. These and other practical measures are aimed at reforming the financial system so that it supports stable inclusive economic growth without costly financial crises.|$|E

50|$|Lomé {{development}} aid was dispersed primarily through the European Development Fund; investment assistance was mainly channelled through the European Investment Bank.

50|$|The {{transformation}} of finance priorities has {{brought with it}} problems in administration. No sound project-appraisal system was in place to identify viable borrowers and projects. Lending institutions did not have adequate autonomy to choose borrowers and projects and were often instructed by the political authorities. In addition, the incentive system for the banks stressed disbursements rather than recoveries, and the accounting and debt collection systems were inadequate {{to deal with the}} problems of loan recovery. It became more common for borrowers to default on loans than to repay them; the lending system was simply disbursing grant assistance to private individuals who qualified for loans more for political than for economic reasons. The rate of recovery on agricultural loans was only 27 percent in FY 1986, and the rate on industrial loans was even worse. As a result of this poor showing, major donors applied pressure to induce the government and banks to take firmer action to strengthen internal bank management and credit discipline. As a consequence, recovery rates began to improve in 1987. The National Commission on Money, Credit, and Banking recommended broad structural changes in Bangladesh's system of financial intermediation early in 1987, many of which were built into a three-year <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> facility signed by Bangladesh with the IMF in February 1987.|$|E
50|$|However, {{from the}} very beginning, Kafka {{made it clear that}} he was not going to focus {{narrowly}} on relations between his constituency and the Fund. Rather, he was going to speak out for the interests of the developing world and make sure that their voices were heard. In 1966, the <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> Facility (CFF) was just beginning to be a major source of financing for commodity-exporting countries. Some of his earliest interventions aimed to strengthen its role. Throughout his tenure on the Board, he fought to expand the usefulness of the CFF and to prevent it from being reduced to a standard conditional facility. In the 1960s, he helped formulate the special drawing rights (SDR) system in a way that would benefit developing as well as industrial countries. In the 1970s, he was instrumental in the creation and design of the Extended Fund Facility, and he helped build a consensus for the oil facilities of 1974 and 1975. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, he served as Vice-Chairman of the Deputies of the Committee of Twenty, the forerunner of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). In the 1980s, he stressed the importance of enlarged access to Fund resources, insisted that the international debt crisis could not be solved until the developed countries assumed more responsibility for it, and worked for the creation and expansion of concessional lending facilities for low-income countries. In the 1990s, he continued to advocate systemic solutions to the problems of the developing world, through innovations such as the HIPC Initiative.|$|E
40|$|The {{supply of}} {{external}} financing {{to developing countries}} generally tends to increase in periods when export earnings are booming and thus, in periods of increasing government revenues. Conversely, Stabex and IMF <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> transfers are primarily designed {{to take place in}} response to a fall in export earnings, and thus, in periods when government revenues are decreasing. However, these transfers occur in an unsteady way with respect to the cycle of government revenues. When occurring in periods of decreasing government revenues, only Stabex transfers are used to finance additional primary expenditures (i. e. expenditures other than interest on public debt). This effect contrasts with the effects usually reported for other instruments of external financing. In periods of increasing government revenues, Stabex and <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> transfers have no impact on fiscal deficit. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E

To {{determine the extent}} to which the facility served its intended purpose of stabilizing foreign exchange earnings of member countries experiencing temporary export shortfalls, a methodology is developed for evaluating the CFF's stabilizing role. The evidence is used to evaluate the facility's role in stabilizing demand for international reserves and its contribution to net welfare gain. The results suggest the CFF has helped stabilize earnings, and net benefits from its use have been substantial. ...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, India’s intransigent {{negotiating}} posture has {{conveyed the}} impression {{that it will not}} accept any carbon emissions limits without full compensation and more stringent carbon limitation from rich countries. However, our assessment of India’s proposed renewable energy standard (RES) indicates that this impression is simply wrong. India is seriously considering a goal of 15 percent renewable energy in its power mix by 2020, despite the absence of any meaningful international pressure to cut emissions, no guarantees of <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing,</b> and a continuing American failure to adopt stringent emissions limits. If India moves ahead with this plan, it will promote a massive shift of new power capacity toward renewables within a decade. The estimated cost of this change from coal-fired to renewable power to be about $ 50 billion—an enormous sum for a society that must still cope with widespread extreme poverty. If India moves ahead with its current plan, it should give serious pause to those who have resisted U. S. carbon regulation on the grounds on that it will confer a cost advantage on “intransigent” countries such as India.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} concept of the New International Economic Order. This was done by providing a back ground statement; examining the legality of the concept; discussing the various elements defining the concept; and describing the following quantitative issues affecting the movement—compensation, borrowing rule, <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> facility, conditionality, emergency fund, structural adjustment facility and buffer stocks. The thesis relied on a literature survey of the material on the NIEO to attain the objective. The following components of the Botswana National Develop ment Plan were examined {{in the context of the}} developing world order [...] the debt problem, mineral development, economic growth, industry and commerce, regional cooperation, agriculture, structural adjustment, and economic liberalization. The paper draws the following conclusions: 1) Developing countries have fallen into debt and continue to do so. 2) Developing countries have not been able to diversify their economies. 3) Economic growth as was experienced during the development decade has been reversed and stagnation has set in. 4) The necessary industrialization of the developing countries that was anticipated has not occurred. 5) Free trade has not been achieved even though both developed and developing countries agree on the concept. 6) Regional efforts to foster economic cooperation and develop ment have had discouraging results...|$|E
40|$|The IMF’s {{primary purpose}} in lending to its member {{countries}} {{is to provide}} short-term balance of payments assistance. The preceding two chapters have described how the Fund’s policies evolved to help ensure that borrowers would adjust their policies to restore viability to their economies and external accounts, and how special lending operations were developed to handle the problems of lowincome countries. Now the focus shifts to the other special windows that provided assistance in particular circumstances during the 1980 s. First, the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) —the most general of these windows, established in 1974 —offered countries the option of longer-term credits. Second, the <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> Facility (CFF) —the oldest special window, established in 1963 —offered credits {{to compensate for the}} effects of temporary fluctuations in the value of exports or imports. The 1988 successor to the CFF, the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF), also provided incremental financing in case of certain unforeseeable events. Third, the Buffer Stock Financing Facility (BSFF) began in 1969 to offer credits to assist countries participating in specified international arrangements for marketing primary commodities. Fourth, although no separate facility was ever created for the purpose, the Fund has on numerous occasions since the early 1960 s provided emergency financing to countries hit by natural disasters. Each of these operations is reviewed in the following sections of this chapter. (For a complete summary of the Fund’s lending operations in the 1980 s, se...|$|E
40|$|The boom in {{commercial}} bank lending to {{less developed countries}} (LDCs) {{in the past ten}} years, which was seen as a timely response to oil price shocks and industrial recessions, has culminated in external debt crises in several major LDCs. This outcome suggests the need to identify an appropriate role for external debt among other macroeconomic policy responses for confronting external financial shocks. ^ This study attempts to define such a role, using dynamic and optimal control simulations of a macroeconometric model of the Philippines. A large-scale disaggregated model was estimated, with full articulation of Philippine commodity sectors, the interaction of international financial flows with domestic monetary aggregates, and the external debt accounts. The study also clarified conceptual issues for measuring debt capacity, and defined measures for the sustainability of the debt situation. ^ Dynamic simulations show that given an external financial shock, recourse to short-term external debt without the accompanying set of coordinated fiscal and monetary policies to distribute the burden of adjustment among the various macroeconomic goals, would likely result in an unsustainable debt situation. Dynamic simulations also evaluate institutional responses such as debt restructuring, rescheduling, and debt cancellation. ^ Optimal control simulations derive a pattern of policy responses that avoid an unsustainable debt situation, given the same external financial shock. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 package assigns an important role to official <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> to de-fuse an incipient debt crisis, and highlight the importance of determining whether the shock is temporary or is a permanent revision of the external balance position. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 package includes fiscal and monetary policies that encourage provate sector investment and autonomous portfolio capital inflows. This prescription is difficult to implement because in a period of uncertainty, the private sector could not usually be the leading growth sector. These and other real world constraints on the optimal solution suggest the need for other macro policy actions on the part of industrial countries for a satisfactory solution to the debt problem. Dynamic simulations measure the multiplier effect of such actions on the debt situation {{in the case of the}} Philippines. ...|$|E
