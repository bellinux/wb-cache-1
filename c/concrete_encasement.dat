500|$|The next {{historic}} bridge {{listed by}} MDOT along M-28 {{is over the}} Sand River in Onota Township in Alger County. While not visible to motorists, the bridge, constructed in 1939, is the longest rural rigid-frame span in Michigan. Most bridges of this type were built in urban locations, and soil conditions in the state limit locations for this style of bridge. The bridge over the East Branch of the Tahquamenon River in Chippewa County was built in 1926 as a [...] "formative exercise in what would evolve into a state standard design." [...] The [...] bridge was built with nine lines of I-beams encased in concrete. Only one other bridge in Michigan was built with such <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} exposed pipe encasements {{on the local}} {{variation}} of hydrodynamic and sediment conditions in a river channel are examined. Laboratory experiments are performed to assess the response of water level, flow regime and bed deformation to several representative types of <b>concrete</b> <b>encasements.</b> The experimental conditions considered are: three types of exposed pipe encasements exposed on the bed, including trapezoidal shape, circular-arc shape and polygonal shape, and three sets of discharges, including annual discharge, once-in- 3 -year flood, and once-in- 50 -year flood. Our experiments show that: (1) the amount of backwater definitely depends on the encasement geometric shape and the background discharge; (2) smaller discharges generally tend to induce local scour of river bed downstream of the encasement, and the order of sensitivity of bed deformation to the encasement geometric shape is trapezoidal > circular-arc > polygonal; (3) comparatively speaking, the polygonal encasement may {{be considered as a}} suitable protective structure for pipelines across alluvial rivers, with relatively modest effects on the local hydrodynamic conditions and bed stabilization...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{consisting of}} structural steel and concrete maximize {{the advantages of}} the two components provided that there is sufficient shear connection. When high strength materials are applied, the positive effect becomes even more apparent. Today, using high strength materials and partially concrete encased steel profiles {{is becoming more and more}} popular and requested in modern construction. Not only the fire resistance of the composite section but also the bending stiffness as well as the load bearing capacity can be increased significantly. Generally, the composite action is achieved by headed studs welded onto the steel web. Adhesion as well as friction forces between the steel profile and the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> contribute to the bond effect, however, due to creep and shrinkage of the concrete these effects can be diminished. Thus, the scope of the dissertation is to calculate the friction forces taking into account the time-dependent material properties. The present publication reports on the interaction between high strength <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> and the high strength steel profile in composite bridges and industrial structures. Numerous experimental and theoretical investigations have been performed regarding the load carrying mechanisms and their characteristics. In order to determine the effectiveness of shear connectors in uncracked as well as cracked concrete a new shear test has been developed. The influence of shrinkage of the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> has been identified for distinct concrete ages by means of extensive measurement techniques. In beam tests the load carrying behavior and the rotation capacity of partially concrete encased composite beams has been investigated under positive and negative bending moments. In order to apply the yield-line theory it has to be verified that the yield strain of the steel profile is achieved before the concrete section fails due to the exceeding concrete strains. With increasing concrete strength the strain at failure decreases in contrast to the high yield strain which is required for the high strength steel to plasticize. The load carrying behavior of the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> is characterized by a three-dimensional stress condition where the bearable compressive strains are increased significantly. By varying the degree of shear connection of the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> the influence of a partial shear connection has also been determined. By means of non-linear finite element simulation not only the global load carrying capacity has been verified but also the internal mechanisms which occur in the composite cross section have been visualized. The results of the finite element simulation show different positive effects on the load bearing behavior of composite beams. In the bending moment region the encased concrete as well as the longitudinal reinforcement are activated primarily by friction bond between the concrete and the steel flanges. Friction bond is mainly governed by the flexural curvature of the beam and in positive moment areas by the lateral contraction of the structural steel in case of tension stress. In the region of negative moments the concrete is confined by the steel profile and the stirrup reinforcement. Thus, the sustainable concrete stresses are increased. If sufficient shear connection is provided, the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> is able to increase the capacity of the section against buckling. Based on own investigations and tests described in literature design recommendations for partially encased composite beams are developed. A novel plastic design method for composite beams with <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> is presented for both, full and partial shear connection. The effects of the rotation capacity which is required to achieve a plastic strain distribution and the bond between the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> and the steel profile are considered as well as the influence of creep and shrinkage of the concrete...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the methods}} being {{considered}} for safely disposing of Category 3 low-level radioactive wastes is to encase the waste in concrete. <b>Concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> would contain and isolate the waste packages from the hydrologic environment and act as an intrusion barrier.

This study focused on assessing the validity of the Nebraska Department of Roads’ (NDOR) reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> retrofit for corroded steel HP piles. Experiments were designed and conducted to test the capacity of the NDOR retrofit and evaluate failure limit states. Two pile locations were considered: abutment and pile bent. For each location there was a non-deteriorated, deteriorated, and retrofitted case. These cases represented the pile at key stages during its life. NDOR’s <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> retrofit provided the required stability and composite action to return the pile to full capacity. The key finding of the experimental study was a greater than anticipated steel-concrete bond stress. The bond stress observed was three times greater than the nominal recommended by AISC. A computational study was also conducted to investigate sensitivities and alternative configurations, such as geometric alterations, material properties, and reinforcement. The computational study emphasized the load transfer mechanism’s dependence on the type of load applied. Piles governed by axial compression with relatively minor moment were observed to be more sensitive to bond. The moment dominated loads required more surface to surface pressure transfer or bearing. Further investigation is recommended to determine the bond characteristics of steel fully encased by concrete. Advisor: Joshua Steelma...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{aqueduct}} conduits {{were supported}} across valleys or hollows on arches of masonry, brick or concrete. The Pont du Gard, {{one of the}} most impressive surviving examples of a massive masonry multiple-piered conduit, also served as a road-bridge. Where particularly deep or lengthy depressions had to be crossed, inverted siphons could be used; the conduit fed water into a header tank, which fed it into pipes. The pipes crossed the valley at lower level, supported by a low [...] "venter" [...] bridge, then rose to a receiving tank at a slightly lower elevation. This discharged into another conduit; the overall gradient was maintained. Siphon pipes were usually made of soldered lead, sometimes reinforced by <b>concrete</b> <b>encasements</b> or stone sleeves. Less often, the pipes themselves were stone or ceramic, jointed as male-female and sealed with lead. Vitruvius describes the construction of siphons and the problems of blockage, blow-outs and venting at their lowest levels, where the pressures were greatest. Nonetheless, siphons were versatile and effective if well-built and well-maintained. A horizontal section of high-pressure siphon tubing in the Aqueduct of the Gier was ramped up on bridgework to clear a navigable river, using nine lead pipes in parallel, cased in concrete. Modern hydraulic engineers use similar techniques to enable sewers and water pipes to cross depressions. At Arles, a minor branch of the main aqueduct supplied a local suburb via a lead siphon whose [...] "belly" [...] was laid across a riverbed, eliminating any need for supporting bridgework.|$|R

The current plan for waste isolation consists of stacking low-level waste packages on a trench floor, surrounding the stacks with reinforced steel, and encasing these packages in concrete. These concrete-encased waste stacks are expected to vary in size with maximum dimensions of 6. 4 m long, 2. 7 m wide, and 4 m high.

Any failure of <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> may result in water intrusion and consequent mobilization of radionuclides from the waste packages. The mobilized radionuclides may escape from the encased concrete by mass flow and/or diffusion and move into the surrounding subsurface environment. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the performance of the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> structure and the ability of the surrounding soil to retard radionuclide migration. The retardation factors for radionuclides contained in the waste packages can be determined from measurements of diffusion coefficients for these contaminants through concrete and fill material. Some of the mobilization scenarios include (1) potential leaching of waste form before permanent closure cover is installed; (2) after the cover installation, long-term diffusion of radionuclides from concrete waste form into surrounding fill material; (3) diffusion of radionuclides from contaminated soils into adjoining <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> and clean fill material. Additionally, the rate of diffusion of radionuclides may be affected by the formation of structural cracks in concrete, the carbonation of the buried waste form, and any potential effect of metallic iron (in the form of rebars) on the mobility of radionuclides. The radionuclides iodine- 129 ({sup 129 }I), technetium- 99 ({sup 99 }Tc), and uranium- 238 ({sup 238 }U) are identified as long-term dose contributors in Category 3 waste (Mann et al. 2001; Wood et al. 1995). Because of their anionic nature in aqueous solutions, {sup 129 }I, {sup 99 }Tc, and carbonate-complexed {sup 238 }U may readily leach into the subsurface environment (Serne et al. 1989, 1992 a, b, 1993, and 1995). The leachability and/or diffusion of radionuclide species must be measured to assess the long-term performance of waste grouts when contacted with vadose-zone pore water or groundwater. Although significant research has been conducted on the design and performance of cementitious waste forms, the current protocol conducted to assess radionuclide stability within these waste forms has been limited to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, Method 1311 Federal Registry (EPA 1992) and ANSI/ANS- 16. 1 leach test (ANSI 1986). These tests evaluate the performance under water-saturated conditions and do not evaluate the performance of cementitious waste forms within the context of waste repositories which are located within water-deficient vadose zones. Moreover, these tests assess only the diffusion of radionuclides from concrete waste forms and neglect evaluating the mechanisms of retention, stability of the waste form, and formation of secondary phases during weathering, which may serve as long-term secondary hosts for immobilization of radionuclides. The results of recent investigations conducted under arid and semi-arid conditions (Al-Khayat et al. 2002; Garrabrants et al. 2002; Garrabrants and Kosson 2003; Garrabrants et al. 2004; Gervais et al. 2004; Sanchez et al. 2002; Sanchez et al. 2003) provide valuable information suggesting structural and chemical changes to concrete waste forms which may affect contaminant containment and waste form performance. However, continued research is necessitated by the need to understand: the mechanism of contaminant release; the significance of contaminant release pathways; how waste form performance is affected by the full range of environmental conditions within the disposal facility; the process of waste form aging under conditions that are representative of processes occurring in response to changing environmental conditions within the disposal facility; the effect of waste form aging on chemical, physical, and radiological properties, and the associated impact on contaminant release.

[...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean <b>encasement</b> <b>concrete.</b> Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains.

40|$|International audienceSteel-concrete {{composite}} beam {{is an alternative}} to reduce the construction time and material costs compared to a conventional reinforced or prestressed concrete one when aiming to reach a large span and limiting {{the height of the}} cross-section. Composite beam consisting of a concrete beam cased in a U-shaped steel beam has been recently reported in the literature. Such {{composite beam}} is cost effective if a thin-walled steel section is used, leading to some difficulties in welding shear stud connectors. Another shear connector devices have to be used. It is worth mentioning that during <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement,</b> the upper flanges of the U-section have to be linked in order to preserve the shape of the steel cross-section. It is then proposed here to use the linking element as a shear connector. This new type of shear connection is not covered in present norms of composite structures and it requires an investigation on its behavior and on force transfer mechanisms. The experimental investigation of the behavior of these shear connectors through asymmetrical push-out tests is presented in this paper. Two different cross-sections of shear connectors were considered. A finite element model has been developed in order to identify the stress behavior of shear connectors and the surrounding concrete.

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for slim constructions and {{improvement}} of erection methods on building site composite slim-floor systems become more important. In the present european and national codes do not include complete design rules for slim-floor constructions. Therefore {{the objective of this}} thesis is concentrated on the development of design rules for slim-floor girders. During the erection stage the elastic design resistance of the steel girder is decisive. Because of the slight plate thickness and sometimes considerable torsional stressing the influence of the shape deformation becomes more important and has to be considered. In this approach the steel sections are filled with concrete in the final state. Thereby the concrete in the openings, arranged in the web or upper flange, work concurrently as concrete dowels. The determination of moment resistance follows the rules for composite structures, respectively whereas in many cases the strain limited design is relevant and additionally the influences from transverse bending in the bottom flange have to be considered. Because of the sheathing of the <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> by the steel section a hybrid truss model with a compression strut in the concrete section is developed, increasing the shear of the section. In case of fire, the directly flamed bottom flange can be substituted by longitudinal reinforcement bars and a high fire resistance period can be realized without any additional activities. For the analysis in case of fire, a design-method is extracted according to EN 1994 - 1 - 2. Based on a transient analysis, thermal analytic functions are developed to describe the temperature distribution in the cross section. The crack behaviour of the concrete slab has already {{a significant impact on the}} girder deformation in the serviceability limit state. The concrete flange adopts a remarkable part of the bending-moment. Compared to general treatment of common composite girders, the neglecting of these bending influences can lead to unrealistic camber of the girder. Therefore, an approximation procedure is derived that considers the bearing of the resilience of composite connector and the crack behaviour on the structure deformation...|$|E
40|$|It {{has become}} evident {{recently}} that abnormal loads {{need to be}} considered in the design of structures so that progressive collapse can be prevented. Building collapses such as the Ronan Point, Alfred P. Murrah, and World Trade Center have shown the catastrophic nature of progressive collapse and with an increasing trend towards more terrorist action in the future, it is clear structural design must include progressive collapse mitigation. The most critical abnormal loadings that have potential to cause progressive failure are blast and impact. These loads are impulsive and dynamic in nature with the potential to induce destructive forces, and to further complicate matters is the random nature of occurrence which makes it difficult to predict adequate levels of design. Much research has been conducted over the past several decades, but to this day very little standardized language has been published to help designers create progressive collapse resistant structures. What is known is that robust structures can be built economically by following a general design philosophy of redundancy, ductility, and overall structural integrity. Reinforced concrete structures are especially well suited for resisting progressive collapse by specifying steel reinforcement detailing such as continuous top and bottom reinforcement, close spacing of stirrups, strategic locations of splices, continuous reinforcement through joints, and designing slabs for two-way action. Steel structures have good ductility, but connection detailing is usually the weakest point and requires special design, {{such as the use of}} the SidePlate (tm) connection. (cont.) Regardless of the type of material used, the design should strive for a uniform, regular layout of the structural system with limited span lengths and close spacing of beams and columns. Perimeter defense systems should be employed as this decreases the threat of an abnormal loading. Since there has been little consideration of extreme loadings, existing structures may be inadequate and require retrofit. Although more difficult, it is possible to achieve improved progressive collapse resistance through the use of externally applied retrofits, such as <b>concrete</b> <b>encasement</b> or the application of composite polymer materials. by Phillip J.
