25|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> {{was further}} {{improved}} by Emile Berliner, Francis Blake, David E. Hughes, Henry Hunnings, and Anthony White. The <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> remained standard in telephony until the 1980s, {{and is still}} being produced.|$|E
25|$|The first {{microphone}} {{that enabled}} proper voice telephony was the (loose-contact) <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone.</b> This was independently developed by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison {{was awarded the}} first patent (after a long legal dispute) in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention. The <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> is the direct prototype of today's microphones and was critical {{in the development of}} telephony, broadcasting and the recording industries. Thomas Edison refined the <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> into his carbon-button transmitter of 1886. This microphone was employed at the first ever radio broadcast, a performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera House in 1910.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone,</b> transmitters, digital signal processing chip or DSP, {{and the development of}} computer technology helped transform the hearing aid to its present form.|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{displacement}} receivers include <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones,</b> strain gauges, and pressure sensors or force sensors, which, to within an appropriate scale factor, respond to distance.|$|R
50|$|Apart from legacy {{telephone}} {{installations in}} Third World countries, <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> are still used today in certain niche {{applications in the}} developed world. An example is the Shure 104c, which is still in demand because of its wide compatibility with existing equipment.|$|R
25|$|Edison {{used the}} <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> concept in 1877 {{to create an}} {{improved}} telephone for Western Union. In 1886, Edison {{found a way to}} improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890 and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Bell Telephone Company {{was created}} in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company {{engineers}} made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which {{emerged as one of}} the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Shure and {{engineer}} Ralph Glover {{began development}} of the first Shure microphone, and the following year, the Model 33N Two-Button <b>Carbon</b> <b>Microphone</b> was introduced, making Shure one of only four microphone manufacturers in the U.S. Shure's first condenser microphone, crystal microphone, and microphone suspension support system (for which they received their first patent) were all introduced that same decade. In 1939, Shure introduced the Model 55 Unidyne Microphone, which {{went on to become}} one of the world's most recognized microphones.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Development== In World War I <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> {{were still}} used as sound receiver. The {{individual}} receivers were mostly {{placed in the}} front part of the vessel along the hull sides to have enough distance from the screw and the noise they emitted. The individual microphones were arranged in groups and each was oriented in a different direction. The individual microphones had to be connected manually for taking bearings. The <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> were not very reliable, so other experiments with other transducers were done. Dynamic microphones were also discarded. At {{the end of the}} process, the piezoelectric principle was deemed the most suitable. This was discovered by Pierre Curie in 1880. The quartz crystals generate an electric voltage depending on the pressure acting on it.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{proliferation}} of vacuum tube amplifiers in the 1920s, <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> were the only practical means of obtaining high-level audio signals. They were widely used in telephone systems until the 1980s, while other applications used different microphone designs much earlier. Their low cost, inherently high output and frequency response characteristic were well suited for telephony. For {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS), carbon-microphone based telephones can still be used without modification. <b>Carbon</b> <b>microphones,</b> usually modified telephone transmitters, were widely used in early AM radio broadcasting systems, but their limited frequency response, as well as a fairly high noise level, led to their abandonment in those applications by the late 1920s. They continued to be widely used for low-end public address, and military and amateur radio applications for some decades afterward.|$|R

25|$|The first {{electrical}} {{hearing aid}} used the <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> {{of the telephone}} and was introduced in 1896. The vacuum tube made electronic amplification possible, but early versions of amplified hearing aids were too heavy to carry around. Miniaturization of vacuum tubes lead to portable models, and after World War II, wearable models using miniature tubes. The transistor invented in 1948 was well suited to the hearing aid application due to low power and small size; hearing aids were an early adopter of transistors. The development of integrated circuits allowed further improvement of the capabilities of wearable aids, including implementation of digital signal processing techniques and programmability for the individual user's needs.|$|E
25|$|A {{carbon pile}} {{resistor}} {{is made of}} a stack of carbon disks compressed between two metal contact plates. Adjusting the clamping pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters. A carbon pile resistor {{can also be used}} as a speed control for small motors in household appliances (sewing machines, hand-held mixers) with ratings up to a few hundred watts. A carbon pile resistor can be incorporated in automatic voltage regulators for generators, where the carbon pile controls the field current to maintain relatively constant voltage. The principle is also applied in the <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shure {{first began}} {{manufacturing}} their own products in 1932 {{with the introduction}} of the 33N two-button <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone.</b> The Model 40D, Shure's first condenser microphone, was introduced the next year, and the first of a line of crystal microphone, the Model 70, was introduced in 1935. With the introduction of the 55 Unidyne microphone in 1939, the company's offerings included carbon, condenser, crystal, and dynamic microphones. Wired and wireless microphones together represent the largest category of Shure's overall business. Shure currently produces numerous series of microphones for various applications, including the SM, Beta, KSM, and PG series, as well as specialty consumer microphones, Microflex, and Easyflex (conferencing systems for commercially installed applications).|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> over other microphone designs {{is that they}} can produce high-level audio signals from very low DC voltages, without needing any form of additional amplification or batteries. This is particularly useful in remote locations served by very long telephone lines, where the electrical resistance of the wires can lead to severe DC voltage drop. Most all-electronic telephones need at least three volts DC to work, and so will often become useless in such situations, whereas carbon transmitter telephones will continue to work down to a fraction of a volt. Even where they do work, electronic telephones also suffer from the so-called [...] "cliff effect", whereby they abruptly stop working when the line voltage falls below the critical level. In particular, this means that one telephone on a [...] "party line" [...] may tend to [...] "hog" [...] all the line current, cutting the others off. With <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones,</b> all receivers on the same line will still operate, albeit with reduced output.|$|R
25|$|Graphite is an {{electric}} conductor, consequently, useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes. It can conduct electricity {{due to the}} vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers (a phenomenon called aromaticity). These valence electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is primarily conducted within {{the plane of the}} layers. The conductive properties of powdered graphite allow its use as pressure sensor in <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> {{are also}} {{widely used in}} safety-critical {{applications}} such as mining and chemical manufacturing, where higher line voltages cannot be used, due {{to the risk of}} sparking and consequent explosions. Carbon-based telephone systems are also resistant to damage from high-voltage transients, such as those produced by lightning strikes, and electromagnetic pulses of the type generated by nuclear explosions, and so are still maintained as backup communication systems in critical military installations.|$|R
25|$|Electric {{recording}} {{which developed}} {{during the time that}} early radio was becoming popular (1925) benefited from the microphones and amplifiers used in radio studios. The early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings, except there was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records. This was in spite of some carbon microphones used, which had resonances that colored the recorded tone. The double button <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement. Alternatively, the Wente style condenser microphone used with the Western Electric licensed recording method had a brilliant midrange and was prone to overloading from sibilants in speech, but generally it gave more accurate reproduction than carbon microphones.|$|E
25|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> is a sound-to-electrical signal {{transducer}} {{consisting of}} two metal plates separated by granules of carbon. When sound waves strike this plate, {{the pressure on the}} granules changes, which in turn changes the electrical resistance between the plates. A direct current is passed from one plate to the other, and the changing resistance results in a changing current, which can be passed through a telephone system, or used in other ways in electronics systems to change the sound into an electrical signal. After a lengthy court battle over patent rights filed in 1877, a United States federal court as well as a British court in 1878 ruled in favor of Thomas Alva Edison over a claim held by Emile Berliner since Edison indisputably preceded Berliner in inventing the transmission of speech as well as the use of carbon in a transmitter.|$|E
25|$|A <b>carbon</b> <b>{{microphone}},</b> {{also known}} as a carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the Berliner and Edison microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of electronic amplifiers, mechanically coupled <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> were used as amplifiers in telephone repeaters. After {{the turn of the}} century it was found that negative resistance mercury lamps could amplify, and they were used. [...] The invention of audion tube repeaters around 1916 made transcontinental telephony practical. In the 1930s vacuum tube repeaters using hybrid coils became commonplace, allowing the use of thinner wires. In the 1950s negative impedance gain devices were more popular, and a transistorized version called the E6 repeater was the final major type used in the Bell System before the low cost of digital transmission made all voiceband repeaters obsolete. Frequency frogging repeaters were commonplace in frequency-division multiplexing systems from the middle to late 20th century...|$|R
2500|$|Unlike other {{microphone}} types, the <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> {{can also}} be used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early telephone repeaters, making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. These repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line. One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old [...] "candlestick" [...] telephone if its earphone was placed near the <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early {{experiments}} in AM radio transmission, conducted by Fessenden, Valdemar Poulsen, Ernst Ruhmer, Quirino Majorana, Charles Harrold, and Lee De Forest, were {{hampered by the}} lack of a technology for amplification. [...] The first practical continuous wave AM transmitters [...] were based on either the huge, expensive Alexanderson alternator, developed 1906-1910, or versions of the Poulsen arc transmitter (arc converter), invented in 1903. [...] The modifications necessary to transmit AM were clumsy and resulted in [...] very low quality audio. [...] Modulation was usually accomplished by a <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire; its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna. [...] The limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones; many of the microphones were water-cooled.|$|E
2500|$|In 1876, Edison {{began work}} {{to improve the}} {{microphone}} for telephones (at that time called a [...] "transmitter") by developing a <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone</b> that used a button of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. Up to that point, microphones, {{such as the ones}} developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it. His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{binaural}} recording {{goes back to}} 1881. The first binaural unit, the Théâtrophone, was an array of <b>carbon</b> telephone <b>microphones</b> installed along {{the front edge of}} the Opera Garnier. The signal was sent to subscribers through the telephone system, and required that they wear a special head set, which had a tiny speaker for each ear.|$|R

Her voice and her cordial, unassuming microphone presence were ideally suited to the novel task. Without instruction she seemed to sense exactly what was necessary in song and patter to successfully put herself across". According to some historical accounts of this incident, having been advised that high notes sung in her natural soprano might shatter the fragile vacuum tubes of her <b>carbon</b> <b>microphone's</b> amplifier, De Leath switched to a deep contralto and in the process invented [...] "crooning", which became the dominant pop vocal styling for the next three decades.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Transistor hearing aids== The {{development}} of transistors in 1948 by Bell Laboratories led to major {{improvements to the}} hearing aid. [...] The transistor was invented by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. Transistors were created to replace vacuum tubes; they were small, required less battery power and had less distortion and heat than their predecessor. [...] These vacuum tubes were typically hot and fragile, so the transistor was the ideal replacement.The 1952 Sonotone 1010 used a transistor stage along with vacuum tubes, to extend battery life. The size of these transistors led to developments in miniature, <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones.</b> These microphones could be mounted on various items, even eyeglasses. [...] In 1951, Raytheon manufactured the transistor {{and was one of}} the first companies to mass-produce transistors to throughout America. Raytheon realized that their hearing aid only lasted short-term and began to sell the vacuum-tube hearing aids again along with transistor hearing aids.|$|R

50|$|The Electrophone was {{preceded by}} the {{similarly}} organized Théâtrophone system of Paris, France, which began operation in 1890. In 1894, Mr. H. S. J. Booth formed the Electrophone Company, Ltd. with an initial capitalization of £20,000, and the service began operations in London the next year, with Booth acting as the Managing Director. Initially the company operated under a license issued by the National Telephone Company, Ltd.To pick up the programs, multiple large <b>carbon</b> <b>microphones</b> {{were placed in the}} theater footlights to pick up the sounds of the performers. In churches, the microphones were disguised to look similar to bibles. Home subscribers were issued headphones connected to their standard telephone lines. The annual charge was £5, which limited its affordability to the well-to-do. Queen Victoria was included as one of the listeners. In 1897, it was noted that coin operated receivers had been installed in some hotels, which provided a few minutes of entertainment for a sixpenny. Additional lines were installed, for free, for use by convalescing hospital patients.|$|R
