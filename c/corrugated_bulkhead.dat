40|$|The {{deck load}} {{capacity}} of new offshore platforms is increasing as these marine structures {{continue to increase}} in size. As a consequence, the structural weight has become a concern. The current investigation contributes to a solution of a more weight-effective structural design of shell-plated marine structures. The structural weight of a shell-plated structure can be reduced in various ways. In the current investigation, an alternative design is presented {{by means of a}} corrugated structure. By the introduction of corrugated panels, a structure may be constructed lighter and cheaper compared to traditional structures with stiffened panels. The welding work during manufacturing can also be reduced substantially. Even though the idea of using corrugated shell plating has been practiced in various applications for a long time, such as in <b>corrugated</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and deck plating, it is yet unexplored in shell structures. Thus, the aim with this study is to compare corrugated shell plating with conventional stiffened panels with respect to strength, weight and cost. A methodology is presented where various solutions are analyzed and compared with regard to strength characteristics, weight and cost. Here, strength characteristics include ultimate tensile strength, buckling stability and fatigue life calculations. Detailed numerical analyses are presented using a realistic and reasonable area of a panel structure of an offshore platform. The structure analyses are carried out using linear finite element analyses. A number of design criteria have been evaluated and verified by comparing predictions obtained in an extensive parametric study of basic structural strength following classification rules. Two alternative designs with corrugated shell plating are proposed with respect to corrugation symmetry. The first one had unequal flanges and the same thickness as that of the reference stiffened model. The second had equal flange lengths. The weight reduction values achieved using these designs were 38 percent and 59 percent in shell plating, respectively, compared with a reference model for traditional stiffened shell plating. The study concluded with a reduction in production costs by 35 percent and 49 percent, respectively. The investigation clearly demonstrates that corrugated panels are often favourable for lightweight design and manufacturing robustness of marine structures...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 112 - 113) The {{study is}} a discussion of particular methodology to obtain (1), the minimum value of a function without calculating derivatives and, (2), the techniques to solve the constrained problem. It is also a practical look {{at each of the}} methods and techniques to determine their quality relative to each other. Its intent is to clearly define and explain what these methods are as well as how to use them. The method used to move from point to point in search of the optimum minimum point is called an algorithm and is independent of the technique used to solve the constraint problem. The algorithms chosen are Powell???s Direct Search (5) and the Adaptive Pattern Search (7) method. The difference between these two algorithms is in their manner of moving from point to point; the criterion, however, for accepting the new point as an improvement over the previous one is the same. The objective function must be less than the one for the previous point or it will be considered as no improvement. Termination of the search is also similar in that after a given number of tries, if the objective function does not improve then the search assumes it has reached the optimum minimum point. Four example problems were chosen to demonstrate the methods and techniques. They are: 1. Rosen - Suzuki Problem (Constrained) (6) 2. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>Bulkhead</b> Problem (Constrained) (4) 3. Parabolic Valley Problem (Unconstrained) (5) 4. Function of Four Variables (Unconstrained) (5) The comparison of the Adaptive Pattern Method vs. the Powell's Direct Search method showed that the Adaptive Pattern method was the better algorithm for most functions. The criterion was the number of iterations it took to reach the optimum minimum point. The two methods had their own distinct search path. The Adaptive Pattern Search would jump off to an area near the final solution and then slowly refine its position as it converged on the answer. The algorithm was not limited to convex problems or problems with few variables. There were no cases of the solution being trapped behind constraints or unable to converge on the optimum point. There were times that it took more iterations but not a significant number. The results of Powell???s Direct Search showed that the algorithm was more delicate to handle. As long as it was started in the right direction, it converged on a very even and smooth path. For some cases, however, the search was led just as evenly and as smoothly into a corner from which it could not find a way out. A relationship can be seen that as the number of variables and constraints increases the accuracy decreases to the point of not working at all for the non-convex problem. The two techniques to solve the constraint problem are the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique, (SUMT), (1) (2), and the Slacked Unconstrained Minimization Technique, (SLUMT), (3). The latter of these proved to be the better based on the same criterion used for the algorithms. SUMT and SLUMT also had their distinctive traits as they converged on the optimum minimum point. SUMT would converge on the final answer without dipping below its value or have any wild perturbations. SLUMT, on the other hand, would go beyond the minimum point and then oscillate up and down until the damping effect of the penalty function would settle it down as it converged. The advantage was that the penalty function for SLUMT did not have a large effect until the search started to converge; this worked better than considering the penalty function at the beginning before the search is even close to converging. Explanations of these phenomena are developed in the final chapter...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} structural optimization {{applied to the}} minimum weight design of <b>corrugated</b> transverse <b>bulkheads</b> made of the duplex stainless steel. The study {{presented in this paper}} was carried out within the EU FP 6 project IMPROVE as a sub-task of multi-level structural optimization that was performed with the aim of development of a new innovative design of chemical tanker. This task can result in large benefi ts, because the unit price of duplex stainless steel is very high (5000 ÷ 6000 €/tons), and even the small savings of material can result in signifi cant cost savings. <b>Corrugated</b> transverse <b>bulkhead</b> structure of chemical tanker (CT) was developed, analyzed and optimized using partial 3 D FEM model, with the objective to achieve improved and competitive design. Two types of corrugations: (1) horizontal-HC and (2) vertical-VC, were investigated, optimized and compared to enable rational selection of the preferred design. Final solutions, satisfying all structural constraints, resulted in 7 % savings in structural mass. The total savings (fi ve duplex-steel made transverse bulkheads) of about 25 t can be expected with the cost benefi t of up to € 150 000...|$|R
