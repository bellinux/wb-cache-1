40|$|Xenos Ltd. is a {{technology}} driven food company, {{that specializes in}} aseptic processing and packaging beverage products in bottles. Their aseptic filling technology is based on packaging sterilization with combined treatments of oxidizing agents and Ultraviolet radiation. Recent research {{studies have suggested that}} there is a synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide (0. 5 – 1 %) plus UV on inactivation of microorganisms including spores. Advantages of the combined treatment include rapid inactivation, minimum hydrogen peroxide residue in products, with the method being applicable {{to a wide range of}} packaging types. Based on this principle, a unique aseptic packaging technique has been developed by Xenos Ltd., which utilizes the combination of vaporized Perform (a commercial sterilizing agent manufactured by Orica Chemnet containing 25 % hydrogen peroxide and 5 % peracetic acid) and UV radiation at 7. 5 – 12. 5 W/m 2. The aim of the project was to improve and validate the effectiveness of the packaging sterilization process through challenge tests. Challenge tests were conducted using Bacillus subtilis spores as the test microorganism to determine the log reductions delivered by the packaging sterilization system. The tests were firstly carried out on a pilot plant scale aseptic filling machine, in order to test the sterility of the small scale system, and investigate processing parameters (operational conditions) which could affect and improve sterility. The established operational conditions for achieving target sterility were used for designing and modifying an upgrade aseptic packaging system. Finally validation of the upgrade packaging sterilization system was conducted through challenge tests to prove sterility. It is highly recommended that in order to ensure sterility, the packaging sterilization system with vaporized Perform plus UV treatment must meet the requirements listed below during the sterilization process: -	Hydrogen peroxide concentration of Perform condensate on bottles (after steaming) is best within 0. 5 – 1 %; -	Perform loading level should be minimum 300 mg/bottle after vaporized Perform treatment; -	UV treatment time applied is greater than 2 seconds during UV treatment; -	At least 20 seconds of penetration time (time between Perform treatment and UV treatment) should be allowed. The upgrade sterilization system used by Xenos Ltd. has been improved to meet the above operational conditions. With spore loading level of 106 per bottle and 105 per cap, the system is able to deliver at least a 6 log reduction of B. subtilis spores on PET or glass bottles and a 5 log reduction on bottle caps. Moruzzi et al. (2000) stated that at least a 4 log reduction is commercially required for an aseptic packaging process. Therefore, the system’s sterility would meet the <b>commercial</b> acceptable <b>sterility...</b>|$|R

This characteristic makes the HPH an interesting process to guarantee the safety of thermo-labile food. Inactivation of Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 and Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 spores in skim milk by HPH was studied. Results showed that pressures up to 300 MPa {{were not able to}} cause any reduction on spore counts or promote changes on its thermal resistance. The application of heat shock (100 °C/ 15 min) before HPH treatment and the homogenization process realized at mild inlet temperature (45 °C) – which results in homogenization temperature of around 84 °C at 300 MPa - also did not cause reduction on viable spores counts. A few spores reduction (0. 67 logarithmic cycles) were only observed when the milk samples were subjected to homogenization treatment 16 times (multiple passes) at 300 MPa.

40|$|A {{recently}} published {{study of the}} inactivation of Clostridium botulinum spores at various temperatures {{in the range of}} 101 to 121 degrees C and neutral pH revealed that their semilogarithmic survival curves all had considerable upward concavity. This finding indicated that heat inactivation of the spores under these conditions did not follow a first-order kinetics and that meaningful D values could not be calculated. The individual survival curves could be described by the cumulative form of the Weibull distribution, i. e., by log S = -b(T) t(n(T)), where S is the survival ratio and b(T) and n(T) are temperature-dependent coefficients. The fact that at all temperatures in the above range n(T) was smaller than 1 suggested that as time increases sensitive members of the population parish and survivors with increasing resistance remain. If damage accumulation is not a main factor, and the inactivation is path independent, then survival curves under monotonously increasing temperature can be constructed using a relatively simple model, which can be used to calculate the spores 2 ̆ 7 survival in a limiting case. This is demonstrated with computer-simulated heating curves and the experimental constants of the C. botulinum spores, setting the number of decades reduction to 8, 10, and 12 (the current criterion for <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility)</b> ...|$|E

By analyzing the response surface plots, the inactivation was shown to be higher in distilled water than in milk under all the conditions tested. This was probably due to a protective effect of milk against inactivation by pressure.

40|$|Currently, the {{sterility}} of heat-processed {{food and}} pharmaceuticals is assessed {{in terms of}} an F 0 value, based on the equivalence of the heat treatment to an isothermal process at a reference temperature. This F 0 value, however, has a meaning if, and only if, the inactivation kinetics of the targeted spores (or cells) follow a first-order relationship and the temperature dependence of the D value, the reciprocal of the rate constant, is log-linear. There is growing evidence that these conditions are not satisfied by many spores, including those of Clostridium botulinum and vegetative cells. Consequently, a replacement for the F 0 value is proposed {{in the form of a}} momentary equivalent time at the reference temperature based on the actual survival pattern of the spores, which need not be log-linear. This equivalent time can be calculated together with the theoretical survival ratio in real time, thus enabling an operator to monitor the lethality of ongoing industrial heat processes. The concept is demonstrated with published survival data of C. botulinum, for which the Weibullian and log-logistic models served as primary and secondary models, respectively. The safety factor according to the proposed method is in the number of added minutes of processing, beyond the theoretical time needed to reduce the survival ratio of the targeted spores or cells to a level that would produce practical (or <b>commercial)</b> <b>sterility.</b> Copyright © 2006 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Brazilian Ultra High Temperature (UHT) milk {{consumption}} {{has increased}} {{during the last}} decade from 187 to 4, 200 million liters. In the continuous UHT process, milk is submitted for 2 - 4 s to 130 - 150 °C, in a continuous flow system with immediate refrigeration and aseptical packing in hermetic packages. This research had the purpose to verify the incidence of B. cereus species from the B. cereus group, in UHT milk. In 1998 high indexes of these organisms were reported, reaching 34. 14 % of the analyzed samples. Beyond this fact, there was the need to establish methods and processes adjusted for correct identification of B. cereus. Thus, <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility</b> tests of 6, 500 UHT milk packages were investigated in two assays, after ten days incubation at 37 °C and 7 °C to germinate all possible spores and/or to recuperate injured vegetative cells followed by pH measurement.

Values of pH were different for the samples, ranging between 6. 57 and 6. 73. After storage of the samples, only four packages with pH measurement below the lower limit of 6. 5 were found and analyzed for the presence of B. cereus.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Although many studies have evaluated quality characteristics of fresh, minimally processed, and processed carrots, none have concentrated on attributes affecting strained carrot quality. This study was initiated to investigate the effects of genotype, environment, and processing conditions on strained carrot quality. Genotypic response contributed to processed strained carrot quality. Relationships between sensory attributes and chemical components for ten genotypes of strained carrots were developed. Fresh carrot aroma, flavor, and aftertaste were associated with high sugar to terpinolene ratios. Cooked carrot attributes were associated with elevated levels of terpenoids. Results indicated that breeders should select lines with increased sugar content and reduced levels of volatile terpenoids. Environmental factors affected chemical attributes and influenced processed strained carrot quality. Carrots grown under reduced sunlight had elevated levels of volatile terpenoids and reduced levels of total sugars. Processors should consider selection of lines more resistant to unfavorable environmental conditions. Processing conditions also affected strained carrot quality. Thermal processing decreased volatile terpenoid levels while greatly increasing soluble phenolic content. Changes in Hunter color values indicated darkening, presumably the result of Maillard browning. Preprocessing operations and degree of thermal processing affected quality of strained carrots. Processors should reduce the time and temperature that strained carrots reside in batch and holding tanks to control color degradation, phenolic polymerization and loss of sugars. Preprocessing blanching operations reduced volatile terpenoid content 60 - 75 %.

40|$|The {{presence}} of highly heat-resistant spores of Bacillus sporothermodurans in ultrahigh-temperature or sterilized consumer milk {{has emerged as}} an important item in the dairy industry. Their presence is considered undesirable since they hamper the achievement of <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility</b> requirements. By using a selective 30 -min heat treatment at 100 °C, 17 Belgian dairy farms were screened to evaluate the presence, sources, and nature of potentially highly heat-resistant spores in raw milk. High numbers of these spores were detected in the filter cloth of the milking equipment and in green crop and fodder samples. About 700 strains were isolated after the selective heating, of which 635 could be screened by fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Representative strains were subjected to amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, percent G+C content, and DNA-DNA reassociations for further identification. The strain collection showed a remarkable diversity, with representatives of seven aerobic spore-forming genera. Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus pallidus were the most predominant species overall. Twenty-three percent of the 603 spore-forming isolates proved to belong to 18 separate novel species. These {{findings suggest that the}} selective heating revealed a pool of unknown organisms with a higher heat-resistant character. This study showed that high spore counts can occur at the dairy farm and that feed and milking equipment can act as reservoirs or entry points for potentially highly heat-resistant spores into raw milk. Lowering this spore load by good hygienic measures could probably further reduce the contamination level of raw milk, in this way minimizing the aerobic spore-forming bacteria that could lead to spoilage of milk and dairy products. Assessment and characterization of this particular flora are of great importance to allow the dairy or food industry to adequately deal with newly arising microbiological problems...|$|E

40|$|Article sous presseIn a {{previous}} study, a modular process risk model, from {{the raw material}} reception to the final product storage, was built to estimate {{the risk of a}} UHT-aseptic line of not complying with <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility</b> (Pujol et al., 2015). This present study was focused on demonstrating how the model (updated version with uncertainty and variability separated and 2 (nd) order Monte Carlo procedure run) could be used to assess quantitatively the influence of management options. This assessment was done in three steps: pinpoint which process step had the highest influence on the risk, identify which management option(s) could be the most effective to control and/or reduce the risk, and finally evaluate quantitatively the influence of changing process setting(s) on the risk. For Bacillus cereus, it was identified that during post-process storage in an aseptic tank, there was potentially an air re-contamination due to filter efficiency loss (efficiency loss due to successive in-place sterilizations after cleaning operations), followed by B. cereus growth. Two options were then evaluated: i) reducing by one fifth of the number of filter sterilizations before renewing the filters, ii) designing new UHT-aseptic lines without an aseptic tank, i. e. without a storage period after the thermal process and before filling. Considering the uncertainty in the model, {{it was not possible to}} confirm whether these options had a significant influence on the risk associated with B. cereus. On the other hand, for Geobacillus stearothermophilus, combinations of heat-treatment time and temperature enabling the control or reduction in risk by a factor of ca. 100 were determined; for ease of operational implementation, they were presented graphically in the form of iso-risk curves. For instance, it was established that a heat treatment of 138 °C for 31 s (instead of 138 °C for 25 s) enabled a reduction in risk to 18 × 10 (- 8) (95 % CI=[10; 34]× 10 (- 8)), instead of 578 × 10 (- 8) (95 % CI=[429; 754]× 10 (- 8)) initially.

40|$|This method uses a photoaffinity {{label that}} recognizes DNA {{and can be}} used to {{distinguish}} populations of bacterial cells from bacterial spores without the use of heat shocking during conventional culture, and live from dead bacterial spores using molecular-based methods. Biological validation of <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility</b> using traditional and alternative technologies remains challenging. Recovery of viable spores is cumbersome, as the process requires substantial incubation time, and the extended time to results limits the ability to quickly evaluate the efficacy of existing technologies. Nucleic acid amplification approaches such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) have shown promise for improving time to detection {{for a wide range of}} applications. Recent real-time PCR methods are particularly promising, as these methods can be made at least semi-quantitative by correspondence to a standard curve. Nonetheless, PCR-based methods are rarely used for process validation, largely because the DNA from dead bacterial cells is highly stable and hence, DNA-based amplification methods fail to discriminate between live and inactivated microorganisms. Currently, no published method has been shown to effectively distinguish between live and dead bacterial spores. This technology uses a DNA binding photoaffinity label that can be used to distinguish between live and dead bacterial spores with detection limits ranging from 109 to 102 spores/mL. An environmental sample suspected of containing a mixture of live and dead vegetative cells and bacterial endospores is treated with a photoaffinity label. This step will eliminate any vegetative cells (live or dead) and dead endospores present in the sample. To further determine the bacterial spore viability, DNA is extracted from the spores and total population is quantified by real-time PCR. The current NASA standard assay takes 72 hours for results. Part of this procedure requires a heat shock step at 80 degC for 15 minutes before the sample can be plated. Using a photoaffinity label would remove this step from the current assay as the label readily penetrates both live and dead bacterial cells. Secondly, the photoaffinity label can only penetrate dead bacterial spores, leaving behind the viable spore population. This would allow for rapid bacterial spore detection in a matter of hours compared to the several days that it takes for the NASA standard assay...|$|E

40|$|O objetivo, neste trabalho, foi avaliarem-se três formulações de carne de jacaré-do-papo-amarelo (Caiman latirostris) em conserva: em óleo comestível, em salmoura com cebola e em salmoura temperada. Após o abate, foram separados cortes (seis pares de membros, uma cauda, duas costelas e dois lombos) para a fabricação das conservas. Antes do processamento industrial, realizou-se a análise de ácidos graxos da carne in natura através de cromatografia gasosa. Após o processo de enlatamento, procedeu-se o teste de esterilidade {{comercial}} para alimentos de baixa acidez para as conservas elaboradas, para então avaliar a aceitação sensorial das três formulações, utilizando escala hedônica estruturada de nove pontos. Foram avaliadas a aparência e a impressão global. Foram analisados também o teor de cloreto de sódio, o pH e a composição centesimal (umidade, resíduo mineral fixo, proteínas e lipídeos) das conservas. Os ácidos graxos saturados, monoinsaturados e poliinsaturados corresponderam, respectivamente, a 28, 5; 42, 5 e 29, 0 % do total de ácidos graxos da carne in natura. As conservas, com ausência de vazamento ou estufamento no teste de esterilidade, foram liberadas para análise sensorial. Em relação à aparência, observou-se que as três amostras diferiram significativamente entre si, sendo a conserva em cebola a menos aceita, seguida da conserva temperada e em óleo, que foi a mais aceita. Em relação à impressão global, a conserva em óleo também foi a mais aceita. O teor de cloreto de sódio variou de 0, 5 a 1, 2 %, sendo mais elevado nas conservas em salmoura. A carne de jacaré-do-papo-amarelo em conserva apresentou um pH médio de 5, 0, umidade de 76, 0 %, resíduo mineral fixo de 1, 3 %, concentração de proteínas de 12, 4 % e teor de lipídeos totais de 5, 5 %. A conserva em óleo apresentou um teor de lipídeos mais elevado (12, 8 %). De acordo com os resultados, pode-se concluir que a comercialização de carne de jacaré-do-papo-amarelo em conserva é viável, permitindo o melhor aproveitamento da carne após o abate, com aumento do seu valor agregado e uma boa aceitação sensorial do produto. This research {{focused on}} the evaluation of three broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) canned meat formulas: one in edible oil, another in salt with onions, and the third one in seasoned salt. Some cuts (six pairs of members, one tail, two ribs and two loins) were separated after slaughter to produce the canned meat. Gas chromatographic analysis of the fatty acids in the non-processed meat was conducted before industrial processing. After the canning process, a <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility</b> test for low acidity food was conducted for the canned meat samples. Subsequently, the three formulations were tested for sensory acceptance by a 9 -point hedonic scale {{with respect to their}} appearance and global impression. The sodium chloride content, pH and percent composition (moisture, fixed mineral residue, proteins and lipids contents) of the canned meat samples were determined. The saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids values were, respectively, 28. 5; 42. 5 and 29. 0 % of the total fatty acids in the non-processed meat. The canned meat samples were released after verifying that there were no leaking or blown cans in the sterility test. The three samples were significantly different in respect to appearance. The results showed the following order, from the least to the most acceptable sample: salt with onions, seasoned salt and edible oil. As for the global impression, the formulation in edible oil was also the most acceptable. The sodium chloride content was in the range of 0. 5 to 1. 2 %, where the highest value was found for the samples in salt. The canned meat samples had an average pH of 5. 0, 76. 0 % moisture content and 1. 3 % of fixed mineral residue, a protein concentration of 12. 4 % and a total lipid content of 5. 5 %. The sample in edible oil showed a higher concentration of lipids (12. 8 %). One can conclude from these results {{that it is possible to}} commercialize canned broad-snouted caiman meat, which allows a better use of the meat after the slaughter. There were also an increase in the value added and a good sensory acceptance of the product...|$|E

O leite cru (250 litros) foi dividido em duas porções que foram armazenadas em tanques de expansão a 4 ? 1 ºC por seis dias. Uma porção foi adicionada de CO 2 grau alimentício até que o pH do leite atingisse 6, 20, enquanto a outra serviu de controle. O leite cru foi avaliado quanto ao pH, acidez, prova do álcool, composição físico-química, proteólise, lipólise, cor e concentração de CO 2 após a injeção. Para caracterização microbiológica, o leite cru foi avaliado quanto à contagem padrão em placas e de micro-organismos psicrotróficos no dia da recepção e após seis dias de armazenamento refrigerado. As amostras foram submetidas ao tratamento UHT por injeção direta de vapor (143 ºC/ 4 s), envasadas em embalagens tetra brik asseptic de 125 ml e armazenadas em BOD a 25, 35 e 45 ºC por 180 dias. No dia seguinte, as amostras foram avaliadas quanto as mesmas características do leite cru, além da prova do álcool, viscosidade, sedimentação, eletroforese, peptídeos por HPLC e esterilidade comercial. Após 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 e 180 dias de armazenamento, as amostras foram avaliadas quanto ao pH, acidez, nitrogênio e frações nitrogenadas, cor, ácidos graxos livres, sedimentação, viscosidade, eletroforese e peptídeos por HPLC. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o de sub-sub-parcelas divididas e o experimento foi repetido três vezes. O efeito do tratamento, da temperatura e do tempo de armazenamento, e a interação destes fatores sobre as características do leite UHT foi avaliado por análise de variância (ANOVA) e teste de Tukey ao nível de 5 % de significância. Após seis dias de armazenamento refrigerado, não houve diferença significativa nas características físico-químicas do leite adicionado ou não de CO 2, exceto na quantidade de ácido graxos livres que foi maior no leite controle do que no adicionado de CO 2. A adição de CO 2 inibiu o desenvolvimento de micro-organismos durante o armazenamento refrigerado, uma vez que a contagem total e de psicrotróficos do leite controle foi maior que as contagens do leite adicionado de CO 2. O pH das amostras de leite UHT armazenadas a diferentes temperaturas foi afetado pela temperatura e pelo tempo de armazenamento, apresentando maior decréscimo do pH nas amostras armazenadas a 45 ºC. A cor das amostras a 25 °C não apresentou escurecimento durante os 180 dias, enquanto as armazenadas a 35 °C e 45 °C apresentaram desenvolvimento de cor visível a olho nu e aumento no valor b* ao longo do tempo. A lipólise do leite UHT foi maior nas amostras armazenadas a 45 ºC. A proteólise foi maior no leite armazenado a 45 °C, cujo aumento não refletiu na viscosidade e sedimentação do leite, que não foram significativamente afetados até o 120 ° dia de armazenamento, prazo de validade usualmente garantido pelas indústrias de processamento de leite UHT no BrasilAbstract: The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the effect of CO 2 addition to raw milk on the characteristics of UHT milk obtained by direct steam injection and stored at 25 ° C, 35 ° C and 45 ° C for 180 days. Raw milk (250 liters) was divided in two portions that were stored in bulk tanks at 4 ± 1 ° C for six days. To one portion was added food grade CO 2 until the pH of milk was 6. 20, while the other portion was the control sample. Raw milk was evaluated for pH, acidity, physicochemical composition, proteolysis, lipolysis, color and concentration of CO 2 after injection. Raw milk was evaluated for standard plate count and psychrotrophic micro-organisms on the reception and after six days of cold storage, for microbiological characteristics. The samples were submitted to UHT treatment by direct steam injection (143 °C/ 4 s), packed in 125 ml Tetra Brik Asseptic packing and stored in BOD at 25, 35 and 45 ° C for 180 days. One day after processing, the samples were evaluated for the same characteristics of raw milk, plus alcohol stability, viscosity, sedimentation, electrophoresis, peptides by HPLC and <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility.</b> After 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days of storage, samples were evaluated for pH, acidity, nitrogen and nitrogen fractions, color, free fatty acids, sedimentation, viscosity, electrophoresis and peptides by HPLC. The experimental design was split-split-plot and the complete experiment was repeated three times. The effect of treatment, temperature and storage period as well as the interaction of these factors on the characteristics of UHT milk was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey¿s test at 5 % significance level. After six days of cold storage, there was no significant difference in the physicochemical characteristics of raw milk with or without CO 2 addition, except for free fatty acid values, which were higher for the milk without CO 2 addition. The addition of CO 2 inhibited the development of microorganisms during storage, since the standard plate count and psychrotrophic count of milk control was higher than values for the CO 2 added milk. The pH of UHT milk samples was affected by temperature and storage time, showing greater decrease in pH for samples stored at 45 °C. The color of the samples at 25 °C showed no browning during the 180 days, while those stored at 35 ° C and 45 ° C showed brown color visible to the naked eye and an increased b * value over time. Lipolysis of UHT milk samples was higher for samples stored at 45 °C. The proteolysis was higher in milk stored at 45 °C, whose increase was not reflected in viscosity and sedimentation of the milk, since these parameters were not significantly affected during 120 days-storage, period of shelf life usually guaranteed by the processing industries of UHT milk in Brazi...|$|E

In {{spite of}} the strong appeal that the tropical fruit juice have due to its flavor and the people concern to consume wealthy products, {{there are many reasons}} for the production of purÃ fruit juices and juice products, since they furnish carbohydrates, carotenoids, vitamins phenolic compounds and minerals, important components in the human nutrition and in the control of free radicals. Besides the fruit mixture for beverages, it has been enough studied the addition of components with allegation of functional properties, aiming the preparation of fruit enriched beverages. The cashew apple is a tropical fruit which Brazilian production is located in the northeast being of great social and economic importance for this region. The cashew apple is source of vitamin C and phenolic compounds with high antioxidant properties. The araÃa-boi in despite of its excellent sensory properties, is not consumed raw being used in mixtures. Therefore this work have the purpose to develop mixed beverages using araÃa-boi added with w- 3 following the evaluation of its chemical, physicochemical microbiological and sensorial behavior during 120 days of storage besides the bioaccessibility of its phenolic compounds and antioxidants. The mixed beverage was selected in an experiment of response surface, where the more accepted by the global acceptance test was the formulation containing 18. 6 % of cashew apple and 93. 3 % of araÃa-boi. From this formulation, three beverages were prepared: mixed beverage of cashew apple and araÃa-boi (F 1); mixed beverage of cashew apple and araÃa-boi added w- 3 (F 2); and mixed beverage of cashew apple and araÃa-boi added encapsulated w- 3 (F 3). Several chemical and physicochemical analysis such as: pH, soluble solids, acidity, total carotenoids, instrumental color and bioactive compounds ascorbic acid, total phenolic compounds and quantification of total antioxidant capacity using the methods ABTS and FRAP. The sensorial evaluation was done through affective tests, evaluating appearance, global acceptance and taste, and the microbiological evaluation analysis through tests of <b>commercial</b> <b>sterility.</b> The experiments were performed in three repetitions and the determinations were done in triplicates. The chemical and physicochemical analysis showed small differences among the formulations and storage time being the methods ABTS and FRAP for antioxidant properties whose which presented greater variations. The parameters pH, soluble solids, acidity total, phenolics, L*, a*, b*, croma and Hue did not present significative interactions among the formulations and the storage time. The pH of the mixed beverages cashew apple and araÃa-boi showed averages around 3. 0. The soluble solids contents remained consistent the fixed values for beverages, around 11 o Brix. The ascorbic acid content did not show significative differences among the formulations, varying form 30. 32 to 33. 31 mg. 100 g- 1 of ascorbic acid. The total carotenoids content varied from 187. 73 to 242. 63 Âg. 100 g- 1, observing higher values for the formulations containing w- 3. The values for phenolic compounds varied from 74. 25 to 88. 83 mg AGE. 100 g- 1. The sensorial attributes showed a discrete variation during the storage, accept for the mixed beverage of cashew apple and araÃa-boi added non encapsulated w- 3, due to the appearance of strange taste during storage, characteristic to oxidized w- 3.
