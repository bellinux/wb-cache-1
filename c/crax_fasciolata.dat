50|$|As a {{national}} park the basic objectives are preservation of natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research, educational activities, outdoor recreation and eco-tourism. The park was created primarily {{because it is an}} untouched Cerrado area that is threatened by the recent expansion of the agricultural frontier in Maranhão. It also contains more than 400 springs of important waterways.Protected species in the park include the oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), cougar (Puma concolor), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), bare-faced curassow (<b>Crax</b> <b>fasciolata)</b> and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus).|$|E
50|$|Ilha Grande is in a {{transition}} between cerrado (characteristic of the Pantanal) and seasonal Forest. Already fauna has several endemic species and/or endangered. Among the terrestrial fauna species were recorded as the marsh deer (Blastocelus dichotomus), the alligator-the-crop-yellow (Caiman Latorostris), the jaguar (Panthera onca), tapir (Tapirus terestris) {{and the giant}} anteater flag (Myrmecophata trydoctyla). Aquatic fauna include: painted (Pseudoplatystoma corruscans) jaú (Paulicea luetkeni), armed (Pterodoras granular), gold (Salminus maxillosus), pacu (piractus mesopotamicus) and avifauna is cited: jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), jaó (Cryptrellus undulatus), curassow (<b>Crax</b> <b>fasciolata),</b> American spoonbill (Platalea ajaja) and Jacana (Jacana jacana).|$|E

40|$|The {{bare-faced curassow}} (<b>Crax</b> <b>fasciolata)</b> {{is a large}} Neotropical bird that suffers {{anthropogenic}} pressure across much of its range. A captive population is maintained for conservation management, {{although there has been}} no genetic screening of stocks. Based on the six microsatellite markers developed for Crax globulosa, the genetic variability of C. fasciolata and possible differences between a wild and a captive population were investigated. Only three loci were polymorphic, with a total of 27 alleles. More than half of these alleles were private to the wild (n = 8) or captive (n = 7) populations. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were restricted to the captive population. Despite the number of private alleles, genetic drift has probably promoted differentiation between populations. Our results indicate that wild C. fasciolata populations are genetically impoverished and structured, but species-specific microsatellite markers will be necessary for a more reliable assessment of the species` genetic diversity.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of hunting animals is of fundamental importance for human subsistence in different tropical areas. Knowing the chosen species, {{the techniques of}} capture and the quantity are fundamental aspects {{to understand how to}} use and the degree of threat of hunting on each wild species. In this perspective, the objective of this work was to record the wild animal species most commonly used as food resource in five rural settlements in the municipality of Uruará-PA, in addition to qualify the main techniques of capturing these species. The data collection was made through semi-structured interviews and participant observation. For the selection of the interviewees, we adopted the “snowball” method. As a result, we identified 38 species of animals consumed, most being mammals (42. 1 %), followed by birds (39. 4 %) and reptiles (18. 5 %). The species most frequently mentioned were: Cuniculus paca (n= 156), Euphractus sexcinctus (n= 154) and Pecari tajacu (n= 137). The most used technique was hunting with shotgun. Among the animals cited, Priodontes maximus, Tayassu pecari, Tapirus terrestris, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Podocnemis unifilis, Tinamus tao, <b>Crax</b> <b>fasciolata</b> and Podocnemis unifilis are in the list of threatened species. The results point to the urgent need for educational programs to farmers regarding the unsustainable use of animals...|$|E
40|$|The Cerrado is now {{considered}} the most threatened biome of South America. Northwestern Minas Gerais state, in southeastern Brazil, still harbors large areas of extreme importance for biological conservation of the Cerrado. The current study provides the first thorough assessment of the avifauna of a large remnant of Cerrado vegetation in this region, the Fazenda Brejão. Data {{are based on a}} bird survey conducted from November 1998 to January 2007. This area is a private property of 20. 000 ha preserved that lies in a region recognized for its palm groves, a pristine Cerrado (savannah-like vegetation) and gallery forests. Bird censuses were carried out through random transects censuses, mist-net captures and recording bird vocalizations. It was recorded 273 species, belonging to 56 families. This represents 32 % of all 857 bird species recorded for the Cerrado. Palm groves held approximately 42 % of all recorded species. We also recorded endemic species of Cerrado as well as adjacent biomes such as the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga. Regional threatened species were also recorded such as the Greater Rhea Rhea americana, the Chestnut-bellied Guan Penelope ochrogaster, the Bare-faced Curassow <b>Crax</b> <b>fasciolata,</b> the Black-and-white Hawk-eagle Spizastur melanoleucus, the Blue-and-yellow Macaw Ara ararauna, the Yellow-faced Parrot Alipiopsitta xanthops and the Minas Gerais Tyrannulet Phylloscartes roquettei. This species diversity reveals the biological importance of the region. The establishment of a natural reserve in the region will be an essential measure to guarantee the biological conservation of one of the best preserved areas of Cerrado to date in southeastern Brazil...|$|E
