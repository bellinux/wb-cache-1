40|$|Light {{scattering}} {{in biological}} tissues and blood {{leads to a}} reduction in imaging spatial resolution, imaging depth and contrast of optical imaging techniques. Refractive index mismatch between erythrocytes and blood plasma is the main source of light scattering in blood. Immersion method for optical clearing of biological tissues and blood can be applied to improve light transport. Application of biocompatible <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> can lead to reduction of light scattering in turbid biological samples and enhancement of optical penetration depth in tissues and blood. The mechanism of the enhancement of transmittance depends on the particular agent applied, its concentration and stage of the measurements. Determination of optimal type and concentration of <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> for blood optical clearing is required for effective and non-destructive usage of optical clearing techniques. The purpose of this work is to investigate systematically the mechanism of optical clearing of blood by use of various biocompatible <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> and determination of the optimal type and concentration of <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> for blood optical clearing in order to improve light penetration depth for optical imaging techniques. The experiments carried out on animals showed the possibility of in vivo applications of optical clearing method. The scattering and absorbing properties of blood are determined by the optical properties of hemoglobin. The knowledge of refractive index of human hemoglobin is important for practical applications in blood and tissue optics. The direct measurements of refractive index of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in wide range of concentrations were carried out in visible and near infrared region. The suggested model functions allow to estimate the refractive index of hemoglobin with arbitrary concentrations, including highly concentrated hemoglobin as in blood and in erythrocytes...|$|R

[...] This clause allowed member banks and the boards of these clearing houses to stifle any competition that might arise from smaller upstart banks by simply telling their member banks not to act as their clearing agents.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore {{the concept of}} moral economy in times when people {{anticipate}} radical socio-economic change. Fassin (2009 : 1251) has recently aimed to revitalize the concept of moral economy by defining it as “the production, distribution, circulation, and use of moral sentiments, emotions and values, and norms and obligations in social space”, and thus he emphasized it to be dynamic. When people expect radical socio-economic change individuals and groups are forced to reposition themselves within the moral economy. I claim that we can only understand what forces the moral economy to be reorganized if we incorporate Zigon’s concept of moral breakdown (2007) {{in the domain of}} the moral economy. By exploring the informal jua kali clearing business in the Ugandan-Kenyan border town of Malaba, I demonstrate that the jua kali <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> experience an existential crisis now that their business is likely to be dismantled in the future. I argue that this existential crisis triggers a collective moral breakdown that demands the jua kali <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> to reposition themselves in the moral economy, which shows the dynamic nature of the moral economy...|$|R

After a time of typically one or two days to let the antibody accumulate in the tumour, a <b>clearing</b> <b>agent</b> may be given to eliminate residues of antibody that are still circulating in the bloodstream; this is especially done in humans. After a further waiting time, the radiotherapy (90Y-DOTA-biotin) is administered. Due to the high affinity of biotin to avidin and streptavidin, the radiotherapy accumulates where the antibody is, namely in the tumour, where it delivers its radioactivity.|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aim: To {{assess the}} impact of new {{alternative}} solutions to formaldehyde and xylene on tissue processing, 13 different tissue processings were designed and performed on thirteen different tissues by using five different fixatives (formaldehyde, Glyo-Fixx®, FineFix®, Cell-block®, Green-Fix®) and four different <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> (xylene, Sub-X®, Bio-clear®, Shandon Xylene Substitute®). Materials and Methods: Hematoxylin and Eosine stained sections were compared by using qualitative histomorphological criterions. Histochemical and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining results were compared with qualitative and quantitative data obtained by a computer program, respectively. Tissue sections were tested for the availability of chromogenic in situ hybridization, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, and DNA quality by polymerase chain reaction. Results: The quality of sections was well for all tissue processings. All alternative solutions were suitable for histochemistry. IHC staining results showed that alternative solutions that contain glyoxal as active agent need optimization for this application. The clearance of signals with chromogenic in situ hybridization were nearly same and well for all tissue samples. Furthermore, tissue processes that do not contain formaldehyde were found to be superior on preservation of nucleic acids. Conclusion: Formaldehyde-free fixatives and alternative <b>clearing</b> <b>agents</b> have potential in routine pathology and research to replace formaldehyde and xylene...|$|R
