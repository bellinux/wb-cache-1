40|$|As {{improvements}} in processor speed continue to outpace {{improvements in}} cache and memory speed, poor locality increasingly degrades performance. Because copying garbage collectors move objects, {{they have an}} opportunity to improve locality. However, no static copying order is guaranteed to match program traversal orders. This paper introduces online object reordering (OOR) which includes a new dynamic, online class analysis for Java that detects program traversal patterns and exploits them in a copying collector. OOR uses runtime method sampling that drives just-in-time (JIT) compilation. For each hot (frequently executed) method, OOR analysis identifies the hot field accesses. At garbage collection time, the OOR collector then copies referents of hot fields together with their parent. Enhancements include static analysis to exclude accesses in cold basic blocks, heuristics that decay heat to respond to phase changes, and a separate space for hot objects. The overhead of OOR is on average negligible and always less than 2 % on Java benchmarks in Jikes RVM with MMTk. We compare program performance of OOR to static class-oblivious copying orders (e. g., breadth and depth first). Performance variation due to static orders is often low, but can be up to 25 %. In contrast, OOR matches or improves upon the best static order since its historybased <b>copying</b> <b>tunes</b> memory layout to program traversal...|$|R

50|$|Besides many dance tunes {{found in}} {{collections}} {{from the end}} of the 18th century, such as those of Niel Gow, and Aird, the manuscript also includes a significant number of earlier 18th-century tunes. Among these are a variation set on Lasses likes nae Brandy, deriving indirectly from a composition by David Young, in the Macfarlane manuscript, probably via a later printed collection by McLean; a variation set on Further Benn the Welcomer, deriving from a version in Flores Musicae, or The Scots Musician, published in 1773, of which a copy is in the Wighton Collection at the University of Dundee; and a tune here called Nea Good Luck, but generally known as Up and war them all Willie, a version deriving from Oswald's Caledonian Pocket Companion of about 1750. Rook's title may derive from the fact that this tune, and the song in 6/8 time, Nae Good Luck, use the same passamezzo moderno ground bass. Versions of Alloway House, The Deukes dang ower my Daddie are also taken from Oswald,. as well as Love is the Cause of my Mourning,. It thus seems that Rook had access to either a printed copy of the Caledonian Pocket Comoanion, or good manuscript <b>copies</b> of <b>tunes</b> from it.|$|R

In an Interview to the press before release of the film, Puri Jagannath and Thaman responded to the issue. Puri Jagannath spoke [...] "Yes. It is inspired from an old Italian song and I don’t see what is the problem with it. We have been inspired by many foreign things. Have we invented the movie camera with which we are shooting?

[...] Later, another hit song [...] "Chandamama", in which the much hyped lip lock of Mahesh Babu and Kajal Aggarwal was featured at the end, was alleged to be copied from He Lives in You, a song written and performed by Lebo M and his South African Choir for the CD Rhythm of the Pride Lands whose shorter version of the song was used in the opening of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. After the release of the film, It landed in a controversy with the Bajrang Dal lodging a police complaint that one of the songs in the film contained vulgar words and conveyed unacceptable meaning. In his complaint to the Mahankali police, Dal city unit's representative Murali alleged that the song in question, [...] "Bad Boys", was written with vulgar words and demanded action against the film's director, Puri Jagannath, for screening such a vulgar song for public viewing at cinema houses.
