40|$|Indiepop was, and is, {{a musical}} genre that {{coalesced}} around UK punk and post-punk {{in the early}} 1980 s. From punk, indiepop borrowed certain ideas {{about the politics of}} cultural production. What differentiated it from punk was its sound: a decidedly pop emphasis on short, melodic song structures and seemingly simple instrumentation. In embracing independent production, indiepop staked a claim for subculture authenticity over the inauthentic mass products of the mainstream music industry. Yet the defining musical elements were characteristic of the historically feminine pop idiom. The result was indiepop, where masculine authenticity and feminine pop forms melded together and created a music scene that fit uneasily within traditional definitions of subculture. This thesis explores the means by which participants in indiepop, through a <b>concerted</b> <b>project</b> to write their version of musical history, made sense of their particular scene and its place within the larger sphere of (masculine) rock culture...|$|E

40|$|Heartwater (cowdriosis) {{is caused}} by Cowdria ruminamium and {{transmitted}} by Amblyomma ticks. To gain further understanding on the epidemiological state of heartwater on smallholder dairy farms in Kenya, a new serological heartwater test (MAP- 1 branched peptide ELISA) was first optimised and then applied on bovine sera collected at sites included in an ECF p 67 vaccine impact study (ILRl). Further, the suitability of three sites for potential heartwater vaccine studies (EU <b>Concerted</b> <b>Project)</b> was to be assessed. These consisted of two sites of the ECF Project and a third one (Mugie Ranch), where clinical heartwater {{has been reported in}} sheep and goats. The ELISA was optimised using 72 bovine sera from experimental Cowdria infections. A cut-off was calculated that included 97 % of the 645 'negative' sera from cattle in Kenya. At the sites of the ECF Project, 399 cattle were sampled monthly for five months and a total of 1631 sera tested. The data from the two sites where Amblyomma had been found was pooled to represent the 'exposed' cohort, the others to represent the 'unexposed' cohort. The serological results of the cohorts were compared and expressed as relative risks and risk differences. Single and multiple seroconversions to the MAP-I branched were observed for both cohorts. Findings suggest that only one in three animals of the exposed cohort seroconverted due to exposure to Cowdria. An incidence rate of 11 seroconversions per 100 animals months was calculated for the exposed cohort. The results of the 110 sera from Mugie are presented without data analysis. The findings and underlying assumptions to the calculations are discussed in relation to the present knowledge on heartwater. It is concluded that the MAP- 1 branched peptide ELISA has not been sufficiently validated to permit a full understanding and characterization of the epidemiological state of heartwater at the sites where an EFC vaccine might be applied or in terms of assessment of sites for potential heartwater vaccine studies...|$|E
40|$|The MDGs {{represent}} a <b>concerted</b> <b>project</b> that {{gave birth to}} unprecedented synergetic efforts. Ever since their enunciation, they became the focus of political discussions and actions in the field of economic and social development, meetings and conferences were held regularly in order to reaffirm their importance, their effort and to evaluate the accomplished progress. Among the Goals, the creation of a global partnership for development is often considered the weak link in the chain, whether in relation to the difficulties for the main actors of the cooperation for development policies to converge on common goals through constructive dialogue aimed at efficient and effective actions, or for the need to define new forms of cooperation that would start from the comparison and the involvement of the non-institutional actors of civil life. In this perspective, the UN urged the adoption of a public and a participatory process bottom-up aimed at analyzing the progress and the achievements in relation to the development and the elaboration of new proposals, {{in such a way as}} to shape the priorities by creating a stronger sense of belonging to the community. For this purpose, a series of consultations has been initiated to meet the request for greater participation in the formation of a new agenda for the post- 2015 development, which is an innovation and an achievement for the adopted methods and for the aroused interest. This research aims to analyze what the contribution of these consultations to the global debate is, which help to reveal people's priorities and to provide key inputs to the discussion of a post- 2015 future development program. At the same time, it explores the potentialities of a synergic cooperation as the fundamental link between international development cooperation, decentralized cooperation and territorial cooperation, a source of renewal in the conception of development based on participation, rights and freedoms, strengthening territorial capacity in the global context and the creation of a network of exchanges that constitute the platform for the construction of new multidimensional development policies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{a region}} of ca 7000 km 2, the geoarchaeological survey, {{carried out by the}} “Arid Margins of Northern Syria” mission, {{discovered}} more than one thousand sites. They were in a rather good condition, and for some of them in an exceptional state of preservation. All placed within their environmental context, they shed new light on the knowledge of the steppe regions for all periods in the history of Syria and the Middle East. This article discusses the period of the Middle Bronze Age, which saw an accentuation of the defensive character of the sites and, above all, the protection of the useful territory. The question of borders and, more broadly, of territorial boundaries in the ancient Orient is one of the subjects often debated and the discoveries made in the Arid Margins area have several times contributed significantly to this debate. Thus, one of the oldest boundaries marked on the ground is the “Very Long Wall” that we connect with the Early Bronze Age IV (Geyer et al. 2010). The kind of fortification of the “Arid Margins” zone in the Middle Bronze Age has a different system of logic. At that time was set up {{what appears to be a}} genuine network, relying on a hierarchized system (in terms of distribution and dimensions) of fortresses, forts, towers and small towers. This article describes this system which has only been briefly mentioned in our previous publications. It presents the plans of each type of fortified site, specifies their mode of construction and installation, and places them in their environmental context. Since this system was mainly located within the area we were surveying, it has been possible to define on the ground its implantation modalities and morphological characteristics. The constructions are built on naturally fortified locations or more rarely on artificial embankments and are built mostly with large polygonal basalt blocks. One of the decisive criteria for their location is the visibility between establishments, which are spaced at a maximum of 20. 8 km, to allow signals-based communications. According to this logic, we were able to reconstruct the extension of this network well beyond the limits of the zone we have been surveying, on a distance north-south of ca 150 km for an average depth of 30 km (but which can reach more than 70 km). This research, using satellite imagery, has allowed to discover unknown and unpublished sites, some of them reaching up to 50 ha. Finally, the geometrical characteristics of their geographical distribution, too regular to be due to chance, show that there is a unity between this network and the large contemporary cities known around the steppe: Yamhad (Aleppo), Qatna (Tall Mishrifa), Ebla (Tall Mardikh), Tall al-Nasiriya, Tall Tuqan and Tall al-Sour. These largely unpublished data, connected with the context of the settlement of the margins of the steppe during the Middle Bronze Age, allow us to propose a first interpretation of the primary functions of this network. It was established for the most part at the eastern edge of fertile basaltic plateaus, making the most of the relief, decidedly turned towards the east, and its role would consist in the defense of the territory, the surveillance and protection of the axes of circulation (some of which have been stated by our study), communication (by signals), but also and above all the protection of the most attractive lands in terms of potential for settlement and agricultural development. It is at least towards these conclusions that the analysis of the geographical and material data provided by the survey of the arid margins area of Northern Syria leads. Our research, based on the analysis of a corpus of nearly a hundred sites, shows that, from the end of the Middle Bronze Age I, a defense organization would have been set up on a regional scale and as well, most likely, the coordination of the defensive systems of several kingdoms involving an overall design, a <b>concerted</b> <b>project.</b> This structuring would have been based on the creation of new sites, fortifications at the edge of the basaltic plateaus dominating the steppe and their network of secondary installations: forts and towers, which protected the lowlands agglomerations during the Middle Bronze Age II. The findings of the “Arid Margins of Northern Syria” mission thus make it possible to reinterpret the results of the study of the neighboring regions and sites and to consider the whole from a broader and systemic point of view, thanks to a diachronic and multidisciplinary method of survey and global analysis, developed, tested and validated by our team. The purpose of this article is to present to the specialists of this period the primary data collected during the survey of the arid margins and by the study of aerial imagery in an analysis detached from the historical considerations, but which we wanted rigorous. The description of this network is only a first step. While waiting to be able to return to the field, we leave it to the historians and archaeologists specialists of the period to deepen these lines of reflection.

The Pearson correlation coefficients between observed and predicted values were equal to 0. 76 and 0. 66 for laboratory experiments and 0. 74 and 0. 59 for field experiments, respectively, for the sweat rates and the rectal temperatures.

It makes provision for health claims on foods, including reduction of disease risk claims, and thus recognises the importance of food and nutrition for health. Member states have provided suggestions for claims regarding "the role of a nutrient or other substance in growth, development and {{the functions of the}} body" (Article 13. 1) by January 2008. The suggested claims are now considered by the Commission, in consultation with the European Food Safety Authority, and a list of approved claims will be compiled by January 2010. In addition to being scientifically underpinned, approved claims should be meaningful to European consumers to facilitate their choice of a healthy diet. Disease risk reduction claims and claims referring to children's development and health (Article 14) require specific and extensive applications and are handled on a case by case basis.

The main aim was to create an overview of Nordic classification and monitoring of habitats on a landscape level and to suggest improvements of the Pan-European BioHab habitat categories. Since only three countries represent the Nordic/Baltic region among a total of 13 partners in BioHab, it was necessary to collect knowledge and draw experience from additional Nordic colleagues.

The calculated pre-exponential factors and activation energies for the concerted ozonolysis of ethene and propene are in good agreement with experimental values. However, the PMP 4 //DFT procedure incorrectly predicts the stepwise mechanism as the favored channel. UCCSD(T) predicts the concerted mechanism as the favored channel but significantly overestimates the activation energies. RCCSD(T) {{is found to be}} more accurate than UCCSD(T) for the calculation of the concerted mechanism but is not applicable to the diradical intermediates. The major difficulty in accurate prediction of the rate constant data for these reactions is the wide range of spin contamination for the reference UHF wave functions and UDFT solutions across the potential energy surface. The possibility of the partial ozonolysis mechanism being the source of epoxide observed in some experiments is discussed...|$|R

[Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]Information is required on pesticide risk indicators used in Europe in order to optimise their use to reduce the environmental impact of pesticides. The present study was performed to compare and evaluate eight pesticide risk indicators developed in Europe and to give recommendations for further use and harmonisation of these risk indicators. This paper is {{based on the results of}} the CAPER <b>project</b> (<b>concerted</b> action on pesticide risk indicators). First the indicators and their methodologies were characterised. The eight indicators differed with regard to the compartments, effects and methods used to calculate environmental impact scores. Subsequently, the environmental risk of 15 individual pesticide applications was assessed with the eight indicators and the outcomes were compared. The rankings of the 15 applications by the indicators differed when the score for the environment as a whole was concerned. This was caused by the large variety in environmental compartments taken into account by the indicators. However, for the individual compartments surface water, groundwater and soil the indicators gave similar rankings of the 15 pesticide applications. The ranking based on the indicator ???kilograms of active ingredient??? did not correlate with most of the rankings by the risk indicators. Indicators are regarded as useful tools for the reduction of the environmental impact of pesticides. The development of a scientific framework for indicators in farmer decision tools is needed to harmonise and increase the use of pesticide risk indicators in the European Union...|$|R

Here we update estimates and their uncertainties for current anthropogenic and natural N₂O emissions and for emissions scenarios to 2050. Although major uncertainties remain, ‘bottom-up’ inventories and‘top-down’ atmospheric modeling yield estimates that are in broad agreement. Global natural N₂O emissions are most likely between 10 and 12 Tg N 2 O-N yr˄− 1. Net anthropogenic N₂O emissions are now about 5. 3 Tg N₂O-N yr˄− 1. Gross anthropogenic emissions by sector are 66 % from agriculture, 15 % from energy and transport sectors, 11 % from biomass burning, and 8 % from other sources. A decrease in natural emissions from tropical soils due to deforestation reduces gross anthropogenic emissions by about 14 %. Business-as-usual emission scenarios project almost a doubling of anthropogenic N₂O emissions by 2050. In contrast, <b>concerted</b> mitigation scenarios <b>project</b> an average decline of 22 % relative to 2005, which {{would lead to a}} near stabilization of atmospheric concentration of N₂O at about 350 ppb. The impact of growing demand for biofuels on future projections of N₂O emissions is highly uncertain; N₂O emissions from second and third generation biofuels could remain trivial or could become the most significant source to date. It will not be possible to completely eliminate anthropogenic N₂O emissions from agriculture, but better matching of crop N needs and N supply offers significant opportunities for emission reductions...|$|R

Given the increasing need to ensure high quality of care within the current worldwide context of cost containment, appropriate use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as GI endoscopy, is crucial. Clinical practice guidelines are de-signed to assist in this task; {{but they need to}} be based on well-documented and validated methods. One of the lead-ing approaches is the RAND appropriateness method [1 – 3] which combines expert opinion with available scientific evidence. Studies comparing the Swiss and US panel-based criteria for the appropriateness of GI endoscopy have shown that the method is reliable [4, 5]. With criteria de-veloped according to this method in 1994, we have asses-sed both over- and underutilisation of gastroscopy and co-lonoscopy in prospective studies [6 – 9]. Because no criteria were available to define the appropriate use of gastrointestinal endoscopy on a European level, the aim of the Lausanne conference was to develop criteria of appropriateness and necessity, within a <b>concerted</b> action R&D <b>project,</b> to improve quality of care within the Euro-pean Community. It should be added, however, that – given the significant differences in health care systems, care re-sources, mentalities and cultures within Europe – the multi-national character of the Lausanne Conference does not preclude the possibility that criteria may be customized to the context of a particular country. The Lausanne Conference The European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointes-tinal Endoscopy (EPAGE), convened in Lausanne, Switzer-land in November 1998, was the first international panel ever conducted using the RAND panel method.

40|$|The {{following}} article {{considers the}} extent to which the Nigerian jihadi group, Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad (JAS), also known as Boko Haram, is transforming its model of governance from domination by violence and force to governance through civil administration and public support. Drawing on over four years of research and programming in north-east Nigeria, the authors consider three aspects of such a transformation: the development of institutions, the propagation of an ideology and programmes to win over the hearts and minds of the wider population, and the role assigned to women and girls. The article finds that JAS has established little in the way of a civilian administration in the areas that have come under its control. Likewise, the movement has apparently made no <b>concerted</b> effort to <b>project</b> a vision of a future society or concrete benefits of the envisaged caliphate that would generate a level of public support. Moreover, the brutal treatment of women and girls belies any attempt by the movement to promote a positive vision of the role of women, even as wives and mothers. In this, JAS is seen to differ from a number of other jihadi movements that have relatively sophisticated approaches to generating popular support and recruiting members. The article goes on to suggest a number of reasons for JAS’s failure to move towards a polity that is more consensual and less dependent on violence, as well as its implications for those who would seek to restrain the expansion and ideological reach of jihadist groups. It concludes by offering suggestions of how the government can seize the opportunity presented by this lack of a state-building strategy, in order to show the people of north-east Nigeria that it can offer a better alternative...|$|R
40|$|Amongst the {{manpower}} problems facing South Africa {{at the end}} of the 1970 's, are the prevalence of poverty amongst a large proportion of the population, a shortage of skilled labour combined with a surplus of unskilled labour, and a need to establish equal opportunities for all members of the labour force in all sectors of the economy. These same three problems (with some differences in emphasis) were also recognised in the United States of America in the period following the Second World War. Various groups, from social reform organisations to the Federal Government, initiated <b>concerted</b> and large-scale <b>projects</b> in an attempt to solvt* the problems. Voluntary efforts were made by both the public and private sectors, while legal measures were introduced to provide the necessary and relevant backing. Some twenty years later poverty, under-utilisatior of manpower and unequal employment opportunities, are no longer problems of such magnitude. Because the US has not only experienced the same problems as South Africa, but has also found solutions to them, it was logical to study the US situation and to compare it with the South African one. This research rBport concentrates on the use and effectiveness of minimum wage legislation in combating poverty; of training schemes in alleviating both aspects of the skill problem; and of personnel practices in creating an environment in which equal opportunities is a meaningful concept for all workers. It was found that US minimum wage legislation does not, by itself, cause general unemployment, because not all sectors of the economy are subject to the laws. However certain groups of workers have experienced higher rates of unemployment, and the relatively high minimum wage appears to have been a contributory factor...|$|R
40|$|BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND THE TERRITORY BY THE MEANS OF LANDSCAPE The actual {{transition}} to non-carbon energies is changing our territories. Energy and the territory {{are in fact}} strictly linked, since production, transportation, consumption of energy happen in the space and heavily influence landscape transformation. Nevertheless on one side energy policies did not adopt any territorial approach in designing this transition, {{and on the other}} side landscape policies and planning rarely include energy dimension. There is then a need of bridging the gap between energy and the territory. This can be done developing research at the crossroads of landscapes and energies (Nadai and Van den Horst, 2010). This article presents some results of the international research “Ressources paysagères et ressources énergétiques dans les montagnes sud-européennes. Histoire, comparaison, expérimentation » (Landscape resources and energy resources on the south European mountains. History, comparison, experiments), that worked on the landscapes of hydropower, under a geo-historical point of view. Its main objective is to analyse the “landscapes of energy” and the social representations connected, today and in the past, with the development of energy infrastructure. The project focused on hydropower development from the end of the XIX century until nowadays, in four different European mountainous study areas. On this basis, the research tried to identify some tools for a “mediation paysagère”, a mediation by the means of landscape, that can help actors in conceiving together energy project and territorial project. Landscape seems able to bridge the gap between energy development and the territory. The question is how to make its role of interface emerge, activating its underlying character of intermediator. As the article shows, studying mountain landscape helps to reveal and to highlight the complex interrelations among hydropower development and the territory. Since landscape links people and the territory, it can be used as a tool to recognise territorial potential of energy development, giving back to energy its spatial and social dimension. In the energy field, the discourse on landscape is normally focused on the potentially negative impact of infrastructure associated with the exploitation of renewable energy. This exclusively “visual” landscape appears on one side as an obstacle to the development of new energies, on the other side something to be protected against them. Our research aims to contribute to the current debate, testing the landscape as a tool to ensure that the choices on energy become a strategic element of territorial <b>concerted</b> <b>projects,</b> able to take charge of the complex relationship between society / territory / environment. The research identifies and tests some methods to use the landscape as an instrument of intermediation, as a reference to be shared among the actors involved. This would happen making the geohistorical and socio-ecological complexity of landscape accessible to them. The landscape brings deep traces of the relationship between man and energy. This awareness allows us to read landscape through energy, showing how energy is inherent in the forms and transformations of the landscapes itself. To achieve this, it is necessary to question landscape as a witness, showing how the energy sector have influenced its transformations. Stakeholders must be able to access information and data included in the landscape-archive. To reading landscape through energy we need a new specific knowledge, a geohistorical research collecting materials useful to build what we called “scénarios paysagers de l’énergie” (landscape scenarios of energy). This is a tool, both discursive and visual, allowing to highlight the sequence of events at the crossroads between people and the territory, that leave their traces on the landscape. Landscape records somehow this sequence, its inflection points, its lulls. Like a backdrop (scenario in Italian) landscape modifies following the storyline (scénario en Français) and commenting it with its own language. Like a backdrop changes in the crucial moments of the comedy, so the landscape can change dramatically when it changes the relationship between resources and society. In the mountains the relationship between society, the visible forms of the territory and the exploitation of its energy potential appears particularly easy to read. For example the exploitation of solar energy has largely determined, anywhere, settlements, agriculture, pastoral and forest activity, etc. – in a word – the configuration of mountain landscapes itself. The slope, the altitude gap, is another typically mountainous energy factor: it allows for example to exploit running water, transforming kinetic in mechanical energy. This last case is the one exploited by hydropower energy. Hydropower appeared on the European mountains between the end of the XIX and the beginning of XX century. This was the last energy transition before the present one. Showing how hydroelectricity changed the mountain landscapes helps us to better understand what is at stake in the current energy transition. Observing the interaction between energy production and the generation and transformation of the landscape we can distinguish two levels. The first is direct, for example when hydropower infrastructures generates their “technological” landscape, sometimes very visible, even exhibited, sometime the hydropower landscape is completely invisible, hidden underground. But there is a second, indirect level of interaction: when a new energy system settles in, it is always accompanied by deep changes. Every change establishes important interactions between hydropower development and forests resources, agro-pastoral resources, tourism, the protection of nature and the use of water. The article presents some examples of these interactions in the research study areas, where the interface character of the landscape becomes explicit and active. Reading landscape through energy appears to be the way towards the building of a collective sensibility: not only to observe the elements of the territory and give them a value and a sense, but also a way to make shareable gaze emerge, to enter the game with a co-constructed representations, to build something that can be placed at the intersection of subjectivities. In this sense the “lecture énergétique du paysage” works with landscape as intermediator. It is at the base of what we call a process of “mediation”, whose characteristic is to build the territorial project on a shareable knowledge and negotiated the distribution of values and meanings...|$|R
