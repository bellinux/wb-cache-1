In this paper we discuss agency problems that emerge when there is only one shareholder (and no debt), but where the shareholder is a trust with separate income and <b>capital</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Trust ownership of this sort is not uncommon. The agency problems emerge as the two classes of beneficiaries have claims on cash flows that occur at different times, with income beneficiaries having claims until “capital” is transferred to the <b>capital</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> The agency problems that are discussed are dividends, risk shifting, capital structure, cost capitalisation, and investment policy. In all cases agency problems arise, and in some respects the agency problems are more pervasive than in the more “orthodox” settings. ...|$|R
30|$|Why was {{interest}} in the take-up of seed capital so low? One possibility is that {{the complexity of the}} Swiss DI system made it very difficult for beneficiaries to understand the incentives involved, and, as a consequence, many beneficiaries decided not to participate in the programme. Thus, simplifying the DI system may increase the responsiveness of beneficiaries to financial incentives. Another possibility is that the programme was designed poorly. More specifically, to qualify for seed <b>capital,</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> had to give up certain DI benefits in return for a possibly higher, but uncertain labour income. It is very likely that risk-averse beneficiaries did not perceive this offer as advantageous. A programme that would allow beneficiaries to keep their benefits while making a work attempt would probably be more successful in increasing return-to-work.|$|R

(Agric Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 The {{fundamental}} {{objective of}} this study was to determine the impact of PLAS Land Reform Projects on the livelihood (financial, human, physical, natural and social <b>capitals)</b> of <b>beneficiaries.</b> The population of the study included all beneficiaries (97) of PLAS projects within Dr. Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality. Fifty four beneficiaries were randomly selected from all 36 projects and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Data collected was sorted, coded and analysed using version 21 of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Frequency count and percentage were used to summarize the data. The identified major constraints affecting PLAS projects were found to be: lack of resources (77. 9 %), lack of finance (77. 8 %), lack of water (77. 8 %), lack of incentives (66. 7 %), lack/poor infrastructure (64. 8 %) and high inputs cost (59. 3 %). The respondents indicated that lack of finance was caused by both lack of government support and inability to access credit from financial institutions, Jack of assets and land ownership which could be used as security to secure loans. Binary Logit Regression Model was used to determine factors influencing the impact of PLAS projects on the livelihood of beneficiaries. Five explanatory variables found to be statistically significant were: size of projects (Z= 1 -. 905 : P 0. 01), sufficient funding (Z= 1. 657 : P< 0. 01), established market (Z= 2. 552 : P 0. 05). Wilcoxon Sign-rank Sum Test was used to determine the "before" and "after" impact of PLAS Land Redistribution projects on the livelihood (financial, human, physical, natural and social <b>capitals)</b> of <b>beneficiaries.</b> The findings showed that significant difference existed on the livelihood (social, financial, physical, natural and human capital) before and after participating in PLAS projects. The result indicated an inverse relationship in terms of the impact of PLAS projects on the livelihood of beneficiaries implying that discontinuation or no participation in PLAS projects could reduce livelihood capitals or negatively affect beneficiaries' livelihood.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. The Constitution of the Republic of South Afi'ica, 1996 {{acknowledges}} the customary system of law directly (section 211) {{and the religious}} based systems of law indirectly (section 15 (3)). The objective of estate planning is to assure the most benefit, use and enjoyment of possessions for the owner with emphasis on the reduction of income and estate tax. The question to be addressed is whether the variety of matrimonial dispensations in South Africa have an influence on estate planning within the Constitutional order. The comparative method is used to achieve this objective by comparing the Islam, Hindu, African Customary law and the Common law matrimonial dispensations. The study {{is based on a}} literature'study. According to. Islam law a woman is inferior to a man. All marriages are concluded out of community of property. A woman may hold property but her husband has control over it. She is entitled to a dowry. Muslim marriages are potentially polygamous. A Hindu woman never reaches majority and the concept of in or out of community of property does not exist in Hindu law. Property belonging to women is divided into two groups namely stridhana and the limited female estate. Hindu marriages are potentially polygamous. According to the customary law a woman has a lesser status than a man but the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 rectifies the situation by declaring man and woman equal. Indigenous women are thus allowed to own property. The concept of in or out of community of property is unknown to customary law but the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998 states that all marriages concluded after the commencement of the Act will be in community of property and in community of profit and loss unless an antenuptial contract is drawn up stating otherwise. Indigenous marriages are potentially polygamous. Only monogamous marriages are acknowledged in Common law. All marriages are in community of property and profit and loss unless stated otherwise in an antenuptial contract. The Fourth Law Amendment Act 132 of 1993 declared men and women equal in all matters. With regard to estate planning the following remarks can be made. Testamentary succession in Muslim law is limited to one-third of the property owned by the deceased. The remaining two-thirds of the property is divided according to the rules of intestate succession. Women may inherent only half as much as men. Muslim law is not recognised in South Africa and a testator will have to set up a trust to ensure that his wishes are fulfilled. In Hindu law the man only has a limited freedom of testation regarding the joint family property. Likewise, the woman only has freedom of testation regarding her stridhana. Hindu law is not recognised in South Africa and a testator will have to set up a trust to ensure that his wishes are fulfilled. A person married according to customary law does not have freedom of testation regarding movable property. There are certain rules in customary law determining the way in which estates should be divided. According to the Nguni, the eldest son of the first wife of the testator not only inherits the estate, but also the status as head of the family and the joint family estate. Women are not allowed to inherit property. According to the common law of South Africa, trusts are frequently used as estate planning instruments. Trusts have large advantages when it comes to estate planning and tax reductions. Section 4 (q) of the Estate Planning Act 45 of 1955 provides that all bequests made to the surviving spouse are exempt from tax. The fact that Muslim and Hindu marriages are not recognised in South African law means that this provision is not applicable to them. By setting up trusts, Muslims and Hindus can ensure that their wives are financially taken care of. The women and/or daughters can be appointed as income beneficiaries and the children as <b>capital</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> The customary law testator can ensure that all his children are treated equally by appointing not only his eldest son, but all his children, as <b>capital</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> He can set up a trust for each of his wives {{in the case of a}} polygamous marriage, thereby ensuring that each of them receive income after his death. The conclusion is that the type of matrimonial dispensation according to which one is married, definitely has an influence on estate planning. It does not seem possible to create a family law system which will please all the people of our rainbow nation because of all the different cultures that exist. Master...|$|R

Using a three-year panel of beneficiary and control households and controlling for potential program endogeneity, we find that crop or job loss and illness shocks significantly increase child labor and access to credit helps reduce the adverse effect of these shocks. Additionally, the results suggest that FA consistently reduces the number of hours of child labor and increases the number of study hours, but not school enrollment, for households under shocks. In addition, we find that the program provides strong incentives for children to combine work and school when households are exposed to shocks. These results reveal that CCT programs can work as insurance for the schooling of the poor but are not able to completely displace costly risk-coping strategies...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} appraises {{the impact}} of the Fast Track Land Reform Programme at three resettled communities in Kadoma District, Zimbabwe. In particular it assesses the livelihood practices of land recipients and their effects on the natural environment. Two of the communities, Lanteglos and CC Molina were resettled under the A 1 villagised and self-contained settlement scheme and are found in the Natural Farming Region III. Pamene, the third community, was resettled under the A 2 small-scale commercial settlement scheme and is found in the Natural Farming Region IIb. Multiple research methods including household surveys, interviews, observations, reviews of literature and map construction through the use of Geographic Information Systems, allowed for the collection of empirical, descriptive, and spatial data to provide for the appraisal. The land use practices included dry land crop production, livestock rearing, vegetable gardening and exploitation of the natural environment for a variety of purposes. Farming was mostly subsistence with the use of traditional equipment by all three communities. Tenure was perceived to be insecure by beneficiaries and although a variety of papers to show ownership were held, none provided for leasing or freehold tenure. Despite acquiring natural capital from the resettlement process, the findings of this research show low levels of financial, physical and social <b>capital</b> amongst <b>beneficiaries.</b> Moreover climatic variability, the declining macro-economic and unstable political environment and little support from government have adversely affected the livelihoods of beneficiaries. The implication of all this has been a reduction in livelihoods that are based solely on agricultural production, leading to off-farm practices primarily exploiting the natural environment. The long term effect would be increased degradation of the environment, leading to reduced arable and grazing land, and thereby hindering sustainable livelihoods from farming. Recommendations are proposed based on this research’s findings being typical in Zimbabwe. Central to this is the need for government to revise its present land policy and, provide for a comprehensive and holistic land policy that should be based on the vision of how agriculture should evolve in Zimbabw...|$|R

Data drawn from 271 business ventures established between the years 2005 and 2009 was analysed by using the Cox proportional hazards model (CPHM), a survival analysis technique. Results from the analysis suggest that businesses operated by younger owners endure {{a higher risk of}} failure in comparison to businesses owned by older entrepreneurs while firm size at start-up was also a significant determinant of survival. As a component of human capital, a personal contribution to the start-up capital and prior employment experience were also found to be significant predictors of business survival. Regarding gender of the business owner, the claim that female operated businesses face a higher probability of failure when compared to businesses run by males was not supported by the study results. The amount of funding from the DOY at start-up was found not to have any influence on the survival or failure outcomes for the business projects. Based on these findings, certain policy implications can be deduced. This study recommends that policy makers focus more on human <b>capital</b> requirements of <b>beneficiaries</b> of government business development initiatives as well as entrepreneur contribution to start-up capital in order to increase the success rate of the business ventures.

Where improved systems had been established sustainability was often doubtful because of insufficient levels of water tariffs and, concerning small urban supply systems, by ineffective management, operation and maintenance. Utilisation of the improved sources once established or rehabilitated turned out to be limited, which was due to both environmental (water quality and quantity) and socio-political factors involving issues of acceptance, 'elite capture' and equity.

40|$|This {{investigation}} is conducted {{against the background}} of current attempts to rehabilitate and revive the now defunct Tyhefu irrigation scheme. The poor track record of many irrigation schemes (despite huge investments) in the former homelands has prompted the government to reconsider its active and direct role in small-scale irrigation farming. This has resulted in the closure of many irrigation schemes including Tyhefu irrigation scheme. The new policy framework in South Africa, known as the irrigation management transfer, is premised on the transfer of ownership, authority and responsibility of small-scale irrigation schemes from government to the farmers. Tyhefu irrigation scheme was a state-driven, top-down initiative. This study argues that the justifications for the Tyhefu irrigation scheme were conflated, with the result that the need for political control of the Tyhefu area far outweighed the considerations regarding the financial viability and sustainability of the proposed project. Given the repressive political climate of the time in South Africa, the planners' proposals were a mechanism for the realization of the socio-political and economic agendas of the apartheid state and Ciskei government. Although technical factors critical for project success were examined, little or no attention was paid to the socio-economic aspects. For the planners, the main requirements for success entailed centralized managerial control, no participation of the <b>beneficiaries,</b> <b>capital</b> intensive and sophisticated agricultural techniques and the production of high value crops. Therefore, {{it can be argued that}} the nature of the planning and implementation of the Tyhefu irrigation scheme was ill-conceived, short-sighted and misguided. A review of the literature on irrigation development on the African continent provided useful insights for this study. The lessons from irrigation development experience in Sub-Saharan Africa indicate that the continent is littered with examples of derelict and costly failures. What stands out in many of these irrigation projects is their over-emphasis on technical issues to the complete neglect of human and other social aspects. Working partnerships between the farmers and irrigation scheme management could, thus, not be realized. Almost without exception the case studies used here indicate that the industrious type of farmer was never developed as was envisioned in the planning documents. Neither were rural livelihoods improved in a sustainable manner. The findings of this study suggest that irrigation management transfer is a complex and delicate process. In this new set of arrangements, beneficiaries face formidable challenges in terms of capacity (human and financial) if small-scale irrigation farming is to become a viable sector. No doubt, the viability and sustainability of the Tyhefu irrigation scheme demands a comprehensive package of interventions that address various issues of markets and marketing, capital investment and access to finance, technology, education and training, support and extension services. It is evident that institutional aspects and the related issue of functional literacy require much more attention than thus far. As a result, at the moment there is no possibility for independent agricultural production. KMBT_ 36...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} trends in antipoverty policy in recent decades has been the emergence of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes. CCTs seek to address poverty in the short-term through the cash benefit to meet immediate needs, and in the long-term by increasing human capital formation among poor children to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. With their growing popularity, there has been considerable effort to evaluate CCTs' impacts; however, evaluations have been limited mostly to measuring short-term impacts. Very little is known of CCTs' long-term impacts, particularly the extent to which human <b>capital</b> formation among <b>beneficiary</b> children and young people is occurring and whether this may be contributing to changed life trajectories for them. Drawing on qualitative research with current and former beneficiaries of Brazil's Bolsa FamÃ­lia programme (BFP), this thesis helps to fill this gap by exploring young people's schooling and labour market trajectories and outcomes, and the implications of these for long-term, intergenerational poverty reduction. The micro-level qualitative approach taken in this research stands in contrast to the almost exclusively macro-level, quantitative evaluations that have dominated the CCT research. Such approaches are not well suited to teasing out the complex social processes that shape long-term trajectories and outcomes, nor to understanding the perspectives and experiences of young beneficiaries' themselves. This research demonstrates the importance of young beneficiaries' perspectives and experiences in understanding the long-term impacts of CCTs, as well as the social processes shaping them. This thesis makes three main contributions to the current research on CCTs. Analytically, it deconstructs and theorises the CCT model for long-term poverty reduction; empirically, it sheds light on the long-term impacts and outcomes of CCTs and the factors that influence these; and methodologically, it employs a qualitative approach that engages directly with beneficiary youth and families. The findings show that the human capital model that underpins CCTs does not hold when considering beneficiaries' long-term trajectories and outcomes. Young beneficiaries {{do not appear to be}} securing the schooling outcomes that would be consistent with changed labour market trajectories, nor do they appear to be incorporated into the labour market in ways that hold much scope for lifting them out of poverty. Rather, various structural barriers and social processes not accounted for in the BFP/CCT model â from the quality of schooling and learning, to labour market segmentation and labour supply, demand and returns; to wider structures of marginalisation â, appear to constrain young beneficiaries' opportunities to move out of poverty. The findings highlight some of the contradictions and tensions that currently exist between programme goals and structure, implementation, and outcomes. Although CCTs have contributed to important gains for the poor in various ways, their potential for facilitating long-term poverty reduction appears limited. Rather, CCTs as a policy tool for breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty will require re-thinking the ways in which such programmes are situated within broader structures of inequality and limited opportunities that contribute to the reproduction of poverty across generations. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is about the}} study of the social capital, its effects on the local development and on the socio-economic resilience of the Palestinians trapped in the East Jerusalem's al-'Eizariyah area. The transformation of al-'Eizariyah since 2002 through the Israeli encroachment on Palestinian land by instrumental use of the Separation Wall policies was analysed and re-state through the lenses of the sociological theory and concepts. Based on the accounts of life stories and interviews with various members of the al-'Eizariyah's former and present community and through the visual data of the changes in al-'Eizariyah and the areas adjacent to the Separation Wall a study of the Palestinian coping and survival strategies was undertaken. The thesis demonstrates how the reality of al-'Eizariyah was changed dramatically {{in the last two decades}} despite and in the opposite direction of the Oslo Accords of 1993. To be sure, al-‘Eizariyah, which is located two miles east of Jerusalem, had expanded to adjust to the economic boom of the early post-Oslo years coupled with the political expectations of it being part of the future Palestinian capital. This was disrupted by the failure of the Oslo Accords, and the construction of the Israeli Separation Wall in 2002, which served as an instrument of intimidation and harassment to make Palestinians leave Jerusalem, as this thesis demonstrates. The Wall did not only cut off al-'Eizariyah from the main road that used to connect East Jerusalem to Jericho. The Wall's more sinister and long-term damage has been in the physical and psychological isolation of al-‘Eizariyah and in preventing its residents from being fully integrated in the economic, social, cultural, and political life of the East Jerusalem and of the West Bank. This two-sided effect of the Separation Wall started when most of the people who used to work in East Jerusalem and Israel lost their Jobs, students could no longer study in Jerusalem and had to change schools; the sick no longer could use the healthcare facilities, etc. Former residents of al-'Eizariyah could no longer do any of these basic necessities neither their shopping and entertainment in Jerusalem freely without being humiliated with denial of access to Jerusalem based on the persons' ability to present a Blue ID at the checkpoint, the only ID that is recognized by the Israeli regime. While some social capital forms helped in coping with the difficulties caused by this new reality it was the difference in the pre- and post-Wall situations that were examined in order to understand the impact of the adversity represented by the Wall on the social capital of the Palestinians. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the implications of the construction of the Wall on the socio-economic life of al-‘Eizariyah residents and to study the Israel-Palestine conflict from sociological lens using a case study setting and qualitative analysis approach. This thesis demonstrates positive impact of the Wall on social capital types by where the bonding social capital became stronger yet the trend got reversed. At the community level, the challenges were too large to be handled only by bonding social capital. Therefore, there is a combined effort between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the local civil society associations and the private sector to overcome problems related to education, health care services, trade and labour in addition to social security caused by the Wall. It was found that bridging social capital and linking social capital were strongly present after the Wall was completed. Although civil society associations are strongly present in al-‘Eizariyah but because the Palestinian society is structured along patrimonial, familial, clannish, tribal and contradictory geographical cleavages, most of these associations work in a way that transformed the intended outcome of bridging social capital to some kind of bonding social <b>capital</b> as the <b>beneficiaries</b> and the participants are mostly from their family, clan members, or those who belong to the same political party, and not the community as a whole. However, observations and the empirical evidence show that bonding is stronger than bridging social capital. The social fragmentation caused by several social forces such as the local-stranger relationship, between the locals of al-‘Eizariyah and the displaced residents, prevented efficient cooperation in solving community problems. Lack of the sense of belonging is not only because the locals always express superiority over the displaced, but also because the displaced themselves do not want to lose their rooted original identity, especially the refugees who settled in the town after the 1948 war. This had a great overall impact on the unity of the Palestinian society especially that ‘the refugees’ communities constitute approximately 42 percent of the total population of the West Bank. The future challenge of the Palestinians in areas such as al-‘Eizariyah is to find ways of detecting de-fragmentation and manipulation policies and develop strategies that would prevent de-fragmentation of the Palestinians being orchestrated by the Israeli Wall policies and that only become apparent with a time lapse when it can be too late. ...|$|R
40|$|The Programa de AquisiÃÃo de Alimentos (PAA) (Food Acquisition Program) {{was created}} in 2003 with the aim to {{encourage}} family agriculture, involving actions that facilitate the distribution of food produced by family agriculturists to people, which are {{in a situation of}} food insecurity. Just like any other program, {{there is a need to}} assess whether public resources are invested effectively providing positive outcomes for their beneficiaries. Honey is configured as one of the main products received by the PAA because their nutritional importance. The technological level adopted by beekeepers can influence the aspects of productivity and production. In this sense, this work sought to analyze the main socioeconomic determinants of technological level of these beekeepers, as well as evaluating the impacts of PAA in CearÃ on productivity, employment and income generation and social capital. The data used in this study were obtained with the application of questionnaires to beekeepers beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of PAA. Regarding the methodological procedures, the technique of factor analysis was adopted to measure the technological and social capital level. To analyze the main socioeconomic determinants of technological level of beekeepers, we opted for the logistic regression model. The procedure Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to assess the impacts of the program on its beneficiaries. Among the main results, we can highlight that the age reduces the chance of beekeepers achieve better technological levels. Also, schooling, have received training before starting the activity, after starting beekeeping, have beekeeping as main activity, amount of labor in the management, use skilled labor, increased rates of social capital increase the chances the beekeeper have better technological level in the activity. With regard to the impact of PAA, we observe positive impacts on productivity, income and level of social capital of beekeepers. Therefore, we can conclude that the technological level of beekeepers is primarily determined by characteristics of beekeepers in beekeeping and elderly beekeepers are more rigid in relation to technological change, while the more educated adopt more appropriate technological practices. Regarding the impact of the PAA, it can be concluded that the PAA is configured as an effective instrument for stimulating the production of honey and income generation, because it offers the best price. Moreover, the program operates as an important way to combat hunger, misery and also, as a relevant strategy for the process of accumulation of <b>capital</b> among its <b>beneficiaries.</b> O Programa de AquisiÃÃo de Alimentos (PAA) foi criado, em 2003, com o objetivo de incentivar a agricultura familiar, envolvendo aÃÃes que possibilitem a distribuiÃÃo de alimentos produzidos pelos agricultores familiares para pessoas em situaÃÃo de inseguranÃa alimentar. Assim como qualquer outro programa, existe a necessidade de avaliar se os recursos pÃblicos investidos estÃo efetivamente proporcionando resultados positivos para seus beneficiÃrios. O mel se configura como um dos principais produtos recebidos pelo PAA, dado sua importÃncia nutritiva. O nÃvel tecnolÃgico adotado pelos apicultores pode influenciar nos aspectos de produtividade e produÃÃo. Nesse sentido, este trabalho buscou analisar os principais determinantes socioeconÃmicos do nÃvel tecnolÃgico desses apicultores, bem como avaliar os impactos do PAA no Estado do CearÃ sobre a produtividade, geraÃÃo de emprego e renda e capital social. Os dados utilizados na pesquisa foram obtidos com a aplicaÃÃo de questionÃrios junto a apicultores beneficiÃrios e nÃo beneficiÃrios do PAA. No que concerne aos procedimentos metodolÃgicos, a tÃcnica de anÃlise fatorial foi adotada para mensurar o nÃvel tecnolÃgico e de capital social. Para analisar os principais determinantes socioeconÃmicos do nÃvel tecnolÃgico dos apicultores, optou-se pelo modelo de regressÃo logÃstica. O procedimento de Propensity Score Matching (PSM) foi utilizado para avaliar os impactos do programa sobre seus beneficiÃrios. Entre os principais resultados, pode-se destacar que a idade reduz a chance dos apicultores alcanÃarem melhores nÃveis tecnolÃgicos. TambÃm, a escolaridade; ter recebido capacitaÃÃo antes de iniciar a atividade; ter recebido capacitaÃÃo depois de iniciar a atividade apÃcola; ter a apicultura como atividade principal; a quantidade de mÃo de obra no manejo; utilizar mÃo de obra capacitada e o Ãndice de capital social aumentam as chances de o apicultor ter melhor nÃvel tecnolÃgico na atividade. Com relaÃÃo aos impactos do PAA, observam-se impactos positivos sobre a produtividade, a renda e o nÃvel de capital social dos apicultores. Portanto, pode-se concluir que o nÃvel tecnolÃgico dos apicultores Ã determinado principalmente por caracterÃsticas do apicultor na atividade apÃcola e que apicultores com maior idade sÃo mais rÃgidos em relaÃÃo Ãs mudanÃas tecnolÃgicas, ao passo que os mais escolarizados adotam prÃticas tecnolÃgicas mais adequadas. Quanto aos impactos do PAA, pode-se concluir que o PAA se configura como efetivo instrumento de estÃmulo Ã produÃÃo de mel e geraÃÃo de renda, pois oferece melhor preÃo. Ademais, o programa atua como importante meio de combate Ã fome e Ã misÃria e, tambÃm, como estratÃgia relevante para o processo de acumulaÃÃo de capital social entre seus beneficiÃrios...|$|R
