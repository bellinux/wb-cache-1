5|$|The Combine is {{composed}} of various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout Half-Life 2 and its expansions are the transhuman Overwatch soldiers and human <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> officers. A variety of combat machines also encountered, ranging from APCs and helicopter gunships to a giant 'Smart wall' which encloses occupied cities and gradually destroys anything in its path. A number of weaponised alien 'synths' are also encountered by Freeman.|$|E
5|$|The Combine's first {{appearance}} is in Half-Life 2. Through {{the early stages}} of the game, Combine <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in Half-Life, Breen sees Freeman as a major threat. As Freeman escapes the city, <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. Freeman and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine. In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.|$|E
5|$|Due to Lane's {{projected}} path {{near the}} western coast of Mexico, authorities closed ports to small {{boats in the}} cities of Acapulco. Just weeks after Hurricane John took a similar path through the area, several tourists voluntarily left their vacations to fly home. Many residents boarded up buildings and bought hurricane supplies {{in preparation for the}} storm. Officials also closed schools across the state of Guerrero. In all, 40,400tourists were evacuated from the Mexican coastline. According to the Secretaría de Gobernación, under which the Mexican <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> Service operates, there were 5.5million homes and 21million people in 21states threatened by the system in all of Mexico. As a result, authorities evacuated about 2,000people to emergency shelters.|$|E

5|$|Forecasters and {{computer}} models at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center predicted that Hurricane Dean would impact the Yucatán Peninsula a full 6days {{before the storm}} actually arrived. The hurricane's stable and well predicted path gave all {{of the countries in}} the region ample time to prepare for its arrival. On August 17, {{at the request of the}} Quintana Roo state government, which was expecting their state to suffer a direct hit, the <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> Office of Mexico's federal Interior Ministry declared a state of emergency for the entire state. This included the towns and cities of Cancún, Playa del Carmen, and Chetumal as well as the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Holbox.|$|E

The islands of Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Kitts were placed under {{a tropical storm}} warning the following day. These advisories were discontinued following Danny's degradation to a tropical depression on August24. Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40flights across the eastern Caribbean due to the hurricane and cruise ships altered their courses. Although members of the Haiti Office of <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> issued an official statement to residents saying Danny was {{not a threat to}} the country, they convened to discuss potential preparations and the status of emergency supplies.

5|$|Because Howard {{remained}} {{away from}} land no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued. One ship, the Strong Virginian, reported sustained winds 42mph (68km/h) at 0600UTC on September4. Along the Baja California Peninsula, 1618ft (4.85.4m) swells were reported. All ships {{were required to}} remain at port due to the rough seas. Heavy rains in the mountainous and Pacific coastal areas of Baja California produced flooding which washed out several roads in San José del Cabo. The rains did help increase water levels in some reservoirs in Baja California. An estimated 2,000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged by the storm and 48 households were damaged throughout four communities. State and federal authorities purchased temporary homes for those who needed shelter in the affected areas. The State <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> in Mexico provided rehabilitation {{for a total of}} 393 homes affected by Howard.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the timing}} of its dissipation, Emily spared {{neighboring}} Haiti from the devastation initially anticipated. At least 235 people in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gonaïves and Miragoâne, required evacuation {{at the height of}} the storm. In Artibonite, <b>civil</b> <b>protection</b> teams evacuated roughly 300 residents. Rainfall triggered floods that damaged over 300 homes throughout the country, while several cholera treatment centers were destroyed. At the risk of new outbreaks, special sterilizers were distributed to sanitize possibly contaminated waters. A body was recovered from a ravine near Les Cayes, but the exact cause of death was disputed; another person in the area sustained injuries after being hit by a fallen tree. High winds caused some property damage in Léogâne and Jacmel.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hours after}} Patricia was {{classified}} as a tropical storm on October12, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for areas along Baja California Sur between La Paz and Santa Fe.

However, the storm's rapid decay on October14 allowed the watches and warnings to be discontinued. Officials in the threatened region began preparing by closing schools and opening 159 shelters on October12. The <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> Department was prepared to evacuate residents in low-lying area if necessary. Resorts and hotels cancelled all outdoor activities and brought all loose objects indoors. The city of Los Cabos was placed under {{a state of emergency}} as flooding rains were forecast to impact the area. Ports in the region were also shut down due to rough seas.|$|E

5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in Half-Life 2 states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by {{a range of}} species. The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is {{shown to be a}} brutal police state. In City 17, an Eastern European city, <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains. Vortigaunts, alien creatures from the original Half-Life, are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to , the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds; both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|On November26, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for Baja California Sur between Todos los Santos and Los Barriles; this was discontinued less than 24hours later.

On October22 and 23, the Haitian government ordered level 1 and then level 2 alerts for the county in anticipation of Tropical Storm Alpha's rainfall. Haiti was already experiencing flooding from Hurricane Wilma's passage between October8 and 19, so the threat of more rainfall was particularly dire. The country's Centre National de Meteorologie issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides. The local government of Sud-Est ordered the evacuation of its capital city, Jacmel. The national government mobilized personnel and resources of the Direction of <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection,</b> the Secrétariat Permanent de Gestion des Risques et des Désastres (SPGRD), and the National Police to pre-arranged Emergency Operation Centres.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{hurricane}} made landfall, Mexico's natural disaster fund provided $1.45 million in aid to repair pipelines, highways, and buildings.

5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican food bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it. Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid.
