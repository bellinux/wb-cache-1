5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous <b>chondrocyte</b> implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E

Design: With human cartilage and <b>chondrocytes,</b> we have explored the duration of binding of <b>chondrocytes</b> to cartilagein vitroand {{the expression of the}} β-galactosidase gene introduced into the <b>chondrocytes</b> through infection with an adenoviral vector before and after transplant of the <b>chondrocytes</b> to cartilage. Results: Transplanted <b>chondrocytes</b> continued to bind to cartilage explants at 45 days in our longest trial. We could successfully infect <b>chondrocytes</b> with adenovirus at least 35 days after we transplanted the <b>chondrocytes</b> to cartilage.

This is due to a mutation in a Fgf gene, causing a premature and constitutive activation of the Stat1 transcription factor. <b>Chondrocyte</b> cell division is prematurely terminated, resulting in lethal dwarfism. Rib and limb bone growth plate cells are not transcribed. Thus, the inability of the rib cage to expand prevents the newborn's breathing.|$|E

25|$|IGFBP-3 exerts {{antiproliferative}} {{effects in}} many cell types by blocking {{the ability of}} IGF-1 and IGF-2 to activate the IGF1R (which stimulates cell proliferation). For example, in esophageal epithelial cells, responsiveness to IGF-1 stimulation is suppressed by secreted IGFBP-3 and restored when IGFBP-3 is downregulated by epidermal growth factor. IGFBP-3 can also inhibit cell function by mechanisms that are independent of effects on IGF1R signaling, even in cells that entirely lack IGF1R. IGF (or IGF1R) independent effects are commonly studied using mutant forms of IGFBP-3 with decreased IGF binding affinity. Thus, IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in differentiating <b>chondrocyte</b> precursor cells is seen equally with a non-IGF binding IGFBP-3 mutant, demonstrating that the mechanism does not involve IGF binding. IGF1R-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 may involve the induction of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad and may be mediated by ceramides (pro-apoptotic lipids), or potentiate ceramide action IGFBP-3 interaction with nuclear hormone receptors may also lead to inhibition of cell proliferation.|$|E

2500|$|For HDACs 4, 5 and 7, conserved binding domains {{have been}} {{discovered}} that bind for C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and 14-3-3. All three HDACs work to repress the myogenic transcription factor MEF2 which {{an essential role in}} muscle differentiation as a DNA binding transcription factor. Binding of HDACs to MEF2 inhibits muscle differentiation, which can be reversed by action of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) which works to dissociate the HDAC/MEF2 complex by phosphorylating the HDAC portion. They have been seen to be involved in cellular hypertrophy in muscle control differentiation as well as cellular hypertrophy in muscle and cartilage tissues. HDACs 5 and 7 have been shown to work in opposition to HDAC4 during muscle differentiation regulation so as to keep a proper level of expression. There has been evidence that these HDACs also interact with HDAC3 as a co-recruitment factor to the SMRT/N-CoR factors in the nucleus. Absence of the HDAC3 enzyme has shown to lead to inactivity which makes researchers believe that HDACs 4, 5 and 7 [...] help the incorporation of DNA-binding recruiters for the HDAC3-containing HDAC complexes located in the nucleus. When HDAC4 is knocked out in mice, they suffer from a pronounced <b>chondrocyte</b> hypertrophy and die due to extreme ossification. HDAC7 has been shown to suppress Nur77-dependent apoptosis.

However, to generate a construct of reasonable size, large numbers of <b>chondrocytes</b> are required, which limits its current applicability. Therefore, the authors evaluate the suitability of a combination of cells for cartilage regeneration: bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells and ear or nasal <b>chondrocytes.</b> Methods: Human bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells were encapsulated in alginate hydrogel as single-cell–type populations or in combination with bovine ear <b>chondrocytes</b> or nasal <b>chondrocytes</b> at an 80 : 20 ratio.

The goal {{of this study was to}} compare the chondrogenic capacity of <b>chondrocytes</b> from healthy and OA joints. DesignChondrocytes isolated from nine healthy and nine OA knee joints were expanded in monolayer for two passages. <b>Chondrocytes</b> from passages 1 and 2 were analyzed for expression of (de) differentiation and hypertrophy markers and were seeded at passage 2 on collagen-coated filters for redifferentiation culture to study cartilage matrix formation. ResultsThe collagen II/I mRNA ratio, reflecting differentiation, decreased from passage 1 to 2 in both <b>chondrocytes</b> from OA joints and <b>chondrocytes</b> from healthy joints (P< 0. 05), without a significant difference between the two donor types. At passage 1, levels of the cartilage transcription factors Sox- 5, Sox- 6 and Sox- 9 appeared to be higher in <b>chondrocytes</b> from OA joints (n. s.), but this was not seen at passage 2. However, a clear difference was observed in collagen type X expression, which was high in <b>chondrocytes</b> from OA joints at both passages, while undetectable in <b>chondrocytes</b> from healthy joints (P< 0. 01). Tissue generated by <b>chondrocytes</b> from healthy joints redifferentiated for 28 days, showed a significantly better morphology, as assessed by histological scoring (P< 0. 01) and higher proteoglycan content (P< 0. 05), compared to <b>chondrocytes</b> from OA joints.

When the frequency was greater than 0. 2 [*]Hz, the extreme value stress of response curve tended to be constant. Cyclic loading had a large influence on the distribution of liquid pressure in <b>chondrocytes</b> in the middle and deep layers. The concentration of fluid pressure changed alternately from intracellular to peripheral in the middle layer. Both the range of liquid pressure in the upper <b>chondrocytes</b> and the maximum value of liquid pressure in the lower <b>chondrocytes</b> in the same lacunae varied greatly in the deep layer. At the same loading frequency, the elastic modulus of artificial cartilage had little effect on the mechanical environment of <b>chondrocytes...</b>|$|R
