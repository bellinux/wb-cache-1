25|$|The {{complexity}} {{and weight of}} mechanical flight control systems increase considerably with the size and performance of the aircraft. Hydraulically powered control surfaces help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft's size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot's muscular strength. At first, only-partially boosted systems were used in which the pilot <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> some of the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces (feedback).|$|E
500|$|Nomura was {{hesitant}} about {{releasing a}} Kingdom Hearts title on the Game Boy Advance, {{feeling that the}} 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. Nomura changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the GBA. After exploring ideas for the gameplay, he felt that a 2D Kingdom Hearts game would be possible, and that it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> like and play like what gamers were used to in the original. Meanwhile, Nomura {{wanted to give the}} game a [...] "lighter tone" [...] than the PlayStation 2 games.|$|E
60|$|Arriving at this conclusion, I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> compassionately and generously towards Lucilla. Far from blaming my poor deluded sister-friend for her cruel {{departure}} and her yet crueler letter, I {{laid the}} whole fault {{on the shoulders}} of Nugent. Full as my mind was of my own troubles, I could still think of the danger that threatened Lucilla, and of the wrong that Oscar had suffered. I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> the old glow of my resolution to bring them together again, and still remember (and determine to pay) the debt I owed to Nugent Dubourg.|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} {{space is}} an important idea to blur boundaries between time and space. As showed {{in the case of}} Pan River, I have demonstrated value and signification of heritage site could be sensed through the spatial narrative written by the ancient. It was like a star in the sky holding the potential to lighten the way of the present to the future. Ancient site in Qufu’s local gazetteer was recorded as ancient traces, where “the righteous men went to the site, viewing traces and behaviors towards imagining the ancient. ” China holds heritage sites of a great number for sure, but the value of using them is to step on the traces of the ancient and think with a dialogical heart, only in this way <b>could</b> we <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> the unchangeable power in historical space and be touched. Moreover, it is how no matter how ruined or vacant this site will be, it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be sensed as a respective place as moral space...|$|R
60|$|Though {{henceforth}} elbowed {{out of many}} {{a chance}} threepenny job by the added thousands who contended with him against starvation, nevertheless, somehow he continued to subsist, as those tough old oaks of the cliffs, which, though hacked at by hail-stones of tempests, and even wantonly maimed by the passing woodman, still, however cramped by rival trees and fettered by rocks, succeed, against all odds, in keeping the vital nerve of the tap-root alive. And even towards the end, in his dismallest December, our veteran <b>could</b> <b>still</b> at intervals <b>feel</b> a momentary warmth in his topmost boughs. In his Moorfields' garret, over a handful of reignited cinders (which the night before might have warmed some lord), cinders raked up from the streets, he would drive away dolor, by talking with his one only surviving, and now motherless child--the spared Benjamin of his old age--of the far Canaan beyond the sea; rehearsing to the lad those well-remembered adventures among New England hills, and painting scenes of rustling happiness and plenty, in which the lowliest shared. And here, shadowy as it was, was the second alleviation hinted of above.|$|R
60|$|They parted from Mr. McEachern on {{the first}} landing, but Jimmy <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> those eyes. The policeman's stare had been {{of the sort that}} turns corners, goes upstairs, and pierces walls.|$|E

60|$|Jill {{had listened}} to this {{diatribe}} with a certain uneasiness. Her brief encounters with Mr. Goble told her that every word was probably true.

But her pride forbade any admission of weakness.|$|E

60|$|Rose sat in silence. This {{had been}} another great period of growth. She <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> {{the heat and}} turmoil in her brain. It was as if upon a {{seed-bed}} of quick-shooting plants a bright, warm light had been turned, resulting in instant, magical activity. At her door they put her down, and once more she thanked them.|$|E
60|$|Ursula was dazed. She <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> {{the touch}} of the mistress's body against her own--only this, only this. The rest of the {{swimming}} time passed like a trance. When the call was given to leave the water, Miss Inger walked down the bath towards Ursula. Her rust-red, thin tunic was clinging to her, the whole body was defined, firm and magnificent, as it seemed to the girl.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} second it {{scarcely}} seemed to stir, then the motion grew palpable, {{and at that}} instant Leonard heard a noise behind him and felt his left foot clasped by a human hand.

60|$|After {{it became}} quite dark Clayton <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> those terrible eyes upon him. He dared not sleep, {{and yet so}} {{exhausted}} was he {{that it was a}} constant fight to retain consciousness. After what seemed an eternity of suffering his head dropped upon a thwart, and he slept. How long he was unconscious he did not know--he was awakened by a shuffling noise quite close to him. The moon had risen, and as he opened his startled eyes he saw Wilson creeping stealthily toward him, his mouth open and his swollen tongue hanging out.|$|E
60|$|But if we saw Piet's face no more, we <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> {{the weight}} of his hand, since from that time forward we began to suffer from thefts of cattle and other {{troubles}} with the natives, which--so Sihamba learned in her underground fashion--were instigated by him, working through his savage tools, while he himself lay hidden far away and in safety. Also he did us another ill turn--for it was proved that his money was at the bottom of it--by causing Ralph to be commandeered to serve on some distant Kaffir expedition, out of which trouble we were obliged to buy him, and at no small cost.|$|E
6000|$|Tomyris {{treated it}} with every {{possible}} indignity. She cut and mutilated the lifeless form; {{as if it}} <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> the injuries inflicted by her insane revenge. [...] "Miserable wretch!" [...] said she; [...] "though I am in the end your conqueror, you have ruined my peace and happiness forever. You have murdered my son. But I promised you your fill of blood, and you shall have it." [...] So saying, she filled a can with Persian blood, obtained, probably, by the execution of her captives, and, cutting off the head of her victim from the body, she plunged it in, exclaiming, [...] "Drink there, insatiable monster, till your murderous thirst is satisfied." ...|$|E

6000|$|No matter! Every hill-top was {{a little}} different, every valley was somehow new. Cossethay and her {{childhood}} with her father; the Marsh and the little Church school near the Marsh, and her grandmother and her uncles; the High School at Nottingham and Anton Skrebensky; Anton Skrebensky and the dance in the moonlight between the fires; then the time she {{could not think of}} without being blasted, Winifred Inger, and the months before becoming a school-teacher; then the horrors of Brinsley Street, lapsing into comparative peacefulness, Maggie, and Maggie's brother, whose influence she <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> in her veins, when she conjured him up; then college, and Dorothy Russell, who was now in France, then the next move into the world again! ...|$|E
60|$|Then he {{received}} a heavy blow on the head. Somebody had struck him with the butt of a whip or riding quirt. The pain was distressing; he felt dazed and stupid, disinclined to move, but he retained consciousness. There were sounds to which he could attach a meaning: a rattle of harness which indicated that his driving team was being loosened, a thud of hoofs as the heavier Percherons were led away. In the meanwhile he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> a strong grasp on his shoulder, holding him down, and {{once or twice a}} man near him gave the others sharp instructions. Grant made a languid effort to fix the voice in his memory, but this was difficult because his mind worked heavily.|$|E
60|$|He, however, {{advanced}} up the Nile, ravaging and plundering {{the country}} as he went on, and at length, {{in the course of}} his conquests, he gained possession of the tomb in which the embalmed body of Amasis was deposited. He ordered this body to be taken out of its sarcophagus, and treated with every mark of ignominy. His soldiers, by his orders, beat it with rods, as if it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel,</b> and goaded it, and cut it with swords. They pulled the hair out of the head by the roots, and loaded the lifeless form with every conceivable mark of insult and ignominy. Finally, Cambyses ordered the mutilated remains that were left to be burned, which was a procedure as abhorrent to the ideas and feelings of the Egyptians as could possibly be devised.|$|E
50|$|All the while, Kida is {{learning}} about {{the outside world and}} is adapting well. However, she <b>still</b> <b>feels</b> guilty, as there <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be other Atlantean war machines in the world causing problems, like the Leviathan. Their next mystery is in the Southwestern United States, involving coyote spirits opposing them. They later find a hidden city in Arizona that contains a statue that greatly resembles Atlantean architecture. Unfortunately, a very sly shop owner, Ashton Carnaby (Thomas F. Wilson), intends to pillage the place for its valuables, but the spirits then turn him into one of them. A man named Chakashi (Floyd Red Crow Westerman), who is a Native American wind spirit, trusts them with the knowledge of their sanctuary and informs Kida that she can choose Atlantis' destiny.|$|R

60|$|There {{could be}} no mistake. He passed his finger over the stain; he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> the slippery, infinitesimal powder of the pollen. It was not there when he had closed the box that morning; it was {{impossible}} {{that it should be}} there unless the box had been opened in his absence. He re-examined the contents of the box; the papers were all there. More than that, they were papers of no importance except to him personally; contained no plans nor key to any military secret; he had been far too wise to intrust any to the accidents of this alien house. The prying intruder, whoever it was, had gained nothing! But there was unmistakably the attempt! And the existence of a would-be spy within the purlieus of the house was equally clear.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the tumult}} of horror and amazement that filled my mind, I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> a faint triumph {{stirring}} in me through it all, when I saw how alarmed and how anxious {{he was about}} me. Nothing more passed between us on the way back. Confronted by the dreadful discovery that I had now made, I was silent and helpless. Of the guilty persons concerned in the concealment of the birth, and in the desertion of the infant, my nobly-born, highly-bred, irreproachable aunt now stood revealed before me as one! An older woman than I might have been hard put to it to preserve her presence of mind, in such a position as mine. Instinct, not reason, served me in my sore need. Instinct, not reason, kept me passively and stupidly silent when I {{got back to the}} house. [...] "We will talk about it to-morrow," [...] was all I could say to Michael, when he gently lifted me from my horse.|$|E
60|$|A quixotic man! Maurice said airily. How {{little he}} understood! How well she--Crystal--knew {{what had been}} the motive of that quixotic action. She had learned so much to-night in the mazes of a waltz.

Of what her heart had felt then, she need now no longer be ashamed: all that should shame her now were her thoughts in the past, the belief that the hand which had held hers on that evening--long ago--in Brestalou could possibly have been the hand of a traitor: that the low-toned voice that spoke to her so earnestly of friendship then could ever be raised for the utterance of a lie.|$|E
