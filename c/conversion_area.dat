Supported by the Landsat TM digital images in 1986, 1996 and 2000 in the west Jilin Province, land use changes analysis are studied in this paper. We classified land use as cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water areas, construction land and unused land. According to the land use data, there was a disproportionate distribution of six land use types in the study region. Cultivated land, grassland, unused land were the primary land use types, they accounted for 85. 64 % of total area in 1986. On the basis of land use map, we can compute the land use <b>conversion</b> <b>area</b> in the study region, and then get the land use conversion matrix.

30|$|Polarization {{anomalies}} of Love waves, {{sometimes called}} quasi-Love waves, {{are likely to}} be caused by lateral variations of azimuthal anisotropy in the upper mantle. Polarization anomalies of Love waves from the 9 October 1995 earthquake near the coast of Jalisco, Mexico, have been recorded by the Pacific 21, IRIS, and Japan Meteorological Agency networks of broadband seismometers in and around Japan. The Love-to-Rayleigh <b>conversion</b> <b>areas</b> for the clearly detected quasi-Love waves are located by using the group velocities of the observed surface waves. In the cases of the stations {{in the northern part of}} Japan and Philippine, the locations of the Love-to-Rayleigh conversions mostly concentrate near the trenches, and suggest that the properties of the azimuthal anisotropies in the upper mantle have lateral variations across the trenches. We infer that the lateral variations of the azimuthal anisotropies may reflect the changes of the mantle flow due to the subducting slabs. The Love-to-Rayleigh <b>conversion</b> <b>areas</b> for the other stations mainly concentrate near the Emperor seamounts and the Mid-Pacific mountains. Several results of surface wave tomographic studies show that the azimuthal anisotropies in these regions are much weaker than those in the central part of the Pacific along the paths. The lateral variation in azimuthal anisotropy may cause the Love-to-Rayleigh conversions.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{optimization}} {{of an integrated}} line balancing process with workstation inventory management. While doing so, we have studied the interconnection between line balancing and its conversion process. Almost each and every moderate to large manufacturing industry depends on a long and integrated supply chain, consisting of inbound logistic, conversion process and outbound logistic. In this sense an approach addresses a very general problem of integrated line balancing. Research works {{reported in the literature}} so far mainly deals with minimization of cost for inbound and outbound logistic subsystems. In most of the cases conversion process has been ignored. We suggest a generic approach for linking the balancing of the line of production in the <b>conversion</b> <b>area</b> with the customersâ rate of demand in the market and for configuring the related stock chambers. Thus, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} translate the underlying problem in the form of mixed nonlinear programming problem and design the optimum supply chain so that the total inventory cost and the cost of balancing loss of the conversion process is jointly minimized and ideal cycle time of the production process is determined along with ideal sizes of the stock chambers.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to set-up a geographical information systems-based multi-criteria approach to assess a range of possibilities for energy-crops conversion. The presented method was implemented at the regional level in the Yorkshire and the Humber Region in Northern UK. The first phase of the study aims to set up a land capability model for the specific purpose of assessing the potential of perennial energy crops, on the basis of pedo-climatic and topographic factors. The model output illustrates a range of potentials for energy-crop conversion that can be explored in the given landscape. In the second phase a sensitivity analysis of the land capability model was performed through a simulation approach in order to interpret the influence of assumptions and uncertainty in input data and model parameters. The last phase of the study allows allocating the <b>conversion</b> <b>area</b> for energy crops introduction according to specific penetration scenario, environmental constraints and land capability values.

40|$|Improved {{knowledge}} of landscape seasonal variations and phenology {{at the regional}} scale is needed for carbon and water flux studies, and biogeochemical, hydrological, and climate models. Amazon vegetation mechanisms and dynamics controlling biosphere-atmosphere interactions are not entirely understood. To better understand these processes, vegetation photosynthetic activity and canopy water and temperature dynamics were analyzed over various types of vegetation in Amazon using satellite data from the Terra-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The objectives of this dissertation were to 1) assess the spatial and temporal variations of satellite data over the Amazon {{as a function of}} vegetation physiognomies for monitoring and discrimination, 2) investigate seasonal vegetation photosynthetic activity and phenology across the forest-cerrado ecotone and <b>conversion</b> <b>areas,</b> and 3) investigate seasonal variations of satellite-based canopy water and land surface temperature in relation to photosynthetic activity over the Amazon basin. The results of this study showed the highly diverse and complex cerrado biome and associated cerrado conversions could be monitored and analyzed with MODIS vegetation index (VI) time series data. The MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) seasonal profiles were found useful in characterizing the spatial and temporal variability in landscape phenology across a climatic gradient of rainfall and sunlight conditions through the rainforest-cerrado ecotone. Significant trends in landscape phenology were observed across the different biomes with strong seasonal shifts resulting from differences in vegetation physiognomic responses to rainfall and sunlight. We also found unique seasonal and temporal patterns of the land surface water index (LSWI) and land surface temperature (LST), which in combination with the EVI provided improved information for monitoring the seasonal ecosystem dynamics of the Amazon rainforest, cerrado, ecotone, and <b>conversion</b> <b>areas.</b> In conclusion, satellite-based, regional scale studies were found to aid in understanding land surface processes and mechanisms at the ecosystem level, providing a "big picture" of landscape dynamics. Coupling this with ground, in-situ measurements, such as from flux towers, can greatly improve the estimation of carbon and water fluxes, and our understanding of the biogeochemistry and climate in very dynamic and changing landscapes...|$|R

The hydrologic response of a small urban catchment is investigated under different land use conversion scenarios including the installation of green roofs and permeable pavements. The modeling is undertaken using the EPA SWMM; the "do nothing" scenario is calibrated and validated based on field measurements while the LID control modules are calibrated and validated based on laboratory test measurements. The simulations are carried out by using as input the synthetic hyetographs derived for three different return periods (T= 2, 5 and 10. years). Modeling results confirm the effectiveness of LID solutions even for the design storm event (T= 10. years) : in particular a minimum land use <b>conversion</b> <b>area,</b> corresponding to the Effective Impervious Area reduction of 5 %, is required to obtain noticeable hydrologic benefits.

We used TM/Landsat optical images, processed by linear spectral mixing modeling, generating fraction images (soil, vegetation and shade) and applied as change detection technique, subtraction of fraction images. The difference-images were classified by Bhattacharyya algorithm, mapping existing conversions, according to field survey. The clustering of conversions according to the characteristics of gain and loss of biomass provided better classification performance, observed by the significant increase of Kappa. Conversions were analyzed in relation of colonization projects and distance to roads (BR- 210 and vicinal roads). The results showed a predominance of opening conversions in newer colonization project areas (Entre Rios and SÃ£o LuizÃ£o). SÃ£o JoÃ£o da Baliza and Caroebe presented similar behavior {{in relation to the}} existing conversions, being the majority of them indicative of land use changes, which may explain the tendency of these regions to the livestock activity, as observed in the field survey.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to define a two-stage reactive fractionation process for converting corn stover into a solid cellulose stream and two liquid streams containing mostly hemicellulosic sugars and lignin, respectively. Toward this goal, biomass fractionation was conducted using a small continuous pilot unit with a nominal capacity of 100 pounds per day of dry biomass to generate performance data using primarily corn stover as feedstock. In the course of the program, the PureVision process was optimized for efficient hemicellulose hydrolysis in the first stage employing autohydrolysis and delignification in the second stage using sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. The remaining cellulose was deemed to be an excellent substrate for producing fermentation sugars, requiring 40 % less enzymes for hydrolysis than conventional pretreatment systems using dilute acid. The fractionated cellulose was also determined to have potential higher-value applications as a pulp product. The lignin coproduct was determined to be substantially lower in molecular weight (MW) compared to lignins produced in the kraft or sulfite pulping processes. This low-MW lignin {{can be used as a}} feed and concrete binder and as an intermediate for producing a range of high-value products including phenolic resins. This research adds to the understanding of the biomass <b>conversion</b> <b>area</b> in that a new process was developed in the true spirit of biorefineries. The work completed successfully demonstrated the technical effectiveness of the process at the pilot level indicating the technology is ready to advance to a 2 â 3 ton per day scale. No technical showstoppers are anticipated in scaling up the PureVision fractionation process to commercial scale. Also, economic feasibility of using the PureVision process in a commercial-scale biorefinery was investigated and the minimum ethanol selling price for the PureVision process was calculated to be $ 0. 94 /gal ethanol vs. $ 1. 07 /gal ethanol for the NREL process. Thus, the PureVision process is economically attractive. Given its technical and economic feasibility, the project is of benefit to the public in the following ways: 1) it demonstrated a novel biomass fractionation process that can provide domestic supply of renewable transportation fuel from all three biomass components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), 2) the lignin stream from the process has many higher-value applications beyond simply burning the lignin for energy as proposed by competing technologies, 3) it can be deployed in rural areas and create jobs in these areas, and 3) it can add to the nationâs economy and security...|$|E

Of this 59. 5 tonnes, DOE anticipates that ~ 7. 5 tonnes will be dispositioned as spent fuel at the Geologic Repository and ~ 2 tonnes will be declared below the safeguards termination limit and be discarded as TRU waste at WIPP. The remaining 50 tonnes of excess plutonium exists in many forms and locations around the country, and is under the control of several DOE Offices. The Materials Disposition Program (MD) will be receiving materials packaged by these other Programs to disposition in a manor that meets the ï¿½spent fuel standard. ï¿½ For disposition by immobilization, the planned facilities will have only limited capabilities to remove impurities prior to blending the plutonium feedstocks to prepare feed for the plutonium immobilization ceramic formation process, Technical specifications are described here that allow potential feedstocks to be categorized as either acceptable for transfer into the MD Immobilization Process, or unacceptable without additional processing prior to transfer to MD. Understanding the requirements should allow cost benefit analyses to be performed to determine if a specific material should be processed sufficiently shipment to WIPP. Preliminary analyses suggest that about 45 tonnes of this material have impurity concentrations much lower than the immobilization acceptance specifications. In addition, approximately another 3 tonnes can easily be blended with the higher purity feeds to meet the immobilization specifications. Another 1 tonne or so can be processed in the immobilization plutonium <b>conversion</b> <b>area</b> to yield materials that can be blended to provide acceptable feed for immobilization. The remaining 3 tonnes must be excluded in their present form. However, approximately 2 tonnes of this remaining material could be processed in existing DOE facilities to make them acceptable to the immobilization process. This leaves about a tonne that probably should be declared waste and shipped to WIPP.

Free standing poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) / single walled nanotube films have been characterised by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and thermo-gravimetric analysis to understand the physical properties of the films. Films with varying compositions of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) / poly(styrene sulfonate) and single walled nanotubes were compared by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge / discharge to understand their electrochemical properties. A comparison of the results shows that having single walled nanotubes dispersed throughout the polymer matrix increases the capacitance by 65 % and the energy density {{by a factor of}} 3 whilst achieving good capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Graphene is sp 2 hybridised carbon atoms in a honeycomb crystal lattice, which has attracted {{a lot of interest in}} materials science and condensed matter physics research due to its favourable electronic properties, abundance and low cost. Exfoliated graphene oxide which has also been partially reduced has been achieved using microwave irradiation through the use of a conventional microwave that has led to rapid expansion and a marked volume increase of the graphene oxide. This has enabled a porous material to be developed that can serve as a conductive scaffold and support for composite electrode materials. Graphene based materials coupled with transition metal oxides {{are promising}} electrode materials in asymmetric supercapacitors owing to their unique properties which include high surface area, good chemical stability, electrical conductivity, abundance, and lower cost profile over time. A composite material consisting of graphene oxide exfoliated with microwave radiation (mw rGO), and manganosite (MnO) is synthesised in order to explore their potential as an electrode material. The composite material was characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to explore the process occurring at the electrode / electrolyte interface. Long term cyclability and stability was investigated using galvanostatic charge / discharge testing. From the resulting analysis, an asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed with the best composite containing 90 % MnO- 10 % mw rGO (w/w). The device exhibited a capacitance of 0. 11 F/cm 2 (51. 5 F/g by mass) and excellent capacity retention of 82 % after 15 000 cycles at a current density of 0. 5 A/g. Composites containing CNTs and graphene are materials of particular interest in the energy storage and <b>conversion</b> <b>area</b> due to their favourable properties which can result in unique optical, electrical, magnetic and chemical properties which are substantially different than that of the individual components. It has been shown that the combination of both CNTs and graphene allows an expressway of electron transport from the electrode material to the current collector. The ability of the CNTs to âsandwichâ in between the graphene sheets helps to alleviate restacking by acting as a spacer (thus maintaining surface area) while increasing electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. We describe a facile method to develop electrodes of SWNT and exfoliated graphene oxide (mw rGO) with varying weight ratios via sonication, centrifugation and vacuum filtration. These composites are then optimised with the best performing weight ratio to be used in the fabrication of a supercapacitor. Extensive electrochemical testing revealed that the incorporation of SWNTs with mw rGO yielded an electrode material with large specific capacitances. The specific capacitances in all cases exceeded 125 F/g with the optimised / ideal weight ratio of 90 % SWNT â 10 % mw rGO exceeding 300 F/g. The thickness of the 90 % SWNT â 10 % mw rGO was optimised with the maximum attainable current per unit area arising at a thickness of 17 microns.

This can be verified byobserving in the data bank studied, the recurrence of landslides in the same area in previousyears...|$|R

40|$|Land Information New Zealand has {{contracted}} EDS {{to convert}} historic survey {{data for the}} construction a Survey-accurate Digital Cadastre. The areas selected contain 1. 35 million parcels, or approximately 70 % of the live parcels that constitute the New Zealand survey system. This work has been undertaken in three parts: {{the definition of a}} new datum to which the converted survey will be adjusted; the creation of a sufficient density of control in the <b>conversion</b> <b>areas</b> to gain a high degree of co-ordinate accuracy; and the capture and adjustment of boundary and traverse data from current survey plans tied to the new control. The intent of the exercise is to create a network of a measured co-ordinate accuracy standard that can be used by external surveyors and for electronic plan lodgement. EDS has developed specialist techniques and tools for the accurate capture and adjustment of the network. Capture of parcel boundaries and traverse is performed for all plans supporting current parcels, with least-squares adjustment performed in terms of the new datum. In order to achieve the required timeframes, the system developed is an automated multi-ste...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} the {{spatial and temporal}} variations in vegetation biologic activity across an eco-climatic transect traversing Amazon forest, transition, cerrado, and associated land <b>conversion</b> <b>areas</b> with MODIS time series data. We utilized 4 years of vegetation index and land surface water index data to depict carbon and water variations over our study areas. The coupled water and carbon indices were investigated with hyperspectral Hyperion data and scaled up to MODIS data for spatial and seasonal extension. Land surface moisture and carbon patterns behaved in an opposite manner between natural and converted areas and exhibited significant seasonal variations. Whereas the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) {{was positively correlated with}} the land surface water index (LSWI) in converted pastures and cerrado ecosystems, there was an inverse relationship between these two indices over primary forest areas. Our results show that these MODIS datasets can track vegetation activity in the Amazon region, including biologic responses to shifts in vegetation type and disturbance. Remotely-sensed land surface water indices combined with the carbon products yield important information useful in the prediction of vegetation health response to climate change and human land cover modifications...|$|R
40|$|In Brazil, {{agriculture}} {{expansion is}} taking place primarily in the Cerrado ecosystems. With the aim of supporting policy development and protecting the natural environment at relevant hotspots, a scenario study was conducted that concerned not only land-use change, but also the resulting effects on erosion and deposition. This coupled approach helped to evaluate potential landscape impacts of the land-use scenarios. In the study area, the Balsas sub-basin in MaranhÃ£o State, a model chain was used to model plausible future soybean expansion locations (CLUE-S model) and resulting sediment mobilization patterns (LAPSUS model) for a business-as-usual scenario. In the scenario, more erosion occurred in <b>areas</b> where the <b>conversion</b> of natural vegetation into soybean cultivation {{is likely to take}} place, but the generated sediments tended to accumulate mainly within the <b>conversion</b> <b>areas,</b> thus limiting the offsite effects of the increased erosion. These results indicated that when agricultural expansion is kept away from rivers, Cerrado conversion will have only a limited impact on the sediment loads of local rivers. Where land-use changes are most concentrated are coincident with areas where more new sediments are generated (higher erosion) and where more sediments are re-deposited...|$|R
