50|$|Washington State University, {{situated}} in an agricultural area of Washington state, chose this {{book to be}} part of its freshman reading program in 2009 but soon canceled the program. Many in the university's community, including those who run the kinds of industrial farms The Omnivore's Dilemma discusses, were unhappy with the selection, and speculation was that the cancellation was a result of political pressure. Elson Floyd, president of WSU, claimed instead that it was a budgetary issue, and when food safety expert Bill Marler stepped up to cover the <b>claimed</b> <b>shortfall,</b> the program was reinstated, and Pollan was invited to speak on campus.|$|R
50|$|Rigby v Ferodo Ltd 1988 ICR 29 is a UK {{labour law}} case {{concerning}} the contract of employment. It held {{that if an}} employer reduces wages without a worker's consent, the worker may continue to work and <b>claim</b> the <b>shortfall.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ferodo Ltd cut wages by 5% to stay afloat. The {{trade union}} {{agreed not to}} strike. Mr Rigby, {{who worked as a}} lathe {{operator}} on £129 a week with a contract terminable on 12 weeks’ notice, made it known he did not accept the wage reduction. For him this was approximately £30 a week. He continued to work and after over a year, he <b>claimed</b> for <b>shortfall.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{administration}} {{planned to}} eliminate gas subsidies, {{except for the}} poorest, and to sell off part of EMETEL, the national telephone company, as well as parts of state-owned energy industries. Noboa, faced with a budget <b>shortfall,</b> <b>claimed</b> that Ecuador’s government could have raised {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars by going after tax evaders and late-payers of taxes.|$|R
50|$|The House of Lords {{held that}} there had been a repudiatory breach of {{contract}} by the employer and so Mr Rigby was entitled to <b>claim</b> his <b>shortfall</b> in wages. If the employee continued to work, this did not necessarily imply he accepted the change, nor was it the case that the contract was automatically brought to an end. Moreover, because Ferodo Ltd had not in fact terminated the contract the damages that Mr Rigby received could be beyond the 12-week notice period in which the contract could legitimately have been terminated, and a notice of unilateral variation could not be implicitly construed as giving notice of termination.|$|R
5000|$|High-tech {{companies}} often cite a tech-worker shortage {{when asking}} Congress {{to raise the}} annual cap on H-1B visas, and have succeeded in getting various exemptions passed. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), described the situation as a crisis, and the situation was reported on by the Wall Street Journal, BusinessWeek and Washington Post. Employers applied pressure on Congress. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates testified in 2007 {{on behalf of the}} expanded visa program on Capitol Hill, [...] "warning of dangers to the U.S. economy if employers can't import skilled workers to fill job gaps". Congress considered a bill to address the <b>claims</b> of <b>shortfall</b> but in the end did not revise the program.|$|R
5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party <b>claimed</b> that the <b>shortfall</b> was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|R
500|$|The {{celebrations}} {{following the}} match recalled Trickett's return from his London victory in November 1876. The commercial {{exploitation of the}} event had been considerable, and thousands of pounds changed hands in , but Trickett and Rush were [...] afterwards, Trickett claiming to be considerably so. The stakes were only £200, and expenses such as training, accommodation, advertising, new boats and incidentals made professional sculling an expensive business, as Rush argued beforehand. Trickett <b>claimed</b> a considerable <b>shortfall</b> in gate money from spectator ships, and a public benefit concert was held for him by actor [...] Others spoke up for Rush as a major financial loser from his endeavour.|$|R
500|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Beshear ordered $78 million in budget cuts, citing a $434 million {{projected}} {{deficit in the}} state budget. Republican Senate President David Williams questioned {{the legality of the}} cuts, <b>claiming</b> that the <b>shortfall</b> was only $117.5 million and that $145 million in surplus funds from the previous fiscal year would cover the difference. Beshear countered that the legislature had already authorized $138 million in expenditures from the surplus fund and that his reckoning of the deficit also included $300 million in [...] "additional spending needs". Williams stopped short of filing a legal challenge to the cuts, but warned Beshear that the General Assembly would closely monitor the cuts and override any they disagreed with by passing modifications to the 2006–2008 budget after the commencement of the legislative session in February.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-financing}} trading strategy that minimizes the expected shortfall locally when hedging a European contingent <b>claim.</b> A positive <b>shortfall</b> occurs if the hedger {{is not willing}} to follow a perfect hedging or a superhedging strategy. In contrast to the classical variance criterion, the expected shortfall criterion depends only on undesirable outcomes where the terminal value of the written option exceeds the terminal value of the hedge portfolio. Searching a strategy which minimizes the expected shortfall is equivalent to the iterative solution of linear programs whose number increases exponentially with respect to the number of trading dates. Therefore, we partition this complex overall problem into several one-period problems and minimize the expected shortfall only locally, i. e., only over the next trading period. This approximation is quite accurate and the number of linear programs to be solved increases only linearly with respect to the number of trading dates...|$|R
40|$|Australia {{provides}} life-changing {{educational experiences}} for {{large numbers of}} young, predominantly male Indian students. This paper explores how a cohort of fifteen Indian women value and plan to exploit their Australian study experience and university qualifications after graduation. This paper is therefore focused on issues of women’s {{access to higher education}} and professional careers in a country where such access has been traditionally limited. The socio-cultural context defining professional women in India is discussed in light of two competing trends. Firstly, India’s strong patriarchal tradition which discourages women from pursuing a career and, secondly, the emerging reality of a surging globalised economy in India with a growing professional recruitment <b>shortfall.</b> <b>Claims</b> that Indian women benefit from enhanced professional opportunities due to strong economic growth driving demand for local talent are considered. Data from individual interviews indicates that Indian women with Australian university qualifications in business professions experience conflicting pressures between traditional family and household roles and expectations, global career opportunities and culturally different notions of gender roles...|$|R
40|$|After {{critically}} reviewing {{evidence in}} historical debates of a persistent claim of a declining {{interest in the}} sciences, the thesis draws on contemporary HESA data to calculate firstyear STEM intake figures to Higher Education from 2002 - 03 to 2014 - 15 to estimate both a level of STEM recruitment {{and the number of}} STEM graduates produced after completing a graduate and post graduate programme over the same period. The supply of graduates is then considered against a level of demand estimated through two proxy indicators, the vacancy rate and salary levels for science and technology graduates. An analysis of the recruitment patterns for science and engineering to identify factors a↵ecting recruitment was also conducted. The research study was supplemented with a ‘before and after’ survey of the London Youth International Science Forum initiative, to assess its impact on recruitment to STEM subjects. Despite the perception of a shortfall in STEM numbers, the findings show graduate recruitment numbers rising over the period under examination, although a regional variation in supply, and shortfalls in some STEM disciplines, may account for <b>claims</b> of a <b>shortfall</b> in graduate numbers. The contribution to knowledge of this research lies in the in-depth analysis of the student recruitment patterns to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the UK over the period from 2003 to 2015. While the analysis identified several relevant factors: contextual, political and financial acting as constraints to STEM recruitment, nevertheless, the research found no quantitative evidence of a crisis in recruitment...|$|R
40|$|The {{landmark}} Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Citizens United {{has opened the}} floodgates to allow unlimited corporate campaign donations, and Supreme Court doctrine is shifting back to the Lochner-era 2 ̆ 7 s focus on economic rights. At the same time, there are efforts underway across the United States to privatize public services in order to alleviate what proponents <b>claim</b> is a <b>shortfall</b> in revenue due to the recession. Within those privatization efforts, public policing has become a new front, with outsourcing and wholesale privatization of the police underway. This article adds to the existing scholarship a political analysis of privatization efforts, including how lobbying and campaign financing are making wholesale privatization {{in the area of}} policing a very real possibility. This article looks at the example of Camden, New Jersey, where the city 2 ̆ 7 s entire police force was fired and replaced with a county-wide force in order to shed pension and wage obligations, as an incubator for future wholesale privatization of the police. Considering the trend of corporate lobbying through groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council that write model legislation and deliver it to lawmakers, as well as unlimited campaign donations, this article traces the current trend toward police privatization. It argues that without more transparency and some limitations on such expenditures, the public cannot fully and fairly participate in decisions about whether to relinquish force-protection to private corporations. Understanding the potential consequences for both public safety and democratic principles requires systemic, legislative and electoral transparency that currently remains deficient...|$|R
2500|$|To {{bring the}} UK back into {{compliance}} with basic standards in international law, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was introduced. The minimum wage takes effect in every worker's contract. Workers {{do not need}} to show [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] or any other requirement except that they personally perform work for a wage and is not a client. One curious exclusion, however, is a pupil barrister who in Edmonds v Lawson was held to not be [...] "working" [...] but be [...] "conscientious in receiving instruction". The minimum wage rate is reset annually after guidance from the Low Pay Commission, and on 1 October 2014 it stood at £6.50 for over-21-year-olds, £5.13 for 18- to 20-year-olds, £3.79 for under-18-year-olds finished with compulsory education. Since 2010, the minimum was cut for [...] "apprentices", and stood in 2014 at £2.73. The National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 spell out the details of how the minimum wage should be calculated. Total pay received is divided by the hours actually worked over an average [...] "pay reference period" [...] of one month. This definition has given rise to litigation in cases where a worker can stay at home but must answer phone calls, is allowed to rest or sleep during shifts, or must make themselves available [...] "on call" [...] over a long period. Generally speaking, it is irrelevant whether one is at home or not. If a worker is given sleeping facilities and is not awake, the minimum wage need not be paid. And if a worker is [...] "on call", then this time still counts at work if the worker is bound to stay within the vicinity of the workplace. However, an exception in regulation 28 allows an employer to agree with a worker what the hours worked actually are, if they would ordinarily be unmeasured. In Walton v Independent Living Organisation Ltd a worker who cared for a young epileptic lady had to be on call 24 hours a day, 3 days a week, but could do her own activities outside tasks such as going shopping, making meals and cleaning. Her company made an agreement with her that her tasks took 6 hours and 50 minutes a day, which resulted in her £31.40 allowance meeting the minimum wage. Certain deductions may be made including £4.51 per day for any accommodation the employer provides, though extra bills, such as for electricity, should not ordinarily be charged. The minimum wage can be enforced individually through an ERA 1996 section 13 <b>claim</b> for a <b>shortfall</b> of wages in a Tribunal. A worker may not be subjected to any detriment for enquiring, or requesting records or complaining about it. However, because many workers will not be informed about how to do this, or have the resources, a primary enforcement mechanism is through inspections and compliance notices issued by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. A remedy of up to 80 times the minimum wage is available to the worker and HMRC can enforce a penalty of twice the minimum wage per worker per day.|$|R
