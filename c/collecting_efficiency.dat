The local mass flux was calculated for varying median particle size and width of the particle size distribution. One interesting result is the influence of the classification along the duct, due to the size dependence of the particle migration velocity, on the local mass flux.

The extraction of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. composed primarily of carbon dioxide, {{is one of the}} most important goals of the Mars ISRU project. The main obstacle is the relatively large amount of dust present in the Martian atmosphere. This dust must be efficiently removed from atmospheric gas intakes for ISRU processing chambers. A common technique to achieve this removal on earth is by electrostatic precipitation, where large electrostatic fields are established in a localized region to precipitate and collect previously charged dust particles. This technique is difficult to adapt to the Martian environment, with an atmospheric pressure of about one-hundredth of the terrestrial atmosphere. At these low pressures. the corona discharges required to implant an electrostatic charge to the particles to be collected is extremely difficult to sustain and the corona easily becomes biopolar. which is unsuitable for particle charging.
