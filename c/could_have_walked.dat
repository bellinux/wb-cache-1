5|$|Foster and Eddy {{finally arrived}} at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they found}} their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E
500|$|Jacques {{began an}} affair in 1962 with her driver, John Schofield, {{who gave her}} the {{attention}} and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room and tried to repair the marriage. He later commented about this period: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". The affair caused a downturn in his health; he collapsed on holiday in Tangier in 1963 and was hospitalised in Gibraltar. He returned to London to find the situation between his wife and her lover was unchanged, which caused a relapse.|$|E
500|$|He was {{subsequently}} {{cast as the}} title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean. To immerse himself in the role, Franco {{went from being a}} non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his dark brown hair blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos. To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies. While filming James Dean, the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. [...] "It was a very lonely existence," [...] he notes. [...] "If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean." [...] Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "Franco <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man." [...] He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).|$|E

60|$|I {{felt that}} I had been absurd to believe {{for a moment}} that Mariposilla <b>could</b> <b>have</b> wished to reënter the place, and I was also {{convinced}} that, in her feeble condition, she <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the distance from the ranch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] he ejaculated as {{he pulled}} himself together, [...] "the troopers were well-mounted ... the officer was enthusiastic; those {{carriers}} <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> very far. And, in any case, I am free from blame. Citoyen Marat himself was here and let them pass!" ...|$|R
500|$|Jacques's {{private life}} became {{complicated}} in 1963. The previous year {{she had met}} John Schofield, a cockney used-car dealer, who chauffeured her to a Leukaemia Research Fund event. The couple became romantically involved after the driver gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room. He later commented about this period: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". During these upheavals in her personal life, Jacques was surprised {{to be the subject}} of This Is Your Life in February 1963, when she was approached by Eamonn Andrews during rehearsal for the sixth series of Sykes and a.... Although Le Mesurier did not mention the marital situation when being questioned by Andrews, he made the comment that for Jacques [...] "the home comes first", which Merriman considered had been said [...] "rather pointedly". Despite the matrimonial upsets, Jacques and Le Mesurier both appeared in the 1963 Tony Hancock film, The Punch and Judy Man. In 1964 Le Mesurier moved out of the marital home, made a decision to protect Jacques from any negative publicity, and allowed her to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity. [...] This ensured that the press blamed him for the break-up, casting Jacques as the victim in the matter.|$|E
2500|$|With the March 1907 peasant uprising, N. D. Cocea's {{profile in}} {{political}} journalism was boosted. He is the probable {{source of a}} much circulated canard, taken up by Adevărul, according to which Romanian authorities had killed 11,000 or more peasant insurgents. Cocea himself eventually settled for a death toll of 12,000, claiming that, [...] "had the peasants' bodies been lined {{up and down on}} Calea Victoriei", Romanian King Carol I of Hohenzollern <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> over to Dealul Mitropoliei [...] "on a soft rug of peasant flesh".|$|E
2500|$|The action having raised {{three of}} Adams's {{prerequisites}} to liability, the Barons of the Exchequer engaged defendant's counsel in a protracted discussion of whether Priestley {{was required to}} ride in the wagon or <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> alongside it, then intended that the declaration was sufficient on this point. Serjeant Adams concluded his advocacy by proclaiming that [...] "there is nothing in the declaration which shews that this was anything more than a mere accident; and for a mere accident which happens in a master's service, the master is not responsible." [...] As with the arguments presented by his opposing counsel, Adams never raised the prospect of vitiating his client's liability due to the intervening act of a fellow servant.|$|E
60|$|He {{questioned}} {{several of}} the soldiers, who had now gathered round, attracted like the officers by the cry. None of them had seen the act or had noticed anyone running away; but in so large a camp {{there were so many}} people about that an assassin <b>could</b> well <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> quietly away without attracting any attention.|$|R
60|$|Armine {{scrambled}} {{round the}} rock over {{which he had}} fallen, a loose stone having turned with him. He had pulled himself up, but even with an arm round Armine's neck, he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> a step on even ground, far less on these rough debris, which were painful walking even for the lightest, most springy tread.|$|R
60|$|Nielsen {{started with}} a laugh. The man courted peril. The bright face of danger must have been {{beautiful}} and alluring to him. I started after him--caught up with him--and stayed beside him. I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> behind him over that strip of treacherous sink-hole. If I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done so the whole adventure would have been meaningless to me. Nevertheless I was frightened. I felt the prickle of my skin, the stiffening of my hair, {{as well as the}} cold tingling thrills along my veins.|$|R
2500|$|From {{the post}} {{at the edge of}} the gorge a narrow track led down to a broad ledge with a deep drop below where the rearguard {{stumbled}} on another group who had been left behind. [...] "At about 22:00 whispering could be heard coming from the ledge, so a stone was bowled over. They were Australians who got a shock when they found that their squadron had retired nearly an hour before and quickly left." [...] From 21:00 the left flank was completely unprotected after the regiment posted there pulled out. Had the enemy known, they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> quietly round and down the road to the horses. After several more quiet hours, at 02:00 orders came to fall back on the horses and with scarcely a halt rode steadily back to the Jordan Valley.|$|E
60|$|Carroll fancied they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> the {{distance}} {{in a few}} hours on a graded road; but the roughness of the ground was not the chief difficulty.|$|E
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> {{twice the}} {{distance}} in that time; but the delay was unavoidable, since {{only on the}} horse's back could his father be brought into camp.|$|E
60|$|Doubtless {{it was a}} {{great relief}} to walk disencumbered; and perhaps without that relief, and the {{consequent}} sense of liberty and lightness, I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> at all. I was but new risen from a bed of sickness; and {{there was nothing in the}} state of our affairs to hearten me for much exertion; travelling, as we did, over the most dismal deserts in Scotland, under a cloudy heaven, and with divided hearts among the travellers.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It is, you see, Saleh, just as I had hoped. I {{felt sure}} that it <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> gone in far; as, in that case, you <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> twenty miles, from the battlefield, {{to the point where}} you met me. Now, if I had a proper instrument, I might be able to extract the bullet. I might hurt you in doing so, but if I could get it out, you would recover speedily; while if it remains where it is, the wound may inflame, and you will die.' ...|$|R
60|$|She leaned {{somewhat}} {{heavily on}} her father's arm, {{for she was}} afraid that she <b>could</b> not otherwise <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> quite straight. She fully realized what it meant when men talked of drunkenness amongst themselves. Copious libations must produce--she thought--just this same sensation of swaying and tottering, and hideous, painful giddiness.|$|R
60|$|But {{it would}} seem that the wall still stood, for the cattle {{remained}} packed in so dense a mass that a man <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> upon their backs, as, indeed, some tried to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{than likely}} {{every one of}} us would have been sick," [...] {{answered}} the young captain with a shudder. [...] "Then the Indians and the desperadoes <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> in here without a struggle." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{was carried}} to the car. I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked,</b> but I had an idea that I had better not. I had made my hit as a {{crippled}} dog, and a crippled dog I intended to remain till things got more settled down.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus <b>could</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|R
5000|$|Mansel's son, taken {{prisoner}} by the retreating French {{as he tried}} to save his father's life was later exchanged and declared that during the battle [...] "there was not, on the 26th, a single French soldier left in the town" [...] as Chapuis had drawn out the whole garrison of Cambrai to support the attack on Inchy. Had this been known at the time a detachment <b>could</b> easily <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> into Cambrai as the French retreated by a very circuitous route ...|$|R
60|$|Who {{could he}} be, this {{formidable}} giant {{coming out of}} the unknown? The percursor possibly of a horde of savage spearmen. And where <b>could</b> he <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> from? The nearest well was a long hundred miles down the track. At any rate the frontier post of Kurkur could not afford to receive casual visitors. Hilary Joyce whisked round his horse, galloped into camp, and gave the alarm. Then, with twenty horsemen at his back, he rode out again to reconnoitre.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{went into}} camp,' said an elderly Major {{recalled}} from the whist-tables at Mussoorie to a sickly Native Regiment, 'they went into camp with {{two hundred and}} ten sick in carts. Two hundred and ten fever cases only, and the balance looking like so many ghosts with sore eyes. A Madras Regiment <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> through 'em.' ...|$|E
60|$|Creeping silently {{toward the}} sentries, a white-burnoosed figure {{approached}} the shadows {{at one end}} of the hut. The meager intellect of the creature denied it the advantage it might have taken of its disguise. Where it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> boldly to the very sides of the sentries, it chose rather to sneak upon them, unseen, from the rear.|$|E

60|$|Paula made {{no secret}} of them, and Miss De Stancy could see that more than half were written on blue paper, with {{diagrams}} amid the writing: they were, in fact, simply those sheets of his letters which related to the rebuilding. Nevertheless, Charlotte fancied she had caught Paula in a sentimental mood; and doubtless <b>could</b> Somerset <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> in at this moment instead of Charlotte it might have fared well with him, so insidiously do tender memories reassert themselves in the face of outward mishaps.|$|R
5000|$|Beorn was {{of immense}} size and {{strength}} for a man, and retained his {{size and strength}} in bear-form. He had black hair (in either form) and a thick black beard and broad shoulders (in human form). While not a [...] "giant" [...] outright, Beorn's human form was of such great size that the {{three and a half}} foot tall Bilbo judged that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> easily <b>walked</b> between Beorn's legs without touching his body. Beorn also named the Carrock and created the steps that led from its base to its flat top.|$|R
40|$|In {{the dynamic}} two-sided market environment, {{overpricing}} {{one side of}} the market not only discourages demand on that side but also discourages participation on the other side. Over time, this process can lead to a death spiral. This paper develops a dynamic structural model of the video game market to study launch failures in two-sided markets. The paper models consumers’ purchase decisions for hardware platforms and affiliated software products and software firms’ entry and pricing decisions. This paper also develops a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate dynamic structural models. The results of the counterfactual simulations show that a failed platform <b>could</b> <b>have</b> survived if it had lowered its hardware prices and that it <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> out of the death spiral if it had subsidized software entry. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{love was}} beautiful," [...] {{continued}} the Human Document, eager, apparently, to relate her {{experience for the}} common good; [...] "just {{because it was a}} free gift. We were not fettered to one another. At any moment either of us <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> out of the house. The idea never occurred to us; not for years--five, to be exact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote A: On the {{authority}} of the poet's nephew, and others, the [...] "city" [...] here referred to has invariably been supposed to be Goslar, where he spent the winter of 1799. Goslar, however, is as unlike a [...] "vast city" [...] as it is possible to conceive. Wordsworth <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> from end to end of it in ten minutes.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a long}} field, and if he {{had earned}} a dollar for every time he had traversed its length, during the last ten years, {{he would have been a}} rich man. He <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> it blindfolded. It was fallow ground, already plowed, disked, rolled, and now the last stage was to harrow it, {{loosening}} the soil, conserving the moisture.|$|E
5000|$|It {{seemed as}} if the [...] "suits" [...] had finally won, and with Biffos screenwriting career taking off at the time, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> chosen to <b>walk</b> away from it all. However, he chose to stay on, writing the pages anonymously, as it only took 45 minutes out of his working day. [...] "Money for old rope," [...] he has said subsequently.|$|R
6000|$|Anne now saw how {{the matter}} stood; {{but she was}} not {{offended}} with him. What woman <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been? They <b>walked</b> on in silence, the respectful trumpet-major keeping a yard off on her right as precisely as if that measure had been fixed between them. She had a great feeling of civility toward him this evening, and spoke again. 'I often hear your trumpeters blowing the calls. They do it beautifully, I think.' ...|$|R
50|$|He also {{repeatedly}} {{states that}} the eighteenth century, being the Age of Reason, was the pinnacle for rational argument. Only in the printed word, he states, could complicated truths be rationally conveyed. Postman gives a striking example: many of the first fifteen U.S. presidents <b>could</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>walked</b> down the street without being recognized by the average citizen, yet all these men would have been quickly known by their written words. However, {{the reverse is true}} today. The names of presidents or even famous preachers, lawyers, and scientists call up visual images, typically television images, but few, if any, of their words come to mind. The few that do almost exclusively consist of carefully chosen soundbites. Postman mentions Ronald Reagan, and comments upon Reagan's abilities as an entertainer.|$|R
