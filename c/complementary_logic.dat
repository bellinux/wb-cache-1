The large number of SWNTs enables excellent device-level performance characteristics and good device-to-device uniformity, even with SWNTs that are electronically heterogeneous. Measurements on p- and n-channel transistors that involve as many as about 2,100 SWNTs reveal device-level mobilities and scaled transconductance approaching about 1,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 and $3,000 S m-1, respectively, and with current outputs of up to about 1 A in devices that use interdigitated electrodes.|$|E

40|$|Thin-film {{transistors}} are omnipresent in {{our daily}} lives mostly acting as switches in an active matrix for displays. This dissertation focuses mainly on the integration of such thin-film transistors in digital circuits targeting future applications that require large area or flexible substrates. The first chapter makes a comparison between different thin-film transistor technologies. Amongst these, organic and metal-oxide transistors are two next-generation technology candidates that can be fabricated at low process temperatures yielding good performance. The integration of these technologies into basic logic gates can be done using unipolar or <b>complementary</b> <b>logic</b> families. Unipolar technologies have only one semiconductor type available, while a complementary technology combines p-transistors with n-transistors. In case of unipolar technologies, we can distinguish between zero-VGS-load logic and diode-load logic. Both unipolar topologies exhibit a limited noise margin compared to <b>complementary</b> <b>logic.</b> This noise margin can be improved by utilizing dual-gate transistors that enable the availability of multiple threshold voltages. <b>Complementary</b> <b>logic</b> results in the best circuit metrics, both from static and dynamic point of view. The second best option, especially from static point of view, is dual-gate zero-VGS-load logic. Organic and metal-oxide transistors suffer from a certain parameter variability that finally limits the circuits integration density. Designs can cope with such parameter variation. In this work, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate within-die variations and estimate the circuits yield. Moreover, corner analysis can be performed taking into account die-to-die variation. For dual-gate technologies, the back gate {{can be used as}} adaptive back-gate control for threshold voltage compensation, both to take within-die and die-to-die variation into account. Finally, we have elaborated in this work on two design cases: the first one being low-cost, item-level RFID tags and the second one an 8 -bit organic microprocessor. The goal of the first design case is to demonstrate that, despite the lower intrinsic performance of organic and metal-oxide electronics, plastic RFID tags could meet specifications and requirements set for monocrystalline silicon based RFID tags. The second case details an 8 -bit microprocessor on foil that has been designed using a gate-level design flow, {{as a consequence of the}} choice of logic type being robust dual-gate zero-VGS-load logic gates. status: publishe...|$|E
