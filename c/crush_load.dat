Over 4,500 passengers are packed into a 9-car rake during peak hours, as against the rated carrying capacity of 1,700.

Although foam filling increased the energy absorption in single Al tube and multi-tube designs, {{it was not}} effective in increasing the specific absorbed energy over that of the empty Al tube.

The results of the experimental tests are utilized to validate the Abaqus/ExplicitTM finite element simulations {{and analysis of the}} crush phenomenon. Three polynomial meta-models based on the evolved group method of data handling (GMDH) neural networks are employed to simply represent the specific energy absorption (SEA), the initial peak <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> (P 1) and the secondary peak <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> (P 2) with respect to the geometrical variables. The training and testing data are extracted from the finite element analysis. The modified genetic algorithm NSGA-II, is used in multi-objective optimisation of the specific energy absorption, primary and secondary peak <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> according to the geometrical variables. Finally, in each optimisation process, the optimal section energy absorptions are compared with the results of the finite element analysis. The nearest to ideal point and TOPSIS optimisation methods are applied to choose the optimal points...|$|R

The rapid increase in the use of these products causes increment in solid waste problems. Eventually, management and prevention of solid waste resulted by urban and industrial waste are dramatically important. On the other hand, deterioration of sewage purification structures, part of industrial structures and concrete sewer pipes attacked by sulfuric acid is an important issue of the world that has communicated with substantial financial need in all countries. Thus, not so many researches has been investigated the effect of sulfuric acid erosion on concrete containing PET particles, this study represents the laboratory investigation of different values of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % of PET particles as an alternative aggregate on erosion caused by sulfuric acid in concrete. All samples were cured during 28 days, 3 samples from each mix design were tested, finally. In intervals of 15, 30, and 60 days of immersion in 5 % sulfuric acid, 3 specimens were taken out from sulfuric acid solution. Then, after drying these specimens and measuring their dimensions, <b>crushing</b> <b>load,</b> weight and ultrasonic wave velocity values were obtained. The results showed that by increasing in amount of PET particles as an alternative aggregates in concrete, there is less reduction in values of <b>crushing</b> <b>load,</b> weight loss and ultrasonic wave velocity.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2005 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 93 - 96) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxvii, 96 leavesAn {{experimental study}} has been conducted {{in order to determine}} the effect of Al-foam filling on the composite and hybrid (Al metal and composite) composite tubes. Tubes and fillers used in the experiments were prepared using the tube rolling and foaming from powder compacts methods, respectively. The composite was prepared using E-glass fiber fabric (2 x 2 twill fiber construction of 165 g/m 2 areal density) and polyester matrix with a 45 / 45 fiber angle to the tube axis. The quasi-static crush tests were conducted axially on the empty, hybrid and foam filled tubes at 25 mm/min crosshead speed. The deformation sequences of the tubes were further recorded during the tests in order to identify the crushing modes of the tubes. Two failure mechanisms literally known as progressive crushing and catastrophic failure (compression shear) were observed during the crushing of empty composite tubes. The progressive crushing mode leaded to higher <b>crushing</b> <b>loads</b> hence Specific Absorbed Energies (SAE). The predominant progressive crushing mode of empty tubes of thinner wall section was attributed to the surface end defects introduced during sectioning of the tubes. In hybrid tubes, the deformation mode of Al tube was found to be a more complex form of the diamond mode of deformation, leading to higher SAE values than the sum of the SAEs of empty composite and empty metal tube. The increased load and SAE values ofhybrid tubes were attributed to the constraining effect of the composite to the metal tube folding. Results further showed that when the progressive crushing mode was taken into account hybrid tubes had lower SAE values than those of empty composite tubes. The foam filling of the composite tubes however showed two different results. It increased the foam filled tube <b>crush</b> <b>loads</b> over the sum of the <b>crush</b> <b>loads</b> of empty composite tube and foam. In the latter case it was not effective in increasing <b>crush</b> <b>loads</b> over the sum of the <b>crush</b> <b>loads</b> of empty composite tube and foam in the progressive crushing region. These two effects were discussed in terms of possible interactions between composite tube and foam...|$|R
50|$|Around {{the same}} time, the Victorian Railways was experimenting with {{replacing}} cast-iron brake blocks with a non-metallic compound (probably asbestos), so Set 11 was fitted with these, and tested between Seaford and Frankston, in 5 mph increments up to line speed, in both directions. Four tests were made - first using the non-metallic brake blocks with empty and later loaded with cast-iron blocks, equal in weight to a <b>crush</b> <b>load</b> of passengers, {{and then with}} the cast iron brake blocks fitted to the train, as well as simulating the load, and finally the empty train with cast iron brake blocks. It was found that the new type of brake blocks performed better at higher speeds, but worse at lower speeds, so on average they gave similar performance and were approved for use.

The first C cars, referred to as C1 cars, were built by Alstom between 1987 and 1989. The second order of C cars, built by Morrison-Knudsen (now Washington Group International), are known as C2 cars. The C2 cars were identical to the C1 cars but featured an interior with a blue/gray motif. At the time of their construction, the C2 cars also featured flip-up seats which could be folded to accommodate wheelchair users; these seats were later removed during refurbishment.

40|$|The {{effect of}} cell size on the {{out of plane}} {{compressive}} crushing response of circular cell polycarbonate honeycomb is presented. The results are a continuation of a study originally done by Mellquist and Waas, 2002. Experiments were conducted on hexagonal cell honeycombs {{ranging in size from}} 1 to 14 cells. The results show that no scaling factor can be determined for the <b>crushing</b> <b>load</b> based on sample size, but that stability appears to be a driving property. Specimen cross-section shapes that have an arrangement of cells with higher orders of symmetry provide greater stability and are less imperfection sensitive and therefore have higher <b>crushing</b> <b>loads.</b> Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to better understand the behavior of the honeycombs during crushing and to validate experimental results.
