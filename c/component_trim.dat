This paper examines the application of oversampling techniques to A/D conversion at rates exceeding 1 MHz. A cascaded multibit sigma-delta (2 A) modulator that substantially reduces the oversampling ratio required for 12 -b conversion while avoiding stringent component matching requirements is introduced. Issues concerning the design and implementation of the modulator are presented. At a sampling rate of 50 MHz and an oversampling ratio of 24, an implementation of the modulator in a 1 -pm CMOS technology achieves a dynamic range of 74 dB at a Nyquist conversion rate of 2. 1 MHz.

These converters exploit the low parasitic capacitances and small feature sizes characteristic of scaled VLSI technologies by trading speed for resolution. This paper compares the second-order XA modulator to several alternative modulator architectures {{in the context of}} digital-audio signal acquisition.

5000|$|The GT was {{designed}} by Serge Soumille and built {{with the assistance of}} chief mechanic Maurice Gris, both of whom, like About, were originally from France. The prototype Manic GT used many parts from the Renault 8. The car was built on a Renault 8 chassis with a steel roll-over structure added to improve safety and add stiffness to the frame. Mounted behind the rear axle centre-line was a [...] Renault Cléon-Fonte engine. This inline four-cylinder motor had a wet-linered cast-iron block with five main bearings and an alloy cylinder head with overhead valves. The body of molded fiberglass was bonded, rather than bolted, to the chassis. While this further stiffened the structure it made repairs difficult. Steering was by rack-and-pinion. The suspension was independent at all four wheels via coil springs and telescopic dampers. The brakes were likewise disks at all four wheels. An anti-roll bar was mounted at the front. Many of the car's other <b>components</b> and <b>trim</b> came from Renault.|$|R
40|$|With in {{the last}} decade {{oversampling}} Delta-Sigma modulation techniques have gained significant importance in the field of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions. Oversampled data converters have some advantages over conventional Nyquist-rate converters. They provide an extremely wide dynamic range and also render the system very insensitive with regard to analog component nonidealities. Thus oversampling techniques have attracted the attention of circuit designers, since they enable the realization of high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADC 2 ̆ 7 s) without the need for a costly analog <b>component</b> <b>trimming</b> procedure. ^ But there remain two problems associated with ΔΣ modulators, which are not yet fully understood. One is the tonal behavior, which is responsible for non-white, discrete tones in the modulator output spectrum. Studying the cause of the tonal behavior will help us understand more about the resulting tonal noise spectra and will hopefully lead the way to a complete removal of these disturbing parasitics. ^ This dissertation is mostly concerned with the pattern noise problems occurring in single stage DSMs. First, the behavior of the DSM is modeled as a set of difference equations in the state space. By examining the difference of successive samples in the state space, the cause of the limit cycles in the DSM will be revealed. With the understanding of the mechanism of the limit cycles, all possible cases of limit cycles up to the point where our computational capacity saturates have been searched and found. Unfortunately, that limit does not include limit cycle sequences long enough to generate pattern noise in the passband. By simulating the 2 nd, 3 rd and 5 th order DSM with arbitrary initial conditions and checking the resulting output sequences for their repetitiveness, many limit cycles could be detected. With sufficient numbers of such cases, the level of maximum frequency response of pattern noise was examined. The simulation has been done for the zero input case, which {{is believed to be the}} most important situation for pattern noise problems. Changes of limit cycle characteristics under small disturbing noise and non-ideal circuit environments have also been studied to check the effect thermal noise or a dithering source might have on the system. ...|$|R

Using a conditional hematopoietic-specific Trim 33 knock-out (Trim 33 (Δ/Δ)) mouse, we showed previously that Trim 33 deficiency in hematopoietic stem cells leads to severe defects in hematopoiesis, resembling the main features of human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We also demonstrated that Trim 33 is involved in hematopoietic aging through TGFβ signaling.

40|$|In pre-production, during {{assembly}} of newly produced components geometrical deviations, caused by form errors of the parts, are discovered {{that can cause}} either functional or esthetical problems. One commonly used way of solving this is to reposition the components by adjusting their locators, also known as trimming. Traditionally this is done by assembling a number of components, measuring the deviations to surrounding parts, adjusting the locator points, reassembling the components and measuring the result. This is repeated until the result is satisfactory, and is a quite time and effort consuming activity. This paper presents a method and a tool that simplifies this process. Based on inspection data from the initial <b>components</b> all <b>trimming</b> activities are performed in the computer tool presented.

The optimization handles both boundaries on the allowed trimming and weighting of the different inspection features.

Here we investigated the abilities of domains from TRIM proteins (TRIM 6, TRIM 34, and TRIM 21) that do not restrict HIV- 1 infection to substitute for the domains of rhesus monkey TRIM 5 α (TRIM 5 αrh). The RING, B-box 2, and CC domains of the paralogous TRIM 6 and TRIM 34 proteins functionally replaced the corresponding TRIM 5 αrh domains, allowing HIV- 1 restriction. By contrast, similar chimeras containing the <b>components</b> of <b>TRIM</b> 21, a slightly more distant relative of TRIM 5, did not restrict HIV- 1 infection.

Polymeric car <b>trim</b> <b>component</b> emissions are typically evaluated using direct thermal desorption/extraction. The Microchamber/Thermal Extractor (mu-CTE, Markes International) was developed to provide both a complementary tool for rapid screening of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions-suitable for industrial quality control-and a means for thermal extraction of larger, more representative samples of car <b>trim</b> <b>components.</b> To determine the degree of correlation between conventional emission test methods and the microchamber, experiments were carried out under different conditions of temperature, air change rate and sample conditioning time. Good quantitative and qualitative correlation was obtained for measurements at ambient temperature. Moreover, it was shown that ambient-temperature emissions data collected using the mu-CTE as rapidly as possible-i. e. with minimal or no sample conditioning time-nevertheless provided a reliable guide as to how well that material would perform in subsequent 3 -day chamber tests of VOC emissions. The parameters found to have the greatest influence on data correlation for experiments carried out at elevated temperatures were the sample mass (for bulk emissions testing) and the conditioning time. The results also showed that, within the constraints of inherent sample homogeneity, the mu-CTE gave reproducible emissions data, despite its small sample size/capacity relative to that of conventional chambers. Preliminary results of modelling the air flow within a microchamber using computational fluid dynamics showed {{a high degree of}} turbulent flow and two potential areas of still air which could cause sink effects. However, the experimental data reported here and in previous studies showed enhanced recovery of semivolatile components from the mu-CTE relative to a recovery from a 1 m(3) conventional chamber.

For GDP growth and the unemployment rate, only few of the forecast combination schemes are able to outperform the simple equal-weighted average forecast.
