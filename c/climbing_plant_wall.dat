50|$|The {{photograph}} (right) {{taken at}} Winster Hall, Derbyshire, in about 1870 (probably by or for Llewellynn Jewitt (1816-1886), {{who lived at}} the house between 1868 and 1880) shows a possibly unique midwinter custom involving three hobby horses. (The picture {{appears to have been}} taken in winter, as the <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> on the <b>wall</b> are leafless.)

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} suitable greening project(s) that can be accomplished in good harmony with the historical walls of Antalya Kaleiçi, which are strictly protected monuments. Three different methods were considered for greening the walls. First one is <b>planting</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> very close to the walls, second one is <b>planting</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> near <b>walls</b> that are already protected by wire cages, and the last is using PVC flat framing with a self-watering system. Recently, the importance of green lands has been widely accepted and appreciated by authorities. Green walls block noise, cold, and heat; reduce air pollution and prevailing winds; provide better habitat microclimates for biodiversity of animals and plants; and improve aesthetic characteristics of living areas and water management. Living walls are rather important in regions characterized by hot summers, such as the Mediterranean Basin, since they can modify the atmosphere by reducing the effects of high temperatures. Living walls also reduce energy consumption by reducing air conditioner usage. Use of living walls should be wide-spread in such areas because of these advantages, in addition to th...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} conform {{with the rules}} for {{building}} on Metropolitan Open Land, the footprint of the new school building did not exceed that of the demolished buildings. The design includes a brown roof, <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> on <b>walls,</b> and areas of planted grassland, wild flowers and woodland. Bowlers Nursery moved into the new building in August 2012 and Ashmount School moved to the site in January 2013. Building operations at the Cape were finally completed in February 2013, two years and {{four months after the}} contract to carry out the work was signed by Islington Council. The Crouch Hill Project received a 2012 BREEAM award. Factors behind this award include the use of rain water harvesting, natural ventilation systems to keep the school building cool in summer and the setting up of an [...] "energy centre" [...] in the blockhouse which by means of combined heat and power provides district heating both for the whole site and for social housing near the site, as well as generating electricity. The main fuel used is gas, but there is also provision for the use of biomass in the form of woodchips. The Architects were Penoyre & Prasad and the Contractors were Willmott Dixon.|$|R
40|$|For {{greening}} {{the building}} envelope several concepts can be used, for example green roofs, façades greened with <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> or living <b>wall</b> systems (modular pre-vegetated panels), etc. Greening the building envelope allows {{to obtain a}} relevant improvement of the its effi- ciency, ecological and environmental benefits {{as well as an}} increase of the biodiversity. Since the interest restoring the environmental integ- rity of urban areas continues to increase, new developments in construction practices with beneficial environmental characteristics take place, as vertical greening systems. Applying green façades is not a new concept and can offer multiple benefits as a component of cur- rent urban design; considering the relation be- tween the environmental benefits, energy sav- ing for the building and the vertical greening systems (material used, maintenance, nutrients and water needed) the integration of vegetation could be a sustainable approach for the enve- lope of new and existing buildings...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{greening}} the building envelope with vertical greening systems such as <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> or living <b>wall</b> systems provides ecological and environmental benefits. Contemporary architecture in fact is increasingly focusing on vertical greening systems {{as a means to}} restore the environmental integrity of urban areas, biodiversity and sustainability. Applying green façades, which is an established feature of contemporary urban design, can offer multiple environmental benefits on both new and existing buildings and can be a sustainable approach in terms of energy saving considering materials used, nutrients and water needed and efficient preservation of edifices. To provide a full perspective and a viable case study on vertical greening systems a process tree is developed throughout this research. Elaborating the process tree {{has proved to be a}} useful methodology to analyse main parameters as climate and building characteristics, avoid damages and maintenance problems caused by inappropriate design, and compare different elements such as technologies, materials, durability, dimensions, and plant species employed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Climbing</b> <b>plants</b> {{are major}} {{component}} of tropical forest and play important role in many aspects of forest dynamic, balancing the micro-climate and provide food, shelter, nest material for wildlife especially bird. Inspite of their importance, <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> are often neglected. This research was aimed to describe the characteristics of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> communities in three different ecosystems in Rambut Island Wildlife Reserve (RIWR). <b>Climbing</b> <b>plants</b> inventory in dryland, beach and ecotone forest were done by combining transect and quadrat method. The plots made in each ecosystem were 53, 27 and 85 respectively. A total of 37 <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> species consisted of 19 families were identifed and their contribution to species richness in RIWR reached 25, 7 %. The <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> found in dryland, coastal and ecotone forest were 27 species (17 families), 23 species (16 families) dan 16 species (12 families) respectively. The species richness of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> in all ecosystem were low, but the dryland forest was the richest due to the more fertile soils and vegetation structure complexity. In general, the species diversity and evenness in all ecosystem were low because of certain species domination. Dioscorea bulbifera was dominant in dryland and beach forest while Ipomoea violacea was dominant in ecotone forest. The domination of D. bulbifera influenced the similarity of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> communities among ecosystem.

40|$|The {{composition}} and geographic distribution of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> are {{important aspects of}} ecological study, but research on temperate <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> is relatively limited. We compared the family and genera- level composition, floristic element type, growth forms, diversity and geographical distribution of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> in nine districts of temperate East Asia, including Northeast China, Japan, Mongolia and the Korean Peninsula. A total of 304 <b>climbing</b> <b>plant</b> species were documented, belonging to 38 families and 96 genera, including 127 lianas, 138 perennial vines and 39 annual vines. Distributions of <b>climbing</b> <b>plants</b> appear to be restricted mainly by cold and drought stresses. Their diversity and proportion to total flora are higher in coastal than inland areas, and higher in low latitudes than in high latitudes. As expected, the proportion of tropical elements declined {{and the proportion of}} temperate elements increased in temperate East Asia relative to subtropical East Asia. Twist climbing is the most common climbing pattern (61. 5 % of all species), followed by tendrillar (23. 7 %), adhesive (11. 2 %) and sprawling (3. 6 %) climbing. We speculate that twisting climbers are more cold-tolerant than other <b>climbing</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
