60|$|That morning, {{while waiting}} for the time to {{approach}} when it would be proper for him to go to Midbranch, he had been reading in a bound volume of an old English magazine, {{which was one of the}} five books the cottage possessed, an account of a battle which had interested him very much. The commander of one army had massed his forces along and below the crest of a line of low hills, the extreme right of his line being occupied by a strong force of cavalry. The army opposed to him was much stronger than his own, and it was not long before the battle began to go very much against him. His positions on the left were carried by the <b>combined</b> <b>charge</b> of the larger portion of the enemy's forces, and, in spite of a vigorous resistance, his lines were forced back, down the hill, and into the valley. It was quite evident he could make no stand, and was badly beaten. Thereupon, he sent orders to his generals on the left to retreat, in as good order as possible, across a small river in their rear. While this movement was in progress, and the enemy was making the greatest efforts to prevent it, the commander put himself at the head of his cavalry and led them swiftly from the scene of battle. He took them diagonally over the crest of the hill, down the other side, and then charging with this fresh body of horse upon the rear and camp of the enemy, he swiftly captured the general-in-chief, his staff, and the Minister of War, who had come down to see how things were going on. With these important prisoners he dashed away, leaving the acephalous enemy to capture his broken columns if he could.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the {{threshold}} decrease {{can be understood as}} a consequence of charge neutrality: the Yau charge-sharing model. The <b>combined</b> <b>charge</b> in the depletion region of the device and that in the channel of the device is balanced by three electrode charges: the gate, the source and the drain. As drain voltage is increased, the depletion region of the p-n junction between the drain and body increases in size and extends under the gate, so the drain assumes a greater portion of the burden of balancing depletion region charge, leaving a smaller burden for the gate. As a result, the charge present on the gate retains charge balance by attracting more carriers into the channel, an effect equivalent to lowering the threshold voltage of the device.|$|E
5000|$|In World War I, Croonaert Wood {{was one of}} {{the sites}} used by German units to defend the area around the Ypres Salient. The Germans built a {{defensive}} complex of trenches, dugouts and bunkers on the slightly elevated landscape, from which artillery observers had an excellent view of the ground around Wijtschate and Ypres. The location was called Bayernwald by German soldiers {{due to the fact that}} the first German soldiers to be stationed there were from Bavaria ("Bayern" [...] in German). The area was the site of extensive mining activity by both German and British units during the war. Before the Battle of Messines, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers placed a large mine around the German strongpoint Günther, not far from the Bayernwald trenches. It consisted of three chambers (Hollandscheschur Farm 1, 2, 3) which were loaded with a <b>combined</b> <b>charge</b> of 66,600 lb of ammonal.

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} charge {{efficacy}} is introduced {{as a measure}} of the effectiveness of incident charge for producing single-event upsets.

It is illustrated how the efficacy curve can be determined from standard heavy-ion or pulsed laser SEU cross-section data, and discussed how it can be calculated from <b>combined</b> <b>charge</b> collection and circuit analysis. Upset rates can be determined using the figure of merit approach, and values determined from the laser cross-sections or from the mixed-mode simulations.

40|$|It is {{explained}} that the Standard Model <b>combined</b> <b>charge</b> conjugation and parity transformation (CP) is a simultaneous complex conjugation outer automorphism transformation of gauge and space-time symmetries. Simple examples are given for the general concept of outer automorphisms ("symmetries of symmetries"), {{as well as for}} their possible actions on physical theories. It is highlighted that complex conjugation outer automorphisms do not, in general, exist for all symmetries. Examples are given for cases in which the physical CP transformation is violated as a consequence of requiring another symmetry. A toy model is illustrated in which CP is spontaneously violated in the broken phase of a continuous gauge symmetry, while an unbroken outer automorphism protects the topological vacuum angle at θ= 0.

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{amino acid}} {{residues}} {{that have been}} shown to be essential for proton transfer in most cytochrome c oxidases are not conserved in the ba 3 -type cytochrome c oxidase from the thermophilic eubacterium Thermus thermophilus. So far, it has been unclear whether the Th. thermophilus ba 3 -type cytochrome c oxidase can nevertheless function as an electrogenic proton pump. In this study, we have <b>combined</b> <b>charge</b> translocation measurements on a lipid bilayer with two independent methods of proton pumping measurements to show that enzymatic turnover of the Th. thermophilus cytochrome c oxidase is indeed coupled to the generation of an electrocurrent and proton pumping across the membrane. In addition to a `vectorial' consumption of 1. 0 H+/e− for water formation, proton pumping with a stoichiometry of 0. 4 – 0. 5 H+/e− was observed. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of redox-coupled proton transfer in this unusual cytochrome c oxidase are discussed...|$|E
