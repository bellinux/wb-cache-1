25|$|According to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed {{criminal}} offenses as uncommon, {{but there}} are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes. Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials {{were also more likely}} to find peaceful outcomes in a <b>community</b> <b>setting</b> than to resort to harsher government resolution.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "waiver" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} these programs as they waive traditional Medicaid statutory requirements regarding the setting in which long-term care services are provided. [...] The enactment of these waiver programs ushered in a major paradigm shift for the long-term care industry and the individuals served by these programs. The goal of waivers {{is to improve the}} quality of life of those receiving long-term care. The mission of such waivers is [...] "to live in the most integrated <b>community</b> <b>setting</b> appropriate to individual support requirements and preferences."

[...] Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with {{the potential impact of}} medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.|$|E

[...] Resistance to these antibiotics has also led {{to the use of}} new, broad-spectrum anti-gram-positive antibiotics, such as linezolid, because of its availability as an oral drug. First-line treatment for serious invasive infections due to MRSA is currently glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). [...] A number of problems with these antibiotics occur, such as the need for intravenous administration (no oral preparation is available), toxicity, and the need to monitor drug levels regularly by blood tests. [...] Also, glycopeptide antibiotics do not penetrate very well into infected tissues (this is a particular concern with infections of the brain and meninges and in endocarditis). [...] Glycopeptides must not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), as outcomes are inferior.|$|E
