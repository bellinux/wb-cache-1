This includes the general principles of contract law, agency law and the rules which apply to forged cheques, and the UK <b>Cross-Border</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> Regulations 1999 which implemented the EU Directive on Cross-Border Credit Transfers 1997. The English law is then compared with Article 4 A of the U. S. Uniform Commercial Code 1989 and the UNCITRAL Model Law in International Credit Transfer 1992.;Chapter one defines EFT, and demonstrates the legal concept of fraudulent EFT in English law. This chapter focuses on the significance of authority and the problem of identity authentication under English common law. Chapter two analyses the legal nature of payment orders and the rules applying to fraudulent EFT in English and EU law. Moreover, it examines the forms and legal validity of security procedures in the context of EFT in English and EU law. Chapter three discusses the rules of the UNCITRAL Model Law and Article 4 A as applied to unauthorised EFT. It focuses on the legal concept and validity of security procedures under both legal frameworks. Chapter four deals with the basis of the originator's action against the originator's bank for fraudulent EFT in English law. Chapter five considers the basis of action and freedom of contract under the UNCITRAL Model Law and Article 4 A. Chapter five examines the scope of the originator's bank's liabilities for direct and consequential damages occurring as a result of fraudulent EFT under both legal frameworks...|$|E

In Europe, the new Payment Services Directive contains important rules on late and erroneous execution.

The European Community is constantly concerned about efficient cross-border payments {{but also about the}} consumer protection of these services, so as to ensure the same conditions for cross-border services, but also for national services and to stimulate cross-border investment was adopted Directive 97 / 5 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 on <b>cross-border</b> <b>credit</b> <b>transfers,</b> repealed by Directive 2007 / 64 /EC. Article 10 of Directive 97 / 5 /EC established a series of minimum requirements and measures relating to <b>cross-border</b> <b>credit</b> <b>transfers.</b> Thus Member States shall ensure that there are adequate and effective complaints and redress procedures for the settlement of disputes between an originator and his institution or between a beneficiary and his institution in case of failure transfers. In Romania, the provisions of Directive 2007 / 64 /EC were transposed by the adoption of Emergency Ordinance no. 113 / 2009 which repeals the Government Ordinance no. 6 / 2004 on cross-border transfers. This document provides that each institution must have appropriate procedures for resolving customer complaints in connection with the execution of a cross border institution or commitments in connection with such transfer. In the legal doctrine prior to the adoption of Government Ordinance no. 6 / 2004, it was proposed that the National Bank of Romania, as banking supervisory authority, in some specialized structures, ensure procedures to enforce the settlement of disputes between consumers and financial service providers of banking and insurance. The solution was acquired by the Romanian legislature, so the earlier legislation and the current legislation, the Emergency Ordinance no. 113 / 2009, this document proposing the establishment of a specialized department that is responsible with the resolution of disputes between consumers and financial service providers ofbanking and insurance. However, although in 2004 we have legislation that enables the implementation of mediation as a means of dispute settlement in the banking sector (Government Ordinance. 6 / 2004), the practical delays occur...|$|R

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the rising {{dependence}} of Central and Eastern Europe on multinational banks’ credits, {{the main purpose of}} the article is to identify and examine the determinants of <b>cross-border</b> <b>credits</b> through a methodology based on “push” and “pull” factors. The author presents the results of a regression analysis on the determinants of <b>cross-border</b> <b>credits</b> provided by multinational banks from EU- 15 to Central and Eastern Europe over the period of 1990 - 2015 by using the statistical data compiled and published by the Bank for International Settlements. The obtained results suggest that global as well as home and host country level determinants influence <b>cross-border</b> <b>credits</b> but to a different extent. According to our results, higher stability and predictability of global economic environment contribute to higher <b>cross-border</b> <b>credit</b> growth. The results of the host country determinants analysis indicate that more effective and profitable economies receive more credits from multinational banks. We also find that multinational banks provide more credits to countries with small markets, low inflation rate, high external debt burden, high capital account deficit, fixed exchange rate regime, and developed institutional environment. Regarding home level determinants, we find the existence of a negative correlation between home country economic cycle and the amount of <b>cross-border</b> <b>credits</b> received by the host country, which can be explained by low economic growth in continental Europe over the period under consideration that stimulated European banks to expand lending on foreign markets with higher profit opportunities. Thus, <b>cross-border</b> <b>credits</b> appear to have been countercyclical to growth in home countries and procyclical to growth in host countries. Finally, it is found that host country level determinants play the most important role in explaining changes in <b>cross-border</b> <b>credits</b> on host countries in Central and Eastern Europe during 1990 - 2015 period, which means that host countries have a control over their own destinies and the amount of received credits depends on their economic and political performance. Value/originality. The results of the research make it possible to provide {{a better understanding of the}} determinants of <b>cross-border</b> <b>credits</b> and practical importance of multinational banks’ lending as an important source of external finance for the catching-up process and a major component in the ongoing process of financial deepening in Central and Eastern Europe, and clarify whether these determinants differ in periods of financial stability and crisis...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{development}} of foreign bank penetration in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and its influence on the stability of bank credit. We measure both <b>cross-border</b> <b>credit</b> and activities of foreign bank subsidiaries within CEE. By combining BIS statistics and BankScope data into a unique database {{we are able to}} make a clear distinction between these two kinds of activities. Our analysis shows that the relative importance of foreign bank subsidiaries in CEE has increased considerably during recent years. However, in Estonia, Hungary and Poland foreign banks were also important during the first transition years, as they provided substantial amounts of <b>cross-border</b> <b>credit.</b> We do not find evidence of foreign banks deserting CEE, e. g. during adverse economic times. Although <b>cross-border</b> <b>credit</b> did decrease during some periods, our results show that foreign banks acquired new local subsidiaries or expanded the credit supply of existing subsidiaries at the same time. foreign banks; cross-border credit; transition economies; financial stability...|$|R

We combine aggregate information on total and <b>cross-border</b> <b>credit</b> with firm-level survey data for the period 2010 - 2014. We find that the decline in cross-border lending led to a deterioration in the borrowing conditions of small firms.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} advance our {{understanding}} of the <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> phenomenon in the UK, specifically how students draw on a credit as a form of institutional cultural capital.

A common theme of “unfinished business” appeared to dominate these accounts and a narrative-oriented analysis of the findings revealed the role of <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> in enabling students to complete varied personal projects or forms of “unfinished business”.
