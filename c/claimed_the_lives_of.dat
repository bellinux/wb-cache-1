Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available along the route but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish.

Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of coastal erosion on the island, some fear the worst.

5|$|The {{industrial}} fire <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> {{at least}} ten people, who were unable to escape because the doors were locked shut illegally. Authorities, in response to local residents' angry criticism, admitted that the emergency response to the accident was substandard. Two separate investigations were launched.

The results of both are either pending or have yet to be released to the general public.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} Longstreet family in January 1862.

In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E

United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose their lives as a result of the crash took to the field in the game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Edwards and centre-forward Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States' {{entry into}} World War II, Dean was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel in 1941, and colonel in 1942. He {{was promoted to}} brigadier general later that year and made head of the Requirements Division in 1943. He held this office only briefly, before being assigned as assistant commander of the US 44th Infantry Division, under Major Generals James I. Muir and Robert L. Spragins beginning in late 1943. The division was to sail for the European Theater and Dean went with them despite being injured shortly before departure in a flamethrower accident which <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> two other soldiers. Dean was promoted to major general in late 1943.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{felt that}} the planned {{extermination}} of the Jews was too difficult and important to be entrusted to the military. In 1941 the Einsatzgruppen were sent into the Soviet Union to begin large-scale genocide of Jews, Romani people, and communists. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews. The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppen was at Babi Yar outside Kiev, where 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation on 29–30 September 1941. In the Rumbula massacre (November–December 1941), 25,000 victims from the Riga ghetto were killed. Another mass shooting early in 1942 <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> over 10,000 Jews in Kharkov.|$|E

5|$|The {{killing of}} civilians living in Voćin and two nearby smaller villages began on 13 December at noon. The White Eagles infantry, {{supported}} {{by at least}} one tank, moved through Voćin bombing Croat-owned houses and killing civilians. The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> 43 civilians. The bodies of the victims were mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voćin itself, to flee or perish. All the victims were Croat civilians, except one 77-year-old Serb who had tried to protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries. Most of the victims were elderly, including twelve women aged 56–76 and eleven men aged 60–84.|$|E
5|$|The war had <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> nine Arsenal {{first team}} players, {{the most of}} any top flight club, and the {{intervening}} time had cut short the careers of several others, including Bastin and Drake. Additionally, the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden, and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946. They lost 6–1 on aggregate to West Ham United in the third round of the 1945–46 FA Cup, and upon the league's resumption in 1946–47 the club finished 13th, their worst in 17 years. George Allison decided to retire from football {{at the end of that}} season, and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker, a long-time servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman.|$|E
5|$|Britain had {{recognised}} Zanzibar's {{sovereignty and}} its sultanate in 1886, {{after a long}} period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans. However, Germany was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century. Sultan Khalifah had granted rights to the land of Kenya to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands. Many of the Arab ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which resulted in some unrest. In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate, which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population. One such conflict in Tanga <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> 20 Arabs.|$|E
