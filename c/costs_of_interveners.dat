50|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>intervener</b> {{services}} {{for individuals who}} are deaf-blind arose in Canada in the 1970s, and has been developing as a practice in the U. S. {{over the past two}} decades. In that time, significant efforts by many individuals across the nation have improved the availability <b>of</b> <b>intervener</b> {{services for}} children who are deaf-blind. Since 2002, there has been a national intervener task force that has developed valuable resources, including materials that raise awareness <b>of</b> <b>intervener</b> services and guidelines for intervener competencies. Families have educated policymakers about the role <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> and the positive impact an intervener can have on the education of a child who is deaf-blind. State deaf-blind projects, part of the system of federal supports for this group of students, have developed creative ways to train interveners and support them in classrooms. Formal and informal collaborations are leading towards the development of a stronger national infrastructure to support this practice. Currently, a national set of recommendations, a national set of competencies for training interveners, national training modules and a national association are part of a strong foundation for promoting quality intervention services for individuals with deaf-blindness.|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This data set contains data for interventions recorded at daily intervals during the twenty-year period 1948 - 1967. The daily report is the unit of analysis. There are 1, 073 records, one for each day on which an intervention occurred in a country. The number of records per country varies. If, for example, a country had no action meeting the criteria for inclusion as an intervention, no record is given for that day for that country. Those countries not involved in an intervention were excluded. Data are recorded for 89 of the 136 nations in the World Handbook aggregate data file and two international organisations. Some of the 31 variables included are the number <b>of</b> <b>interveners,</b> type <b>of</b> group involved, air and naval incursions and length <b>of</b> <b>intervener's</b> presence in the country. The data sources are the New York Times Index, Associated Press, Asian Recorder, African Research Bulletin, Middle East Journal and African Diary...|$|R

40|$|The {{institute}} <b>of</b> an <b>intervener</b> is one <b>of</b> many procedural institutes whose {{regulation is}} characterized by considerable disparity in the Serbian anti-discrimination legislation. Considering {{the fact that this}} subject matter is not regulated either in the Act on the Prohibition of Discrimination (2009) or in the Act on the Prevention of Discrimination against People with Disabilities (2006), the applicable law on this matter is embodied in the Civil Procedure Act as a subsidiary source of law. In addition, the Gender Equality Act includes some subject-specific provisions on the right of third parties to participate in anti-discrimination lawsuits. Given the fact that this right of third parties is a European standard envisaged in EU documents, it is important to address a number of questions on the procedural position <b>of</b> an <b>intervener.</b> Who can be an <b>intervener?</b> Which <b>of</b> the claimants can he/she join and support? What kind of status may he/she have in the proceedings? What is the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>intervener's</b> involvement in the proceeding? Finally, can the intervener support the defendant and is there leeway for applying the intervention effect of the final judgment? In this context, the author provides a detailed analysis of the procedural dilemmas underlying this subject matter and proposes a legal solution de lege ferenda which would be most appropriate for regulating the participation <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> in anti-disctimination lawsuits...|$|R

50|$|After Getúlio Vargas took power, the {{governors}} were {{elected by the}} national congress, and after this, a number <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> were sent to govern the state. A short period of democracy returned when Carlos Monteiro Lindenberg was elected by Capixabas. However, after the 1964 military coup interveners were once again chosen by the national assembly. After Cristiano Dias Lopes, Arthur Carlos Gerhard Santos, Élcio Álvares and Eurico Rezende were chosen this way, open elections were used to choose all leaders from Gerson Camata up to the current governor Renato Casagrande.|$|R

An interventer is typically a paraeducator who has received specialized, in-depth training in deaf-blindness and works one-to-one with an infant, child, or youth.

50|$|Reaction was {{immediate}} and widespread, {{given that the}} range <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> in Sun Indalex reflected {{the fact that the}} scope and importance of many of the issues raised in the case apply equally in non-insolvency circumstances. Restructuring experts in the Canadian legal community welcomed the decision as being pragmatic, and pension plan administrators noted how the decision dealt with situations where companies administer their own pension plans. Other lawyers noted that Sun Indalex hands pensioners some new tools to use in similar court fights. The immediate impact to the Indalex pension plan members was that they would lose about half of what they would have received under their full pensions.|$|R
50|$|Though {{often an}} {{outsider}} figure, {{for instance in}} the role <b>of</b> <b>intervener</b> or arbitrator, Cú Roí appears in {{a great number of}} medieval Irish texts, including Forfess Fer Fálgae, Amra Con Roi, Brinna Ferchertne, Aided Chon Roi (in several recensions), Fled Bricrenn, Mesca Ulad and Táin Bó Cúailnge. The early Irish tale-lists refer to such titles as Aided Chon Roí, Echtra Chon Roí (List A), Orgain Chathrach Chon Roí and Cathbúada Con Roí (List B), but only the first of these tales can be shown to have survived in some form. Several tales describe the enmity between him and the Ulster hero Cú Chulainn, who eventually kills him.|$|R
50|$|Although most {{writers agree}} that {{humanitarian}} interventions should be undertaken multilaterally, ambiguity remains over which particular agents the UN, regional organizations, {{or a group}} of states should act in response to mass violations of human rights. The choice of actor has implications for overcoming collective action challenges through mobilization of political will and material resources. Questions of effectiveness, conduct and motives <b>of</b> the <b>intervener,</b> extent <b>of</b> internal and external support, and legal authorization have also been raised as possible criteria for evaluating the legitimacy <b>of</b> a potential <b>intervener.</b>|$|R
40|$|This review {{examines}} {{both the}} anthropological and international relations literature on collective understandings and peace interventions {{to identify their}} contributions, elucidate the current debates, emphasize the literatures' complementary and conflicting aspects, and shed light on their respective shortcomings. I {{first look at the}} top-down research, which focuses on two main topics: national negotiation styles and diplomatic culture, and the liberal peace paradigm. After highlighting the deficiencies of this top-down approach, I move to two central debates in the bottom-up research on peace interventions: the divergence between cultures <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> and those <b>of</b> local populations, and the significance of the interveners' organizational and professional frames. To conclude, I emphasize areas that remain underresearched...|$|R
40|$|The {{accidents}} {{in the construction}} {{are one of the}} main indicators of the claims recorded at work in Portugal. The identification of the factors and causes related with accidents at work is essential for a correct analysis of the risks and a consequent adoption of procedures and measures to achieve a more effective prevention. The focus on rehabilitation has increased in Portugal and it is in this kind of construction that accidents are more frequent, mainly motivated by the lack of local knowledge to work and skilled manpower. Thus, on the basis of an inquiry implemented to several categories <b>of</b> <b>interveners,</b> this work puts forward the main reasons for noncompliance in safety regarding this type of activity...|$|R
40|$|Behavioral {{studies of}} {{sentence}} comprehension suggest that processing long-distance dependencies {{is subject to}} interference effects when Noun Phrases (NP) similar to the dependency head intervene in the dependency. Neuroimaging studies converge in localizing such effects to Broca's area, showing that activity in Broca's area increases with the number <b>of</b> NP <b>interveners</b> crossed by a moved NP of the same type. To test if NP interference effects are modulated by adding an intervening clause boundary, which should by hypothesis {{increase the number of}} successive-cyclic movements, we conducted an fMRI study contrasting NP interveners with clausal (CP) interveners. Our design thus had two components: (I) the number <b>of</b> NP <b>interveners</b> crossed by movement was parametrically modulated; (II) CP-intervention was contrasted with NP-intervention. The number <b>of</b> NP <b>interveners</b> parametrically modulated a cluster straddling left BA 44 / 45 of Broca's area, replicating earlier studies. Adding an intervening clause boundary did not significantly modulate the size of the NP interference effect in Broca's area. Yet, such an interaction effect was observed in the Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG). Therefore, the involvement of Broca's area in processing syntactic movement is best captured by memory mechanisms affected by a grammatically instantiated type-identity (i. e., NP) intervention...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept and}} {{practice}} of technology transfer in the agriculture sector in the Philippines need rethinking. The common notion of technology transfer in the agriculture sector {{is based on the}} traditional view of innovation in which technologies and techniques are assumed to flow essentially unchanged from one location to another in a linear fashion. The technology transfer approaches <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> in the agriculture sector have been generally top-down. While these approaches have achieved some degree of success, they have not been sufficiently far-reaching to spur the growth of the rural economy. This thesis questions the linear and top-down orientation of technology transfer both as explanation and as prescription {{in the context of the}} agricultural research and extension system in the Philippines...|$|R

"Profiling" addresses such problems as poor development of ideas, simplistic ideas, and lack of coherence in written texts. "Pause Analysis" focusses on the thinking processes that students engage in while drafting text, processes such as searching for ideas, evaluatÂ­ing ideas, and postponing ideas. Both activities enable the instructor to assume the role <b>of</b> <b>intervener</b> in the students' writing processes, rather than evaluator of the text produced.

40|$|I {{consider}} {{who should}} undertake humanitarian intervention. Should we prefer intervention by the UN, NATO, a regional or sub-regional organisation, a state, {{a group of}} states, or someone else? This thesis answers this question by, first, determining which qualities <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> are morally significant and, second, assessing {{the relative importance of}} these qualities. The thesis then considers the more empirical question of whether (and to what extent) the current agents of humanitarian intervention actually possess these qualities, and therefore should intervene. Overall, I develop a particular conception of legitimacy for humanitarian intervention. I use this conception of legitimacy to assess not only the current interveners, but also the desirability of potential reforms to the mechanisms and agents of humanitarian intervention.

40|$|Domestic {{political}} instability provides {{an incentive for}} external military intervention by raising the opportunity <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> nonintervention. When deciding to intervene in response to instability within its sphere of influence, a regional hegemon considers the anticipated actions <b>of</b> other potential <b>interveners.</b> In particular, a hegemon has an incentive to intervene preemptively to forestall future interventions by rival powers. Given this, military intervention {{will be more likely}} when another power provides an external threat to a hegemon’s sphere of influence. A historical examination of U. S. intervention policy and behavior in the Caribbean Basin supports the theory. ...|$|R
40|$|Interveners make {{submissions}} {{in about}} half of the cases heard by the Supreme Court of Canada, but the motivations for and consequences of the practice are not clearly understood. Considered broadly, {{there are at least three}} functions that the practice of intervention might perform. The first possibility is that hearing from interveners might provide objectively useful information to the Court (i. e., interveners might promote the 2 ̆ 2 accuracy 2 ̆ 2 of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision making). A second possibility is that the practice <b>of</b> intervention allows <b>interveners</b> to provide the 2 ̆ 2 best argument 2 ̆ 2 for certain partisan interests that judges might want to 2 ̆ 2 affiliate 2 ̆ 2 with. A third possibility is that interventions are allowed mainly (if not only) so that intervening parties feel they have had their voices heard by the Court and the greater public, including Parliament, regardless of the effect on the outcome of the appeal (i. e., the Court might be promoting the 2 ̆ 2 acceptability 2 ̆ 2 of its decisions by allowing for an outlet for expression). We examine empirically the role <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> in all the cases decided by the Supreme Court of Canada from January 2000 to July 2009 and find statistical evidence that interveners matter...|$|R

50|$|External {{interventions}} see {{different levels}} of democratization success {{depending on the type}} <b>of</b> <b>intervener,</b> type <b>of</b> intervention, and level of elite cooperation prior to the intervention. The level of neutrality and geopolitical disinterest the intervener possesses is important, as is the severity of the intervention's infringement on sovereignty. The differences can be highlighted with three examples: a neutral, mostly unobtrusive monitor missions like UN election observers in Nicaragua in 1989; the multilateral NATO IFOR mission in Yugoslavia to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1031 in 1995; and the unilateral, destabilizing intervention represented by the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. All three missions aimed on some level to promote democracy, with varying degrees of success. Michael Doyle and Nicholas Sambanis have found that the peacekeeping missions most successful at producing fledgling democracies have strong mandates backing them up, but tend not to revolve around military enforcement. Successful democratizing interventions consist of monitoring factions' adherence to their negotiated settlement, while the most successful ones include extensive state-building (such as improving government efficiency and professionalism, or classical infrastructure assistance).|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} shows that foreign military interventions in civil conflicts {{on the side of}} the government or opposition are frequent and they have significant political and economic impacts on both the intervening states and the target states. While many recent quantitative studies have examined the impact of foreign military interventions on the dynamics and outcomes of civil conflicts, similar attention has not been paid to the factors that motivate foreign powers to intervene in intrastate disputes. Most of the theoretical insight on the causes of military intervention comes from earlier qualitative studies that analyze the foreign policy decision making <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> in detail. In contrast, the small amount of quantitative research conducted on this topic focuses more on the attributes of the civil conflict that attract foreign military intervention. The purpose of this study is to analyze the causes of military interventions from a foreign policy decision making perspective which has been neglected in current quantitative studies. In order to identify the factors that motivate state leaders to use military intervention as a foreign policy instrument, this dissertation examines the international and domestic sources of foreign polic...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{conflict}} {{play an important}} part in underpinning and guiding practical interventions in conflict. The theory {{of conflict}} transformation is distinguished from theories of conflict management and conflict resolution by its emphasis on the need for systemic change in order to alter the social structures, conflict parties and institutions within which conflicts are embedded. Since all conflicts are situated within a social context, which often shapes and may engender the conflict formation, transformation of conflict often requires change in the conflict’s context. This suggests that conflict transformation theory needs to extend beyond the immediate site of conflict to become a theory of conflict-in-context. The EU is {{one of a number of}} major international actors which affect the context of contemporary conflicts, especially on its immediate borders. This paper argues firstly that conflict transformation theory can be used to inform, analyse and assess European practice in intervening in conflict, and secondly that the theory should be extended to include the impacts of external agents such as the EU. This is to argue for a reflexive approach to theory and practice, allowing a critical interpretation of the interaction <b>of</b> <b>interveners</b> and protagonists in conflict. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} dependency-forming {{featural}} operation Agree and its {{interaction with the}} structure-building operation Merge in the local, derivational framework of Chomsky (2000). Chapter II develops a theory of cyclicity where individual instances of Merge can change the search-space of a probe. Such dynamic cyclicity is motivated from cyclic displacement phenomena where search-space expands downwards from one cycle to the next through evacuation <b>of</b> <b>interveners,</b> and the ergative displacement phenomenon in Basque where search-space expands upwards through cyclic construction of the phrase marker. Chapter III shows how Merge composes with Agree in the derivation to give both movement and copy-raising. The Merge step is constrained by the Agree step because Agree transmits the variable names needed to interpret movement in Heim & Kratzer (1998). Differences between movement and copy-raising reduce to the Binding Theory and copy-deletion in the result, forcing copies in local domains and pronouns in non-local domains. English tough-movement exemplifies copy-raising whose pronoun tail is an Ā-operator. Chapter IV explores the ontology of Agree, departing from Chomsky (2000) where Agree in weak agreement languages manipulates features rather than atoms and has no furthe...|$|R
