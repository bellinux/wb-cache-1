5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs <b>crafted</b> are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well <b>crafted</b> images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank.

5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he <b>crafted</b> himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes <b>crafted</b> from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E

5000|$|Studio <b>craft</b> is the {{practice}} of <b>craft</b> methodology in an artist's studio. Traditional <b>craft</b> tends to generate <b>craft</b> objects out of necessity or for ceremonial use while studio <b>craft</b> produces <b>craft</b> objects at the whim of the maker or intended owner. These objects are at most only desirable for use and often lack any utility. Because studio <b>craft</b> doesn't make objects out of necessity, it is similar to works of studio art which are made for aesthetic rather than functional purposes.|$|R
25|$|Historians {{believe that}} {{parchment}} <b>craft</b> originated {{as an art}} form in Europe during the fifteenth or sixteenth century. Parchment <b>craft</b> at that time occurred principally in Catholic communities, where <b>crafts</b> persons created lace-like items such as devotional pictures and communion cards. The <b>craft</b> developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the sixteenth century, parchment <b>craft</b> was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment <b>craft</b> with them. As before, the <b>craft</b> appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their first communion received gifts of handmade parchment <b>crafts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes.

40|$|<b>Craft</b> {{producers}} in South Africa face difficulties selling to formal <b>craft</b> retailers. This {{is due to}} the lack of understanding of what <b>craft</b> retailers consider as important when searching for suppliers. The study was conducted to determine the importance of various supplier selection criteria that <b>craft</b> retailers use to evaluate suppliers. Convenience sampling was adopted and self-administered questionnaires were completed by a total of 233 <b>craft</b> retailers. The findings revealed that <b>craft</b> retailers consider product quality as the most important supplier selection criteria when evaluating <b>craft</b> producers as suppliers. The MANOVA results further indicated that although the importance attached to supplier selection criteria differed for various types of <b>craft</b> retailers, such differences occur only for selected supplier criteria. An understanding of the supplier selection criteria used by <b>craft</b> retailers could enable informal <b>craft</b> producers to gain access to the formal market. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Since the Middle Ages, most {{dwellings}} were log {{houses with}} notched corners, carefully <b>crafted</b> to ensure {{protection against the}} elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times.

Air cushion technology has vastly increased the landing capability of the <b>craft,</b> providing greater speed and flexibility over traditional landing <b>craft.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{has never}} been in Japan such a {{remarkable}} movement for modernization of designs and <b>craft</b> as has been the case in Europe. As for <b>craft,</b> there was barely the folk <b>craft</b> movement advanced by Muneyoshi Yanagi, whose goal was not the modernization of <b>craft.</b> During the Meiji Era, Japan was so urgent to adapt herself to European civilization that she could ill afford to start her own movement considering her position in the fields of design or <b>craft.</b> Especially, {{in most parts of the}} country, having little influence from Europe, the <b>craft</b> manufacturers were unable to get rid of their traditional way of thinking and manufacturing. In 1929, however, there came home to Japan a toung man called Fusaichiro Inouye, who had experienced a new movement for design and <b>craft</b> for seven years in France. In Takasaki, his native town, trying to connect art with local industry, he would start a movement to make high quality <b>craft</b> far more popular than ever. For this purpose, Inouye organized an Association for distribution of wood <b>craft,</b> established the Inouye <b>Craft</b> Institue, and actually started designing and manufacturing himself. What he aimed at was not only fostering local <b>craft</b> but also manufacturing such <b>craft</b> goods as would be well fit for overseas markets. It was because of such a basis well established that Bruno Taut moved to Takasaki in 1934 so as to be a leader in <b>craft.</b> Taut sympathized with Inouye in his ideal of fostering <b>craft</b> movement as had never been found in Japan, and gave a helping hand to the industrialization of <b>craft</b> and design. Indeed, he settled in Takasaki for twenty-seven months, devoting himself to the development of a new <b>craft.</b> What was a tiny <b>craft</b> movement started in Takasaki, grew big under Taut's leadership, whose designs have had a great influence on the local <b>craft</b> here. It would be necessary for us to evaluate highly this <b>craft</b> movement in Takasaki, if we were to make a panorama of our modern design and <b>craft...</b>|$|R
