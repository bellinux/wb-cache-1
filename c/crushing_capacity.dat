40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Rail {{is said to have}} an almost unlimited capacity. The PRASA Technology Framework states that a rail corridor is able to carry 60 000 - 80 000 passengers per peak hour. This paper analyses the practical optimum capacity of metropolitan rail services: an Underground Metro, an All-Stop train, and an Express service. In a practical situation the capacity of rail systems seems to be limited to some 35 000 passengers/hr on one track per direction; only in crush situation the maximum capacity is approaching 50 000. It would need four tracks per direction over great part of a corridor, to accommodate almost 60 000 passengers/hr in a mix All-Stop and Express service, and 80 000 only as <b>crush</b> <b>capacity.</b> This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

40|$|Cone crushers {{are used}} in the mineral, mining, and {{aggregate}} industry for fragmentation of rock materials. Control systems for cone crusher settings are widely used to compensate for wear and to protect the machines. The eccentric speed in a cone crusher affects the number of compressions the material is exposed to and thus the particle size distribution of the product. Eccentric speed also affects <b>crusher</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, the speed of the crusher is mostly fixed, because speed changes must be made by shifting pulleys, a process which is quite time-consuming. By applying a frequency converter, which has decreased in cost during recent years, it has become possible to adjust the speed continuously. By also applying mass-flow sensors to the process, the crusher can be run optimally to yield the most sellable products in a given moment. Existing systems normally only protect the machine. The sensors can be mass-flow meters, e. g., conveyor-belt scales. To analyze data from the process and calculate the appropriate value for the speed, an algorithm has been developed. The developed algorithm was tested and evolved at a crushing plant for aggregates that produces around 350 kton a year. The algorithm was implemented in a computer that could communicate with the frequency controller, retrieve data from four mass-flow meters, and also interact with the operator. The computer was reachable over the Internet for the researchers at Chalmers and the algorithm was tuned and improved on-line. The result is a crushing stage that consistently and maximally produces the most desirable product. The performance (yield of required products) increased by 4 %.

40|$|African copper PLC’s {{flagship}} is {{the copper}} producing Mowana mine located 129 km from Francistown in the North-Eastern {{part of the}} Republic of Botswana. The processing operation at Mowana is a standard flotation plant designed to produce copper concentrates from oxide, supergene, and sulphide ores. The expected average output of 16. 2 tons per hour of copper concentrates has never been attained since plant commissioning. The major bottleneck has been established to be located around the crushing circuit of the Mowana production chain. The major hypotheses of this research are that performance in a crushing plant is adversely influenced by moderate and discrete changes in the process. The ultimate objective {{is to develop a}} dynamic process simulator, administered in Simulink/MATLAB® background, for application in the design of a control model utilising two crusher variables and a self-tuning control algorithm. In this research work, a process model describing the dynamic operation of an Osborn 57 S gyrasphere cone crusher is investigated. Modelling of the Mowana crushing circuit is carried out by combining the steady-state and dynamic components of the crushing equipment in the Simulink/Matlab® environment. Eccentric speed (ES) and closed-side setting (CSS) are amongst the important inputs to the models. The rest of the inputs (crusher power, crusher cavity level, federate, pulley diameters, liner wear measurement, number of teeth of the pinion and bevel gear) are extracted from the data collected across the Mowana mine crushing circuit. While it has been demonstrated that the crusher CSS is the most influential controllable parameter, it has also been demonstrated that <b>crusher</b> <b>capacity</b> and power can be used effectively to optimise the circuit. The use of crushing power and cavity level control is suitable for the crushing circuit since the crushers are running on a constant ES and the CSS is set and reset manually. The outcome of the study presents an insight into the optimization of the Mowana mine crushing circuit through the design of a self-tuning controller for the cone crusher and for prototyping, parameters of a PID controller were determined in the Simulink/MATLAB® environment. The simulation involved the optimisation of the control model {{as a function of the}} cavity level of and the power drawn by the cone crusher. A self-tuning control algorithm at PLC and SCADA level of control was then tested. This formed the simulations and training platform. The outcome of the simulations carried out in this research needs to be validated against the real Mowana crushing process control upgrade. This will then inform the modifications and recommended crusher motor resizing exercise to be implemented. Electrical and Mining EngineeringM. Tech. (Engineering: Electrical...|$|R
40|$|Cone crushers {{are used}} in the mineral, mining, and {{aggregate}} industry for fragmentation of rock materials, minerals and ores. Systems used for controlling the Closed Side Setting (CSS) on cone crushers, and thereby the size reduction, are widely used to compensate for wear of the manganese crushing liners and to protect the machines from overloads. With a frequency converter also the eccentric speed in a cone crusher can be adjusted in real-time in addition to the CSS. The eccentric speed affects the dynamic interaction between the rock material and the crusher liners. Especially the number of compressions the material is exposed to is affected and also the local compression of the rock material is affected, thus the particle-size distribution of the product. Eccentric speed also affects <b>crusher</b> <b>capacity.</b> Real-time feedback data on the sellable product streams can be obtained by applying mass-flow sensors to the process. The adjustment of these two online parameters in real-time can result in an increased potential for production yield; however, a nontrivial optimization problem with a large solution space also arises. As the feed material also varies, the optimal setting for the parameters varies in time. Herein, we report the development of a monitoring and control system including a two variable online algorithm for the selection of the setpoint for eccentric speed with respect to the current CSS. The different product yields from the crushing plant were monitored by mass-flow meters and continuously evaluated by a fitness function. A model for the outcome of the crushing stage, with the two parameters eccentric speed and CSS, was fitted mathematically to the measurement data. However, since the process varies continuously, due to the wear of crushers and screens and feed material variations, the performance landscape is also continuously varying. Therefore, an Evolutionary Operation (EVOP) approach was adopted, wherein the variations are instead used to continuously find an operating point closest to the optimal. The developed algorithm was tested and evolved at a crushing plant for aggregates that produces around 400, 000 tonnes aggregates per year. The algorithm was implemented in a computer that communicated with the frequency converter and retrieved data from ten mass-flow meters in the process. The operator was able to interact and supervise the system through a Human Machine Interface (HMI). The result is an algorithm that can determine the position and direction of a dynamic speed control to continuously improve the process-operation point. The magnitude of the improvement potential compared to a fixed speed operation is from 5 % to 20 %...|$|R
