It has been used the informations from the threefold overlaps of aerial stereoscopic pairs. The parallax measuring errors on forest areas are three times larger than on the arable and pasturelands. It has been shown that the third dimension can be used for the derivative of <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> profiles and their roughness and the rates of timber growth can be derived with sufficiently high accuracy from the repeatability flying...|$|E

The accuracy of psychological tests was required in potential review in order to predict future behavior. HR practitioners and psychologists showed appreciation and confidence in psychological tests. However, it had not been fully supported by empirical evidence regarding the accuracy of the tests for selecting employees.

40|$|The <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> is {{the centre}} of {{physiological}} activity which gives {{an indication of the}} potential photosynthetic capacity on a tree. Though, its measurement remains a challenge in forest inventory task. The ability to predict crown diameter from stump diameter provides an effective technique of obtaining its estimate. This helps in detecting the excessive tree felling than actual requirements and wildlife suitability. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop and test crown diameter prediction models for silvicultural management of naturally grown Parkia biglobosa within the University of Agriculture, Makurdi. Nine 100 m x 100 m temporary sample plots were established using simple random sampling method. Crown diameter and stump diameter were measured in all living P. biglobosa trees with stump diameter ≥ 10. 0 cm. Least square method was used to convert the counted stumps into harvested crown dimension. Three linear and three non-linear models using stump diameter as the exploratory variable were developed and evaluated using the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj. R 2), standard error of estimate (SEE), prediction error sum of squares (PRESS) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The crown-stump diameter relationship was best described by the double logarithmic function with. The result showed that Crown diameter estimation was feasible even when the only information available is stump diameter. The resulting equation was tested for validation with independent data obtained from additional plots and was found to be desirable for estimating the crown diameter for Parkia biglobosa in Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria. </p...|$|E

30|$|If {{remote sensing}} {{material}} {{was used as}} auxiliary data and a model-assisted or model-based framework was employed instead of e.g. simple random sampling, a larger plot size might be optimal (see e.g. Hofstadt et al. 2015). This is because we assume {{the correlation between the}} remote sensing data and plot data to be higher with larger plots due to e.g. co-registration errors. Moreover, remote sensing registers crowns rather than stems, and <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> included into the plot will often be partly outside the plot boundaries, and respectively the <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> not included into the plot will be partly inside the plot boundaries. Within larger plots, the effect <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> overlapping should be smaller. This also remains to be studied in the future.|$|R
500|$|The rainforests {{in which}} these animals live are seasonal, with two primary seasons: the hot, wet season (November through April), and the cool, dry season (May through October). The primary habitat for both species, at any season, is in the <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> where they spend the {{majority}} of their time [...] above ground. With the seasonal availability of resources being similar regardless of location, there is little to no difference in tree usage between species. From September through April, more fruit is available, so females prefer the lianas in the <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> Both sexes prefer the lower, major branches during the hot, rainy season. The tree crowns are predominantly used from May through August, when young leaves and flowers are in abundance.|$|R
50|$|Stems are green.

50|$|Excessive {{wildfire}} prevention {{disrupts the}} fire ecology. The stands are usually so densely populated that the trees self-thin, or out-compete each other, leaving dead trees standing.

5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. The moth flies over the <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|R

50|$|The scarlet myzomela is arboreal, {{foraging}} in the <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> darting from flower to flower, probing for nectar {{with its}} long curved bill.

50|$|Infected {{trees have}} {{abnormally}} small, yellow and sparse leaves which frequently fall prematurely. The <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> {{which have been}} infected for many years have many dead twigs and branches. Tarry or rusty spots may appear {{at the base of}} the trunk which are indicative of the death of the phloem caused by the P. alni invasion. The course of the disease is varied, with many trees dying rapidly once symptoms appear, however, others may deteriorate slowly over many years.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{evergreen}} shrub which grows as a vine {{if provided}} with support. As such it grows to 20 m, climbing {{by means of}} small rootlets on the stems, similar to ivy (an example of convergent evolution, as the two species are not related). Like ivy, {{it also has a}} sterile non-flowering juvenile climbing or creeping phase, which on reaching high enough into the <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> to get more light, develops into an adult, flowering phase without climbing rootlets.|$|R
50|$|This {{bark beetle}} feeds on the {{developing}} bark on {{and around the}} root <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> seedlings, especially the phloem. It also infests stumps, logs, and fallen trees. It prefers pines, and is a widespread pest of wild and cultivated Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) in particular. Other recorded host trees include silver fir (Abies alba), colonial pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), common larch (Larix decidua), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens).|$|R
50|$|The <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> a <b>tree</b> {{consists}} <b>of</b> {{the mass}} of foliage and branches growing outward from the trunk <b>of</b> the <b>tree.</b> The average crown spread is the average horizontal width <b>of</b> the <b>crown,</b> taken from dripline to dripline as one moves around the crown. Some listings will also list the maximum crown spread which represents the greatest width from dripline to dripline across the crown. Other crown measurements that are commonly taken include limb length, crown volume, and foliage density. Canopy mapping surveys the position and size {{of all of the}} limbs down to a certain size in the <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tree</b> and is commonly used when measuring the overall wood volume <b>of</b> a <b>tree.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tree mortality: In FORMIND, {{background}} {{mortality is}} generally calculated stochastically from a mean annual mortality rate. Alternatively, the model also allows calculating mortality {{as a function}} <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> size or stem diameter growth. In addition, trees compete for space. Crowded stands are thinned, i.e., mortality rate is increased if <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> overlap. If large trees die, they have a certain probability of falling over into neighboring patches, in which their crowns smash smaller trees and create canopy gaps. Thus, trees might die for various reasons (age, growth rate, space competition, tree fall damage). All individual tree mortalities are determined stochastically.|$|R

50|$|Anolis lizards {{are some}} of the best {{examples}} of both adaptive radiation and convergent evolution. Populations of lizards on isolated islands diverge to occupy separate ecological niches, mostly in terms of the location within the vegetation where they forage (such as in the <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> vs. the trunk vs. underlying shrubs). These divergences in habitat are accompanied by morphological changes primarily related to moving on the substrate diameter they most frequently encounter, with twig ecomorphs having short limbs, while trunk ecomorphs have long limbs.|$|R
