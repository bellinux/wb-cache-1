40|$|International audienceDesigning a claw-pole {{synchronous}} machine implies solving many 3 D nonlinear magnetostatic problems {{which makes the}} computation (CPU) time very long. In our model, the mesh is refined to reach the desired level of precision on global quantities such as torque. Since the airgap is very thin (around 0. 3 mm for a 100 mm diameter) and a Newton Raphson algorithm requires several iterations to converge, CPU time may be too high. Nowadays, many researches are ongoing to reduce the CPU time, while preserving an acceptable accuracy. One of the most efficient methods is permeance networks but this method is not suitable for complex geometries. Our main contribution {{is to use a}} permeance network in the areas where flux lines are easy to guess and to solve a 3 D FEM problem in complex geometry areas of the magnetic device: the <b>claw</b> <b>poles</b> and the air gap for example. Moreover, current sources belong to the permeance network model, so that there are no current sources in the 3 D FEM problem. Then, a 3 D scalar magnetic potential formulation can be used easily. The two classical magnetostatic formulations (magnetic scalar potential formulation (Um – hs) and vector potential formulation (a – j)) are presented in this paper. Then, the hybridization of 3 D FEM formulation and the permeance network, is presented. Numerical results are compared with experimental measurements and a good agreement is obtained while reducing the CPU time.

40|$|Based on the {{structure}} analysis of alternator poles, two closed die forging steps in one heat forming process of alternator poles were put forward, {{as well as the}} forming die system.

A 3 -D coupled thermo-mechanical finite element model was created. The billet deformation, metal flow and forming load were obtained. The results showed that a filling well forging without overlap defects could be obtained by this process, and that the forming load at the first step increased slowly, but the load increased sharply at the second step when the middle boss was filling completely by the former process. An improved process was put forward, which changed the flow mode in the second forging step; it can considerably reduce the final forging load...|$|R

40|$|As one of {{the main}} {{parasitic}} parameters in permanent magnet (PM) synchronous machines (PMSMs), cogging torque is the main component of the torque ripple, which has always been the handicap in the high-performance, low-speed drive systems. Over the last two decades, various methods have been proposed to decrease the cogging torque in both radial-flux and axial-flux PMSMs. Among these methods, stator slot skewing, stator tooth notching, permanent magnet (PM) skewing, PM shifting, and pole pairing are extensively investigated. However, little work has been done on reducing the cogging torque of the <b>claw</b> <b>pole</b> machine (CPM), whose cogging torque cannot be ignored. In this paper, the general methods that have been used to reduce the cogging torque in radial-flux and axial-flux PMSMs are developed and verified in a CPM with a soft magnetic composite (SMC) core. The 3 -D finite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the cogging torque and PM flux linkage per turn. By comparing different cogging torque reduction technologies, it can be found that the magnet step skewing and unequal <b>claw</b> <b>pole</b> width are very suitable for CPM...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} several structural factors and parameters involved {{in the design of}} <b>Claw</b> <b>Pole</b> Transvers Flux Permanent Magnet Machines (TFPMs) on their internal voltage. Knowing the influence of each factor is very important for an effective process of design and optimization for these machines. In this paper by using the complete design algorithm of <b>Claw</b> <b>Pole</b> TFPM, only one parameter is changed at a time and its influence on the internal voltage is analyzed. Output torque is also studied, because the internal voltage has effect on both the average and the ripple of output torque.
