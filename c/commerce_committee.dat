5|$|On May 4, 1999, {{following}} the Columbine High School massacre and increasing news media {{reports on the}} effects on violent films, games, and other media on society, the United States Senate <b>Commerce</b> <b>committee</b> held a hearing about Hollywood's marketing of films to youths.

5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign <b>Commerce</b> <b>Committee.</b> In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E

5|$|Heins recounts how the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{advocated}} for its associated organizations to add Parental Advisory warnings on labels of music albums {{as a way}} to advise parents about possible offensive content.
