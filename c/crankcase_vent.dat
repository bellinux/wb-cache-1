40|$|Exposures of {{occupants}} {{in school}} buses to on-road vehicle emissions, including emissions {{from the bus}} itself, can be substantially greater than those in outdoor settings. A dual tracer method was developed and applied to two school buses in Seattle in 2005 to quantify in-cabin fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) concentrations attributable to the buses' diesel engine tailpipe (DPMtp) and <b>crankcase</b> <b>vent</b> (PMck) emissions. The new method avoids the problem of differentiating bus emissions from chemically identical emissions of other vehicles by using a fuel-based organometallic iridium tracer for engine exhaust and by adding deuterated hexatriacontane to engine oil. Source testing results showed consistent PM:tracer ratios for the primary tracer {{for each type of}} emissions. Comparisons of the PM:tracer ratios indicated that there was a small amount of unburned lubricating oil emitted from the tailpipe; however, virtually no diesel fuel combustion products were found in the crankcase emissions. For the limited testing conducted here, although PMck emission rates (averages of 0. 028 and 0. 099 g/km for the two buses) were lower than those from the tailpipe (0. 18 and 0. 14 g/km), in-cabin PMck concentrations averaging 6. 8 microg/m 3 were higher than DPMtp (0. 91 microg/m 3 average). In-cabin DPMtp and PMck concentrations were significantly higher with bus windows closed (1. 4 and 12 microg/m 3, respectively) as compared with open (0. 44 and 1. 3 microg/m 3, respectively). For comparison, average closed- and open-window in-cabin total PM 2. 5 concentrations were 26 and 12 microg/m 3, respectively. Despite the relatively short in-cabin sampling times, very high sensitivities were achieved, with detection limits of 0. 002 microg/m 3 for DPMtp and 0. 05 microg/m 3 for PMc...|$|E
5000|$|After Bedard {{purchased}} the year-old Vega in California for $1,900, former Chevrolet engineer Doug Roe -- a Vega specialist -- {{told him to}} [...] "overfill it about a quart. [...] "When you run them over 5,000 rpm, all the oil stays up {{in the head and}} you'll wipe the bearings. And {{something has to be done}} with the <b>crankcase</b> <b>vents.</b> If you don't it'll pump all that oil into the intake." [...] Roe added that 215 degrees was normal and only above 230 degrees would the engine probably" [...] detonate.|$|R
40|$|At {{compressor}} stations, fugitive methane {{emissions from}} compressor piston rod packing and engine <b>crankcases</b> are <b>vented</b> {{directly into the}} atmosphere. In {{an effort to reduce}} compression station carbon footprint, this study evaluates the feasibility of combusting the methane emissions into carbon dioxide and thus reduce the global warming potential. This study focuses on running simulations to determine the methane reduction from rebreathing engine <b>crankcase</b> and compressor <b>vent</b> gases into the air intake of a large bore, natural gas, 2 -stroke engine. The methane reduction percentage is observed over a range of rebreathed gas mass flow rates, and rebreathed gas composition. It is extremely difficult to determine the composition of the engine blow-by gases in the crankcase, since the composition depends on a large variety of parameters. For this study, the emissions from the compressor was modeled as methane, and the emissions from the engine crankcase was modeled as products of combustion with a varying amount of methane concentrations. A sensitivity analysis was performed, and the observed pressure traces show that the engine performance is not affected by the addition of rebreathed gases. This insensitivity mainly results from the very small rebreathed flow rates compared to the air intake, and the adjustments made on engine parameters, boost pressure and fuel injection rate, to keep TER and the energy delivery rate the same. The simulations also showed that the net methane reduction percentage was approximately 52 %, no matter the study test conditions. It was discovered that the methane reduction depends on the trapping ratio of the engine; since these engines generally have trapping ratios around 50 %, the actual methane reduction tends to be small. A 52 % reduction rate is not desirable; the hope is to increase the reduction rate closer to 100 %. More importantly to note, a substantial amount of complexity would need to be added to a typical compressor station just to reduce methane emissions by 1 kg/hr. Thus, at present, the idea of rebreathing compressor and engine crank case gases for methane emission reduction is not feasible. Future studies should focus on routing the emissions to a 4 -stroke engine, a waste heat recovery system, or other combustion devices with higher trapping ratios...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The <b>crankcase</b> ventilation system <b>vents</b> to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air <b>vented</b> from the <b>crankcase</b> contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1967 Trans-Am {{campaign}} with the 4-Bbl induction system producing more horsepower than the competing auto makers' 8-Bbl systems, for 1968 Chevrolet developed a factory 'cross-ram' aluminum intake-manifold package using two Holley [...] mechanical secondary carburetors for Trans-Am racing. It was available only as off-road service parts purchased over the Chevrolet dealership parts counter. With the Chevrolet '140 1st-design off-road cam, the package increased a stock 302's horsepower from [...] to approximately [...] Chevrolet {{went so far}} as to carry the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system over to the cross-ram induction system to retain emissions compliance mandated for US-produced cars beginning in 1967, that also provided full-throttle <b>crankcase</b> pressure <b>venting</b> to the intake air to burn its vapors. Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing [...] with little more than the 8-Bbl induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the '754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models' cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner assembly ducted from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core. In 1969, factory Z/28's could be ordered with the ZL-1 aluminum-block 427 adaption of the 1967 L-88 427 Corvette cowl-induction 'ZL-2' hood available for both single and dual four-barrel induction systems that were sealed to the air cleaner base ensuring dense cooler, high-pressure, oxygen-laiden air from the center of the base of the windshield was supplied to the engine for combustion smoothness and maximum power production. Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.|$|R
