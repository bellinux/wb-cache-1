5|$|Selke {{retired in}} 1964 and was succeeded by Sam Pollock. Often named the best general manager in NHL history, Pollock led the Canadiens to nine Stanley Cup championships in his 14 {{years at the}} helm of the team. One of his key tactics was trading aging stars to {{expansion}} teams for draft picks, which led to the team drafting future Hall of Famers Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson and Ken Dryden. The Canadiens won consecutive titles in 1965 and 1966, and entered the 1967 Stanley Cup Final against Toronto as a heavy favourite. The City of Montreal was so confident in the Canadiens that they had already built a space for the Stanley <b>Cup</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Expo 67 site, but the Canadiens fell to the Maple Leafs, in the last NHL finals of the Original Six era.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord opened September with a 4–0 home win on {{the first}} day of the month against Roda JC. Four {{different}} Feyenoord players scored in the game; Vormer and Pellè in the first half and Nelom and Goossens after half time.

On 15 September Feyenoord played the second game of the month in Nijmegen against N.E.C., the game ended in a 3-all draw after a last-minute equalizer by Bruno Martins Indi. The club got their third win in four league matches on 22 September at home due to the lone goal in the 35th minute from Tonny Vilhena against FC Utrecht. After a bye in the first round, Feyenoord started the 2013–14 KNVB <b>Cup</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 26th at home against FC Dordrecht in the second round. They won the game 3–0; Pellè put the first goal on the board after 36 minutes, Schaken and Armenteros added a goal each to the scoreline in the second half. Feyenoord won the last match of September 4–2 at home against ADO Den Haag.

5|$|The first {{match in}} October {{was on the}} 4th; it was an away match at Parque de Jogos, Moreirense's home ground. Benfica won 4–1, which was their largest win all season. Camacho {{attributed}} the team's success to an improvement in the conversion rate of the attacking line. After a break for international matches, Benfica returned with the second leg of the UEFA <b>Cup</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 15th. They dominated the match, and only a strong performance from Silvio Proto allowed the Belgians to leave with only a goal conceded. Two days later, Benfica announced they were rescheduling the game against Marítimo from 25 October to 12 November, due to the opening game of the new Estádio da Luz on the same day. On 19 October, Benfica ended their six-month spell at Estádio Nacional with a match against Gil Vicente. Benfica scored first but Gil Vicente equalized three minutes later, unsettling the home side. In the second half, Simão scored the winning goal for Benfica. Camacho acknowledged that Benfica struggled after conceding Gil Vicente's goal, adding {{that it was a}} normal behaviour in football. On the 25th, Benfica opened its brand new Estádio da Luz, attracting a sell-out crowd against Nacional Montevideo. Benfica won 2–1, with Nuno Gomes scoring twice. On the following Wednesday, Benfica opened the redeveloped Estádio Cidade de Coimbra, in a game transferred from August. Simão put on a man of the match performance, leading the team to a 3–1 win to Académica.|$|E
