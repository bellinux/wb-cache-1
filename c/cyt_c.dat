It allows ATP synthase to use the flow of H+ through the enzyme back into the matrix to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. Complex I (NADH coenzyme Q reductase; labeled I) accepts electrons from the Krebs cycle electron carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and passes them to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone; labeled Q), which also receives electrons from complex II (succinate dehydrogenase; labeled II).

5000|$|VDAC {{has also}} been shown {{to play a role in}} apoptosis.During apoptosis, {{increased}} permeability of VDAC allows for the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c. Although <b>cyt.</b> <b>c</b> plays an essential role in oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondrion, in the cytosol it activates proteolytic enzymes called caspases, which play a major role in cell death. Although the mechanism for VDAC-facilitated <b>cyt.</b> <b>c</b> release has not yet been fully elucidated, some research suggests that oligomerization between individual subunits may create a large flexible pore through which <b>cyt.</b> <b>c</b> can pass. A more important factor is that release of <b>cyt</b> <b>c.</b> is also regulated by the Bcl-2 protein family: Bax interacts directly with VDAC to increase pore size and promote <b>cyt.</b> <b>c</b> release, while anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL produces the exact opposite effect. In fact, it has been shown that antibodies that inhibit VDAC also interfere with Bax-mediated <b>cyt.</b> <b>c</b> release in both isolated mitchondria and whole cells.

Cytochrome c is thought {{to play a role}} in apoptosis via the release of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria.A cardiolipin-specific oxygenase produces CL hydroperoxides which can result in the conformation change of the lipid.

40|$|Brief {{changes in}} the cytosolic and intra-organellar Ca 2  + {{concentration}} serve as specific signals for various physiological processes. In mesothelial cells lining the surface of internal organs and the walls of body cavities, a re-entry in the cell cycle (G₀–G₁ transition) evoked by serum re-administration induces long-lasting Ca 2  + oscillations with a slowly decreasing frequency. Individual mesothelial cells show {{a wide range of}} different oscillatory patterns within a single, supposedly homogenous cell population. Changes in the cytoplasmic Ca 2  + concentration (<b>c</b> <b>cyt)</b> show baseline oscillatory patterns i. e., discrete Ca 2  + transients starting from a constant basal <b>c</b> <b>cyt</b> level. The ER Ca 2  + concentration (c ER) displays a sawtooth wave at a semi-depleted ER state; the minimum level is reached just briefly after the maximal value for <b>c</b> <b>cyt.</b> These oscillations depend on plasmalemmal Ca 2  + influx and on the inositol trisphosphate concentration [InsP₃]; the Ca 2  + influx is a crucial determinant of the oscillation frequency. Partial blocking of SERCA pumps modifies the oscillation frequency in both directions, i. e. increasing it in some cells and lowering it in others. Current mathematical models for Ca 2  + oscillations mostly fail to reproduce two experimentally observed phenomena: the broad range of interspike intervals and constant basal <b>c</b> <b>cyt</b> levels between two Ca 2  + spikes. Here we developed a new model based on – and fitted to – Ca 2  + recordings of <b>c</b> <b>cyt</b> and <b>c</b> ER recorded in primary mouse mesothelial cells.

The overall increase in calcium triggers a massive release of <b>cyt</b> <b>c,</b> which then acts in the positive feedback loop to maintain ER calcium release through the IP3Rs. This explains how the ER calcium release can reach cytotoxic levels. This release of cytochrome c in turn activates caspase 9, a cysteine protease.

50|$|Pardaxin initiates caspase-dependent and caspase-independent {{apoptosis}} {{in human}} cervical carcinoma cells. Pardaxin triggers {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS). ROS production disrupts protein folding and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). This causes stress on the endoplasmic reticulum, which releases calcium. This leads {{to an increase in}} mitochondrial calcium, dropping its membrane potential. The pore permeability changes, and Cytochrome c (<b>Cyt</b> <b>c)</b> is released. <b>Cyt</b> <b>c</b> activates the caspase chain that leads to apoptosis. ROS also activates the JNK pathway. JNK is phosphorylated, which leads to the phosphorylation of AP-1 (transcription factor consisting of cFOS and Cjun). This results in the activation of caspases as well. ROS also causes a caspase independent pathway that results in apoptosis. When the mitochondrial membrane potential changes, apoptosis-inducing factors (AIFs) are also released. These trigger apoptosis when they enter the nucleus, not needing to involve caspases.|$|E

Chan et al., with the use of tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence as a probe, found no significant collapse of the protein on the submillisecond time scale following dissociation of CO from unfolded cyt c^(II).

Over time, the response to pigeon CYT becomes more specific for the foreign Ag through the recruitment of B cells expressing different combinations of V genes and, possibly, somatic mutation of the mouse CYT specific B cells from early in the response. Cross-recognition of pigeon CYT by mouse CYT-specific B cells results from the sharing of critical amino acid residues by the two Ags.

40|$|The {{calcium ion}} (Ca²⁺), a {{universal}} signaling molecule, is widely recognized {{to play a}} fundamental role in the regulation of various biological processes. Agonist–evoked Ca²⁺ signals often manifest as rhythmic changes in the cytosolic free Ca²⁺ concentration (<b>c</b> <b>cyt)</b> called Ca²⁺ oscillations. Stimuli intensity was found to be proportional to the oscillation frequency and the evoked down-steam cellular response. Stochastic receptor expression in individual cells in a cell population inevitably leads to individually different oscillation frequencies and individually different Ca²⁺-related cellular responses. However, in many organs, the neighboring cells have to overcome their individually different sensitivity and produce a synchronized response. Gap junctions are integral membrane structures that enable the direct cytoplasmic exchange of Ca²⁺ ions and InsP₃ molecules between neighboring cells. By simulations, we were able to demonstrate how the strength of intercellular gap junctional coupling in relation to stimulus intensity can modify the spatiotemporal patterns of Ca²⁺ signals and harmonize the Ca²⁺-related cellular responses via synchronization of oscillation frequency. We demonstrate that the most sensitive cells are the wave initiator cells and that a highly sensitive region {{plays an important role in}} the determination of the Ca²⁺ phase wave direction.

We hypothesize that ischemia disrupts Met 80 -Fe ligation of <b>cyt</b> <b>c,</b> forming pentacoordinated heme Fe 2 +, which inhibits electron transport (ET) and promotes oxygenase activity. MethodsSS- 20 (Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2) {{was used to}} demonstrate the role of Met 80 -Fe ligation in ischemia. Mitochondria were isolated from ischemic rat kidneys to determine sites of respiratory inhibition. Mitochondrial <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> and <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> Met-O were quantified by western blot, and cristae architecture was examined by electron microscopy.

Loss of <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> was associated with proteolytic degradation of OPA 1. Ischemia significantly inhibited ET initiated by direct reduction of <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> and coupled respiration.

Western blotting of key proteins revealed the apoptotic and autophagic potential of SCP- 0 - 1. Besides, SCP- 0 - 1 upregulated Bcl- 2 Associated X Protein (Bax) and downregulated B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) in the HepG 2 cells. The expression of caspase- 3, - 8, and - 9; poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); cytochrome <b>c</b> (<b>Cyt</b> C); tumor protein 53 (p 53); survivin; sequestosome 1 (p 62); microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain- 3 B (LC 3 B); mitogen-activated protein kinase p 38 (p 38); extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK); c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); protein kinase B (AKT); and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) were evaluated using Western blotting. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism through which SCP- 0 - 1 exerts its antiproliferative activity and induces mitochondrial apoptosis rather than autophagy. The induction of mitochondrial apoptosis was attributed to the inhibition of the Hsp 90 /AKT signalling pathway in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase-independent manner. The results also provide initial evidence on a molecular basis that SCP- 0 - 1 {{can be used as}} an anti-hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutic agent in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{cytochrome}} (CYT) P- 450 mixed-function oxidase (MFO) in the biotransformation of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was investigated, {{since in}} vivo interaction between this enzyme and chemical is very probable. HCB is a type I substrate with (Fe(2 ̆ 73 +)) CYT P- 450 isozymes present in untreated, b-naphthoflavone (BNF) and phenobarbital (PB) induced rat liver microsomes. HCB dependent and saturable type I binding titrations yield spectral dissociation constants (K(,s)) of 180 and 83 uM for the isozymes present in untreated and PB induced microsomes, respectively. Purified CYT P- 450 b, the major isozyme induced by PB, produces HCB dependent and saturable type I spectra with a K(,s) of 0. 38 uM. ^ CYT P- 450 mediated reductive dehalogenation occurs in microsomes and purified/reconstituted MFO systems and produces pentachlorobenzene (PCB) as the initial and major metabolite under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In microsomal reactions secondary metabolism of PCB occurs {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is produced only in aerobic reactions with PB induced microsomes with a concomitant decrease in PCB production. PCP is not detected in aerobic reactions with BNF induced microsomes, although PCB production is decreased compared to anaerobic conditions. A reaction scheme for the production of phenolic metabolities from PCB is deduced. ^ CYT P- 450 dependent and NADPH independent modes of PCB production occur with purified/reconstituted MFO systems and are consistent with dehalogenation pathways observed with microsomal experiments. The NADPH independent production of PCB requires native microsomal or purified MFO protein components and {{may be the result of}} nucleophilic displacement of a chlorine atom from HCB mediated or coupled with redox active functions (primary, secondary, tertiary and quarternary structures) of the proteins. CYT P- 450 dependent production of PCB from HCB is isozyme dependent: <b>CYT</b> P- 450 <b>c</b> = <b>CYT</b> P- 450 d 3 ̆e CYT P- 450 a 3 ̆e CYT 450 b. The low apparent specific activity may be due to non-optimal reconstitution conditions (e. g., isozyme choice and requirement of other microsomal elecron transport components) and secondary metabolism of PCB and the phenols derived from PCB. CYT P- 450 mediated dehalogenation may be catalyzed through attack, by the iron oxene (postulated intermediate of CYT P- 450 monooxygenations), at the chlorines of HCB instead of the aromatic nucleus.

40|$|An early {{event in}} the {{induction}} of apoptosis is cytochrome c (<b>Cyt</b> <b>c)</b> release from mitochondria.

40|$|The final interprotein {{electron}} transfer (ET) in the mammalian respiratory chain, from cytochrome c (<b>Cyt</b> <b>c)</b> to cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is investigated by 1 H- 15 N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectral analysis. The chemical shift perturbation in isotope-labeled <b>Cyt</b> <b>c</b> induced by addition of unlabeled CcO {{indicates that the}} hydrophobic heme periphery and adjacent hydrophobic amino acid residues of <b>Cyt</b> <b>c</b> dominantly contribute to the complex formation, whereas charged residues near the hydrophobic core refine the orientation of <b>Cyt</b> <b>c</b> to provide well controlled ET. Upon oxidation of <b>Cyt</b> <b>c,</b> the specific line broadening of N-H signals disappeared and high field 1 H chemical shifts of the N-terminal helix were observed, suggesting that the interactions of the N-terminal helix with CcO are reduced by steric constraint in oxidized <b>Cyt</b> <b>c,</b> while the chemical shift perturbations in the C-terminal helix indicate notable interactions of oxidized <b>Cyt</b> <b>c</b> with CcO.

40|$|Colletotrichum 屬真菌可引起多種作物之炭疽病，其中亦包含草莓及芒果，除影響水果商品價值外，亦是縮短櫥架壽命的主要原因。本研究自台灣中南部草莓及芒果的主要產區，由罹病葉片及果實上分離到炭疽病菌共 105 株，經形態學與分子鑑定後得知，其中 3 株菌株屬於 C. acutautm，其餘 102 株均屬於 C. gloeosporioides。另以 Strobilurin (QoI) 類殺菌劑中的克收欣 (Kresoxim- methyl) 、亞托敏 (Azoxystrobin) 、三氟敏 (Trifloxystrobin) 及百克敏 (Pyraclostrobin) 對所有菌株進行感受性測試，結果顯示百克敏於 10 ppm 時即能有效抑制芒果及草莓炭疽病菌之菌絲生長，而在 500 ppm 有效濃度下，克收欣對供試菌株之平均抑制率為 45. 0 %，亞托敏與三氟敏則分別為 44. 6 % 與 46. 1 %。前人研究指出，cytochrome b 基因中第 143 密碼子處發生點突變為主要控制 QoIs 抗藥性產生的機制，然本研究對台灣芒果及草莓炭疽病菌菌株之 cyt b 基因片段進行分析後發現第 143 密碼子位置並無突變現象產生，顯示 143 位置並非影響台灣芒果及草莓炭疽病菌對 QoIs 產生抗性的主要原因。此外，於含有 100 ppm 亞托敏原體之 PDA 培養基中添加 SHAM (Salicyhydroxamic acid) 抑制 {{alternative}} oxidase 之活性，亦無法有效提升亞托敏的殺菌效果，顯示 {{alternative pathway}} respiration 並非引起抗藥性產生的機制。另分析 <b>cyt</b> b 基因結果中顯示，分離自芒果、草莓、柑橘、山藥及蕃薯等作物之 <b>C.</b> gloeosporioides 菌株，皆在第 144 與 145 密碼子位置間出現了核苷酸缺失 (deletion) 的現象，造成第 144 密碼子後的胺基酸發生改變，推測此現象可能為影響菌株抗性之原因。本研究選取來自不同地區的 30 株芒果及草莓炭疽病菌進行苯丙咪唑系 (Benzimidazoles) 藥劑感受性測試，並觀察 QoIs 與 Benzimidazoles 藥劑間是否具有交互抗性 (cross-resistance) 之現象。結果顯示，有 12 株供試菌株對免賴得 (benomyl) 、腐絕 (Thiabendazole) 及貝芬替 (Carbendazim) 具有抗藥性，其餘 18 株菌株則在 1 ppm 有效濃度處理下即明顯受藥劑所抑制，得知目前台灣芒果與草莓炭疽病菌之抗藥性菌株與感受性菌株同時存在於田間。此外，觀察供試菌株對 QoIs 與 Benzimidazoles 藥劑之抗感性反應，得知台灣芒果與草莓炭疽病菌對此兩類殺菌劑已有交互抗性現象產生。而在菌株抗 Benzimidazole 類藥劑之機制方面，於分析 β-tubulin 基因片段後確定抗藥性菌株在第 198 密碼子位置發生由GAG (Gly) 置換成 GCG (Ala) 的點突變，然未發現菌株在第 200 密碼子的位置發生改變，顯示台灣芒果炭疽病菌對苯丙咪唑類藥劑之抗藥性產生導因於β-tubulin 基因上第 198 密碼子的改變。為能快速診斷出抗 Benzimidazole 類藥劑的炭疽病菌，本研究針對β-tubulin 基因設計專一性引子對 TubGF 1 與 TubGR，並利用 PCR-RFLP 方法對 50 株供試菌株進行分子檢測，並配合觀察其對 Benzimidazoles 藥劑的抗感性反應，結果顯示所設計的專一性引子對配合 PCR-RFLP 可正確診斷田間芒果及草莓的炭疽病菌株對Benzimidazoles 藥劑是否具抗藥性。Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp., including mango and strawberry, {{is an important}} crops disease throughout the world. Anthracnose is one of factor to reduce economic worth and time of post-harvest of fruits. A total of 105 Colletotrichum isolates obtained from infected fruits and leaves of strawberry and mango in main production area. Based on morphological and molecular characteristics, three C. acutatum and 102 C. gloeosporioides isolates were identified. For compaŠnng sensitivities to strobilurins (QoIs), all C. gloeosporioides isolates were examined sensitivities to four QoIs, kresoxim- methyl, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin at 1, 10, 100 and 500 ppm (a. i.) by mycelial growth. Pyraclostrobin was highly efficacy to inhibit mycelial growth of all C. gloeosporioides isolates at 10 ppm (a. i.). Contrary to pyraclostrobin, kresoxim- methyl, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin only showed 45. 0 %, 44. 6 % and 46. 1 % mycelial growth inhibition rate at 500 ppm (a. i.), respectively. Previous studies indicated that the mutation at codon 143 in cytochrome b gene (cyt b) is the principal action of QoIs-resistant fungal pathogen. However, the QoIs-resistant isolates of C. gloeosporioides obtained from mango and strawberry did not be found the mutation at codon 143 of cyt b. The result indicated that the mutation at codon 143 of cyt b is not available character to increase the resistance of C. gloeosporioides isolates from mango and strawberry to QoIs in Taiwan. Moreover, the azoxystrobin did not raise the inhibiting efficacy of C. gloeosporioides isolates at salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) added PDA medium. Thus, alternative pathway respiration did not {{play an important role}} for C. gloeosporioides isolates enhanced resistance to QoIs. Interestingly, the nucleotide deletion of cyt b between codon 144 and 145 was detected among C. gloeosporioides isolates from mango, strawberry, orange, yam and sweet potato. The result suggests that the nucleotide deletion may change the protein structure of cyt b and enhance the resistance of C. gloeosporioides isolates to QoIs in Taiwan. In this study, thirty C. gloeosporioides isolates obtained from mango and strawberry were tested the sensitivities to benzimidazole fungicides, benomyl, thiabendazole and carbendazim. Results showed that mycelial growth of 18 C. gloeosporioides isolates were significantly inhibited at 1 ppm (a. i.) and 12 C. gloeosporioides isolates were resistant to those three benzimidazoles. Thus, the benzimidazoles-sensitive and -resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates were simultaneously existed in the field at Taiwan. Moreover, the positive cross-resistance among benzimidazoles on C. gloeosporioides isolates was existence, and the negative cross-resistance between benzimidazoles and QoIs were detected on some C. gloeosporioides isolates. For the benzimidazoles-resistant mechanism analysis, the resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates showed point mutation at codon 198 in β-tubulin gene and the amino acid was substituted glycine (Gly) to alanine (Ala). While, the codon 200, caused the moderately resistant to benzimidazoles, did not be detected among all C. gloeosporioides isolates. The results suggest that the mutation at codon 198 in β-tubulin gene is major mechanism of benzimidazoles-resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates in Taiwan. Consequently, the specific primers of TubGF 1 and TubGR were designed to amplify partial β-tubulin gene, including codon 198, and used PCR-RFLP method to detect the benzimidazoles -resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates in field. According to the result, this method could be rapidly and precisely to diagnose benzimidazoles-resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates obtained from mango and strawberry in Taiwan. 中文摘要 英文摘要 前言……………………………………………… 1 材料方法……………………………………………………………………………… 7 一、炭疽病菌株的蒐集與鑑定……………………………………………… 7 (一) 供試菌株來源………………………………………………………… 7 (二) 病原菌鑑定…………………………………………………………… 7 1. 形態學鑑定……………………………………………………… 7 2. 利用 ITS rDNA 鑑定炭疽病菌……………………………… 7 (1) 總 DNA之萃取與純化…………………………………… 7 (2) 利用 ITS 4 與專一性引子 (specific primer) 鑑定炭疽菌種 類………………………………………………………… 8 二、殺菌劑對炭疽病菌菌絲生長抑制測試………………………………… 8 (一) 對Strobilurin (QoI) 類殺菌劑的抗感性測試……………………… 8 (二) 對Benzimidazole 類殺菌劑的抗感性測試…………………… 9 三、抗藥性產生機制的探討 ……………………………………………… 10 (一) Cytochrome b基因突變與 QoIs 低感受性菌株的關係……… 10 1.

40|$|Proximal tubular {{cytochrome}} c efflux: Determinant, {{and potential}} marker, of mitochondrial injury. BackgroundCytochrome c (<b>cyt</b> <b>c)</b> is released from mitochondria after tissue injury, but {{little is known}} of its subsequent fate. This study was undertaken to ascertain: (1) does <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> readily {{gain access to the}} extracellular space; (2) if so, what are some determinants of this process; and (3) might <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> release be a potentially useful marker of in vivo tissue damage. MethodsIsolated mouse proximal tubules (PT) were subjected to site 1 (rotenone; Rot), site 2 (antimycin A, AA), or site 3 (hypoxic) respiratory chain blockade (± 2 mmol/L glycine, to prevent plasma membrane disruption/cell death). Alternatively, oxidant injury was imposed (Fe 2 + or cholesterol oxidase). Extra- and intracellular <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> levels were quantified by Western blot. Plasma or urine <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> levels were also determined after rhabdomyolysis or ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) (in mice), or clinical ARF. ResultsAA, Rot, and hypoxia caused variable degrees of PT <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> release (AA > rot ≈ hypoxia), but at most, < 20 % of total cell content was involved. In contrast, Fe 2 + evoked ∼ 65 % <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> efflux, and cholesterol oxidation caused ∼ 100 % <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> release. Glycine did not block <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> efflux, dissociating this process from plasma membrane disruption/necrotic cell death. After rhabdomyolysis, plasma <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> levels rose and correlated with the severity of ARF (r, 0. 93 vs. BUNs). <b>Cyt</b> <b>c</b> was detected in urine after both experimental and clinical ARF. ConclusionCell <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> release is dependent on the site and the type of mitochondrial injury sustained. Oxidative injury, in general, and cholesterol oxidation, in particular, seem particularly relevant in this regard. After mitochondrial release, <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> traverses plasma membranes, eventuating in the extracellular space. The data suggest that plasma and/or urine <b>cyt</b> <b>c</b> appearance might function as a clinically useful in vivo marker of mitochondrial stress and the tissue injury sustained...|$|E
