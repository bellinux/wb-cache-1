25|$|Dairy {{products}} are often pasteurized during production to kill pathogenic bacteria and other microbes. Butter made from pasteurized fresh cream is called sweet cream butter. Production of sweet cream butter first became {{common in the}} 19th century, {{with the development of}} refrigeration and the mechanical <b>cream</b> <b>separator.</b> Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is called raw cream butter. While butter made from pasteurized cream may keep for several months, raw cream butter has a shelf life of roughly ten days.|$|E

25|$|The {{third major}} {{industry}} in West Chester {{in the late}} 1800s was the Sharples Separator Works. Philip M. Sharples built a shop in April 1881 and built many different things made out of wood or metal such as farm machinery and steam engines. He began manufacturing cream separators in 1883, which became his most profitable product. In 1889, he {{moved into a new}} factory on Maple Avenue that eventually employed 600 workers and produced 3,700 cream separators annually. After being sued in 1893, Sharples acquired a patent for his <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> in 1897. Sharples added innovations like electric lighting, fire alarms, and steam whistles and helped transform West Chester into a major industrial hub. By the 1900 census, West Chester's population had expanded to 9,524 and was the largest town in Chester County with approximately 10 percent of its population.|$|E

25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of butter was made by hand, on farms. The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval. This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the butter produced in the United States was factory made; Europe followed suit shortly after.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, {{clotted cream}} {{was created by}} {{straining}} fresh cow's milk, letting it stand in a shallow pan in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream {{to rise to the}} surface, then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling. The clots that formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a reamer or raimer. [...] By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, which produced far more clotted cream than the traditional method from the same amount of milk. As a farmer's wife in Poundsgate said, [...] "the separator saves a whole cow!" ...|$|E

50|$|In the Pialba {{district}} in the 1890s <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> were too expensive for individual farmers to buy, {{and as a result}} a creamery opened at Aalborg (named after the town in Denmark, now known as Nikenbah). Creameries separated the cream from milk, so the cream could then be sent to a butter factory, and the farmers could take the remaining skim milk home to feed to their calves or pigs. Due to this process pig farming became a common adjunct to dairy farming. In 1901 a butter factory opened at Maryborough and Pialba farmers were able to buy their own <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> from the factory, on credit against future payments for their cream.|$|R

Every tree had been cut down. The house was so unsheltered, so battered by the wind, so bleakly thrust out into the harsh clearing, that Carol shivered.

6000|$|... "And withal {{it is very}} simple, David. The {{earth was}} once a nebulous mass. It cooled, and as it cooled it shrank. At length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon its outer surface--a sort of shell; but within it was {{partially}} molten matter and highly expanded gases. As it continued to cool, what happened? Centrifugal force burled the particles of the nebulous center toward the crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state. You have seen the same principle practically applied in the modern <b>cream</b> <b>separator.</b> Presently {{there was only a}} small super-heated core of gaseous matter remaining within a huge vacant interior left by the contraction of the cooling gases. The equal attraction of the solid crust from all directions maintained this luminous core in the exact center of the hollow globe.

Equally to every part of this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light and torrid heat.|$|E

50|$|From the 1870s Gustaf de Laval (1845-1913) {{developed}} {{machines for}} the dairy industry, {{including the first}} centrifugal milk-cream separator and early milking machines. His first separator was patented in 1887, and his first milking machine in 1894. From the early 1880s, De Laval's <b>cream</b> <b>separator,</b> was promoted internationally. For example, the London-based Dairy Supply Co presented the <b>cream</b> <b>separator</b> at the 1891 Dairy Show in London.In 1883, DeLaval and Oscar Lamm founded Aktiebolaget Separator (abbreviated to AB Separator) in Stockholm, Sweden. In the first year the company built 53 milk separators, of which 37 were exported. In 1888 in the US the company founded the De Laval <b>Cream</b> <b>Separator</b> Co. as a subsidiary, with a sales office in New York and production facility in Poughkeepsie, New York.

50|$|Dairy {{products}} have long formed {{the backbone of}} Ireland's agricultural sector. In the early 19th century, the country was amongst the world's largest producers of dairy products. In 1848, Ireland accounted for two thirds of butter imports into the port of London. Irish butter came under pressure by competitors which were modernising their systems with the newly developed <b>cream</b> <b>separators.</b> As a consequence, Irish butter imports to London dropped to under one per cent in the early 1880s.|$|R
50|$|The {{centrifugal}} separator was first manufactured by Gustaf de Laval, {{making it possible}} to separate cream from milk faster and more easily, without having to let the milk sit for a time, and risk it turning sour. Possibly because Gustaf de Laval manufactured the first <b>cream</b> <b>separators,</b> many people credit the invention to de Laval. However, many patents appear before his, all of them labelled as 'improvements'. One of the first specifically for cream separation was patented by W. C. L. Lefeldt and C. G. O. Lentsch.|$|R

40|$|Citation: Waldraven, Luther Watts. A {{comparative}} test of centrifugal <b>cream</b> <b>separators.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1900. Introduction: During {{the month of}} March, 1900, {{a series of tests}} were made of two centrifugal <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> in use at the dairy school of the Kansas State Agricultural College. The object of the tests was primarily, to determine the amount of power required to operate each separator. A secondary object was to make a more general comparison of the two machines, comparing the capacities, skim-milk tests, etc. Each machine was installed by its manufacturer. Both separators were in good order, and care was taken to test both under as nearly the same conditions as possible. The power used was measured by a Flather hydraulic transmission dynamometer, which was carefully inspected and calibrated in the College Engineering Laboratory. The constant of the dynamometer was accurately computed, which constant, multiplied by the reading of the pressure-gauge, and by the number of revolutions per minute, gave the horse-power transmitted at the instant the readings were taken. The skim-milk tests were by the Babcock test, and were made by the dairy students in charge. Owing {{to the fact that the}} students were not thoroughly familiar with the work, several of the skim-milk tests were lost, and some are incorrect...|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{mechanical}} <b>cream</b> <b>separators</b> in Australia in the 1880s, the Babcock butterfat {{test in the}} 1890s, government grading of butter {{and the start of}} refrigerated shipping from Brisbane in 1884 also helped to encourage dairying. In addition, the spread of Queensland's railway network meant that some cream could be easily transported to butter factories and butter could be carried from the factories to ports for export. A further impetus for dairying was the Co-operative movement, where producers held shares in the enterprises that processed and sold their product.|$|R
