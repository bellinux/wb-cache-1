The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.Chambered doctor blade systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{very first}} DocuTech system, {{known as the}} DocuTech Production Publisher was {{announced}} on October 2, 1990. Its 135 page-per minute, black and white, xerographic print engine and attached finisher module were largely based on ones previously developed for the Xerox 5090 Duplicator system (announced by Xerox in 1988). However, image generation in the DocuTech was performed using a digitally driven, dual-beam, Laser ROS (Raster Output Scanner) {{rather than by the}} light-lens optics and exposure lamps found in the [...] "analog" [...] 5090 system. The system's scanner module allowed document scanning in a number of modes including manually from the platen or automatically using a 23 page-per-minute recirculating document feeder. The scanner also had a semi-automatic side feeder which could be used to scan large originals and computer fan-fold (CFF) input. The entire system was controlled by an electronic sub-system (ESS) of a proprietary Xerox design. The ESS incorporated a large number of Xerox proprietary Mesa processors which were specifically designed for high-speed image processing, 32 MegaBytes of RAM, I/O control interfaces for communicating with the Printer and Scanner modules, as well as 3 disk drives which <b>contained</b> <b>system</b> software and space for storing images (including those for saved jobs).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Transgenic {{plants are}} {{promising}} alternatives for the low-cost and safe pathogen-free production of complex recombinant pharmaceutical proteins (molecular farming). Plants as higher eukaryotes perform posttranslational modifications {{similar to those}} of mammalian cells. How-ever, plant-specific protein N-glycosylation was shown to be immunogenic, a fact that represents a drawback for many plant systems in biopharmaceutical production.

It is grown in the predominant haploid gametophytic stage as tissue suspen-sion cultures in photobioreactors. Efficient secretory signals and a transient transfection system allow the secretion of freshly synthesized proteins to the surrounding medium. The key advantage of Physcomitrella compared to other plant systems is the feasibility of targeted gene replacements. By this means, moss strains with non-immunogenic humanized glycan patterns were created. Here we present an overview of the relevant aspects for establishing moss as a production system for recombinant biopharmaceuticals...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} system for {{continuing}} surveillance of viral pathogens circulating in large human populations.

The technology for concentrating virions from 100 -L volumes was developed previously at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the means for purifying and concentrating virions from volumes in microliters have been developed recently. At the same time, marine virologists have developed efficient methods for concentrating, amplifying, and sequencing complex viral mixtures obtained from the ocean. Given this existing technology base, we believe an integrated, automated, and <b>contained</b> <b>system</b> for surveillance of the human "virome" can be implemented within 1 to 2 years.

40|$|The Oyster Restoration Program {{alongside}} the New Hampshire {{chapter of the}} Nature Conservancy is working towards developing new oyster beds throughout the Great Bay. Sedimentation {{is proving to be}} a vast problem by covering up the beds before {{they have a chance to}} grow to a healthy level. The many rivers entering the Great Bay are bringing the sediments from all over the region and limiting the ability of the program to develop the new beds. They need a way to measure the sedimentation rate, by measuring the flow rate of the rivers over a single tidal cycle in various locations throughout the bay. This is done simply by the design of a wireless water flow meter network. Using a Price Meter as the measurement tool and an Arduino UNO to organize the data, the Oyster Restoration Program can monitor the characteristics of the locations to gain a better understanding of the location as a potential site for a new oyster bed. The design of an self <b>contained</b> <b>system</b> to extract and store the data to be collected is essential to speed up the process of monitoring these locations, which the device developed here will do...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{electrification}} {{has long}} been top on the development agenda of many developing countries. Nevertheless, {{a vast majority of}} the population in these countries is still in the darkness. The proportion of rural population in the Sub-Saharan Africa that has an access to electricity is, for instance, as low as 4 %. Electric energy (electric light in particular) is still a luxury enjoyed only by a few in Ethiopia. The rate of electrification in the country is 10 % and for rural Ethiopia it is almost nil (less than 1 %!). There are 922 towns having more than 2000 households. The population living in these towns makes up only 15 % the total. The remaining 85 % live in scattered rural villages and have very remote chance to get electricity through the national grid. The only realistic approach to electrify the rural houses seems therefore to be the stand-alone (self <b>contained)</b> <b>system.</b> At present, diesel generation sets are popular and well known in the country. Renewable sources of energy like hydropower and solar energy are, on the other hand, less familiar and their contribution to electrification is minimal...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a self <b>contained</b> <b>system</b> {{consisting of a}} portable platform and a disposable LabCard capable of performing a nucleic acid concentration, amplification, and detection. The LabCard comprises several inlets and outlets, integrated microvalves, two chambers and stored reagents. In the first chamber it is performed a magnetic beads-based DNA concentration, washing and elution. Then, the eluted DNA is transferred to the second chamber where it rehydrates with the pre-stored reagents. Finally, a real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) takes place and the fluorescence signal is recorded and displayed in real time. The magnetic bead protocol allows the LabCard to process {{a wide range of}} sample volumes (from 10 μl to 10 ml). The PCR reagents are stored inside the LabCard using a gelification technique allowing: (i) long-term storage of the LabCards, (ii) reduction of the reagent volumes, and (iii) significant simplification of the LabCard design and user operation. The cross contamination is avoided by making the LabCard disposable. On the other hand, the platform has been conceived as a comprehensive and generic solution able to perform a wide range of biological assays. These assays consist in an automated and programmable sequence of sample preparation phases followed by a DNA amplification and detection phase...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a detailed {{investigation of the}} evolution of methyl bromide concentrations, degradation rates, and ventilation rates for 26 days in a naturally contained, warm-core eddy of the North Atlantic Ocean. This is the first study of the oceanic cycling of methyl bromide in a natural, <b>contained</b> <b>system</b> with a complete suite of supporting measurements of physical and chemical variables. Methyl bromide concentrations in the mixed layer ranged from 2. 3 to 4. 2 nmol m− 3, degradation rates ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 9 nmol m− 3  d− 1, net sea-to-air exchange rates ranged from 0 to 0. 5 nmol m− 3  d− 1, and net loss rates through the thermocline were less than 0. 1 nmol m− 3  d− 1. From a mass balance for methyl bromide in the mixed layer, we calculated production rates ranging from < 0. 1 to 1. 3 nmol m− 3  d− 1. The median of this range, 0. 48 nmol m− 3  d− 1, is higher than the ∼ 0. 15 nmol m− 3  d− 1  necessary to maintain the reported global oceanic emission of 56 Gg yr− 1. This is reasonable, because our study area was supersaturated in methyl bromide, whereas the ocean as a whole is undersaturated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{successful}} {{development of}} odour-baited trapping systems for mosquitoes {{depends on the}} identification of behaviourally active semiochemicals, besides the design and operating principles of such devices. A large variety of 'attractants' has been identified in laboratory investigations, yet few of these increase trap catches in the field. A <b>contained</b> <b>system,</b> intermediate between the laboratory and open field, is presented and previous reports that human foot odour induces behavioural responses of Anopheles gambiae confirmed. Methods The response of 3 – 5 day old female An. gambiae towards odour-baited counterflow geometry traps (MM-X model; American Biophysics Corp., RI) was studied in semi-field (screen house) conditions in western Kenya. Traps were baited with human foot odour (collected on socks), carbon dioxide (CO 2, 500 ml min - 1), ammonia (NH 3), 1 -octen- 3 -ol, or various combinations thereof. Trap catches were log (x+ 1) transformed and subjected to Latin square analysis of variance procedures. Results Apart from 1 -octen- 3 -ol, all odour baits caused significant (P 2, which increased catches of these odours alone by 3. 8 and 2. 7 times, respectively. Conclusion These results {{are the first to}} report behavioural responses of an African malaria vector to human foot odour outside the laboratory, and further investigation of fractions and/or individual chemical components of this odour complex are called for. Semi-field systems offer the prospect of high-throughput screening of candidate kairomones, which may expedite the development of efficient trap-bait systems for this and other African mosquito species. </p...|$|E
