40|$|The disbondment of {{protective}} organic coatings under excessive cathodic protection potentials {{is a widely}} reported coating failure mechanism. Traditional methods of evaluating <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> are based on ex situ visual inspection of coated metal surfaces after being exposed to standard <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> testing conditions {{for a long period}} of time. Although electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed as an effective means of evaluating various anti-corrosion properties of organic coatings; its application for assessing the <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> resistance of coatings has not been sufficiently exploited. This paper reports an experimental study aimed at developing EIS into a tool for in situ measurement and monitoring of <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> of coatings. A clear correlation between EIS parameters and the disbonded coating areas has been confirmed upon short term exposure of epoxy-coated steel electrodes to <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> conditions; however the degree of this correlation was found to decrease with the extension of exposure duration. This observation suggests that EIS loses its sensitivity with the propagation of coating disbondment, and that in order to achieve quantitative determination of the coating <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> localized EIS measurements are required to measure the parameters related to local disbonded areas...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Steel {{pipelines}} {{are susceptible}} to corrosion {{by the action of}} corrosive substance in the environment {{and one of the most}} common failure modes in buried pipeline coating is <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment.</b> Consequently, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to assess the effect of three important parameters, the thickness of coating, the artificial defect and electrolyte type, on <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment,</b> according to ASTM G 8. Experiments were done in 3. 5 % wt NaCl, KCl and CaCl 2 solutions at room temperature with different coating thicknesses (354, 483 and 1014 μm) and several artificial defects diameters (3, 6 and 9 mm). Immersion time was 28 days and during this period, a- 1. 5 V cathodic potential (vs. SCE) was applied. Further, the EIS measurements were done in Open Circuit Potential (OCP). Investigations showed that a thick polyurethane coating was highly resistant to <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> in intact areas and that coating thickness increases caused decreases in the rate of <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> in areas with defects. On the other hand, the evaluation on artificial defects showed disputable results, though with no logical correlations between artificial defects ’ diameters and any disbonded area individually. In addition, assessment on electrolyte type showed the rate of cathodic disbonding might be classified after two parameters...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to achieving the ambitious goal of cost effectively extending the safe operation life of energy pipeline to 100 {{years is the}} application of health monitoring and life prediction tools {{that are able to}} provide both long-term remnant pipeline life prediction and in-situ pipeline condition monitoring. A critical step is the enhancement of technological capabilities that are required for understanding and quantifying the effects of key factors influencing buried steel pipeline corrosion and environmentally assisted materials degradation, and the development of condition monitoring technologies that are able to provide in-situ monitoring and site-specific warning of pipeline damage. This paper provides an overview of our current research aimed at developing new sensors and electrochemical cells for monitoring, categorising and quantifying the level and nature of external pipeline and coating damages under the combined effects of various inter-related variables and processes such as localised corrosion, coating cracking and <b>disbondment,</b> <b>cathodic</b> shielding, transit loss of cathodic protection...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} to achieving the ambitious goal of cost effectively extending the safe operation life of energy pipelines to, for instance, 100 {{years is the}} application of structural health monitoring and life prediction tools {{that are able to}} provide long-term remnant pipeline life prediction and in-situ pipeline condition monitoring. A critical step in pipeline structural health monitoring is the enhancement of technological capabilities that are required for quantifying the effects of key factors influencing buried pipeline corrosion and environmentally assisted materials degradation, and the development of condition monitoring technologies that are able to provide in-situ monitoring and site-specific warning of pipeline damage. This paper provides an overview of our current research aimed at developing new sensors for monitoring, categorising and quantifying the level and nature of external pipeline and coating damages under the combined effects of various inter-related variables and processes such as localised corrosion, coating damage and <b>disbondment,</b> <b>cathodic</b> shielding. The concept of in-situ monitoring and site-specific warning of pipeline corrosion is illustrated by a case of monitoring localised corrosion under disbonded coatings using a new corrosion monitoring probe. A basic principle that underpins the use of sensors to monitor localised corrosion has been presented: Localised corrosion and coating failure are not an accidental occurrence, it occurs as the result of fundamental thermodynamic instability of a metal exposed to a specific environment. Therefore corrosion and coating disbondment occurring on a pipeline will also occur on a sensor made of the same material and exposed to the same pipeline condition. Although the exact location of localised corrosion or coating disbondment could be difficult to pinpoint along the length of a buried pipeline, the ‘worst-case scenario’ and high risk pipeline sections and sites are predictable. Sensors can be embedded at these strategic sites to collect data that contain ‘predictor features’ signifying the occurrence of localised corrosion, CP failure, coating disbondment and degradation. Information from these sensors will enable pipeline owners to prioritise site survey and inspection operations, and to develop maintenance strategy to manage aged pipelines, rather than replace them...|$|R
40|$|The disbondment of {{protective}} organic coatings {{is a widely}} reported pipeline coating failure mode in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Traditional methods of evaluating <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> of pipeline coatings are based on visual inspection of pipeline conditions, and laboratory testing of <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> resistance (CDR) using standard methods such as ASTM G 8. Although some other laboratory-based techniques, such as scanning kelvin probe and scanning acoustic microscopy have been used to study the <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> (CD) of coatings, these are often difficult to apply in practical testing. Over the past decade, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed as a potential method for measuring CD. This paper reports preliminary results from an EIS study designed to characterise CD behaviour of epoxy coatings under excessive cathodic protection. EIS data correlated well with the area of disbonded coating. Analysis of EIS data can provide valuable information on the initiation and rates of CD...|$|E
40|$|Thermal sprayed {{ethylene}} {{methacrylic acid}} (EMAA) and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) coatings were evaluated for corrosion protection in a biochemical process to treat geothermal residues. Coupon, Atlas cell, peel strength and <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> tests were performed in aggressive environments including geothermal sludge, hypersaline brine and sulfur oxidizing bacteria (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans) to determine coating suitability for protecting storage tanks and reaction vessels. It {{was found that}} the polymers were resistant to chemical attack and biodegradation at the test temperature of 55 °C. The EMAA coatings protected 316 L stainless steel from corrosion in coupon tests. However, corrosion of mild steel substrates coated with EMAA and ETFE occurred in Atlas cell tests that simulated a lined reactor operating environment and this resulted in decreased adhesive strength. Peel tests revealed that failure mode was dependent on exposure conditions. <b>Cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> tests in brine at room temperature indicated that EMAA coatings are resistant to disbondment at applied potentials of - 780 to - 1070 mV SCE for the test conditions and duration...|$|E
40|$|Reliable testing methodologies for the {{assessment}} of protective coatings are critical for ensuring the integrity and durability of pipeline coatings (such as field joint coatings) and the mitigation of pipeline corrosion. Currently the failure of joint coatings {{is one of the major}} concerns in corrosion protection of pipelines, although they represent only approximately 5 % of the coated area in a pipeline system. This paper presents an overview of major testing methodologies currently used in the pipeline industry for the selection, testing, and life prediction of coatings, in particular field joint coatings. Particular focus is on the discussion of difficulties and limitations in testing methods for assessing pipeline coating cracking, <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> and loss of adhesion. It is shown that there are limitations in current methodologies in evaluating the coating flexibility - a key parameter for avoiding coatings cracking during hydrostatic testing, cyclic pressure operation and field bending. Methodologies for assessing the effect of holidays in coatings on the <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> of pipeline coating under excessively negative cathodic protection (CP) voltages also require improvement. Furthermore, methods for understanding the effects of coating wet adhesion on pipeline coating, cracking and disbondment also need attention. Some preliminary results for addressing some of these issues are also presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemically}} integrated multi-electrode array {{has been}} used for monitoring and visualizing the <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> of defective coatings by measuring local electrochemical impedance. Compared with the conventional electrochemical impedance and local current measurement approaches, this new approach significantly enhances the sensitivity of detecting the propagation of coating disbondment by eliminating the effects of the dominating low impedance regions, such as those that arise at coating defects, and thus increases the visibility of higher impedance regions deep in the disbonded coating. Furthermore, it facilitates the probing of electrode processes and mechanisms in selected local electrode regions. <br /...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there are}} many {{reported}} cases of corrosion failure in cement concrete pipelines. In majority of cases, the failures {{have been attributed to}} rebar corrosion which is caused by the permeability of chloride from low resistivity soil and subsequent attack on passive layer on iron bar in the structure. As a possible alternative to cementitious materials, some organic coatings based on olefin, vinyl or epoxy-based polymers have been considered. However, due to paucity of data on the behavior of these coatings in aqueous media particularly product water, the possibility of their application in water transmission systems in the Kingdom has not been fully exploited. This paper deals with the studies carried out on the corrosion and mechanical behavior of fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) coating on steel in aqueous media which include product water, distilled water and saline water. The mechanical testings on coating include adhesion, bending and <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> testings. The corrosion studies include immersion testing under static and dynamic conditions, autoclave tests and accelerated (salt-fog) tests. The analysis of results indicates chemical inertness of FBE coating in either of the aforementioned water used during testing, good adhesion and no damage to the coating during bending. <b>Cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> tests indicate that FBE coating sustains under cathodic protection (CP) conditions. In general, the results of mechanical and corrosion tests indicate that FBE is a promising material for internal coating on steel in water transmission systems...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> (CD) {{of organic}} {{coatings}} is a continual problem in applications of cathodically protected steel in civil infrastructure and petrochemical production and transportation. Multiple researchers {{have proposed that}} the degree of disbondment is a function of factors such as service temperature, coating thickness and applied cathodic potential. While the mechanism by which disbondment occurs has received a fair amount of attention, efforts to develop new material coating systems to resist the disbondment of organic coatings on cathodically protected metal substrates has been lacking. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a new coating system to protect metal substrates under cathodic protection, such as buried pipelines. Pipeline coatings must be tough, durable, resistant to chemical and moisture diffusion, and maintain adhesion in wet environments. A reactive ethylene terpolymer (RET) was compound blended with standard high- density polyethylene (HDPE) as a potential coating material for steel. The HDPE component provides toughness and high chemical and moisture resistance, while the RET component provides high polarity and reactivity, which enhance adhesion to steel substrates. Micro- and nanocomposite approaches were taken to incorporate multi- walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to provide increased cohesive strength while inorganic particles (clay, talc, and zinc) micro-scale fillers and organically-modified nanoclays were explored to reduce diffusion pathways through the polymer coatings. The <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> performance of the various blend and composite coatings are presented and analytical models developed to predict long-term durability of the coatings in corrosive environment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cathodic</b> <b>Disbondment</b> (CD) of commercially {{available}} polymeric coatings {{has been investigated}} usinga truncated version of the ASTM standard G 8 - 96; one thermoplastic, unfilled polyamide and two thermosetting, filled epoxy based coating systems of two different thicknesses each were studied. For the purpose comparison, delamination tests were performed on all the coatings using a standard Vickers indenter with a 40 kg weight. The truncated version of the CD test was shown {{to be effective in}} evaluating the adhesive properties of the coatings. It was observed that the surface preparations applied to the substrate, before coating was deposited complicated the analysis of the CD test results. Overall, a good agreement was observed between the CD and the delamination indentation tests and the coating systems have been ranked based on their performance in these test methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{blending}} two different materials with a medium density polyethylene {{for use as}} pipe coatings is presented. The influence of such blending on properties such as <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> (CD) and wet adhesion on steel is investigated. The components blended include a functionalised polyethylene (PE) containing the polar functionality, maleic anhydride (MAH) and an amorphous elastomer, ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM). It was found that modification of PE with small amount (2. 5 – 3 wt%) of either blended MAH-g-PE or EPDM resulted in a significant improvement in CD performance and wet adhesion strength. The mode of failure and disbondment mechanism was investigated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The greater resistance of migration of sodium ions increases with the incorporation of the modifiers, and it is proposed that this results {{in an increase in}} CD performance. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} is to obtain alkyd resins using recycled poly (ethylene terephthalate), PET, and different vegetable oils. Glycolysis of PET waste using pentaerytheritol (PEr) was used to produce suitable hydroxyl oligomers, GPEr, for alkyd resin. The glycolysis {{was carried out in}} the presence of manganese acetate as a catalyst and m-cresol as a solvent at 220 o C. Alkyd resins were prepared using phthalic anhydride, PET waste, glycerin, sunflower oil or linseed oil and ethylene glycol to produce PET-based alkyd resin. GPEr was used instead of PRT waste to produce the second type of alkyd resin based on GPEr. The reactions were carried out in the presence of butylhydroxytin oxide as a catalyst to prepare alkyd resins. The curing characteristics of the resins produced were investigated. Corrosion resistivity based on salt spray and <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> were evaluated for the cured alkyd as organic coating for carbon steel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> (CD) {{performance}} {{of a range of}} modified polyethylenes (PE) compression molded on to steel plates at 320 [degrees]C is reported. Adhesion strength was measured by the 90 [degrees] peel test and good dry adhesion strength was obtained for all modified polyethylene materials and blends, {{as well as for the}} neat polymer. It is shown that dry bond strength does not correlate with CD performance. Initial results of wet peel tests of samples in various concentrations of NaOH are presented where it is observed that for samples with improved wet adhesion strength, CD performance was also Improved. Surface polarity was determined from contact angle measurements, and it is shown that increased surface polarity of the coating was not the only determinant for improved CD performance. Inorganic fillers such as talc were also found to improve CD performance by changing the bulk properties, with little measurable change in polarity. Some mechanistic aspects of CD performance are also discussed. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Carbon steel samples {{coated with}} a base-coat of AMC 4302 and a top-coat of AMC 3201 passed both the <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> (ASTM G 42) and the {{galvanic}} corrosion tests in simulated saline environments. The porosity levels determined in coatings applied using the ArcMelt® Company AMC 3201 / 4302 system is less than 5 %. There {{was no evidence of}} apparent permeation of the saline solution through the coating thickness and no effect on the coating/base metal interface bonding. The coating system, however, failed the crevice corrosion test due to the microclimate generated under the fictitious crevice imposed on the coating surface as specified in the ASTM G 78 Standard test protocol. Crevice corrosion seems to have been related to the preferential dissolution of the metal matrix in both the top and the base coat under the acidic crevice microclimate with the predominant formation of Cr-chlorides and Ni-chlorides in the top and base coat, respectively. Delamination of the coating resulted from hydrogen evolution once th...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} of mild steel reinforcement {{offered by a}} newly developed epoxy based coating system containing inherently conducting polyaniline {{as one of the}} pigments has been studied. The synthesis of polyaniline and preparation of epoxy based coating system containing this polyaniline are described here. The corrosion resistant property of epoxy polyaniline system, coated on mild steel was evaluated by various techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potential time studies, <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> test, anodic polarization study, salt spray test and chemical resistance test. The corrosion resistance of epoxy polyaniline coating system coated on reinforcement bars embedded in concrete was also studied by an accelerated time to cracking study. The formation of polyaniline was characterized using FTIR, UV, GPC, particle size analyzer and fineness studies. Electrochemical impedance studies reveal that the resistance of the coating decreased initially and then increased due to passivating ability of the polyaniline pigment. Based on the results of different techniques, it is found that epoxy coating with polyaniline pigment is effective in corrosion {{protection of}} steel in concrete environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of hydrosoluble species, mainly chlorides and sulphates, at the metal/paint interface promotes osmotic blistering of the coating and underfilm metallic corrosion when {{the concentration of}} the soluble salts exceeds a critical level due to the accelerated entrance of water to the interface. Loss of adhesion and <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> can be also consequences of the {{presence of}} soluble salts. These processes can lead to the deterioration of the paint system in {{a very short period of}} time. However, since the interface is not easily accessible by experiment, not much is known about interfacial structure, reactions and the processes causing degradation. Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) is an ideal tool for the in situ monitoring of the degradation processes at the buried interface. On the other hand, for an in-depth understanding it is important that the superposition of the effects of all different parameters involved can be disentangled. Hence, it is important to design experiments focussing on individual aspects of the complex system. A study of the fundamental aspects of the stability of the contaminated buried steel/coating interfaces, specially focused on the initial stages of blistering and underfilm corrosion, has been carried out. Results of the characterization study performed with a height-regulated SKP (HR-SKP) on surfaces contaminated at the interface by different salt concentrations with well defined crystal size and distribution are shown.

40|$|A {{thermoplastic}} adhesive bonding process {{was developed for}} galvanized steel to polypropylene (PP) composite using a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) based adhesive with a total process cycle of less than 120 seconds. The processing temperature significantly affected the strength of adhesive bonded lap joints. Cataplasma and cyclic moisture/temperature aging tests demonstrated that the hot-dipped galvanized steel with a polyester melamine based primer did not improve the joint durability of galvanized steel to PP composite bonded with this HDPE based adhesive. The significant loss in the adhesion of the primer to galvanized steel under Cataplasma environment {{was due to the}} blistering of the primer. The blistering was essentially a process of the <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment.</b> ^ The fracture performance of HDPE based adhesive bonded double cantilever beam (DCB) aluminum joints was investigated. The fracture toughness, 1. 77 kJ/m 2, of the joints with a bondline thickness of 0. 2 mm at a testing crosshead speed of 5. 08 mm/minute, derived from beam theory equation, was significantly different from fracture toughness, 2. 54 kJ/m 2, obtained by cohesive zone model (CZM) approach, in which Needleman 2 ̆ 7 s modified exponential traction-separation law was employed. The large amount of deformation occurring in adhesive ahead of the crack tip significantly contributes the fracture toughness of joints. A modified equation was proposed to compute the fracture toughness of the adhesive bonded DCB joints. ^ The mechanical properties of the adhesive bonded DCB joints are strongly rate-dependent due to the viscoelasticity of the adhesive layer. A new rate-dependent cohesive zone model was developed to analyze the rate-dependent fracture behavior. The model consists of a rate-independent cohesive zone model in parallel to a Maxwell element. The numerical simulations were in good agreement with the experimental data for various testing crosshead speeds and for a relaxation test. A generalized rate-dependent CZM was suggested. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{delamination}} of two commercially important, but {{markedly different}} polymer coatings from cathodically protected mild steel has been investigated. The {{conditions of the}} steel surface prior to coating, {{the nature of the}} metal-to-polymer bonding, and the failure of the coating as a result of lap shear tests has also been studied. The major analytical technique employed throughout the work was X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The nature of polybutadiene-to-steel adhesion has been investigated by XPS in conjunction with a novel oxide stripping/argon ion bombardment technique for interface analysis. It is concluded that the interface is more correctly described as an. interphase zone, characterised by the presence of divalent iron. The locus of failure of polybutadiene coated steel has been determined for mechanical and cathodic delamination. Cohesive failure of the polymer occurred in the former case but when polarised cathodically failure occurs in two stages; the interphase segregating with either the coating or the substrate. Reduction of the substrate oxide was observed and its relevance to the <b>cathodic</b> <b>disbondment</b> of organic coatings is discussed. The kinetics of delamination of a powder sprayed epoxy coating have been investigated for a series of substrate pretreatments. In the early stages of delamination the disbondment rate varies logarithmically with time but soon approximates to a linear dependence which decreases as interfacial path length increases. The concept of a critical disbondment velocity for the epoxy/iron oxide system is proposed and model calculations indicate that a pH of about 11 is required within the disbondment crevice to sustain this failure rate. Surface analyses have shown that although failure mechanism is essentially invariant with surface treatment; as path length increases so does the proportion of cohesive failure of the oxide. A comprehensive mechanism for epoxy delamination, in the light of both kinetic studies and interface analyses is proposed...|$|E
