5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|Botanical gardens {{must find}} a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> the need for peace and seclusion, {{while at the same}} time {{satisfying}} the public need for information and visitor services that include restaurants, information centres and sales areas that bring with them rubbish, noise, and hyperactivity. Attractive landscaping and planting design sometimes compete with scientific interests— with science now often taking second place. Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Toronto's midtown {{area was}} {{starting}} to experience growth. There was a public debate about the two schemes between the two chairmen and the municipalities that made up Metropolitan Toronto. The extension of the Yonge line along University Avenue, and the east-west Bloor–Danforth line extension were authorized on September 5, 1958 by the Ontario Municipal Board which sought a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> the involved communities.|$|E

5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> increasing bending strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of coral kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony coral is a sort of <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> the two.|$|E
5|$|The private Cloud Club {{formerly}} {{occupied the}} 66th through 68th floors. It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite. Its creation was spurred by Texaco's wish {{for a proper}} restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|Democratic {{rule was}} {{restored}} in 1983, and Duhalde ran {{for mayor of}} Lomas de Zamora. Being a centrist, the PJ appointed him candidate as a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> the internal opposing factions. The elections ended in a technical tie with the candidate of the Radical Civic Union (UCR), Horacio Devoy; Duhalde won by just 700 votes. There was a tie in the elections for the local legislature as well, as both the PJ and UCR got eleven legislators. Duhalde reported that a colonel sought his support for a possible coup against the newly elected president Raúl Alfonsín. Duhalde refused and reported directly to Alfonsín himself. He was elected national deputy in 1987, and became {{vice president of the}} Argentine Chamber of Deputies. He established a commission to fight drug addiction during his term of office.|$|E
5|$|East Midwood was {{organized}} in 1924 by Jacob R. Schwartz, a dentist who {{was concerned that}} his two sons had no nearby Hebrew school which they could attend. From the start his intention had been to create a Conservative synagogue: Conservative Judaism {{was seen as a}} <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> Orthodox and Reform, providing the familiar (and lengthy) Hebrew services of Orthodox Judaism, but, like Reform, adding some English prayers. East Midwood differed from earlier Ashkenazi synagogues in New York, as services were to be conducted in Hebrew and English only (not Hebrew and Yiddish), and the members were to come from immigrants from all over Europe, not just one city or region.|$|E
40|$|The {{extraction}} of brightness temperature maps from scanning radiometer data {{is described as}} a typical linear inverse problem. Spatial quantization and parameter estimation is described and is suggested as an advantageous approach to a solution. Since this approach takes into explicit account the multivariate nature of the problem, it permits an accurate determination of the most detailed resolution extractable from the data as well as explicitly defining the possible <b>compromises</b> <b>between</b> accuracy and resolution. To illustrate the usefulness of the method described for algorithm design and accuracy prediction, it was applied to the problem of providing brightness temperature maps during the NOSS flight segment. The most detained possible resolution was determined and a curve which displays the possible <b>compromises</b> <b>between</b> accuracy and resolution was provided...|$|R

50|$|It {{should be}} noticed that CCA, as an {{iterative}} learning algorithm, actually starts with focus on large distances (like the Sammon algorithm), then gradually change focus to small distances.

5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament {{building}} to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E

Her only major deployment came in 1897–1898 when she joined an international naval demonstration to protest the Greek annexation of Crete; the demonstration ultimately forced a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> the Greeks and Ottomans. In 1900, she was withdrawn from active duty and used as a harbor defense ship. From 1912 to 1919, she was used by the High Seas Fleet as a target ship; she was sold for scrapping in 1919 and broken up that year.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} bout of illness subsided, Augustus {{gave up his}} consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul {{would be in the}} years 5 and 2BC, both times to {{introduce}} his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU was {{internally}} divided when it purged Communists {{from its}} leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it {{decided whether to}} defend alleged Communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about {{the threat posed by}} Communists, and tried to establish a <b>compromise</b> <b>between</b> the two extremes. This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.|$|E
