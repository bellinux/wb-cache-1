500|$|Intense {{glaciation}} {{has taken}} place at Level Mountain in the last 5.33 million years, {{as shown by the}} presence of strongly developed glacial grooves reaching elevations over [...] This evidence indicates that much of the massif was covered by ice during past glacial periods, with the latest glacial period ending approximately 12,000 years ago. A series of U-shaped valleys have been carved into the stratovolcano by radially directed alpine glaciers. These serve as a radial drainage for at least six small streams; Dudidontu, Kakuchuya, Beatty, Lost, Kaha and Little Tahltan. Those that flow from the Level Mountain Range drain across the lava plateau in a pinwheel-like fashion. Two streams, Kakuchuya and Dudidontu, contain a series of small lakes. The Kakuchuya and Beatty creek valleys have been eroded to a level below that of the plateau surface. Also dissecting the massif are V-shaped stream canyons along the lava plateau margin, exposing a section of Tertiary basalts along the Grand Canyon of the Stikine. Periglacial processes, such as <b>cryoturbation</b> and stone stripping, occur on Level Mountain at elevations greater than [...] <b>Cryoturbation</b> takes place mainly on flat and gently sloping areas while stone stripping happens primarily on gently sloping areas adjacent to peaks of the Level Mountain Range.

40|$|Lake high-stand sediments {{are found}} in three onshore {{terraces}} at Lake Donggi Cona, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and reveal characteristics of hydrological changes on lake shorelines triggered by climate change, geomorphological processes, and neo-tectonic movements. The terraces consist of fluvial–alluvial to littoral lacustrine facies. End-member modeling of grain-size distributions allowed quantification of sediment transport processes and relative lake levels during times of deposition. Radiocarbon dating revealed higher than modern lake levels during the early and mid Holocene. Lake levels follow the trend of Asian monsoon dynamics, and are modified by local non-climatic drivers. Site-specific impacts explain fluctuations during the initial lake-level rise ~ 11 cal ka BP. Maximum lake extension reached ~ 9. 2 cal ka BP, at ~ 16. 5 m above present lake level (a. p. l. l.). Littoral and lacustrine sediment deposition paused during a phase of fluvial activity and post-depositional <b>cryoturbations</b> at ~ 8. 5 cal ka BP, when the lake level fell to ~ 8 m a. p. l. l. After a second maximum at ~ 7. 5 cal ka BP, lake level declined slightly at ~ 6. 8 cal ka BP, probably due to a non-climatic pulse that caused lake opening. The level remained high until a transition towards drier conditions ~ 4. 7 cal ka BP. Though discontinuous, high-stand sediments provide a unique, high-resolution archive...|$|R
500|$|A {{variety of}} soil types with differing {{physical}} properties are found at Level Mountain. Shallow, coarse, textured, steep to strongly sloping soils dominate {{peaks of the}} Level Mountain Range and owe their origin to weathering of volcanic bedrock. These well drained soils are strongly acidic and xeric in nature and show little or no horizon development. The gently undulating alpine portions of Level Mountain {{have been affected by}} <b>cryoturbation,</b> resulting in patterned ground in which coarse material has been separated from each other as patches or stripes. Surface horizons are strongly to very strongly acidic, becoming medium to slightly acidic approximately [...] in depth. At lower elevations, soils develop on fluvio-glacial deposits. Many of these fluvio-glacial materials contain a high percentage of fine materials while the soils which have developed from them contain a subsurface horizon enriched by clay accumulation. Very poorly drained organic soils are extensive on the southern portion of the lava plateau.|$|E
2500|$|The Llanquihue {{glaciation}} {{takes its}} name from Llanquihue Lake in southern Chile which is a fan-shaped piedmont glacial lake. On the lake's western shores there are large moraine systems of which the innermost belong to the last glacial period. Llanquihue Lake's varves are a node point in southern Chile's varve geochronology. During the last glacial maximum the Patagonian Ice Sheet extended over the Andes from about 35°S to Tierra del Fuego at 55°S. The western part appears to have been very active, with wet basal conditions, while the eastern part was cold based. Cryogenic features like ice wedges, patterned ground, pingos, rock glaciers, palsas, soil <b>cryoturbation,</b> [...] solifluction deposits developed in unglaciated extra-Andean Patagonia during the Last Glaciation. However, not all these reported features have been verified. The area west of Llanquihue Lake was ice-free during the LGM, and had sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by Nothofagus. Valdivian temperate rainforest was reduced to scattered remnants in the western side of the Andes.|$|E
50|$|The second process {{responsible}} for storing carbon is <b>cryoturbation,</b> {{the mixing of}} soil due to freeze-thaw cycles. <b>Cryoturbation</b> moves carbon from the surface to depths within the soil profile.

When <b>cryoturbation</b> and the deposition of sediments act together, carbon storage rates increase.|$|E
40|$|This paper accompanies a {{map that}} shows the extent of {{permafrost}} in the Northern Hemisphere between 25 and 17 thousand years ago. The map is based upon existing archival data, common throughout the Northern Hemisphere, that include ice-wedge pseudomorphs, sand wedges and large <b>cryoturbations.</b> Where possible, a distinction is made between areas with continuous permafrost and areas where permafrost is either spatially discontinuous or sporadic. The associated mean annual palaeo-temperatures that are inferred {{on the basis of}} present-day analogues increase understanding of the possible changes in permafrost extent that might accompany current global warming trends. Areas with relict permafrost and areas that were formerly exposed due to lower sea level (submarine permafrost) are also mapped. Mapping is mostly limited to lowland regions (areas approximately < 1000 m a. s. l.). Striking features that appear from the map are (i) the narrow permafrost zone in North America, which contrasts with the broader LPM permafrost zone in Eurasia (that may be related to different snow thickness or vegetation cover), (ii) the zonal extent of former LPM permafrost (that may reflect sea-ice distribution), which contrasts with the present-day pattern of permafrost extent (especially in Eurasia) and (iii) the relatively narrow zones of LPM discontinuous permafrost (that may indicate strong temperature gradients). © 2014 Collegium Boreas.

50|$|In gelisols (permafrost soils), <b>cryoturbation</b> (frost churning) {{refers to}} the mixing of {{materials}} from various horizons of the soil down to the bedrock due to freezing and thawing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryoturbation</b> {{occurs to}} varying degrees in most gelisols. The cause of <b>cryoturbation</b> lies {{in the way in}} which the {{repeated}} freezing of the soil during autumn causes the formation of ice wedges at the most easily erodible parts of the parent rock. If the parent rock is hard, this can cause quite deep erosion of the rock over many years. As this process continues, during the summer when an active layer forms in the soil this eroded material can easily move both from the soil surface downward and from the permafrost table upward.|$|E

5000|$|Orthels: soils {{that show}} {{little or no}} <b>cryoturbation</b> (less {{than one-third of the}} depth of the active layer). Patterned ground (except for polygons) {{generally}} is lacking. Orthels occur primarily within the zone of discontinuous permafrost, and in alpine areas.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cryoturbation</b> is the {{dominant}} force operating in the active layer, and tends to make it generally uniform in composition throughout.

5000|$|Frost boils (also {{known as}} mud boils, frost scars and mud circles) are upwellings of mud that occur through frost heave and <b>cryoturbation</b> in {{permafrost}} areas, such as arctic and alpine regions.

50|$|Soil mixing (pedoturbation) {{is often}} an {{important}} factor in soil formation. Pedoturbation includes churning clays, <b>cryoturbation,</b> and bioturbation. Types of bioturbation include faunal pedoturbation (animal burrowing), floral pedoturbation (root growth, tree-uprootings), and fungal pedoturbation (mycelia growth). Pedoturbation transforms soils through destratification, mixing, and sorting, as well as creating preferential flow paths for soil gas and infiltrating water. The zone of active bioturbation is termed the soil biomantle.|$|E
50|$|Soils {{which are}} in most ways similar to Mollisols but contain either {{continuous}} or discontinuous permafrost and are consequently affected by <b>cryoturbation</b> are common in the high mountain plateaux of Tibet and the Andean altiplano.

They commonly contain tongues of mineral and organic horizons, organic and mineral intrusions and oriented rock fragments. Organic matter is accumulated on top of the permafrost and ice wedges are a common features. Turbels occur primarily in the zone of continuous permafrost.|$|E
50|$|Polygonal bogs (Polygonmoore) are {{widespread}} on the Arctic and sub-Arctic {{plains of}} Sibiria and North Americas and cover vast areas. They {{are associated with}} patterned peatland and ice wedges. A scanty layer of peat-forming vegetation can occur in the inner honeycomb-shaped areas of this frost pattern terrain (<b>cryoturbation)</b> and are fed during the short summers with sufficient moisture, because the meltwater is prevented from draining away by the raised polygonal margins. The peat layers can attain a thickness of 0.3 to 1 metre.|$|E
50|$|Hummock {{excavation}} normally {{reveals a}} disturbed soil profile, often with irregular streaks {{of organic matter}} or other colorations suggesting fluidity at some time past. The disturbance, a form of <b>cryoturbation</b> often extends to a depth roughly equal to the hummock’s height. This has been explained by some {{as the result of}} convection processes whereby warmer soil and water at depth expands, becomes less dense and rises, while gravity forces denser soil downwards. Circulation has also been explained as driven solely by density of soil material, not temperature induced density changes.|$|E

50|$|Soils, in general, are {{the largest}} {{reservoirs}} of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. This is also true for soils in the Arctic that are underlain by permafrost. Determining carbon stocks in cryosols, that is, soils containing permafrost within two meters of the soil surface, was completed using the Northern and Mid Latitudes Soil Database. Permafrost affected soils cover nearly 9% of the earth’s land area, yet store between 25 and 50% of the soil organic carbon. These estimates show that permafrost soils are an important carbon pool.
