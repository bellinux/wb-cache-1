50|$|Removable dental {{prostheses}} (mainly dentures) are {{considered by some}} to be a form of indirect dental restoration, as they are made to replace missing teeth. There are numerous types of precision attachments (also known as combined restorations) to aid removable prosthetic attachment to teeth, including magnets, <b>clips,</b> <b>hooks</b> and implants which could be seen as a form of dental restoration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{overhand}} loop is {{a simple}} knot which forms a fixed loop in a rope. Made by tying an overhand knot in the bight, it can be tied anywhere along a rope (does not need any working end). The knot {{can be used for}} attaching <b>clips,</b> <b>hooks,</b> other rope, etc., but has the disadvantage that it is likely to jam tight when the rope has been pulled and the knot may need to be cut off. It also has some uses in kite-flying, though other knots may be better. It is commonly disapproved by the Boy Scouts because of its tendency to be misused {{as an alternative to the}} bowline. (Reference 1 also contains a sequence of images that show how to tie an overhand knot.) ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{multimeter}} can use {{many different}} test probes {{to connect to}} the circuit or device under test. Crocodile <b>clips,</b> retractable <b>hook</b> <b>clips,</b> and pointed probes are the three most common types. Tweezer probes are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance surface-mount devices. The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while benchtop meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today. [...] Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.|$|R
5000|$|In the Season 1 pilot, Gypsy {{managed to}} uncoil herself, {{revealing}} {{that she was}} at least fifty feet long. Joel explained that he just kept making her longer and longer compulsively when he built her (comparing it to, [...] "When you start connecting paper <b>clips,</b> you get <b>hooked</b> on it...").|$|R
50|$|A clip strip {{refers to}} a trademarked brand of retail {{merchandising}} display strips manufactured by the Clip Strip Corporation located in Hackensack, NJ. The Clip Strip is a retail product display, so named {{because it is a}} length of material (either plastic or metal) with <b>clips</b> and/or <b>hooks</b> at regular intervals, upon which merchandise is displayed. It was invented by Edward Spitaletta in 1979. The term Clip Strip is a trademark of Clip Strip Corporation and the term merchandising strip refers to its actual functionality. Rival competitive products sold such as Ishida's Hang-Strips offer similar features.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "pre-tied", or more commonly, the clip-on, necktie is a {{permanently}} knotted four-in-hand or bow tie affixed by a <b>clip</b> or <b>hook,</b> {{most often}} metal and sometimes hinged, to the shirt front {{without the aid}} of a band around a shirt collar; these ties are close relatives of banded pre-tied ties that make use of a collar band and a hook and eye to secure them. The clip-on tie sees use with children, and in occupations where a traditional necktie might pose a safety hazard, e.g., law enforcement, mechanical equipment operators etc. (see [...] below).|$|R
50|$|AUI used a {{full-sized}} 15-pin D connector (model DA-15) {{that used}} a sliding clip for mechanical connections {{in place of}} thumbscrews. AAUI replaced these with a small 14-position, 0.05-inch-spaced ribbon contact connector. The connector may {{have been changed to}} avoid confusion with the monitor port on early Macintoshes, which also used a 15-pin D connector. The connector was locked into position using two <b>clips</b> or <b>hooks</b> {{on the sides of the}} connector outside of the D shell (where screws often are on D subs) which automatically clicked on when plugged in, and could be removed simply by pulling back on a sliding sheath over the body of the connector, disengaging the hooks. Third-party AAUI devices often omitted this sheath, requiring the user to directly squeeze small tabs on the sides of the plug housing to detach the hooks.|$|R
5000|$|Store {{and forward}} {{networks}} predate {{the use of}} computers. Point-to-point teleprinter equipment was used to send messages which were stored at the receiving end on punched paper tape at a relay center. A human operator at the center removed the message tape from the receiving machine, read the addressing information, and then sent it toward its destination on appropriate outbound point-to-point teleprinter link. If the outbound link was in use, the operator placed the message in tape in a physical queue, usually consisting {{of a set of}} <b>clips</b> or <b>hooks.</b> A major relay center in the mid 1900s might have dozens of inbound and outbound teleprinters, scores of operators, and thousands of messages in the queues during peak periods. Operators referred to these centers as [...] "torn-tape relay centers," [...] a reference to removing the received message from the inbound teleprinter by tearing the paper tape to separate one message from the next. The U.S. military term for such a center was [...] "Non-Automated Relay Center" [...] (NARC).|$|R
5000|$|Garter - Garter belts {{are often}} used by players to hold up hockey socks. A garter is simply an elastic band that goes around the waist and has several straps that {{go down to the}} front and back of the legs. At the end of each strap is a <b>clip</b> or a <b>hook</b> which {{attaches}} to the sock. The latest garters belts come with Velcro straps which makes it easier to attach the socks. Many hockey pants and jock shorts now have built-in garters {{in the form of a}} velcro patch on the front and rear of the leg, which grab and hold the sock.|$|R
40|$|The bobbin change appts., {{particularly}} for condenser bobbins in a carded yarn double-sided ring spinner, has a feed pivoting on a generally horizontal axis on {{a frame of}} the spinner, with a holder for the condenser bobbin to be filled. A removal and advance mechanism moves in a generally vertical direction within the frame to engage the bobbin holder. The feed pref. has two symmetric swing clips at a gap from each other, each with a holder for the bobbin at the opposite ends to the swing axis, displaced by about {{the width of the}} condenser bobbin. Each holder is a shaped section, with a recess at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the <b>clip,</b> above a <b>hook,</b> so that the recess runs conically towards the hook. ADVANTAGE - The appts. gives an automated bobbin exchange action...|$|R
40|$|The {{ring that}} is {{difficult}} to remove from a swollen finger is a common problem, both in the accident and emer-gency department and on the ward. It is often seen in the older woman with upper limb trauma or infection and usually involves a much-loved wedding ring. The meth-ods of removal used in the past have varying degrees of success but each has its own drawbacks: ¥ lubrication is usually the first course of action but the degree of swelling is often too great for this to be effective ¥ the use of suture material wound tightly around the digit, passing under the ring and then unwound, forcing the ring distally with it (Belliappa, 1989), is generally ¥ the last resort is the use of a ring cutter. This can sometimes be difficult to find in the department, especially in serviceable condition. It also, of course, results in damage to the ring that is expensive to repair. The technique described here involves the use of cheap and easily available materials. It is an improvement upon the method of Belliappa (1989). The end of a length of ribbon gauze 1. 25 cm wide is passed under the tight ring atraumatically (Fig 1), using a paper <b>clip</b> to <b>hook</b> it after being carefully slipped between the skin and the ring. The gauze lying distal to the ring is then firmly wound around the finger with a half width overlap o...|$|R
500|$|While {{designing}} for Treasure Planet, {{the crew}} operated on rule {{they call the}} [...] "70/30 Law" [...] (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film's artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% sci-fi. The overall look of Treasure Planet {{was based on the}} art style promoted by illustrators associated with the Brandywine School of Illustration (such as Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth), whose illustrations have been described by the film's crew as being the [...] "classic storybook illustration," [...] having a painterly feel to it, and being composed of a warm color palette. The animators took Deep Canvas, a technology which they had initially developed for Tarzan (1999), {{and came up with a}} process they called [...] "Virtual Sets," [...] wherein they created entire 360 degree sets before they began staging the scenes. They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a [...] "painted image with depth perception" [...] and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film. In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a <b>clip</b> of Captain <b>Hook</b> from Peter Pan and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.|$|R
