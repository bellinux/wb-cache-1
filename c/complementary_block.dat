Nature uses segregation to improve biochemical control by organizing reactants into defined, well-regulated environments, and the transfer of genetic information is a primary function of templating.

Herein is presented a biomimetic segregation/templating approach to synthetic radical polymerization. Polymerization of a nucleobase-containing vinyl monomer {{in the presence of}} a <b>complementary</b> <b>block</b> copolymer template of low molecular weight yields high molecular weight (Mw up to ~ 400, 000 g mol− 1), extremely low polydispersity (≤ 1. 08) daughter polymers.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on our recent {{findings}} concerning the structure of complex coacervate core micelles composed of two types of (<b>complementary)</b> <b>block</b> copolymers. Both copolymers have a polyelectrolyte (one cationic and the other anionic) block combined with a neutral one. The opposite charges attract and form a close-to-electroneutral core. The two neutral blocks form the corona of the micelles. Here, {{we focus on the}} structure of the corona, which among other possibilities assumes the Janus configuration. Corresponding self-consistent field calculations confirm the rich behaviour of these systems. Unless the solvent quality of one of the corona chains is poor, we do not expect an onion-like corona with a clear interface between the layers. Disparities in chain length and solvent quality may only lead to gradual differences (local enrichments) in radial distributions. In the case that both corona chains are in good solvent, an unfavourable mixing of the two chains leads to the formation of Janus micelles, where the two blocks occupy different hemispheres. The interface that separates the two regions exerts a force on the core, which will deform when the core surface tension is not too high. In line with experimental results, the core flattens like a disk and the corona chains extend most {{in the direction of the}} poles...|$|E

40|$|Self-fertilization and {{crossing}} were combined {{to produce a}} large number of levels of inbreeding and of degrees of kinship. The inbreeding effect increases with the complexity of the character and with its supposed relationship with fitness. A certain amount of heterozygosity appears to be necessary for the expression of variability. With crossing of unrelated noninbred plants, genetic variance is mainly additive, but with inbreeding its major part is nonadditive. High additivity in crossing, therefore, coexists with strong inbreeding depression. However, even in inbreeding the genetic coefficient of covariation among relatives appears to be strongly and linearly related to the classical coefficient of kinship. This means that deviations from the additive model with inbreeding could be partly due to an effect of inbreeding on variances through an effect on means. An attempt to analyze genetic effects from a theoretical model, based upon the identity by descent relationship at the level of means and of covariances between relatives, tends to show that allelic interactions are more important and nonallelic interactions are less important for a character closely related to fitness. For a complex character, these results lead to the conception of a genome organized in polygenic <b>complementary</b> <b>blocks</b> integrating epistasis and dominance.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for leveraging the {{vast amount of}} data available on the Web is Entity Resolution, i. e., the process of identifying and linking data that describe the same real-world objects. To make this inherently quadratic process applicable to large data sets, blocking is typically employed: entities (records) are grouped into clusters - the blocks - of matching candidates and only entities of the same block are compared. However, novel blocking techniques are required {{for dealing with the}} noisy, heterogeneous, semi-structured, user-generated data in the Web, as traditional blocking techniques are inapplicable due to their reliance on schema information. The introduction of redundancy, improves the robustness of blocking methods but comes at the price of additional computational cost. In this paper, we present methods for enhancing the eficiency of redundancy-bearing blocking methods, such as our attributeagnostic blocking approach. We introduce novel blocking schemes that build blocks based on a variety of evidences, including entity identifiers and relationships between entities; they significantly reduce the required number of comparisons, while maintaining blocking effectiveness at very high levels. We also introduce two theoretical measures that provide a reliable estimation of the performance of a blocking method, without requiring the analytical processing of its blocks. Based on these measures, we develop two techniques for improving the performance of blocking: combining individual, <b>complementary</b> <b>blocking</b> schemes, and purging blocks until given criteria are satisfied.

Therefore, {{it is important not}} only to manage individual projects by themselves, but to also take into account different interactions between projects in order to manage whole portfolios. This study is the step-by-step representation of the method of optimizing portfolios of risky petroleum E&P projects, an illustrated method based on Markowitz?s Portfolio Theory. This method uses the covariance matrix between projects? expected return in order to optimize their portfolio. The developed computer model consists of four major modules. The first module generates petroleum price forecasts. In our implementation we used the price forecasting method based on Sequential Gaussian Simulation. The second module, Monte Carlo, simulates distribution of reserves and a set of expected production profiles. The third module calculates expected after tax net cash flows and estimates performance indicators for each realization, thus yielding distribution of return for each project. The fourth module estimates covariance between return distributions of individual projects and compiles them into portfolios. Using results of the fourth module, analysts can make their portfolio selection decisions. Thus, an advanced computer model for optimization of the portfolio of petroleum assets has been developed. The model is implemented in a MATLAB? computational environment and allows optimization of the portfolio using three different return measures (NPV, GRR, PI). The model has been successfully applied to the set of synthesized projects yielding reasonable solutions in all three return planes. Analysis of obtained solutions has shown that the given computer model is robust and flexible in terms of input data and output results.

Strongly segregated polyisoprene-PDMS and polystyrene-PDMS diblocks are prepared according to standard procedures in the literature by anionic synthesis in the laboratory of Professor Apostolos Avgeropoulos at the University of Ioannina in Ioannina, Greece and their morphologies are investigated using small angle x-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Good agreement is found between this work and other work on the structures of diblocks containing PDMS with a variety of <b>complementary</b> <b>blocks</b> and between this work and theoretical predictions for the morphologies of diblock polymers. Different processing treatments including casting from solvents with a range of preference for each block and a week-long anneal are tested to determine whether processing has a strong effect on final morphology; it is found that in most cases the morphology displayed after processing is consistent independent of the processing treatment, indicating that the morphologies are in equilibrium and fairly robust to preparation procedure. Finally, selected weakly segregated diblocks were studied at varying temperatures using synchrotron small angle x-ray scattering. The diblock samples appeared to be affected by the prior x-ray dose that the materials had received. With limited prior dose, the materials studied were ordered with little dramatic change in morphology throughout the temperatures investigated; under continual irradiation by a 1. 371 Å (9. 1 keV) beam for half an hour, the samples were damaged. The thesis concludes with a summary and suggestions for future work, including a discussion of experimental and theoretical work on the ways that equilibrium morphologies of block copolymers are perturbed when they are spatially confined to dimensions on the order of several times their repeat period. The small domain sizes achievable with and technological relevance of PDMS-containing diblocks make them ideal for use in microelectronics and information storage which provides a motivation for exploring this topic further. by Charlotte Stewart-Sloan.

Using real reported traffic Key Performance Indicators to calibrate the model, an estimated accessibility is obtained at a per-resource level and combined to find global estimated accessibility. The proposed model is intended to assist network operation, estimating individual resource shortage, differentiating congestion from hardware failures, and predicting the necessary resources to be deployed to tackle a high-capacity demanding event.|$|R

Specificity is guar-anteed by small antisense RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Func-tional miRNAs derive from longer double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules that are cleaved to pre-miRNAs in the nucleus and are transported by exportin 5 (Exp 5) to the cytoplasm. Adenovirus-infected cells express virus-associated (VA) RNAs, which are dsRNA molecules similar in structure to pre-miRNAs. VA RNAs are also transported by Exp 5 to the cytoplasm, where they accumulate. Here {{we show that}} small RNAs derived from VA RNAs (svaRNAs), similar to miRNAs, {{can be found in}} adenovirus-infected cells. VA RNA processing to svaRNAs requires neither viral replication nor viral protein expression, as evidenced by the fact that svaRNA accumulation can be detected in cells transfected with VA sequences. svaRNAs are efficiently bound by Argonaute 2, the endonuclease of the RNA-induced silencing complex, and behave as functional siRNAs, in that they inhibit the expression of reporter genes with <b>complementary</b> sequences. <b>Blocking</b> svaRNA-mediated inhibition affects efficient adenovirus production, indicating that svaRNAs are required for virus viability. Thus, svaRNA-mediated silencing could represent a novel mechanism used by adenoviruses to control cellular or viral gene expression. Virus-associated (VA) RNAs are noncoding polymerase III...|$|R
