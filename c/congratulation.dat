5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer is still a respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for <b>congratulation</b> than regret... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} was warmly {{received on}} its {{return to the}} Clyde on 21 July 1904. A formal reception for 400people {{was held at the}} Marine Biological Station, Millport, at which John Murray read a telegram of <b>congratulation</b> from King Edward VII. Bruce was presented with the Royal Scottish Geographical Society's Gold Medal, and Captain Robertson with the silver medal.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of the American intentions, the British and Canadians {{thought that}} King, Boerstler and Winder had been {{intended}} {{as the first}} wave of Smyth’s invasion rather than as a preparatory raid. The Canadian press praised the “gallant achievement” of the defenders in apparently repulsing the Americans and singled out Bisshopp for particular <b>congratulation.</b> In his dispatch to Prevost, Major General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe, the British commander in Upper Canada, wrote that “Lieut.-Colonel Bisshopp deserves high commendation for the spirit and activity he displayed, and great credit is due the officers and men who acted under his orders.” Bisshopp was killed the following summer while leading the Raid on Black Rock.|$|E

5|$|At the {{approach}} {{to the west of}} the important city of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry. In the ensuing battle Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious. Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of <b>congratulation</b> for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312AD, when he moved on to Brixia (Brescia).|$|E
5|$|The {{first volume}} of Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph was published that fall, although the ongoing war made it unclear when the remaining three volumes would be published. The first volume was highly praised by reviewers, and received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1918. In January 1919 Roosevelt, who was severely ill by this point, wrote to Beebe from his hospital bed congratulating Beebe on {{the publication of his}} monograph. His letter of <b>congratulation</b> to Beebe was the last letter that Roosevelt wrote before his death. Volume II of the monograph was published in 1921, and volumes III and IV were published in 1922. The completed work, titled A Monograph of the Pheasants, has been considered by some reviewers to be possibly the greatest ornithological monograph of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the count focused on two other projects: the first {{grew out of}} his longstanding {{interest}} in promoting literature and sciences, and the second, more ambitious aim was {{to fight for the}} gradual abolition of slavery. When in 1867 PedroII openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in his Speech from the Throne, Porto Alegre {{was one of the few}} individuals who supported him, sending him a letter of <b>congratulation.</b> On 18 June 1869, the Partenon Literário (Literary Parthenon), a spiritual successor to the Historic and Geographic Institute of the Province of São Pedro, was created and Porto Alegre was made an honorary member. In one of its sessions, the count, who had already embarked on a plan of gradually freeing his own slaves, proposed the creation of a civil association devoted to slavery's abolition. His idea was not only welcomed but came to fruition. The Sociedade Libertadora (Liberation Society) was founded on 29 August, with Porto Alegre as its president, its primary purpose being the purchase of freedom for enslaved children.|$|E

5|$|Döblin {{completed}} work on November 1918 in {{the spring}} of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher. The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann. In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. Heinrich Mann gave a speech, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach read aloud from Döblin's works, and he was presented with notes of <b>congratulation</b> and praise from Brecht, Max Horkheimer, and Alfred Polgar, among others. Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed, and Blandine Ebinger sang Berlin chansons. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, and fell on unsympathetic ears.|$|E
5|$|Military leaders {{throughout}} the country gave addresses to their troops to celebrate the occasion. Some, such as Major General (later Generalfeldmarschall) Erich von Manstein, were especially effusive in their praise for their supreme commander. Official guests representing 23 countries {{took part in the}} celebrations. Papal envoy Cesare Orsenigo, the President of the Slovak Republic Jozef Tiso, the heads of the branches of Nazi Germany's armed forces, and mayors of German cities offered birthday congratulations at the chancellery. Hitler and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini exchanged telegrams assuring each other that the friendship between Germany and the Kingdom of Italy (both ruled by fascist regimes at the time) could not be disturbed by their enemies. The ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France and the United States were not present at the parade, having been withdrawn after Hitler's march into Czechoslovakia in 1938. The U.S. was represented at the troop review by chargé d'affaires Raymond H. Geist. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not congratulate Hitler on his birthday, in accordance with his practice of not sending birthday greetings to anyone but ruling monarchs. King George VI of the United Kingdom dispatched a message of <b>congratulation</b> to Hitler; but due to the strained relations between the two countries, his advisors had considered whether the King should ignore the birthday altogether. There was no Polish representation at the parade.|$|E

25|$|Although Williams {{attracted}} the attention and admiration {{of some of the}} most notable writers of his day, including T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden, his greatest admirer was probably C. S. Lewis, whose novel That Hideous Strength (1945) has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems. Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis's then-recently published study The Allegory of Love; he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of <b>congratulation</b> and dropped it in the mail. Coincidentally, Lewis had just finished reading Williams's novel The Place of the Lion and had written a similar note of <b>congratulation.</b> The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship.|$|E

25|$|After {{the breach}} of the Hindenburg Line, Haig's forces were through to open country. The Germans retreated to the River Selle (east of Cambrai) after a further British victory at the Second Battle of Cambrai, at which massed cavalry were used. On 10 October Haig {{received}} a paper from Foch recommending the seizure of the Rhineland – he disapproved, thinking this was too much like asking the Germans to surrender. The following day he received a telegram of <b>congratulation</b> from Lloyd George, which annoyed him by implying that the victories had been won by Marshal Foch.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, the Norwegian Nobel Committee opted {{to give it}} jointly to Henry Dunant and Frédéric Passy, a leading {{international}} pacifist. More significant than {{the honor of the}} prize itself, the official <b>congratulation</b> from the International Committee of the Red Cross marked the overdue rehabilitation of Henry Dunant and represented a tribute to his key role {{in the formation of the}} Red Cross. Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of Heiden. Only two months earlier his long-standing adversary Gustave Moynier had also died, leaving a mark in the history of the Committee as its longest-serving president ever.|$|E
