Fewer agree, however, on how to ensure effective political engagement in development programs and reforms. It is questionable whether many practitioners <b>or</b> <b>theoreticians</b> <b>even</b> have clear ideas about what effective political engagement looks like. Terms like political will and political commitment lack clarity and operational import; {{it is unclear what}} they are and even more unclear how to foster them. This chapter attempts to shed light on why such a key issue is poorly understood and to suggest ideas for thinking about it. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a spine care <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> {{practitioner}} was first presented by Scott Haldeman, neurologist, in an editorial in The Spine Journal in 2001 to include all clinical specialties that treat patients with spinal disease. This was emphasized at the American Back Society Annual Convention in San Francisco in November 2005. At {{that time it was}} clear that none of the current clinical disciplines offering care to people with spinal disorders were adequately trained in the skills necessary to offer treatment protocols consistent with current evidence-based guidelines. The necessity to define a primary spine care <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> specialist became <b>even</b> more evident when it was determined that there were over 200 treatment approaches available for people with spinal pain without any clinician with the knowledge, time, skills and ability to guide patients through this maze of treatment options.Similar considerations were presented in the British Medical Journal by Harvigsen et al. which noted that the general medical practitioner is not adequately equipped to deal with the complexities of musculoskeletal disorders and suggested that the solution to this problem would be the development of a primary musculoskeletal specialist. Hartvigsen et al. suggested that chiropractors, physical therapists or osteopathic physicians could serve this purpose with some changes in education, clinical practice and licensure of these professions.|$|R

40|$|King-Kopetzky {{syndrome}} (KKS) is {{the condition}} in which an individual complains of having difficulties understanding speech in background noise but has normal hearing thresholds on pure tone audiometry. KKS is a relatively common condition and recognized as a clinically unique group in the audiological or ENT clinics (about 1 - 10 %). The absence of any abnormal audiometric findings to explain their hearing difficulties leaves the <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> audiologists with a diagnostic dilemma and presents difficulties {{in dealing with the}} patients. Consequently, in the past they have often simply been reassured <b>or</b> <b>even</b> been recognized as non-organic hearing loss or psychological or neurotic. With developments in audiological technology and in hearing physiology, comprehensive test protocols have been developed to identify the possible pathogenesis underlying patients with KKS. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the advances in the development of sensitized and objective assessments of subclinical auditory dysfunction in patients with KKS. This should be valuable to provide guidelines on the pathogenesis and consequently lead towards a better understanding of KKS. Appropriate approaches to the process of rehabilitative management of patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} review of structured family support programs in childrenâ€™s mental health was con-ducted in collaboration with leadership from key national family organizations. The goals were to identify typologies of family support services for which evaluation data exis-ted and identify research gaps. Over 200 programs were examined; 50 met criteria for inclusion. Programs were categorized by whether they were delivered by peer family members, <b>clinicians,</b> <b>or</b> teams. Five salient components of family support were identified: (a) informational, (b) instructional, (c) emotional, (d) instrumental, and (e) advocacy. Clinician-led programs were heavily represented (n = 33, 66 %), followed by family-led (n = 11, 22 %), and team-delivered (n = 6, 12 %) programs. Key differences between programs delivered by <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> by peer family members {{were found in the}} degree of emphasis, research methodology, and outcomes. However, the content of the components was similar across all three program types. There are both important differences in emphasis across typologies of family support provided by <b>clinicians,</b> family members, <b>or</b> teams as well as important similarities in content. Family-delivered support may be an important adjunct to existing services for parents, although the research base remains thin. A research agenda to promote more rigorous evaluations of these services especially those delivered by peer family members is critical...|$|R
