40|$|In the Jerez-Lebríja area (SW Spain) {{there are}} deppsits of Pliocene sands which are {{exploited}} in various quarries. The {{analysis of the}} surface features presented by the quartz grains from these sands refveals different stages in their evolution of the grains. The first of these stages is recorded {{in the form of}} conchoidal fractures and arcuate steps; the second is represented by an assemblage of features comprising isolated Vs, grooves and <b>chattermark</b> trails. In a posterior stage chemical features were developed in relation to tropic climatic Condition...|$|E

Geochemistry indicates possible affinities with the Gawler Range Volcanics and the Moonta Porphyry. The sequence is intruded by amphibolite dykes. Metamorphic and tectonic events have modified the rocks, destroying primary textures. These events {{may be related}} to the Olarian orogeny. The figure of 1735 m. y. obtained on the rhyo-dacite probably represents a re-setting event. Permian glacigene sediments unconformably overlie the acid volcanics. These sediments consist of mottled clays and quartz arenites, and contain heavy mineral grains the surfaces of which show well-defined <b>chattermark</b> trails. Erratics are numerous. Grooved bedrock surfaces indicate a 340 ° ice movement direction, as does the Cape Willoughby source for the largest granite erratic. A richly-fossiliferous Pliocene sequence - the Hallett Cove Sandstone - overlies the Permian and the Basement. The 4 m thick sequence shows ten distinct horizons, reflecting differing environmental conditions. The Quaternary cover shows evidence of Holocene sea-level changes in the form of stranded shingle beach ridges, aeolianite wave-cut platforms and undersea calcrete reefs. These also record palaeoclimatic changes, as do the fossil soils, calcretes and aeolianite dunes. The geochemistry of the calcretes reflects that of the underlying bedrock, and places constraints on the calcrete-formation model postulated. A salt-marsh-prograding barrier beach couplet shows the classic features of such an environment. Palaeontological analyses of the Recent sands indicates a diverse death assemblage, the dominance differences probably resulting from life-assemblage environmental differences, particularly depth and bottom. The presence of Marginopera vertebralis in the tidal detritus between Wardang Island and Goose Island indicates that this species may still be extant in this locality. MgC 03 analyses support this hypothesis. Thesis (B. Sc. (Hons)) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Physical Sciences, 197...|$|E

50|$|The gravel-size {{portion of}} the Squantum Member diamictites {{consists}} of range from sub-rounded to angular clasts, 5-60 cm (2-24 in) in diameter, to well-rounded clasts 3-8 cm (1.1-3 in) in diameter. They are composed of multicoloured, locally derived felsic and mafic volcanic rocks, granodiorite, quartzite and massive, graded and laminated sandstone and siltstone. The sand- and gravel-sized fraction of the diamictites consist of volcanic, granitic and metasedimentary lithic fragments that have the same composition as the sediments of the Brookline and Dorchester members. Glacially striated pebbles, <b>chattermarked</b> quartz grains and dropstones have been reported from these diamictites. However, none of these reports have been substantiated by later research. For example, previously identified dropstones have been re-interpreted as having been emplaced by lateral sediment-gravity or current processes.|$|R
40|$|Proximal ejecta {{deposits}} {{related to}} three large terrestrial impacts, the 14. 8 -Ma Ries impact structure in Germany (the Bunte Breccia), the 65 -Ma Chicxulub impact {{structure in the}} Yucatan (the Albion and Pook's Hill Diamictites in Belize) and the mid-Tertiary Azuara impact structure in Spain (the Pelarda Fm.) occur {{in the form of}} widespread debris-flow deposits most likely originating from ballistic processes. These impact-related diamictites typically are poorly sorted, containing grain sizes from clay to large boulders and blocks, and commonly display evidence of mass flow, including preferred orientation of long axes of clasts, class imbrication, flow noses, plugs and pods of coarse debris, and internal shear planes. Clasts of various lithologies show faceting, various degrees of rounding, striations (including nailhead striae), crescentic <b>chattermarks,</b> mirror-like polish, percussion marks, pitting, and penetration features. Considering the impact history of the Earth, it is surprising that so few ballistic ejecta, deposits have been discovered, unless the preservation potential is extremely low, or such materials exist but have been overlooked or misidentified as other types of geologic deposits. Debris-flow diamictites of various kinds {{have been reported in the}} geologic record, but these are commonly attributed to glaciation based on the coarse and poorly sorted nature of the deposits and, in many cases, on the presence of clasts showing features considered diagnostic of glacial action, including striations of various kinds, polish, and pitting. These diamictites are the primary evidence for ancient ice ages. We present evidence of the surface features on clasts from known proximal ejecta debris-flow deposits and compare these features with those reported in diamictites. interpreted as ancient glacial deposits (tillites). Our purpose is to document the types of features seen on clasts in diamictites of ejecta origin in order to help in the interpretation of the origin of ancient diamictites. The recognition of characteristic features in clast populations in ancient diamictites may allow identification and discrimination of debris-flow deposits of various origins (e. g., impact glacial, tectonic) and may shed light on some climatic paradoxes, such as inferred Proterozoic glaciations at low paleolatitudes...|$|R
