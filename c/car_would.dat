5|$|In early 2010, it was {{reported}} that General Motors would lose money on the Volt for at least the first couple of generations, but it hoped the <b>car</b> <b>would</b> create a green image that could rival the Prius.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{introduced}} {{more stringent}} {{tests on the}} cars at the Malaysian race to ensure floor mounting systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber were not in breach of the regulations. After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's undertray to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed. Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 <b>car</b> <b>would</b> not be compromised in any way by the required modifications.|$|E
5|$|When Johnson {{returned}} to his car, he found a note from Dean Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000 but would eventually return the money in 1984 so that the <b>car</b> <b>would</b> be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck would be officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E

5000|$|According to the 2010-2014 capital plan, 146 {{new cars}} {{were to be}} purchased. Of these new <b>cars,</b> 110 <b>cars</b> <b>would</b> go to make up 10 new 11-car trains, while the {{remaining}} 36 cars were to be [...] "C" [...] <b>cars</b> that <b>would</b> go to expanding 36 CBTC upgraded R142A 5-car sets (360 existing cars) to 6-car length.

50|$|The planned midlife {{rehabilitation}} of the 5000-series cars was {{to take place in}} the late 2010s through the early 2020s. Design specifications were to be drafted in 2017, with the first cars rehabbed in 2022. This series of <b>cars</b> <b>would</b> have been the third series of cars to have automated station announcements and the stainless steel paint scheme after they would have been rehabilitated. The <b>cars</b> <b>would</b> have been compatible with the 7000-series once the rehabilitation process was completed. Metro announced in November 2013 that within two years, all 5000-series and 6000-series <b>cars</b> <b>would</b> feature new resilient flooring, replacing the existing carpeting.|$|R
5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a <b>car</b> <b>would</b> be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} between Lehto and Lamy {{caused the}} safety car to be deployed, {{with all the}} remaining competitors holding position behind it while travelling at a reduced speed. During this period, {{as a result of}} travelling at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with Gerhard Berger, had expressed concern that the safety car (itself only reintroduced in Formula One in 1993 and only the third time used since then, the other occurrences being the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix and the 1993 British Grand Prix) did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high. Senna was also worried by a procedure introduced at the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix, whereby the safety <b>car</b> <b>would</b> lead the grid on the formation lap, rather than letting the race leader choose the pace of the formation lap. The procedure was removed for this race.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the <b>car</b> <b>would</b> ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The <b>car</b> <b>would</b> swerve away. The second take saw the car crash into the container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part composite shot to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck, {{the iconic}} 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves as}} the {{official}} mascot of the student body, was acquired in this era. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions, and leads the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty it has performed since 1961. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken-down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search employed newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 when Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000; he eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the <b>car</b> <b>would</b> be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E

2500|$|In 1906, {{during the}} PRR {{construction}} project to build tunnels under the Hudson and East Rivers and build Penn Station, the PRR announced that all new passenger <b>cars</b> <b>would</b> {{be made of}} steel and that wooden <b>cars</b> <b>would</b> not be allowed in the tunnels due to the hazard of fire. A design for a steel suburban car with a [...] passenger compartment, [...] overall length, and 72 seats was already under development, along with one for a corresponding passenger-baggage combination car.

25|$|Former Caterham F1 team {{principal}} Manfredi Ravetto {{confirmed in}} an interview that a contract was signed with Barrichello to replace Kamui Kobayashi for the final three races of the season, providing the <b>car</b> <b>would</b> actually be competitive, but it was proven that it wouldn't be and the Caterham team went into administration, and as such, Barrichello never raced with the team.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, it {{was decided}} that the new technologically {{advanced}} <b>car</b> <b>would</b> need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3L pushrod V6. The 3.3L engine's 60° block was bored out to 3.5L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5L V6.|$|E
