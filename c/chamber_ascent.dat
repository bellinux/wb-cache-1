40|$|International audienceLa Soufrière of Guadeloupe is a {{dangerous}} volcano characterized {{over the last decade}} by moderate seismic and fumarolic unrest. In the last 15, 000 years it has experienced phreatic and magmatic eruptions and unusually numerous flank collapse events sometimes associated with a magmatic eruption. We propose a new age of 1530 A. D. and a new eruptive scenario for the last magmatic eruption {{on the basis of a}} novel statistical analysis of radiocarbon age dates, and new field and geochemical data. This eruption is the only magmatic eruption likely to have occurred in Guadeloupe during the last 1400 years. The eruption mainly involved an andesitic magma which, in the first phase of the eruption, partially mixed with a slightly more differentiated magma stored in a small and shallow magma <b>chamber.</b> <b>Ascent</b> of magma to the surface generated a partial collapse of the hydrothermally altered edifice that increased the magma discharge and led to a sub-plinian phase with scoria fallout and column-collapse pyroclastic flows followed by near-vent pyroclastic scoria fountains. The eruption ended with growth of a lava dome. Our revised interpretation of the last magmatic eruption of La Soufrière constitutes the most likely key to a future magmatic eruption scenario for this volcano which displays strong evidence of unrest since 1992...|$|E

In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|R
25|$|Instant abort {{capability}} {{was important}} because certain failure modes such as loss of thrust upon liftoff (for example the third Redstone test flight in May 1954) {{could result in}} an immediate catastrophic situation. Other failure modes such as deviation from the proper flight path or a drop in engine <b>chamber</b> pressure during <b>ascent</b> did not necessarily present an immediate risk to the astronaut's safety and he could either initial a manual abort by pulling a lever in the capsule to activate the Launch Escape System or ground control could send a command to activate it.|$|R
40|$|Astronauts are at {{risk for}} {{developing}} decompression sickness (DCS) while exposed to the hypobaric environment of the extravehicular suit in space, in terrestrial hypobaric <b>chambers,</b> and during <b>ascent</b> from neutral buoyancy training dives. There is increasing recognition that DCS risk is different between diving and altitude exposures, with many individual parameters and environmental factors implicated as risk factors for development of DCS in divers but are not recognized as risk factors in altitude exposures. Much of the literature to date has focused on patent foramen ovale (PFO), which has long been considered a major risk factor for DCS in diving exposures, but its link to serious DCS in altitude exposures remains unclear. Knowledge of those risk factors specific to hypobaric DCS may help identify susceptible individuals and aid in astronaut selection, crew assignment, and mission planning. This paper reviews the current literature pertaining to these risk factors, including PFO, anthropometric parameters, gender, menstrual cycle, lifetime diving experience, physical fitness, biochemical levels, complement activation, cigarette smoking, fluid balance, and ambient temperature. Further research to evaluate pertinent risk factors for DCS in altitude exposures is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{forecasting}} {{of future}} volcanic events of a volcano requires detailed {{understanding of its}} past behavior and extrapolation of this behavior into the future. Geological and geophysical studies are required to understand the origin and composition of deposits, magma and lava flows, presence of aquifers, strength, elasticity and plasticity of magmas, lavas, surrounding rocks and soils, etc. Research in applied mathematics requires the development of physical models at the microscopic and macroscopic levels for the magma, lava, soil, and atmospheric dispersion of erupted materials. The complicated form of the resulting coupled and non-linear differential equations requires efficient numerical methods and computer techniques for solving these equations and visualizing large data sets produced by the simulations. Such an effort was proposed {{over a decade ago}} for the purpose of producing a Global Volcanic Simulator for Vesuvius [1, 2], with some notable progress already being made in modeling magma <b>chamber</b> dynamics, magma <b>ascent</b> in conduits, and pyroclastic dispersions [3]. A Global Volcanic Simulator should adequately resolve the thermodynamic processes associated with magma mixing, differentiation, and crystallization in the magma chamber, changes in magma chamber geometry with time due to the inflow and outflow of magma and changin...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies are}} focused on textural and {{compositional}} features of plagioclase as an usefull tool to investigate magma <b>chamber</b> processes, <b>ascent</b> dynamics, and physico-chemical conditions. In particular water content, which plays {{a fundamental role in}} volcanic process, strongly affects plagioclase stability and, by conseguence, textural and compositional features. However, such reconstruction are usually biased by too many assumptions; particularly when dealing with past eruptions or remote volcanoes. Only few volcanoes provide an array of instrumental monitoring to constrain timing and modality of eruptive events. In this respect Mount Etna probably represents one of the most controlled volcano in the world and a great wealth of seismological and ground deformations data are available. In this work we present a textural and compositional study of plagioclases from lavas emitted during the 2001 - 2006 eruptive period on Mount Etna. Textural classification has been done on over 130 thin sections taking into account different portion of the crystals. This allow to recognize different types of core (ehuedral and rounded) and rims (dusty or with melt inclusion alignment) separated by oscillatory zoned overgrowth. Oxygen fugacity in magmas has been calculated using the method of [1] and results has been used to reequilibrate the melts to mantle equilibrium, adding back the appropriate quantity of fractionated material. Water content of the melt has been estimated using the hygrometer of [2]. These data were used in the MELT model to estimate the plagioclase stability field and to calculate theoretic composition at different water content. Results were integrated with monitoring data acquired during the entire period under study with the aim to reconstruct magma ascent and storage conditions, as well as the mechanism of eruption triggering. Results indicate the 2001 - 2006 eruptive period involved magmas with quite similar major element composition but different dissolved H 2 O. Complex zoning such as dusty areas and alignments of melt inclusions in outer portion of the phenocrysts suggest two different trigger mechanism respectively: i) magma input and mixing with a more basic and volatile-rich magma; ii) fracture migration that induce decompression of shallow magma batches...|$|R
40|$|The {{petrology}} of the Sutherland Commonage olivine melilitite intrusives {{have been}} investigated using petrographic and chemical methods. The occurrence consists of a ring dyke which surrounds a centrally located sill complex. The rock of the ring dyke is a typical melilitite which consists of olivine in a groundmass of melilite, clinopyroxene, opaque spinel, nepheline and perovskite. The sill complex is a multiple intrusion and is comprised of a lower green melilitite and an overlying (and younger) grey melilitite. The green melilitite is deuterically altered and the original mineralogy is destroyed to a large extent. The grey melilitite contains autoliths of the green and is a fairly typical monticellitic melilitite in which phenocrysts of olivine are set in a groundmass of melilite, monticellite, opaque spine!, nepheline and perovskite. Microprobe analyses of clinopyroxenes indicate that they are aluminous titanian diopsides and salites which exhibit complex zonation patterns. They record magmatic conditions ranging from the intrusive stage to a final phase of magmatic evolution during which a vapour phase evolved after {{the majority of the}} groundmass minerals had crystallised. The chemistry of olivine phenocrysts suggests that the parent magma to the Commonage intrusives accumulated in a temperature-zoned reservoir {{at the base of the}} lithosphere. Large, unzoned olivine phenocrysts crystallised in this chamber. Subsequent rupture of the <b>chamber</b> and <b>ascent</b> of magma led to supercooling and the crystallisation of abundant, strongly zoned phenocrysts of smaller size. Olivine crystallisation continued until the magma reached crustal levels. It is inferred from the chemistry of chromites and magnetites that the magma in the ring dyke was more evolved than those in the sill complex and that very oxidising conditions prevailed in the grey melilitite during the crystallisation of magnetite in this intrusive type. The high fO₂ may have resulted from the degassing of CO₂ after intrusion. Major and trace elements have been analysed for in eleven whole rock samples and the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratio was determined for seven of the same samples. The results of the geochemical study suggest that the Commonage melilitites were derived by the melting of a recently metasomatised region of the asthenosphere, probably under the influence of an ocean-island-type hotspot situated in the lower mantle...|$|R
40|$|Explosive {{volcanic}} eruptions comprise a complex series of processes involving {{withdrawal from the}} magma <b>chamber,</b> magma <b>ascent</b> along the conduit and eruption column dynamics. Numerous studies have modeled the different sub-domains of a volcanic system, but their interplay has seldom been analyzed. To this end, we developed C 3 (C-cubed, that stands for Chamber, Conduit and Column), a new integrated model that describes the dynamics of an explosive eruption {{as a series of}} steady state regimes and as a function of geometry and initial conditions of the magma reservoir. We used Global Sensitivity Analysis to quantify the role of the relevant model parameters and describe the interplay between the different volcanic sub-domains. In particular, we analyzed the evolution of a sustained explosive eruption in order to identify the conditions for buoyant, super-buoyant and collapsing columns. Input data were based on field reconstructions of Quaternary explosive eruptions in the Vulsini Volcanic District (Roman Province, central Italy). Model results show that: 1) the column regime, although affected by complex interactions among several factors, mostly depends on the conduit radius, the volatile content (i. e. supersaturation concentration {{at the top of the}} chamber) and length of the conduit, in decreasing level of importance; 2) the amount of mass erupted is independent of the conduit radius and depends mostly on volatile supersaturation, the radius of the magma chamber, the length of the conduit and the overpressure at the conduit inlet; 3) the mass flow-rate, column height and duration of the eruption are largely controlled by the conduit radius; 4) the flow pressure and density at the conduit exit are mostly controlled by the conduit inlet overpressure at the onset of the eruption, and by the length of the conduit at the end of the eruption; 5) the exit velocity from the conduit is mostly controlled by the volatile content, the length of the conduit and the inlet overpressure. In this model framework, and with specific reference to selected Plinian events of the Vulsini Volcanic District, simulation results show that column collapse is not achieved for reasonable eruption durations (order of hours) and conduit widths (tens of meters). This is consistent with field reconstructions suggesting that column collapse did not likely occur and that pyroclastic flows were therefore generated by independent mechanisms from ring fissures and/or multiple vents concomitant to caldera collapse. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|The Pomici di Mercato (PdM, 8, 010 ± 40 a), {{also known}} in the {{literature}} as Pomici Gemelle or Pomici di Ottaviano, {{is one of the}} oldest Plinian eruptions of Somma- Vesuvius. This eruption occurred after the longest (7 ka) quiescence period of the volcano and was followed by more than 4 ka of repose. The erupted magma is phonolitic in composition. All the products have very low phenocrysts content (less than 3 %) and show evidence of mineralogical disequilibria. They contain K-feldspar ± clinopyroxene (salite and diopside) ± plagioclase ± garnet ± biotite ± amphibole ± apatite ± Fe-Ti oxides. Pumice fragments collected at different stratigraphic heights are slightly less evolved and more enriched in radiogenic Sr composition upsection. The glass composition is fairly homogeneous in single pumice fragment and among pumice fragments from different layers. Glass separated from pumice fragments collected at different stratigraphic heights is homogeneous in the Sr-isotope composition (around a value of 0. 70717). Glass is in isotopic equilibrium with salite throughout the entire sequence and with diopside at the base of the sequence. Diopside becomes more radiogenic upsection, reaching a value of 0. 707458 ± 7, whereas feldspar is consistently slightly less radiogenic than glass. Nd-isotope composition is fairly uniform (ca. 0. 51247) through the whole sequence. The isotopic disequilibria among glass, feldspar and diopside, together with the homogeneous isotopic composition of pumice glass in equilibrium with salite, and the mineralogical disequilibria between plagioclase and K-feldspar, imply that most of the diopside and plagioclase crystals are xenocrysts incorporated into the phonolitic magma during residence in a magma <b>chamber</b> and/or during <b>ascent</b> towards the surface. The PdM Tephra are compositionally and isotopically similar to the phonolitic, first-erupted products of the subsequent Pomici di Avellino Plinian eruption. On the basis of this similarity, we suggest that the magma feeding both eruptions resulted from the tapping of a unique magma chamber. Prior to the PdM eruption, this chamber was formed by a large and homogeneous phonolitic magma body. After the PdM eruption, as a consequence of new arrivals of more radiogenic in Sr, less-differentiated magma batches, the magma chamber progressively developed a slightly stratified phonolitic uppermost portion, capping a tephriphonolitic layer, both emitted during the subsequent Pomici di Avellino eruption...|$|R
40|$|As a {{step towards}} the {{characterization}} of the rheological properties of natural magmatic mixtures a detailed experimental investigation on natural sample derived from Italian Volcanic systems (Stromboli, Etna and Phlegrean Fields) has been performed. Viscosity measurements were conducted on basaltic melts from Stromboli and Etna during their crystallization. At the investigated subliquidus temperatures (1131 °C 1175 °C and ϕ up to 0. 12 - 0. 14 both studied compositions behave as Newtonian, while with decreasing temperature, the increase in crystal content leads to the onset of a weak shear thinning behavior (n= 0. 9). A strong departure from the well-known (strain-rate independent) Einstein-Roscoe equation and from the strain-rate dependent model developed by Costa et al. (2009) has been observed. The origin of this departure is related primarily {{to the effect of}} elongated plagioclase in increasing crystal interactions at low ϕ. Detailed textural analyses allowed to develop {{for the first time on}} natural liquids a parameterization of the multiphase rheology, which takes into account the crystal shape, crystal size distribution of the suspension and the deformation regime. The results were applied to a synthetic suspension HPG 8 Na 20 containing a variable amount of almost spherical corundum particles with known textural features at T= 1000 - 1100 °C. Multiphase rheology of natural vesicles- and crystal- bearing magmas from Monte Nuovo have been investigated by uniaxial deformation experiments in the T range 600 °C- 800 °C and strain rates between 10 - 7 and 10 - 4 s- 1. Brittle behavior of the magma has been observed at T< 600 °C and strain rates of 10 - 5 s- 1 and at T= 800 °C for the higher applied strain rate (10 - 4 s- 1). All other experiments were performed in the viscous regime and Monte Nuovo magma showed always a non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior. Effective viscosity in the range of 1010 - 1013 were calculated by the no slip model by Gent (1960). Fitting of experimental data using the Herschel-Bulkley model revealed that at the studied condition, no yield stress was present and yielded a parametrization of the flow behavior in terms of consistency K and flow index n. The relative viscosities indicated a dependence from experimental temperature and applied strain rate. Higher relative viscosities (up to 2. 1 log 10 units) were observed with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rates. Negative relative viscosities were observed at T= 640 °C, when the melt approaches the glass transition temperature (Giordano et al., 2005). To derive the net effect of vesicles on the rheology of Monte Nuovo magmas, the relative viscosity was further normalized to the relative viscosity obtained by Caricchi et al. (2008) on the same sample composition and no porosity. Normalization revealed that the presence of vesicles has a major influence on the rheology of magmas and can lead to a decrease of the viscosity of more than two orders of magnitude. Viscosity measurements have been performed on basaltic melts from Etna at low oxygen fugacity conditions and T between 1150 °C- 1300 °C. Reducing conditions yield a slight decrease in viscosity compared to the expected viscosity versus temperature relationship at fO 2 = air (Giordano and Dingwell 2003). Moreover, another effect of lowering the oxygen fugacity conditions is the decrease of liquidus temperature of the melt which leads to none or minor crystallization compared to experiments conducted at fO 2 =air. The results of two experiments conducted at two different oxidation state at T= 1300 °C (Fe 3 +/ΣFe = 0. 18 and 0. 76, respectively) indicated that the viscosity decrease observed as an inverse function of fO 2, is smaller than what observed by many authors on simplified iron-bearing silicate melts. We suggest that this behavior is linked to the competition in natural systems between Fe 3 + and Al 3 + for the tetrahedric structural sites. Being Al favored in tetrahedrical coordination, part of Fe 3 + is forced to behave as network-modifier also at high fugacity condition, thus the depolymerization of the melt when the reduction Fe 3 +- Fe 2 + takes place is limited. Our data seem to be consistent with those obtained by Bouhifd et al. (2004) on basalts, confirming that the effect of oxidation state on viscosity is more pronounced at lower than at higher temperatures and for Al-free synthetic liquids rather than for natural melts. Rheological measurements conducted on basaltic melts from Stromboli and Etna at subliquidus conditions (see above) were also used to investigate the effect of the deformation rate (gammai= 4. 26 s- 1 for Stromboli and gammai= 0. 53 s- 1 for Etna) on the crystallization kinetics of plagioclase at different degree of undercooling (ET), varying from 24 to 45 °C for Stromboli and from 21 to 72 °C for Etna. Post-run plagioclase crystal contents are between ϕ= 0. 11 - 0. 23 for Stromboli and between ϕ= 0. 06 - 0. 18 for Etna with increasing undercooling. Different kinetics of the crystallization process has been observed. Higher deformation rates seem to play a fundamental role in favoring the achievement of phase equilibria in a short time-scale. Crystal Size Distribution (CSD) of the experimental plagioclase crystals are always characterized by a log-linear decrease of population density as a function of crystal size. With increasing degree of undercooling a systematic increase of the steepness of the curves has been observed for both datasets. The CSD parameter of all samples (slopes and intercept) are linearly correlated with the overall crystal content. However, given the difference of the crystal content vs. undercooling behavior for the two datasets, two different linear correlation have been found for Stromboli and Etna, relating the CSD parameters to the degree of undercooling. In the framework of the CSD theory average value of G and average J were obtained. Stromboli data always show higher values of both G and J with respect to Etna data. Stromboli growth rates G are quite stable with increasing undercooling, however they display a relative small variation ranging between 2. 5 - 3 x 10 - 8 m/s. A slight increase of G can be observed for Etna with decreasing temperature, from 0. 6 x 10 - 8 to 1. 3 x 10 - 8 m/s. Nucleation rates J always continuously increase with undercooling from 1. 3 x 107 to 8. 72 x 107 m. 3 s- 1 for Stromboli and for Etna (9. 2 x 104 m. 3 s- 1 - 2. 9 x 107 m. 3 s- 1). However, the lowest value of J for Etna is relative to a sample in which evidence of textural coarsening have been observed and hence it represents a minimum value. Data obtained for G and J in this study are comparable with those obtained in literature, both from natural samples and from experimental studies. Data from this study can be applied to natural volcanic system to take into account the effect of deformation rate on the variation of crystallization kinetics. G and J data obtained in this work can be applied to natural volcanic system to infer residence times in magma <b>chambers</b> and magma <b>ascent</b> velocities. This work underline also the need and the importance to consider the deformation rates in the variation of the crystallization kinetics...|$|R
