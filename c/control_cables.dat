5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional <b>control</b> <b>cables.</b> The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E

5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff <b>control</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractSecondary <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} parts for protection device to get the accurate fault generated current travelling waves. This paper studies current travelling wave transmission characteristics in secondary <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> based on Alternative Transient Program (ATP). Valuable transmission characteristics of <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> have been got from the simulation results: current travelling waves which pass the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> will be distorted and some interfering current travelling waves will be generated; duration of interfering current travelling waves depends on the length of the control cable; the original fault generated current travelling wave wave-front is delayed and smoothed by the control cable; magnitude of fault generated current travelling wave wave-front has been varied by the <b>control</b> <b>cable.</b> And these transmission characteristic of <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> provide useful references to the protection algorithms based on fault generated current travelling waves...|$|R
50|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the Redstone's engine shutdown was caused by two of its electrical cables separating in the wrong order. These <b>cables</b> were a <b>control</b> <b>cable,</b> which provided various control signals, and a power cable, which provided electrical power and grounding. Both cables were plugged into the rocket at the bottom edge {{of one of its}} tail fins and would separate at liftoff. The <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was supposed to separate first, followed by the power cable. However, for this launch, the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was longer than expected—it was one designed for the military PGM-11 Redstone missile rather than the shorter cable designed for Mercury-Redstone. This <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> had been clamped to compensate for its greater length, but when the vehicle lifted off, the clamping did not work as planned and the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> separation was delayed, eventually occurring about 29 milliseconds after the power cable had separated.|$|R
40|$|During transmembrane {{signaling}} by Escherichia coli Tsr, {{changes in}} ligand occupancy in the periplasmic serine-binding domain promote asymmetric motions in a four-helix transmembrane bundle. Piston displace-ments of the signaling TM 2 helix in turn modulate the HAMP bundle on the cytoplasmic {{side of the}} membrane to control receptor output signals to the flagellar motors. A five-residue <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> joins TM 2 to the HAMP AS 1 helix and mediates conformational interactions between them. To explore <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> structural features important for signal transmission, we constructed and characterized all possible single amino acid replace-ments at the Tsr <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> residues. Only a few lesions abolished Tsr function, indicating that the chemical nature {{and size of the}} <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> side chains are not individually critical for signal control. Charged replacements at I 214 mimicked the signaling consequences of attractant or repellent stimuli, most likely through aberrant structural interactions of the mutant side chains with the membrane interfacial environment. Prolines at residues 214 to 217 also caused signaling defects, suggesting that the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> has helical character. However, proline did not disrupt function at G 213, the first <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> residue, which might serve as a structural transition between the TM 2 and AS 1 helix registers. Hydrophobic amino acids at S 217, the last <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> residue, produced attractant-mimic effects, most likely by contributing to packing interactions within the HAMP bundle. These results suggest a helix extension mechanism of Tsr transmembrane signalin...|$|R
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and <b>control</b> <b>cables</b> going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

25|$|In January 2012 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{issued an}} {{airworthiness}} directive grounding all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas and Debonairs {{equipped with a}} single pole-style yoke, having forward elevator <b>control</b> <b>cables</b> more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff and resulting concerns {{about the age of}} the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) requesting that the elevator <b>control</b> <b>cables</b> be inspected during the annual inspection.|$|E

25|$|Three prototypes were ordered, {{the first}} of which (serialed N143) flew on 3 January 1922. Initial testing {{revealed}} that performance was disappointing with low speed handling, and that the view from the cockpit was also poor. After being damaged in a crash landing, the first prototype was rebuilt with new wingtips, a revised two-bay wing and with the <b>control</b> <b>cables</b> for the elevators enclosed in the rear fuselage to reduce drag, flying in December 1922 as the Hanley Mark II. These changes improved performance, but handling was still poor. The third prototype was therefore fitted with revised slots, as well as the drag reduction changes tested on the Hanley Mark II, the revised aircraft being designated Hanley Mark III, demonstrating considerably improved handling.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty. The aircraft of which Sgt. Smith was a gunner was subjected to intense enemy antiaircraft fire and determined fighter aircraft attacks while returning from a mission over enemy-occupied continental Europe on 1 May 1943. The aircraft was hit several times by antiaircraft fire and cannon shells of the fighter aircraft, 2 of the crew were seriously wounded, the aircraft's oxygen system shot out, and several vital <b>control</b> <b>cables</b> severed when intense fires were ignited simultaneously in the radio compartment and waist sections. The situation became so acute that 3 of the crew bailed out into the comparative safety of the sea. Sgt. Smith, then on his first combat mission, elected to fight the fire by himself, administered first aid to the wounded tail gunner, manned the waist guns, and fought the intense flames alternately. The escaping oxygen fanned the fire to such intense heat that the ammunition in the radio compartment began to explode, the radio, gun mount, and camera were melted, and the compartment completely gutted. Sgt. Smith threw the exploding ammunition overboard, fought the fire until all the firefighting aids were exhausted, manned the workable guns until the enemy fighters were driven away, further administered first aid to his wounded comrade, and then by wrapping himself in protecting cloth, completely extinguished the fire by hand. This soldier's gallantry in action, undaunted bravery, and loyalty to his aircraft and fellow crewmembers, without regard for his own personal safety, is an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E
