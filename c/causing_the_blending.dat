40|$|Blends of lignin and poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) were {{obtained}} by melt extrusion. They were buried in a garden soil for up to 12 months, and the extent and mechanism of degradation were investigated by gravimetric analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) over {{the entire range of}} compositions. The PHB films were disintegrated and lost 45 wt% of mass within 12 months. This value dropped to 12 wt% of mass when only 10 wt% of lignin was present, suggesting that lignin both inhibited and slowed down the rate of PHB degradation. TGA and DSC indicated structural changes, within the lignin/PHB matrix, with burial time, while FTIR results confirmed the fragmentation of the PHB polymer. XPS revealed an accumulation of biofilms on the surface of buried samples, providing evidence of a biodegradation mechanism. Significant surface roughness was observed with PHB films due to microbial attack caused by both loosely and strongly associated micro-organisms. The presence of lignin in <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> may have inhibited the colonisation of <b>the</b> micro-organisms and <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> to be more resistant to microbial attack.

40|$|Abstract—Rotational symmetries (RoSys) {{have found}} uses in several {{computer}} graphics applications, such as global surface parameterization, geometry remeshing, texture and geometry synthesis, and nonphotorealistic visualization of surfaces. The visualization of N-way rotational symmetry (N-RoSy) fields is a challenging problem {{due to the}} ambiguities in the N directions represented by an N-way symmetry. We provide an algorithm that allows faithful and interactive representation of N-RoSy fields in the plane and on surfaces, by adapting the well-known line integral convolution (LIC) technique from vector and second-order tensor fields. Our algorithm captures N directions associated with each point in a given field by decomposing the field into multiple different vector fields, generating LIC images of these fields, and then <b>blending</b> <b>the</b> results. To address the loss of contrast <b>caused</b> by <b>the</b> <b>blending</b> of images, we observe that the pixel values in LIC images closely approximate normally distributed random variables. This allows us to use concepts from probability theory to correct the loss of contrast without the need to perform any image analysis at each frame.

The X-ray spectrum is characterized by the presence of two phase- dependent absorption lines at energies of similar to 0. 7 and similar to 1. 4 keV.

Since 1 E 1207 - 5209 is the only X-ray-emitting pulsar showing evidence of such features, we tentatively link them to the unique combination of age and energetics that characterize this object. We suggest that a young age and a low level of magnetospheric activity are favorable conditions for the detection of atomic spectral features from Z > 1 elements in neutron star atmospheres, which would be either blanketed by a thin layer of accreted hydrogen in older objects or masked by nonthermal processes in young energetic pulsars...|$|R

Polycarbonate/polyester blends are known to react during thermal processing <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> formation of copolymers to have new mechanical and thermal properties. The aim of this project was to study the crystallization, mechanical, rheological and degradation behavior of blends of PC, PTT and PBT and explain these behaviors in terms of transesterification and other plausible mechanisms.

Non isothermal crystallization kinetics of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> and neat polymers were investigated using a Perkin Elmer diamond DSC instrument having a fast response time. This thermoplastic blend was able to crystallize rapidly from the melt. Non isothermal crystallization kinetic parameters were analyzed using different numerical methods. Those parameters of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> fell between those of PTT and PBT. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> of this behavior {{could be due to}} the nature of PC as an amorphous polymer. Rheological properties of <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> were also studied at different temperatures. Rheological measurements were conducted to study the storage modulus, loss modulus, and viscosity values vis a vis the neat materials. Changes in complex viscosity (η*) and shear viscosity (η) were attributed to transesterification. The study presented in this work showed two fundamental issues that have never been addressed in the literature: one is the synthesis of a novel tricomponent system and other is how transesterification during polymer processing might affect the degradation and rheological properties of <b>the</b> tricomponent <b>blend.</b> Effect of blending on mechanical properties was carried out using tensile tests revealing a higher yield strength and elastic modulus of <b>the</b> <b>blend.</b> <b>The</b> morphology of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> and neat polymers was studied using Scanning electron microscope (SEM), showing immiscibility of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> components. X ray analysis was carried out to determine the crystalline nature of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> vis a vis neat polymers.

40|$|In this paper, we {{reported}} {{on the influence of}} PCL on the cold crystallization behaviour of PLA in different PLA/PCL <b>blends,</b> and on <b>the</b> influence of <b>blending</b> with PLA on the PCL crystallization behaviour and kinetics. The presence of PCL in <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> had a strong influence on PLA cold crystallization, and the extent of this influence was determined by <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> morphology. Successive self-nucleation and annealing (SSA) analysis of PCL crystallization in <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> showed that <b>the</b> presence and amount of PLA in <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> had a strong influence on the crystal size distribution in the main crystalline fraction of PCL. A kinetic analysis of the crystallization of neat PCL and PCL in <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> showed that <b>the</b> crystallization mechanism of the neat PCL changed from instantaneous/heterogeneous nucleation and two-dimensional growth to sporadic/homogeneous nucleation and two-dimensional growth with decreasing crystallization temperature, while for PCL in <b>the</b> <b>blends,</b> <b>the</b> mechanism over the whole crystallization temperature range was that of instantaneous/heterogeneous nucleation and three-dimensional growth into spherulites. PCL in <b>the</b> <b>blends</b> also crystallized significantly faster than neat PCL, but there was little difference between the crystallization rates of PCL in <b>the</b> different <b>blends.</b> <b>The</b> Center for Advanced Materials at Qatar University funded this research and provided the required infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the compatibilizers, P(LLA-co-εCL) and P(LLA-b-εCL), on the {{morphology}} and hydrolysis of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) was investigated. An addition of P(LLA-co-εCL) or P(LLA-b-εCL) into <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> could enhance <b>the</b> compatibility between the dispersed PCL domains and the PLLA matrix. The size of the PCL domains in the PLLA/ PCL (70 / 30) blend containing P(LLA-co-εCL) reduced more significantly {{with an increase in}} the content of the compatibilizer than that in <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> containing P(LLA-b-εCL). <b>The</b> molecular weight of <b>the</b> PLLA/PCL <b>blend</b> films compatibilized with P(LLA-co-εCL) or P(LLA-b-εCL) decreased during the hydrolysis and the decrease of the molecular weight of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> films compatibilized with P(LLA-co-εCL) was much more significant than that of <b>the</b> <b>blend</b> films compatibilized with P(LLA-b-εCL). close 394...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{biodegradable}} microparticles of silk fibroin (SF) /starch blends were prepared by a simple water-in-oil emulsion solvent diffusion technique. SF/starch blended solution and ethyl acetate were used as water and oil phases, respectively. The influence of SF/starch ratios on characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>blended</b> microparticles was investigated. The SF conformation of microparticle matrices from FTIR analysis was changed from random coil to &# 946;-sheet form by <b>blending</b> with starch. <b>The</b> <b>blended</b> microparticles had lower dissolution in water than those of SF and starch microparticles. The 1 / 3 (w/w) SF/starch <b>blended</b> microparticles exhibited <b>the</b> lowest dissolution. The SF and starch microparticles showed irregular and deflated shapes, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>blended</b> microparticles were nearly spherical in shapes and smaller sizes. Thermal stability of <b>the</b> <b>blended</b> microparticles slightly increased with <b>the</b> starch <b>blended</b> ratio. <b>The</b> results suggested that SF conformational transition, thermal stability, morphology and dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>blended</b> microparticles can be adjusted by varying <b>the</b> <b>blended</b> ratio...|$|R
