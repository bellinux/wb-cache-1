50|$|The Hanthawaddy command {{had planned}} to fight on the astrologically chosen date of Wednesday, 4th waxing of Late Tagu 776 ME (Wednesday, 13 March 1415). That day, Hanthawaddy forces led by three sons of Razadarit—Binnya Dhammaraza, Binnya Ran I and Binnya Kyan—approached modern Dala-Twante. Minye Kyawswa pulled back from his siege of Syriam to meet the enemy forces. His brother Min Nyo was his deputy. Minye Kyawswa {{on the back of}} his {{favorite}} elephant Nga <b>Chit</b> <b>Khaing</b> led the charge. He broke through several enemy lines but was soon surrounded. His elephant, which had been severely wounded, flung him off. Though heavily wounded, the crown prince of Ava refused treatment, and died shortly after. He was 24.|$|E
50|$|Circa October 1414, Minye Kyawswa {{launched}} the invasion with a joint naval and land attack on Fort Khebaung (north of Hinthada). But Hanthawaddy troops {{put up a}} remarkable defense, inflicting heavy casualties on the invaders. After the first two attempts failed, Minye Kyawswa ordered another attack, declaring that anyone who failed to charge would be executed. Then, he on his favorite war elephant, Nga <b>Chit</b> <b>Khaing,</b> along with his elite regiment of 800 men, led the charge. The fort subsequently fell. The fall of Khebaung shocked Razadarit who had heavily invested in its defenses. He immediately sent an army to retake Khebaung, and sent another army to attack Toungoo (Taungoo). But neither attack materialized. The Hanthawaddy king evacuated to Martaban (Mottama) in October/November 1414.|$|E
