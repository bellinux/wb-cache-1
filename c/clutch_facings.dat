40|$|During the {{engagement}} of a dry clutch system heat is generated at the friction surfaces {{and the temperature}} rise caused by this heat depends on the thermal properties of the <b>clutch</b> <b>facings.</b> Usually these facings are made of polymer matrix composite friction materials {{and they have a}} low thermal conductivity. Any increase in the thermal conductivity of these materials is expected to reduce the contact surface temperature and improve their tribological performance. The thermal conductivity of six polymer matrix composite friction materials was measured at room temperature, 100 ºC, 200 ºC, and 300 ºC using the laser flash diffusivity technique with density corrections for these temperatures. The wear rate of the materials was measured in the low energy test, medium energy test, and high energy test according to standard norms for <b>clutch</b> <b>facings</b> testing. The correlation analysis between thermal conductivity and wear rate for the materials and conditions studied did not confirm the expected relation between high thermal conductivity and low wear rate. Wear is a system property and it can not be considered as a material property. Obviously there are other variables which were not studied on this work with a more significant impact on the wear behavior of the materials...|$|E

An artificial neural network has been used to obtain a comprehensive view of the influence of the main sliding parameters. The study has also taken into account the not weak influence of the sliding acceleration to improve the friction coefficient prediction during transient operations of these dry friction based devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{cushion spring}} plays an {{important}} role in an automotive dry-clutch system. It strongly influences the clutch torque transmission from the engine to the driveline through its non-linear load–deflection curve. Therefore, knowledge of the cushion spring compression behaviour is crucial to improve the gearshift performance in an automated manual transmission. Furthermore, the cushion spring compression behaviour is influenced by the temperature because of the frictional heat generation of the <b>clutch</b> <b>facings</b> with the flywheel and the pressure plate surfaces during the engagement phase. In this paper an analysis of the load–deflection curve, taking into account the thermal load to which it is subjected, of a typical passenger car cushion spring is proposed. Six temperatures, in addition to room temperature, were analysed to investigate how the cushion spring load–deflection curve depends on the temperature...|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{chemical}} and thermal treatment of flax fibres are developed: dry, wet, thermal, and oxidation process. The appropriate techniques are established. Scaling up to production size is possible, {{and is being}} realized in 2 cases. The aim was to produce technical fibres of constant quality and to modify yarns starting from flax raw material. Application is planned as reinforcement and process fibres in pressed disk and drum brake linings {{as well as in}} pressed and coiled <b>clutch</b> <b>facings</b> for cars, trucks, rail vehicles, and industrial devices. During the project pilot plants were designed and built for the a. m. processes. These were used to produce series of differently modified flax short fibres and yarns which were delivered to the project partners. Based on the requirements and the feed-back of the manufacturers and on accompanying laboratory research pilot plants and techniques have been optimized. Several fibre types from the SETRALIT "t"r"a"d"e"m"a"r"k FT, FNT, and FG series are technically, ecologically, and economically advantageous when used in friction linings as a substitute for asbestos and synthetic fibres. Mixtures of SETRALIT with aramides may be used, too. Use of standard friction linings containing flax fibres in the automative and other industries can be expected in the medium term. The SETRALIT procedures can be applied on all plant fibres like hemp, sisal etc., and are suitable for manufacturing technical short fibres used in other industrial sectors (e. g. construction materials, plastics, gaskets).

40|$|An Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) {{system is}} {{generally}} constituted by a dry or wet clutch assembly and a multi-speed gearbox, both equipped with electro-mechanical or electro-hydraulic actuators, which {{are driven by}} a control unit, the transmission control unit (TCU). The operating modes of AMTs are usually two: semiautomatic, with the driver requesting a sequential gear shift {{by means of a}} proper interface or fully automatic. In both cases, after the gear shift command, the TCU manages the shifting steps, through suitable signals to the engine, the clutch assembly and the gearbox, according to current engine regime, driving conditions and selected program. For market sectors such as large-series and ecological cars, AMT has the advantage of lower weight and higher efficiency with respect to other typologies of automatic transmissions. Furthermore, an AMT is directly derived from a manual one through the integration of actuators; then, development and production costs are generally lower than other automatic transmissions, while the reliability and durability are at highest level. For high class sport cars, vehicle dynamic performances and driving quality can further improve the results of the automatic transmissions [1]. This transmission type is also an affordable and robust solution, but the quality of the vehicle propulsion as perceived by the driver is largely dependent {{on the quality of the}} control strategies. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for AMTs have shown that uncertainties in clutch torque characteristic can severely affect the performance of the clutch engagement: modelling in detail the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial issue in order to design robust engagement control strategies [2, 3]. This paper aims at investigate the temperature influence on the dry clutch transmission characteristic through the study of physical models which separately taking into account the thermal effect on the frictional behaviour of the <b>clutch</b> <b>facings,</b> the throwout bearing characteristic positions, the cushion spring load-deflection curve. The outcome of this analysis could become a key element for designers of automated clutches and control engineers to recast the cushion spring conception to overcome the poor engagement performance exhibited by AMTs after repeated gear shifting...|$|E
