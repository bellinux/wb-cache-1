50|$|Meat {{preservation}} as {{a survival}} technique {{dates back to}} ancient times. Indigenous peoples of Southern Africa, such as the Khoikhoi, preserved meat by slicing it into strips, curing it with salt, and hanging it up to dry. European seafarers preserved meat for their long journeys by curing meat in salt or brine. European settlers (Dutch, German, French) who arrived in southern Africa in the early 17th century used vinegar in the curing process, as well as saltpetre (potassium nitrate). The potassium nitrate in saltpeter kills Clostridium botulinum, the deadly bacterium that causes botulism while the acidity of the vinegar inhibits its growth. According to the World Health Organisation, C. botulinum will not grow in acidic conditions (pH less than 4.6), therefore the toxin will not be formed in acidic foods. The antimicrobial properties of certain spices have also been drawn upon since ancient times. The spices introduced to biltong by the Dutch include pepper, coriander, and cloves. Recently, a research group at the University of Beira Interior in Portugal tested the antimicrobial properties of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> (coriander {{being one of the}} main spices in the most basic of biltong recipes) against 12 bacterial strains, and found that 10 of the 12 strains of bacteria were killed with a relatively mild concentration of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> (1.6%). In the two strains that were not effectively killed, Bacillus cereus and Enterococcus faecalis, the <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> reduced their growth significantly.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted to {{examine the effect of}} petroselinic acid, found in <b>coriander</b> <b>oil,</b> on fillet, hepatocyte and whole body FA composition and Δ 6 desaturase gene expression in hepatocytes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed vegetable oil (VO) based diets containing no fishmeal (FM) or fish oil (FO). In the first experiment, rainbow trout were fed one of eight diets containing fish, flax, canola or Camelina sativa oil with or without <b>coriander</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>Coriander</b> <b>oil</b> in the diet increased concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22 : 6 n- 3, P < 0. 05) in the fillet. There was a trend to increased 20 : 5 n- 3 + 22 : 6 n- 3 / 20 : 4 n- 6 ratios when <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> was added to the diet (P = 0. 067). The second trial set out to investigate the effects of varied levels of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> in canola oil based diets, on i) the capacity of rainbow trout hepatocytes to desaturate, elongate and esterify [1 - 14 C] α-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3; ALA) and [1 - 14 C] linoleic acid (18 : 2 n- 6, LA), ii) reducing the production of 20 : 4 n- 6 in hepatocytes and iii) gene expression. This experiment demonstrated a significant increase in 22 : 6 n- 3 (P = 0. 011) and a decrease 20 : 4 n- 6 (P = 0. 023) in rainbow trout hepatocytes. Furthermore, there was a three-fold decrease in acetate for the [1 - 14 C] 18 : 2 n- 6 and nearly a two-fold increase for the [1 - 14 C] 18 : 3 n- 3 substrate when coriander was added at increasing levels, illustrating an increase in peroxisomal β-oxidation. Relative gene expression of ∆ 6 desaturase decreased with addition of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> at the 0. 5 inclusion level of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil.</b> The final experiment was conducted to determine if bypassing the first ∆ 6 desaturase and rate-limiting step in the n- 3 FA pathway causes increased conversion of stearidonic acid (SDA; 18 : 4 n- 3) to 20 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3. Rainbow trout were fed one of six diets containing either fish, conventional linseed (flax), or SDA enriched linseed oil (LO) with and without <b>coriander</b> <b>oil.</b> Inclusion of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> did not affect any growth or feed intake parameters of rainbow trout. However, the addition of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> caused a significant increase in whole body 22 : 6 n- 3 and 20 : 4 n- 6 concentrations in fish fed SDA enriched LO with <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> (SDA+C) compared to fish fed conventional linseed oil (LO). These results suggest that petroselinic acid, found in <b>coriander</b> <b>oil,</b> has the ability to influence FA bioconversion of the n- 3 and n- 6 FA pathway thereby increasing 22 : 6 n- 3 and possibly 20 : 5 n- 3 in rainbow trout and reducing ARA when fed VO-based diets. Furthermore, it seems as though petroselinic acid causes improved bioconversion to 22 : 6 n- 3 when the first ∆ 6 desaturase is bypassed.

40|$|ABSTRACT Present {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of the dietary supplementation of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> on broiler performance, blood characteristics, microbiota, and small intestine morphology measurements. A number of one-day-old broiler chickens (Ross 308) were allocated to five treatments, with four replicates according to a completely randomized design (CRD). Birds were offered either a corn-soybean meal basal diet (control), or the basal diet supplemented with 600 mg/kg of a flavophospholipol antibiotic, 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg coriander essential oil. At 42 days of age, two birds per replicate were selected for blood collection, slaughtered, and its intestinal microbiota and morphology were investigated. The results indicated that weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio significantly improved by the dietary inclusion of the <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> and antibiotic compared with the control treatment (p 0. 05). Birds fed the <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> and antibiotic diets had lower populations of Escherichia coli than control group in cecum (p< 0. 05). The dietary treatments influenced the morphology of small intestinal villi. Birds fed antibiotic and coriander essential oil presented higher villus height and crypt depth compared with those in the control treatment (p< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} hospital-acquired infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, {{coupled with the}} low efficacy of drugs and rising treatment costs has created interest in the potential antimicrobial properties of natural products. The main objective of this work {{was to determine the}} effect of coriander essential oil on Acinetobacter baumannii in different growth phases, as well as its ability to inhibit the formation or eradication of biofilms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> using a microdilution broth susceptibility assay was determined. The effects of different concentrations of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> (ranging from 0. 125 to 4 ×MIC) on biofilm formation and on established biofilm were tested using 96 -well microtiter plates. Crystal violet assay was used as indicator of total biofilm biomass and the biofilm viability was assessed with a XTT staining method. It was found that <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> presented significant antibacterial activity against all tested strains of A. baumannii, with MIC values between 1 and 4 μL/mL. The MBC values were the same as the MIC, being an indicator of the bactericidal activity of this essential oil. In what concerns the effect of this essential oil on biofilm formation inhibition was observed of at least 85 % of biomass formation by all A. baumannii strains using 2 ×MIC of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil,</b> in addition to a decrease in the metabolic activity of the cells. After exposure to <b>coriander</b> <b>oil,</b> a decrease in 24 h and 48 h-old biofilm biomass and metabolism was seen for all tested concentrations, even with sub-inhibitory concentrations. Coriander essential oil proved to have a significant antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity and should be considered in the development of future disinfectants to control A. baumannii dissemination.

40|$|In a {{large number}} of {{epidemiological}} studies investigating relationship between diet and cancer, a protective effect of the consumption of vegetables and fruits on various types of cancer has been found. This protective effect has been generally attributed to the antioxidative capacities of the constituents present in these foods. The search for natural agents that protect against tumorigenesis is important to those at risk by virtue of environmental pollution or health-related treatment as well as for scientific study of the mechanism of the potential therapeutic application of these agents. The present research is a trial to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of oral administration of oil extracted from the leaves of Coriandrum sativum (1 mg/kg) in mice inoculated with Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma with or without exposure to fractionated doses of gamma irradiation (up to 6 Gy). Significant increase in malondialdehye (MDA) level accompanied with significant decrease in catalase activity in both liver and tumor tissue in the group of mice, bearing tumor while total protein content was increased in tumor tissue. Serum iron was inversely proportional to the level of transferrin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels. Application of <b>coriander</b> <b>oil</b> to mice bearing tumor caused partial amelioration in the assayed parameters.

40|$|Foodborne {{diseases}} remain common {{around the}} world with Campylobacteriosis being the most commonly reported zoonosis in the European Union in 2013. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the main species associated with human illness. Furthermore, Campylobacter can develop biofilms which is becoming a major problem within the food industry. In addition to foodborne pathogens, oxidation is a non-microbial cause of deterioration of food causing loss of quality and safety. Thus, there is an urgent need in the food industry for new and effective strategies that can help prevent food contamination, spoilage and consequently, foodborne illnesses. Essential oils are known for their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and are already widely used in the food industry. So, the aim of this work was to study the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of <b>coriander</b> essential <b>oil</b> and its major compound linalool against C. jejuni and C. coli strains, as well as their effect in the quorum sensing (QS) system and their potential as antioxidants. Our results, demonstrated that both compounds have anti- Campylobacter activity, inhibited in vitro biofilm formation and promoted biofilm dispersion even at sub-MIC concentrations and interfered with the QS system through the inhibition of violacein production. Moreover, the essential oil and linalool were shown to have radical scavenging properties and lipid peroxidation inhibition ability which could make them potential alternatives to synthetic antioxidants. In sum, our results demonstrated the antibacterial, anti-biofilm, anti-QS and antioxidant potentials of the <b>coriander</b> essential <b>oil</b> and its major compound, linalool, suggesting that they could be used in the food industry to enhance shelf life of food products and increase food safety without requiring chemical additives or preservatives.

40|$|The {{descriptive}} terminology and sensory prolife of four {{samples of}} Italian salami were determined using a methodology {{based on the}} Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA). A sensory panel consensually defined sensory descriptors, their respective reference materials, and the descriptive evaluation ballot. Twelve individuals were selected as judges and properly trained. They used the following criteria: discriminating power, reproducibility, and individual consensus. Twelve descriptors were determined showing similarities and differences among the Italian salami samples. Each descriptor was evaluated using a 10 cm non-structured scale. The data were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey test, and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The salami with <b>coriander</b> essential <b>oil</b> (T 3) had lower rancid taste and rancid odor, whereas the control (T 1) showed high values of these sensory attributes. Regarding brightness, T 4 showed the best result. For the other attributes, T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4 were similar...|$|R
