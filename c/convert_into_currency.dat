The Treasury began its own gold sterilization policy in order to stop inflation from potentially increasing due to an increase in inflow of gold into the U.S. soon after the Fed enacted the same policy. Gold holdings more than doubled in the period of 1935 to 1940. This lasted for 16 months from 1936 to 1938. In more efforts, as of the end of 1936, the Treasury noted its gold purchases as part of [...] "inactive" [...] account.

40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of growth}} and development {{is an important issue}} in economics, because these phenomena are closely related to sustainability. We address growth and development from a network perspective in which economic systems are represented as flow networks and analyzed using ecological network analysis (ENA). The Beijing economic system is used as a case study and 11 input-output (I-O) tables for 1985 - 2010 are <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> <b>currency</b> networks. ENA is used to calculate system-level indices to quantify the growth and development of Beijing. The contributions of each direct flow toward growth and development in 2010 are calculated and their implications for sustainable development are discussed. The results show that during 1985 - 2010, growth was the main attribute of the Beijing economic system. Although the system grew exponentially, its development fluctuated within only a small range. The results suggest that system ascendency should be increased in order to favor more sustainable development. Ascendency can be augmented in two ways: (1) strengthen those pathways with positive contributions to increasing ascendency and (2) weaken those with negative effects...|$|R

50|$|Monetary {{compensatory}} amounts (MCAs) were border {{measures in the}} EU consisting of taxes and subsidies formerly applicable to intra-EC trade in agricultural and food products for which intervention prices were set.

This gave rise to price differentials between member nations (in market ECUs) that would influence intra-EC trade if not offset by the MCAs.

In the United States, {{for the period of}} this study, all high-powered money held by the nonbanking public has been in the form of currency and vice versa; the two concepts pertain to the same quantity. Under those circum-stances the currency ratio indicates the distribution of money balances between deposits and currency and also of high-powered money between banks and the public, a dual role which greatly simplifies the analysis.

40|$|Many {{economies of}} the former Soviet Union have {{experienced}} cash shortages: people with demand and savings deposits in the banking system are unable to <b>convert</b> them <b>into</b> <b>currency.</b> Usually this is attributed to the common use of the ruble. The author argues otherwise. According to him: (a) cash shortages are manifestations of financial disintermediation: the banking sector is unable to attract enough voluntary deposits; (b) cash shortages allow the government to hold inflationary pressures in check; (c) solutions to the cash shortage problems that rely on printing newcurrency will lead to accelerating inflation. More appropriate solutions (increasing the nominal interest rates, for example) involve reversing the economic incentives to financial disintermediation. Excess demands for cash reflect conditions in financial markets. The phenomenon of cash shortage {{is related to the}} concept of shallow formal financial markets. This shallowness is recent in the former Soviet Union. The burst of inflation in early 1992 removed the"ruble overhang"and greatly reduced all indicators of financial depth. Continuing shallowness is a direct consequence of financial disintermediation because of negative real interest rates.
