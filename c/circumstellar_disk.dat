25|$|An {{accretion}} disk is a structure (often a <b>circumstellar</b> <b>disk)</b> formed by diffused material in orbital motion around a massive central body. The central body is typically a star. Friction causes orbiting {{material in the}} disk to spiral inward towards the central body. Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise {{the temperature of the}} material, causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass. Accretion disks of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared; those around neutron stars and black holes in the X-ray part of the spectrum. The study of oscillation modes in {{accretion disk}}s is referred to as diskoseismology.|$|E
25|$|HR 8799 {{is a young}} (~30 million-year-old) {{main-sequence star}} located 129 light years (39 parsecs) away from Earth in the {{constellation}} of Pegasus, with roughly 1.5 times the Sun's mass and 4.9 times its luminosity. It {{is part of a}} system that also contains a debris disk and at least four massive planets. Those planets, along with Fomalhaut b, were the first extrasolar planets whose orbital motion was confirmed via direct imaging. The designation HR 8799 is the star's identifier in the Bright Star Catalogue. The star is a Gamma Doradus variable: its luminosity changes because of non-radial pulsations of its surface. The star is also classified as a Lambda Boötis star, which means its surface layers are depleted in iron peak elements. This {{may be due to the}} accretion of metal-poor circumstellar gas. It is the only known star which is simultaneously a Gamma Doradus variable, a Lambda Boötis type, and a Vega-like star (a star with excess infrared emission caused by a <b>circumstellar</b> <b>disk).</b>|$|E

Since A-type stars like Beta Pictoris tend to radiate most of their energy at the blue end of the spectrum, this implied the presence of cool matter in orbit around the star, which would radiate at infrared wavelengths and produce the excess.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars reside in binary systems. As these systems are young, their properties may contain an imprint of the star formation process at intermediate masses. However, these systems are generally spatially unresolved, {{making it difficult to}} probe their circumstellar environment to search for manifestations of their formation process, such as accretion disks. Here we investigate the formation mechanism of Herbig Ae/Be (HAe/Be) binary systems by studying the relative orientation of their binary orbits and <b>circumstellar</b> <b>disks.</b> We present linear spectropolarimetric observations of HAe/Be stars over the Halpha line, which are used to determine the orientation of their <b>circumstellar</b> <b>disks.</b> In conjunction with data from the literature, we obtain a sample of 20 binaries with known disk position angles (PAs). We compare our disk PA data to a model to investigate whether HAe/Be binary systems and their disks are co-planar. Moreover, in the light of a recent suggestion that some HAe/Be star spectropolarimetric signatures may not necessarily be related to <b>circumstellar</b> <b>disks,</b> we re-assess the relationship between spectropolarimetric signatures and disk PAs. We do this by comparing spectropolarimetric and high spatial resolution observations of young stellar objects. We find that spectropolarimetric observations of pre-main-sequence stars do trace <b>circumstellar</b> <b>disks.</b> This finding is significant above the 3 sigma level. Using this result, our data are entirely consistent with the situation in which HAe/Be binary systems and <b>circumstellar</b> <b>disks</b> are co-planar, while random orientations can be rejected at the 2. 2 sigma level. We conclude that HAe/Be binary systems and the disks around the primaries are likely to be co-planar, which is consistent with the notion that these systems form via monolithic collapse and subsequent disk fragmentation (abridged).
