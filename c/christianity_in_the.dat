5|$|The embassy was probably, at that time, {{part of a}} plan {{to diversify}} and {{increase}} trade with foreign countries, before the participation of Christians in the Osaka rebellion triggered a radical reaction from the shogunate, with the interdiction of <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territories it directly controlled, in 1614.|$|E

5|$|In 1500, the Portuguese {{explorer}} Pedro Álvares Cabral {{arrived at}} Anjediva in North Canara with eight Franciscan missionaries {{under the leadership}} of Frei Henrique Soares de Coimbra. On arrival they converted 22 or 23 natives to <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mangalore region. In 1526, during the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio, the Portuguese took possession of Mangalore whereupon Portuguese Franciscans began slowly spreading Christianity in Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, Baldwin {{addressed}} the John Birch Society {{on the second}} day of its 50th anniversary. At the event he discussed the role of <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States public life and delivered his stump speech. He attacked globalist entities such as NAFTA, the International Criminal Court, the Law of the Sea Treaty and the Security and Prosperity Partnership as well as calling for the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence of Canterbury as his {{successor}} to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office. Although {{at the time of}} Augustine's death, 26 May 604, the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Isles. Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself. Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.|$|E
50|$|After this, Verbiest and {{the emperor}} formed a real friendship, with the Jesuit {{teaching}} him geometry, philosophy and music. He was frequently {{invited to the}} palace and to accompany the Emperor on his expeditions throughout the empire. He translated the first six books of Euclid into Manchu and took every opportunity to introduce <b>Christianity.</b> <b>In</b> response, <b>the</b> Emperor elevated him to the highest grade of the mandarinate and granted permission for him to preach <b>Christianity</b> anywhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> empire.|$|R

5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.|$|E
5|$|Converting to evangelical <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also made {{a great deal of money}} and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century mendicant orders—the Franciscans and the Dominicans—who swore vows {{of poverty}} and earned their living by begging, were {{approved}} by the papacy. Religious {{groups such as the}} Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle 12th and early 13th centuries, but they were condemned as heretical by the papacy. Others joined the Cathars, another heretical movement condemned by the papacy. In 1209, a crusade was preached against the Cathars, the Albigensian Crusade, which in combination with the medieval Inquisition, eliminated them.|$|E

50|$|Before <b>the</b> {{advent of}} <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> Ipele, <b>the</b> indigenes worshipped several gods {{one of which}} was Obalufon, a deified Oni of Ife. Obalufon was {{regarded}} as a higher god just below Oghodua (Olodumare) the Almighty.|$|R
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the colony's ethnic Chinese {{population}} was severely undereducated, unable to enter schools for either Europeans or natives. Aged ten, Lie {{was enrolled in a}} Calvinist missionary school run by Christiaan Albers. This school had roughly 60male students, mostly Chinese. Under Albers, a fluent speaker of Sundanese, he received his formal education in a curriculum which included the sciences, language, and Christianity– the schools were meant to promote <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East Indies, and students were required to pray before class. Lie, as with most students, did not convert, although biographer Tio Ie Soei writes that an understanding of Christianity likely affected his world view.|$|E
5|$|Legend {{from the}} {{apocryphal}} Gospel of Thomas and other ancient documents suggests that Saint Thomas the Apostle preached in Bactria, which is today northern Afghanistan. The Nestorians planted <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, {{and there have}} been nine bishops and dioceses in the region, including Herat (424-1310), Farah (544-1057), Kandahar, and Balkh. This early establishment of Christianity was overcome by Muslim invasions in the 7th century, though the territory was not substantially controlled by Muslims until the 9th and 10th centuries. In 1581 and 1582 respectively, the Jesuits Montesserat of Spain and Bento de Góis of Portugal were warmly welcomed by the Islamic Emperor Akbar, but there was no lasting Jesuit presence in the country.|$|E
5|$|Since Duke Mislav of the Duchy of Croatia made Klis Fortress {{the seat}} of his throne {{in the middle of the}} 9th century, the {{fortress}} served as {{the seat of}} many Croatia's rulers. The reign of his successor, Duke Trpimir I, the founder of the Croatian royal House of Trpimirović, is significant for spreading <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Duchy of Croatia. He largely expanded the Klis Fortress, and in Rižinice, in the valley under the fortress, he built a church and the first Benedictine monastery in Croatia. During the reign of the first Croatian king, Tomislav, Klis and Biograd na Moru were his chief residences.|$|E

5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, {{given the fact that}} we do not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E
5|$|The Viking {{invasions of}} the 8th and 9th centuries reintroduced paganism to North-East England, leading {{in turn to}} another wave of conversion. Indigenous Scandinavian beliefs were very similar to other Germanic groups, with a pantheon of gods {{including}} Odin, Thor and Ullr, combined with a belief in a final, apocalyptic battle called Ragnarok. The Norse settlers in England were converted relatively quickly, assimilating their beliefs into <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decades following the occupation of York, which the Archbishop had survived. The process was largely complete by the early 10th century and enabled England's leading Churchmen {{to negotiate with the}} warlords. As the Norse in mainland Scandinavia started to convert, many mainland rulers recruited missionaries from England to assist in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata in the west of modern Scotland is traditionally attributed {{to the work of}} St. Columba. However, given the close cultural and linguistic ties, and the short distance across the seas, between the region and Ireland, which had begun to be Christianised from at least the fifth century, it is likely that Christianity had already reached this part of modern Scotland before his arrival in the mid-sixth century. In this view, the role of clergy owing their loyalty to Iona and elsewhere was to consolidate the position of <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region and beyond and to provide pastoral care for the people there.|$|E
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, and <b>the</b> rise of <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> Spain, <b>the</b> circus saw more use than the other Roman {{structures}} of Mérida, since racing was considered less sinful than spectacles performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theater and Amphitheater.|$|R

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{religion of}} the Māori population was animistic, but {{with the arrival of}} missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Māori population converted to <b>Christianity.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2013 census, 2,595 Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs. The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rātana church has adherents among Māori. Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} was probably built by king Tiridates I {{in the first}} century AD as a temple to the sun god Mihr. After Armenia's conversion to <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early fourth century, it was converted into a royal summer house of Khosrovidukht, the sister of Tiridates III. According to some scholars it was not a temple but a tomb and thus survived the universal destruction of pagan structures. It collapsed in a 1679 earthquake. Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations at the site in early and mid-20th century and its eventual reconstruction between 1969 and 1975. It {{is one of the main}} tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of Armenian neopaganism.|$|E
5|$|Æthelhere {{witnessed}} {{the fortunes of}} his dynasty {{during the years of}} Rædwald's rule and afterwards. The East Angles under Rædwald had been converted to Christianity, but in around 627, during the reign of his son Eorpwald, they reverted to heathenism. This occurred after Eorpwald was killed by a pagan soon after his succession and baptism. The assassin, Ricberht, may then have ruled the kingdom for a few years, to be succeeded by Sigeberht, who re-established <b>Christianity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kingdom and became the first East Anglian king to act as a patron of the Church.|$|E
