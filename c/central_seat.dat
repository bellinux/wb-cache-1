Lloyd continued as a constituency MP until October 2012, when he stepped down to contest the 2012 Police and Crime Commissioner elections for Greater Manchester Police area. He was elected and assumed the position in November 2012.|$|E
25|$|Harding {{attempted}} {{to win a}} seat in the House of Representatives twice during his tenure as a senator. In the 1993 general election, he {{attempted to}} unseat incumbent representative John A. Junor, a PNP member occupying the Manchester <b>Central</b> <b>seat.</b> Junor won the election, 5,980 to 4,356, a difference of 1,624 votes. In the 1997 election, Harding attempted to unseat another sitting PNP representative, Horace O. Clue, as part of a three way race for the Saint Andrew East Rural seat that Harding contested twenty years prior. Securing 4,819 votes, Harding came second in the voting, behind Horace Clue's 6,769 votes, but well ahead of the 1,026 votes secured by National Democratic Movement candidate Andre Foote. The People's National Party won both elections overall.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} the city and country was the <b>central</b> <b>seat</b> of the dualistic Zoroastrian religion, the founder of which, Zoroaster, died within the walls {{according}} to the Persian poet Firdowsi. Armenian sources state that the Arsacid Dynasty of the Parthian Empire established its capital in Balkh. There is a long-standing tradition that an ancient shrine of Anahita was to be found here, a temple so rich it invited plunder. Alexander the Great married Roxana of Bactria after killing the king of Balkh. The city was {{the capital of the}} Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and was besieged for three years by the Seleucid Empire (208–206 BC). After the demise of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, it was ruled by Indo-Scythians, Parthians, Indo-Parthians, Kushan Empire, Indo-Sassanids, Kidarites, Hephthalite Empire and Sassanid Persians before the arrival of the Arabs.|$|E

2500|$|A {{published}} EU {{report in}} early 2012 made an urgent {{call for the}} EU to adopt a more [...] "active and visible" [...] implementation of its policy towards Israel and the peace process. A potentially radical proposal for [...] "appropriate EU legislation to prevent/discourage financial transactions in support of settlement activity" [...] was the first indication that some member states were seeking European divestment from businesses {{actively involved in the}} settlement enterprise. Under one interpretation of the proposal, the Commission would use legislation to force companies in Europe to break their links with businesses involved in settlement construction and commercial activities. The report also recommended the EU prepare a blacklist of settlers involved in violence, in order to possibly ban them from entering EU member states, encourage PLO activity and representation in east Jerusalem, and for senior EU officials to avoid being escorted by Israeli representatives or security personnel in east Jerusalem. The issue of the PLO/Fatah and East Jerusalem has been a flashpoint between Israel and many EU countries because EU diplomats have often met their Palestinian counterparts in the city but have rarely met with Israeli government officials there (even in West Jerusalem, which the EU sees as a current and future part of Israel), which also ties into how the EU has tried to present Tel Aviv as the Israeli capital even though the <b>central</b> <b>seat</b> of government and most government facilities are located in Jerusalem.|$|E

The Selman Stërmasi Stadium was built in 1956 and had been named the 'Dinamo' Stadium till 1991 when it was permanently given its new name. The Football Association of Albania and the club decided to name the stadium post mortem after the eminent KF Tirana player, coach and president, Selman Stërmasi. The stadium has a capacity of 12,500 (of which 6000 seated) and has ended a long phase of construction, involving development of the main pitch, <b>central</b> <b>seated</b> area, facilities around the ground and general lineaments. There are still improvements expected to be made soon, as side seated areas, an electronic clock and a KF Tirana shopping centre just under <b>central</b> <b>seating.</b> The internal facilities include a press conference room, journalists' corner and modern showers.

Yet it is evidently disliked by the multitude and those whom the multitude permits to lead it." ...|$|E
6000|$|By Warburg Ferdinand had got the Diemel; on {{the north}} bank of which he spread himself out, impassable to Broglio, who lay trying on the {{opposite}} bank:--"No Hanover by this road." [...] Broglio thereupon drew back a little; pushed out circuitously from his right wing, which reaches far eastward of Ferdinand, a considerable Brigade,--circuitously, round by the Weser-Fulda Country, and beyond the embouchure of Diemel,--to try it by that method. Got actually a few miles into Hanoverian territory, by that method; laid hold of Gottingen, also of Munden, which secures a road thither: and at Gottingen there, [...] "ever since August 4th," [...] Broglio has been throwing up works, and shooting out hussar-parties to a good distance; intending, it would seem, to maintain himself, and to be mischievous, in that post. Would, in fact, fain entice Ferdinand across the Weser, to help Gottingen. [...] "Across Weser, yes;--and so leave Broglio free to take Lippstadt from me, as he might after a short siege," [...] thinks Ferdinand always; [...] "which would beautifully shorten Broglio's communication [quite direct then, and without interruption, {{all the way to}} Wesel], and make Hanover itself, Hanover and Brunswick, the <b>central</b> <b>Seat</b> of War!"

5000|$|On {{either side}} of the <b>central,</b> <b>seated</b> figure are baboons with upraised arms, wearing the lunar disk headdress, which {{represent}} the Egyptian god Thoth or Djehuty. In Egyptian pictiographic writings Thoth was often placed opposite Re, and represented a type of [...] "night sun". Thoth was associated with truth and integrity, the regulation of time, record keeping and possession of secret knowledge. For example, Thoth provided Isis with the secret word formula she needed to resurrect Osiris.|$|R
6000|$|One of Thor's expeditions, to Utgard (the Outer Garden, <b>central</b> <b>seat</b> of Jotun-land), is {{remarkable}} in this respect. Thialfi was with him, and Loke. After various adventures, they entered upon Giant-land; wandered over plains, wild uncultivated places, among stones and trees. At nightfall they noticed a house; {{and as the}} door, which indeed formed one whole side of the house, was open, they entered. It was a simple habitation; one large hall, altogether empty. They stayed there. Suddenly {{in the dead of}} the night loud noises alarmed them. Thor grasped his hammer; stood in the door, prepared for fight. His companions within ran hither and thither in their terror, seeking some outlet in that rude hall; they found a little closet at last, and took refuge there. Neither had Thor any battle: for, lo, in the morning {{it turned out that the}} noise had been only the snoring of a certain enormous but peaceable Giant, the Giant Skrymir, who lay peaceably sleeping near by; and this that they took for a house was merely his Glove, thrown aside there; the door was the Glove-wrist; the little closet they had fled into was the Thumb! Such a glove;--I remark too that it had not fingers as ours have, but only a thumb, and the rest undivided: a most ancient, rustic glove! ...|$|E

That, gentle reader, is {{perhaps one of the most}} interesting men who attend the British Association. He is only a private in the mounted guard (preventive service) at an obscure part of the Cornwall coast, with four shillings a day, and a wife and nine children, most of whose education he has himself to conduct. He never tastes the luxuries which are so common in the middle ranks of life, and even amongst a large portion of the working classes. He has to mend with his own hands every sort of thing that can break or wear in his house. Yet Mr. Peach is a votary of Natural History; not a student of the science in books, for he cannot afford books; but an investigator by sea and shore, a collector of Zoophytes and Echinodermata - strange creatures, many of which are as yet hardly known to man. These he collects, preserves, and describes; and every year does he come up to the British Association with a few novelties of this kind, accompanied by illustrative papers and drawings: thus, under circumstances the very opposite of those of such men as Lord Enniskillen, adding, in like manner, to the general stock of knowledge. On the present occasion he is unusually elated, for he has made the discovery of a Holothuria with twenty tentacula, a species of the Echinodermata which Professor Forbes, in his book on Star-Fishes, has said was never yet observed in the British seas. It may be of small moment to you, who, mayhap, know nothing of Holothurias: but it is a considerable thing to the Fauna of Britain, and a vast matter to a poor private of the Cornwall mounted guard. And accordingly he will go home in a few days, full of the glory of his exhibition, and strong anew by the kind notice taken of him by the masters of the science, to similar inquiries, difficult as it may be to prosecute them, under such a complication of duties, professional and domestic. Honest Peach! humble as is thy home, and simple thy bearing, thou art an honour even to this assemblage of nobles and doctors: nay, more, when we consider everything, thou art an honour to human nature itself; for where is the heroism like that of virtuous, intelligent, independent poverty? And such heroism is thine!" [...] - CHAMBERS' EDIN. JOURN., Nov. 23, 1844.|$|E
