40|$|A {{single-stage}} {{axial fan}} was built and {{tested in the}} shop of the propeller-research tunnel of the NACA. The fan comprised a simple 24 -blade rotor having a diameter of 21 inches and a solidity of 0. 86 {{and a set of}} 37 contravanes having a solidity of 1. 33. The rotor was driven by a 25 -horsepower motor capable of rotating at a speed of 3600 r. p. m. The fan was tested for volume, pressure, and efficiency over a range of delivery pressures and volumes {{for a wide range of}} <b>contravane</b> and blade-angle settings. The test results are presented in chart form in terms of nondimensional units in order that similar fans may be accurately designed with a minimum effort. The maximum efficiency (88 percent) was obtained by the fan at a blade angle of 30 degrees and a <b>contravane</b> angle of 70 degrees. An efficiency of 80 percent was obtained by the fan with the contravanes removed...|$|E
