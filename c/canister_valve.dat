40|$|The primary aim {{of present}} {{investigation}} was to develop and formulate room temperature stable formulation of formoterol fumarate and beclomethasone dipropionate with extra fine part size of hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhalers. Particle size distribution of hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhalers was evaluated using Twin Stage Glass Impinger and Anderson Cascade Impactor. A tetrafluoroethane and/or heptafluoropropane were evaluated for preparation of hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhalers. The fine particle fractions delivered from hydrofluoroalkane propellant suspension pressurized metered dose inhalers can be predicted {{on the basis of}} formulation parameters and is dependent of metering chamber of valve and orifice size of actuators. The results presented in investigation showed the importance of formulation excipients with formulation of pressurized metered dose inhalers viz, <b>canister,</b> <b>valve</b> and actuators used in formulations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{importance}} of regular medication {{in order to}} control asthma symptoms is recognized. However, there is no accurate mechanism for assessing the fullness of aerosol inhalers. The contribution to asthma morbidity of unexpectedly running out of inhaled medication is unknown. AIM. A study was undertaken to determine how patients assess inhaler fullness and the accuracy of their assessments, and to evaluate the floatation method of assessing inhaler fullness. METHOD. An interview survey of 98 patients (51 % of those invited to take part), using 289 inhalers, was completed at one general practice in Hampshire. RESULTS. One third of participants said they had difficulty assessing aerosol inhaler fullness and those aged 60 years and over were found to be more inaccurate in assessing fullness than younger participants. Shaking the inhaler to feel the contents move was the commonest method of assessment. When placed in water, an inhaler canister floating on its side with a corner of the <b>canister</b> <b>valve</b> exposed to air indicates that the canister is less than 15 % full (sensitivity 90 %, specificity 99 %). CONCLUSION. Floating a canister in water provides an objective measurement of aerosol inhaler fullness. Providing the method is recommended by the aerosol inhaler manufacturer, general practitioners should demonstrate the floatation method to patients experiencing difficulty in assessing inhaler fullness...|$|E

50|$|The {{evaporative}} emission system {{is controlled by}} a vacuum-operated mechanical carbon <b>canister</b> control <b>valve.</b> Fuel pressure is maintained by a vacuum operated mechanical fuel pressure regulator on the fuel injector rail assembly. Inputs and outputs are shown in the following illustration. Digifant II as used on Golf and Jetta vehicles provides the basis for this chart.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{manufacturers}} of inhalers are Cipla, GlaxoSmithKline (makers of the Advair Discus, a DPI), Midascare Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, Merck, AstraZeneca (makers of Pulmicort and Symbicort) and Boehringer-Ingelheim (makers of Atrovent, Combivent, and Spiriva). BI, GSK, Merck, and AstraZeneca manufacture the medication being delivered via inhaler.

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} technologies to meet requirements for an extravehicular activity (EVA) Portable Life Support System (PLSS) for exploration. The PLSS Ventilation Subsystem transports clean, conditioned oxygen {{to the pressure}} garment for space suit pressurization and human consumption, and recycles the ventilation gas, removing carbon dioxide, humidity, and trace contaminants. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the development efforts conducted at the NASA Johnson Space Center to redesign the Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) <b>canister</b> and <b>valve</b> assembly into a radial flow, cylindrical package for carbon dioxide and humidity control of the PLSS ventilation loop. Future work is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} RELAP 5 {{results of}} the Heated Vacuum Drying System (HVDS) response to overpressurization of TMI canisters. RELAP 5 was used to calculate transient pressures when hypothetical overpressurization events are considered. RELAP 5 {{results indicate that the}} steam flow is friction limited and that a pressure relieve valve adequately relieves the pressure for scenarios involving overpressure in four <b>canisters</b> if the <b>valve</b> functions...|$|R
40|$|An {{anesthetic}} {{gas flow}} pop-off <b>valve</b> <b>canister</b> is described that is airtight and permits {{the patient to}} breath freely. Once its release mechanism is activated, the exhaust gases are collected at a hose adapter and passed through activated coal for adsorption. A survey of laminar air flow clean rooms is presented and the installation of laminar cross flow air systems in operating rooms is recommended. Laminar flow ventilation experiments determine drying period evaporation rates for chicken intestines, sponges, and sections of pig stomach...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to calculate by simulation, the pressure drop of a firefighting pressure regulated discharge valve for inert gas agent. For doing that, we simulate the discharge of a pressurized closed <b>canister</b> through the <b>valve</b> under realistic conditions. This project has been done in collaboration with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The code used to perform the numerical simulations is Alya, a multi-physics code developed at BSC. The code has been adapted to solve this application problem...|$|R
50|$|The {{deposition}} {{of the content}} of drug formulation on the canister surface can result in a shorter shelf life of an MDI inhaler. Applying a suitable surface coating to the components helps to extend this shelf life. Over the years a range of coating processes have been developed that can be applied to both the <b>canister</b> and <b>valve</b> to protect the contents from deposition and degradation.Gas plasma processing is an industrial technique that is carried out in a vacuum to coat the entire MDI inhaler and involves constant or pulsed excitation of gas by either Radio Frequency (RF) or microwave field to produce an energetic plasma. This coating ensures that the drug formulation does not stick to the interior wall of the MD inhaler and results in the patient receiving the prescribed dose of medication, whilst also extending the product's shelf-life.|$|R
5000|$|This rebreather was {{developed}} by Ted Eldred in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Some were made and used for sport diving, {{but they did not}} go into full production. It was worn on the back without a casing. The bag was between the <b>canister</b> and <b>valve</b> assembly and the diver's back. It had two wide breathing tubes like an aqua-lung or an IDA71, running to a mouthpiece, which had a shutoff button to keep water out when it was not in the mouth. It appeared in three versions: MK1, MK2, MK3. It had a special valve that both breathing tubes ran through: it was activated by surrounding pressure; when he got deeper than was safe for pure oxygen it restricted (not stopped) the supply of breathing gas, to tell him to go to shallower depth. (Before open-circuit scuba was readily available in Australia, many Australian sport divers used war-surplus Siebe Gorman Salvuses.) ...|$|R
50|$|The driptorch {{consists}} of a canister for holding fuel with a handle attached to the side, a spout with a loop to prevent fire from entering the fuel <b>canister,</b> a breather <b>valve</b> to allow air into the canister while fuel is exiting through the spout, and a wick from which flaming fuel is dropped to the ground. The wick is ignited and allows the fire to be directed as needed. The spout and wick can be secured upside down inside the canister for storage or transport. Typically the fuel used {{is a mixture of}} gasoline and diesel with a ratio of 30% to 70% respectively, although, the amounts may need to be adjusted according to fuel and weather conditions. Sometimes heavier oils are used to increase adhesion of the liquid fuel to the vegetation, and increase burn time and heat.|$|R
50|$|The {{company is}} best known for the Quadrajet carburetor, which was {{originally}} designed in the 1960s and remained in production, with modifications to meet progressively tightening exhaust emission limits, into the 1980s. The Quadrajet became computer controlled in 1980 in California and in 1981 {{in the rest of the}} states; its last application was on the 1990 Cadillac Brougham and 1990 full size GM station wagons with the Olds 307 engine. RPD was a pioneer in fuel injection systems in road cars in the 1980s. In addition to carburetors, Rochester also made various emissions control equipment such as charcoal <b>canisters</b> and EGR <b>valves,</b> which found use in GM vehicles as well as those from other makes. Other products made at this plant were locks and keys as well as steel tubing for both vehicular and non-vehicular applications. The last major carburetor design by Rochester was the Varajet II, essentially a Quadrajet halved lengthwise, and was one of the few successful progressive 2-barrel carburetors. It was installed on 4- and 6-cylinder engines from 1979 to 1986.|$|R
40|$|JP- 8 {{jet fuel}} (similar to commercial/international jet A- 1 fuel) is the {{standard}} military fuel {{for all types of}} vehicles, including the U. S. Air Force aircraft inventory. As such, JP- 8 presents the most common chemical exposure in the Air Force, particularly for flight and ground crew personnel during preflight operations and for maintenance personnel performing routine tasks. Personal exposure at an Air Force base occurs through occupational exposure for personnel involved with fuel and aircraft handling and/or through incidental exposure, primarily through inhalation of ambient fuel vapors. Because JP- 8 is less volatile than its predecessor fuel (JP- 4), contact with liquid fuel on skin and clothing may result in prolonged exposure. The slowly evaporating JP- 8 fuel tends to linger on exposed personnel during their interaction with their previously unexposed colleagues. To begin to assess the relative exposures, we made ambient air measurements and used recently developed methods for collecting exhaled breath in special containers. We then analyzed for certain volatile marker compounds for JP- 8, as well as for some aromatic hydrocarbons (especially benzene) that are related to long-term health risks. Ambient samples were collected by using compact, battery-operated, personal whole-air samplers that have recently been developed as commercial products; breath samples were collected using our single-breath canister method that uses 1 -L <b>canisters</b> fitted with <b>valves</b> and small disposable breathing tubes. We collected breath samples from various groups of Air Force personnel and found a demonstrable JP- 8 exposure for all subjects, ranging from slight elevations as compared to a control cohort to > 100 [mutilpe] the control values. This work suggests that further studies should be performed on specific issues to obtain pertinent exposure data. The data can be applied to assessments of health outcomes and to recommendations for changes in the use of personal protective equipment that optimize risk reduction without undue impact on a mission...|$|R
