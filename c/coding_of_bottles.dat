Unfortunately, the redesign <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> shape always performed when the desirable bottle shape had not passed the test. There was time consumption and loss of opportunity to compete producing <b>of</b> <b>bottles.</b> This research proposed a method to receive a desirable shape <b>of</b> plastic <b>bottles</b> together with top load strength. The master <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> shape had been created which capable to change any dimensions before generated CAD and performed top load analysis with FEM. The artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to obtain the desirable bottle shape with top load resistance by varying dimension <b>of</b> the master <b>bottle.</b> The plastic bottle design would be performed rapidly with the ANN <b>of</b> master <b>bottle</b> shape. Consequently, the suitable dimension <b>of</b> plastic <b>bottles</b> which achieved by ANN {{could be used to}} design a desirable shape <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> by using CAD and FEM without trial and error...|$|R

Over fourteen brands <b>of</b> <b>bottled</b> water {{could be found in}} the market of Doha. Use <b>of</b> <b>bottled</b> water has kept on increasing in this region. Reasons for the increase in use <b>of</b> <b>bottled</b> water for drinking have been discussed. The raw water source for the bottled water is groundwater. Most of the manufacturers <b>of</b> the <b>bottled</b> water claim bottled water as "Natural Mineral Water" which is contrary to the definition suggested by the International <b>Bottled</b> Water Association <b>of</b> Washington D.

Samples of various brands <b>of</b> <b>bottled</b> water available in Doha and municipal water were collected during 1993 and 1994 for physical, chemical, and bacteriological analysis. All the samples were found potable and safe for drinking and conform to various drinking water standards. The physical and chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>bottled</b> water varies with time but the concentration of constituents printed on the labels <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> is always the same.

40|$|Intelligent {{empty bottle}} {{inspection}} system {{is an important}} inspection equipment <b>of</b> empty <b>bottle</b> before filling beer, {{and it is a}} blend of machine vision, precision machine and real-time control. They need to cooperate perfectly to achieve the desired effect. In the design <b>of</b> the empty <b>bottle</b> inspection system, one of the key technologies is the bottle bottom detection which affects the speed and accuracy of the system. It includes positioning and defect recognition <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom. For the problems such as the slow detection speed and low detection precision <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom detection, some new methods are proposed in this paper. The positioning algorithm <b>of</b> the <b>bottle</b> bottom in images is studied after preprocessing the obtained images, and the accurate positioning is achieved by improving the Randomized Hough transform. In the defect recognition <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom, a method of calculating optimum radius in Fourier spectrum is used {{to solve the problem of}} the detection accuracy being influenced by the antiskid veins <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom. It can improve the recognition accuracy effectively.
