This model {{is a combination of}} a self-consistent approximation model, enhanced with an inter-particle contact {{heat transfer}} <b>correction</b> <b>coefficient.</b> For dry and saturated soils, this coefficient is defined as a ratio of a soil harmonic mean thermal conductivity of solid and fluid (air or water) phases, to the average thermal conductivity of soil solid grains.

40|$|Along a {{non-uniform}} flow {{in a stream}} or river, the pressure, energy, and momentum coefficients tend to vary from section to section. These coefficients also tend to vary with the water depth and discharge. Although some researchers provided some values of these coefficients for special conditions, their spatial variability in accelerated flow has not been adequately investigated. To simplify calculations, the values of these coefficients are usually assumed to be constants. This implies that the cross-sectional velocity and pressure distributions do not change with space. Values of these constants are often regarded as unity, which implies that the velocity is uniformly distributed over the cross section while the pressure distribution is hydrostatic. However, effect of these coefficients on the solution of {{non-uniform flow}} equations is not well understood. In this study, a new simple method for computing the pressure, energy, and momentum correction coefficients from the water surface profile for accelerating flow over block stones ramp was developed. This method {{is based on the}} assumption that the water depth at the beginning of the ramp is equal to the critical depth. The study revealed that the maximum deviation in the pressure is at the ramp crest and decreases in the downstream direction until it reaches to uniform flow condition at some distance from the ramp crest.

However, infrared channels are adversely affected by the limb effect, the result of an increase in optical path length of the absorbing atmosphere between the satellite and the earth as viewing zenith angle increases. This paper reviews a newly developed technique to quickly correct for limb effects in both clear and cloudy regions using latitudinally and seasonally varying limb <b>correction</b> <b>coefficients</b> for real-time applications.

The method used for bias correction was developed for global models, its adaptation to limited-area models raises further questions. The quality of the bias correction coefficients- scan-angle biases and coefficients for air-mass predictors- depends on the sample of the observation-minus-model-first-guess data obtained at each satellite (AMSU-A) scan position. In {{the case of a}} limited domain (limited-area model, LAM), {{we do not have the}} same amount of satellite measurements along the scan line, due to the fact that satellite paths might be cut at different scan positions during pre-processing in the analysis system.

40|$|The open-end {{correction}} of an acoustic tube {{has been widely}} investigated in a free-field condition (cf. Hall, 1987). However, no experimental data give accurate open-end corrections for side branches within an acoustic tube, although some proposals have been made [see Fant (1960) ]. To incorporate side branches such as the paranasal sinuses and piriform fossa in an acoustic model of the vocal tract, an end <b>correction</b> <b>coefficient</b> is definitely needed. Thus this study estimated the end <b>correction</b> <b>coefficient</b> of side branches experimentally and computationally.
