40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The {{amount of}} <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> in {{corporations}} has increased substantially {{over the years}} on a global scale. There are opinions that support hoarding cash in corporate stating that such action can save cost from raising expensive external capital. However, there are also opinions that high amount of <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> leads to agency problems and induces managers to take on value decreasing investments. I study the relationship between <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> and M&A activity in Europe to see if hoarding <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> is detrimental or beneficial for corporates. DATA AND METHODS: My data collecting period is from 1995 to 2014. Mostly, I collect company financial information from Thomson One and deals information from SDC. First, I conduct normal cash model to {{determine the amount of}} excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> for each firm year taking into account the industry and firm's specific characteristics. Then, I use the probit models to see if excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> lead to higher probability of becoming a bidder or a target in M&A. Finally, I use panel regressions to see if M&A made by cash-rich firm is value increasing. In my models, first I study Europe as a whole and then I look into individual countries to examine the situation in each country. RESULTS: For Europe as a whole, the results are not conclusive. High amount of excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> does lead to higher probability of becoming a bidder of a firm. However, the regression models cannot conclude if these investments are detrimental. The investments are only value-decreasing under the combined effect of high <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> and low investment opportunities. For individual countries, the picture is more clear. In France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, managers tend to take advantage of <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> in a company as {{they are more likely to}} engage in M&A and the investments they make are value-decreasing. However, in United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, managers seem to hoard <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> for shareholders' benefits.

40|$|We study a continuous-time {{contracting}} problem under hidden action, {{where the}} prin-cipal has ambiguous {{beliefs about the}} project cash flows. The principal designs a robust contract that maximizes his utility under the worst-case scenario subject to the agent’s in-centive and participation constraints. Robustness generates endogenous belief heterogene-ity and induces a tradeoff between incentives and ambiguity sharing so that the incentive constraint does not always bind. We implement the optimal contract by <b>cash</b> <b>reserves,</b> debt, and equity. In addition to receiving ordinary dividends when <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> reach a threshold, outside equity holders also receive special dividends or inject cash in the <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> to hedge against model uncertainty and smooth dividends.

40|$|We study {{two types}} of robust {{contracting}} problem under hidden action in continuous time. In type I problem, the principal is ambiguous about the project cash flows, while he is ambiguous about the agent’s beliefs in type II problem.

We implement the optimal contract by <b>cash</b> <b>reserves,</b> debt and equity. In addition to receiving ordinary dividends when <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> reach a threshold, outside equity holders also receive special dividends or inject cash in the <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> to hedge against model uncertainty.

As of Q1 2012, Citi had a tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%, making Citi one of the best-capitalized financial institutions in the world after billions of dollars in losses from the financial crisis.

25|$|The reserve {{requirement}} (or <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio) {{is a central}} bank regulation employed by most, but not all, of the world's central banks, that sets the minimum amount of reserves that must be held by a commercial bank. The minimum reserve is generally determined by the central bank to be no less than a specified percentage {{of the amount of}} deposit liabilities the commercial bank owes to its customers. The commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash owned by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the commercial bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank.|$|E
25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower expense ratio. This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, this needs to be compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio, and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An index fund is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only does an ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions, an ETF does not have to maintain a <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds can charge 1% to 3%, or more; index fund expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E

30|$|In {{examining}} the interaction effect, {{there is a}} potential endogeneity concern with excess cash. Managers of firms with a large number of ATPs may accumulate excess cash for managerial perquisites. Thus, if firms with a large number of ATPs tend to hoard large <b>cash</b> <b>reserves,</b> it is difficult to identify the interaction effect. While evidence from outside the US suggests that weak shareholder rights are associated with higher <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> (Lins and Kalcheva 2007), other studies show that US firms with a large number of ATPs hold lower excess cash (Harford et al. 2008). In a setting with strong shareholder rights protection and enforcement, entrenched managers in the US rather prefer to dissipate excess cash quickly in value-destroying investments because large <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> are too visible target of shareholder activism. This managerial preference drives the negative association between ATPs and excess cash.|$|R
