40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to explain legal transplants, especially focussing in the transplantation of <b>class</b> <b>actions</b> from common law system (tradition) to Indonesian legal field. Even though Indonesia's legal system is mixed legal systems (one in which the law in force is derived from more than one legal tradition or legal family), the civil procedure rules in Indonesia have foundation in civil law system. The study is crucial in relation both difference legal system and socio-culture context of legal jurisdictions where law was transfered. Hence, methods used in this study are comparative legal research and case study. <b>Class</b> <b>actions</b> actually has been imposed upon substantive legal element. From proceeding perspective, it has not been ended. In sociological perspective, it has not concerned with culture's approach emphasises the mismatch of recipient and model. In view of comparative law, the transplant has not been corrected the mismatch between model and recipient.

5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level <b>class</b> <b>action</b> suits {{were filed}} against Apple in New York and California alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the battery life represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault.
