40|$|Extraction {{processes}} employing emulsion liquid membranes (ELMs), water-in-oil emulsions dispersed in aqueous phase, {{have been}} shown to be highly efficient in removing a variety of organic and inorganic contaminants from industrial wastewaters. As a result, they have been considered as alternative technologies to other more common separation processes such as pressure-driven membrane processes. Unfortunately, a widespread use of the ELM process has been limited due to the instability of emulsion globules against fluid shear. Breakup of emulsions and subsequent release of the internal receptor phase to the external donor phase would nullify the extraction process. Numerous studies have been, therefore, made in the past to enhance the stability of ELMs. Examples include adding more surfactants into the membrane phase and increasing the membrane viscosity. However, increased stability has been unfortunately accompanied by loss in extraction efficiency and rate in most reported attempts. The primary objective of this research is to apply the ELMs in a unique <b>contacting</b> <b>device,</b> a Taylor-Couette column, which provides a relatively low and uniform fluid shear that helps maintaining the stability of emulsion without compromising the extraction efficiency of a target compound. The ELM used in this study is made of membrane phase converted into non-Newtonian fluid by polymer addition, which provides additional uncommon remedy for the problem. This innovative ELM process was optimized to treat various types of simulated industrial wastewaters containing selected phenolic compounds and heavy metals. Experiments performed in this study suggested that the newly developed ELM process achieved exceptionally high overall removal efficiencies for the removal of these target compounds in relatively short contact time. Mechanistic predictive models were further developed and verified with the experimental data. Combined with the experimental data and novel mathematical predictive models, this study is expected to have a high impact on immediate practices of emulsion liquid membrane technologies in relevant industries.

40|$|In a {{confined}} plunging {{liquid jet}} (CPLJ) system, a liquid jet {{is allowed to}} fall in a partially submerged narrow downcomer tube.

This simple phenomenon of gas entrainment bears great industrial significance. It facilitates an efficient gas liquid <b>contacting</b> <b>device,</b> {{which can be used}} for waste water aeration and lake destratification etc. In present work, a confined plunging liquid jet system was experimentally and numerically analyzed. On experimental front, a laboratory scale CPLJ setup was developed. Impact of change in jet height, water flow rate and nozzle diameter on, bubble plume size and surrounding flow field was investigated through high speed camera photography and Particle Image Velocimetry. Image processing programs were developed in MATLAB for extracting plume boundaries in high speed camera images. Experimental results showed that, bubble plume width and flow field is only weakly dependent on jet height. With increase in water flow rate, bubble plume size and air lifted water velocity increases. Increase in nozzle diameter, at constant water flow rate and jet height, decreases both the plume size and upward water velocity. On numerical front, a 3 D Euler-Euler two-fluid CFD simulation of bubble plume dispersion was performed for the test case of 7 mm nozzle diameter, 100 mm jet length and 12. 5 LPM water flow rate. Grid generation was done in GAMBIT while CFD software ANSYS CFX 12. 1 was used for CFD simulations. Air phase was modelled as a polydispersed fluid with eight size bins.

40|$|Projections in {{the future}} energy {{scenario}} outline an important role played by fossil fuels to meet the increasing global energy demand. A “golden age” has been recently outlined for natural gas, in particular, as the fastest growing and the cleanest of all fossil fuels. Although natural gas is mostly {{considered to be a}} “clean” fuel with respect to the emission of pollutants from its combustion, the raw natural gas found in reservoir deposits is not free of contaminants. Among the others, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide are two undesired compounds, which are responsible for the sour or acidic nature of natural gas and must be removed for operational and safety reasons. Acid gas treating is typically performed in facilities built at surface locations, mainly by means of chemical absorption into aqueous amine solutions. However, subsurface technologies may allow to possibly separate the gas undesired compounds directly downhole. The high pressure encountered in this environment makes the use of water as liquid absorbent worth considering. This work investigates the possibility of acid gas removal from natural gas by downhole water washing and presents a preliminary evaluation of the performances of the process, which is assumed to be carried out in the gas production casing that can be represented as a bubble column. A previously proposed correlation for the gas holdup in this type of <b>contacting</b> <b>device</b> operated counter-currently has been used to determine the volumetric mass transfer coefficient for design purposes, considering different raw gas flow rates and inlet acid gas concentrations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{desulphurization}} of gas streams using aqueous copper sulphate (CuSO 4) solutions as washing liquor is studied theoretically and experimentally. The desulphurization {{is accomplished by}} a precipitation reaction that occurs when sulphide ions and metal ions are brought into contact with each other. Absorption experiments of H 2 S in aqueous CuSO 4 solutions were carried out in a Mechanically Agitated Gas Liquid Reactor. The experiments were conducted at a temperature of 293 K and CuSO 4 concentrations between 0. 01 and 0. 1 M. These experiments showed that the process efficiently removes H 2 S. Furthermore, the experiments indicate that the absorption of H 2 S in a CuSO 4 solution may typically be considered a mass transfer limited process at, {{for this type of}} industrial process, relevant conditions. The extended model developed by Al-Tarazi et al. (2004) has been used to predict the rate of H 2 S absorption. This model describes the absorption and accompanying precipitation process in terms of, among others, elementary reaction steps, particle nucleation and growth. The results from this extended model and results obtained with a much simpler model, regarding the absorption of H 2 S in CuSO 4 containing aqueous solutions as absorption of a gas accompanied by an instantaneous irreversible reaction were compared with experimental results. From this comparison it appeared that the absorption rate of H 2 S in a CuSO 4 solution can, under certain conditions, be considered as a mass transfer rate controlled process. Under a much wider range of conditions the error that is made by assuming that the absorption process is a mass transfer controlled process, is still within engineering accuracy. Application of the simple model allows for a considerable reduction of the theoretical effort needed for the design of a gas-liquid <b>contacting</b> <b>device,</b> thereby still assuring that the desired gas specification can be met under a wide range of operating conditions. A comparison of the experimental results and the simulated results showed that the extended model gives an under prediction of the H 2 S absorption rate for the experimental conditions applied. ...|$|E

This gas contained approximately 500 vppm NO and was fed at flow rates varying from 200 to 600 m 3 /h. The results have been compared with those obtained in fixed beds operated at the same conditions. Almost the same NO conversion levels were found at equal space velocities; it was therefore concluded that the contacting efficiency corresponds to that in an ideally contacted (high Reynolds numbers) plug flow system. This means that there is no gas bypassing the solids in the FGSFB. The NO conversion behaviour of the FGSFB reactor was also simulated with a plug flow reactor model using simplified kinetics and an empirical correlation for the axial particle distribution. The S-shaped form of calculated curves, representing the NO conversion degree {{as a function of the}} axial position for different values of the reaction rate constant, are characteristic for a FGSFB: the slope increase in the bottom part of the reactor is caused by an increasing conversion rate due to a positive particle concentration gradient in the upwards direction.

40|$|A {{biomimetic}} self-assembling dye, {{which forms}} aggregates that mimic the natural light-harvesting system of special photosynthetic active bacteria, {{has been investigated}} towards its applicability to solar cells. This fully synthetic dye, self-assembles to orderly structured nano- to micrometer sized rod-shaped aggregates, which might improve solar cells based on conventional organic dyes. In order to use the full potential of the dye aggregates, the self-assembly needed to be controlled and a suitable solar cell concept for their implementation developed. In {{the first part of}} this thesis it has been investigated how the self-assembly can be controlled in order to achieve dye aggregates with a high internal order and size-confinement at least in one dimension. This dimension should not exceed the exciton diffusion length, what is the maximum path length, an excited state, which originates by the absorption of light, can travel within an aggregate. In the second part of this thesis the findings from the first part have been applied to construct and test first solar cell prototypes with such controlled dye aggregates. In contrast to the chlorophylls of plants, the self-assembling bacteriochlorophylls of green sulfur bacteria, which served as model for our dye, do not require proteins for the assembly of functional light-harvesting systems. This allows to mimic the light-harvesting system fully synthetically in large scale in order to realize low-cost, light-weight and environmentally friendly solar cells. As nature gives the proof of principle in practice for the functionality of such dye aggregates, this work has been carried out in order to investigate the transferability of this concept to technology. Various methods have been investigated in order to decrease the size of the aggregates while maintaining as far as possible their highly ordered internal structure. These included the steric hindering of the self-assembly within voids of different porous TiO 2 layers and on zinc oxide nanorod substrates, the kinetic growth-hindering at low temperatures and a size-selective deposition by dielectrophoretic forces. Other investigated techniques to deposit the aggregates were spin-coating, spraying, precipitation and a two-step process, where at first an amorphous layer was deposited suppressing the self-assembly in order to initiate afterwards a reorganization to the desired aggregates. The degree of success was monitored mainly by absorption spectroscopy in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Whereas the absorption spectroscopy gave a value of the average degree of the aggregates' internal order, the SEM allowed an assessment of the aggregates' dispersity, i. e. the fraction and distribution of different morphologies, sizes and their alignment on the substrate. Finally, these aggregates have been implemented into solar cells, designed to combine the advantages of hybrid solar cells and solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ss-DSSCs). We call them: dye aggregate solar cells (DASCs). They were constructed on flat and different porous TiO 2 structures, which were sensitized by the dye aggregates for visible light with supplement for the hole transport by the transparent organic hole transport material spiro-MeOTAD. The performance of the DASCs was compared with that of ss-DSSCs based on the common ruthenium dye N 719, which is often used as reference. Additional investigations have been done using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to apply dense hole-blocking TiO 2 layers onto the transparent conductive substrates with a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) layer. As application method for the gold counter electrode the sputtering technique was employed for these solar cells as alternative to the conventional evaporation technique. The development of a special <b>contacting</b> <b>device</b> allowed miniaturized solar cells to be contacted without the need for pre-structuring the commercial FTO-layers...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades {{intensive}} study is being done on inorganic membrane reactors in order to improve yield and selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. A number of recent research have reported that the use of the membrane reactors in selective oxidation reactions can result in improving selectivity of desired intermediates and suppressing the deep oxidation (Reyes et al. (1993), Tonkovich et al(1995)). Membrane reactors are promising candidates to improve the reactor performance limited by the reaction kinetic or thermodynamics using the concept of distributed educt dosing. The application of this concept would be beneficial, including dehydrogenations, synthesis gas production and esterifications. In heterogeneous catalyzed partial oxidation systems, the product selectivity can be enhanced when the order of the reaction in oxygen for the formation of target product is lower than that of the formation of undesired product. Hence a decrease in oxygen concentration favors product selectivity (Santamaria et al. (1995, 1999)). A packed bed membrane reactor combines both axial feed of reactant and distributive oxygen feeding through the membrane with low axial back mixing in the catalyst bed. Simplified 1 D models are state of the art and widely-used for the simulation of packed bed membrane bed reactors (PBMR) (Varma et al. (2002 a,b). Only fewer studies were oriented on two dimensional description (Kürten et al. (2004)). However this detailed models seems to be needed to be able predict and understand governing effects in the PBMR. In our study we have considered oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on a VO x /γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst as model reaction. (Klose et al. (2003)). One objective of this thesis is to implement a one dimensional, pseudo-homogeneous membrane reactor model to study the effect of varying flow rates, dosed oxygen amounts, and especially the influence of tube/shell ratio on the ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity. Another objective of this study was the investigation of the PBMR using two dimensional pseudo homogenous reactor models. The commercial software package FEMLAB TM 3. 1 is used as a promising simulation tool. With the implemented two dimensional models following effects are studied in detail: - Axial and radial distribution of the oxidant, the effects of interparticle mass transfer limitations on the reactor performance - Study of radial and axial velocity profiles, - Influence of temperature on the product distribution - The possibilities of a model simplification, considering heat, mass and momentum transfer in the boundary conditions Sebastian C.
