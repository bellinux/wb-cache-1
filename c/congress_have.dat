25|$|Congressman Rush Holt, whose {{district}} in New Jersey includes a mailbox from which anthrax letters {{are believed to}} have been mailed, called for an investigation of the anthrax attacks by Congress or by an independent commission he proposed in a bill entitled the Anthrax Attacks Investigation Act (H.R. 1248) Other members of <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> also called for an independent investigation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{members of}} <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> {{tried to create}} a federal usury statute that would limit the maximum {{allowable}} interest rate, but the measures have not progressed.

The act provides for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate some credit practices but has no interest rate limit.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} vocal {{opponent}} of the policies has been the American Civil Liberties Union, which has brought or been a participant in fourteen lawsuits against the Boy Scouts of America from 1981 to March 2006. A few members of the U.S. <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> also spoken out against the BSA's policies. Since the Dale decision, some Eagle Scouts (about 100) have returned their Eagle Scout badge to the BSA in protest.|$|E

25|$|Customarily, one {{cabinet member}} (the {{designated}} survivor) does not attend, {{in order to}} provide continuity in the line of succession in the event that a catastrophe disables the President, the Vice President, and other succeeding officers gathered in the House chamber. Additionally, since the September 11 attacks in 2001, a few members of <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> been asked to relocate to undisclosed locations {{for the duration of the}} speech to form a rump Congress in the event of a disaster.|$|E
25|$|Since this {{provision}} {{went into effect}} in late 1998, all the Presidents serving in office during this period have determined moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. A re-assessment has to take place every six months however. In response, members of <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> begun to include language {{to do away with the}} President's exclusivity in making the determinations or flat-out remove the waiver provision completely from the Embassy Act altogether.|$|E

25|$|Congress {{is split}} into two chambers—House and Senate—and manages the task of writing {{national}} legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary {{organizations such as the}} Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members of <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, DENR {{provided}} {{its first}} assessment {{of acid rain}} in the United States. It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable {{for the survival of}} many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2012, a House {{subcommittee}} met {{to consider}} replacing the dollar bill. This action took {{place after the}} seventh Government Accountability Office report on the subject. The latest report claimed that switching to dollar coins would save $4.4 billion over thirty years. However, according to polls, few Americans {{want to give up}} dollar bills. Recent budgets passed by <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> included provisions to prevent the Treasury Department from spending any of its funds to redesign the one dollar bill, largely because of potential cost impacts on the vending machine industry.|$|E

25|$|Various bills before <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> {{proposed}} granting federal {{recognition for}} the six non-reservation Virginia Tribes. Recent sponsors of such Federal recognition bills have been Senator George Allen, R-Va and Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va. These bills would grant federal recognition to the Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Upper Mattaponi, Rappahannock and Nansemond Tribes, and Monacan Indian Nation. These are six non-reservation tribes whose members have demonstrated continuity of community, as noted by state recognition. Federal recognition of these tribes would compensate {{for some of the}} historic injustices they suffered under Virginia government, and recognize their continuing identities as Virginia Indians and American citizens.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} unfolded {{against the}} backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members of <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping. In response, Clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts, though not their own private email servers.|$|E
25|$|Several {{members of}} the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> called for {{mandatory}} production of flexible fuel vehicles.

The E85 and Biodiesel Access Act would increase the credit from 30 {{percent of the cost of}} clean fueling property to 50 percent and increase the maximum credit to $100,000.

25|$|Although {{individual}} members of <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> every right to express their views and the views of their constituents {{with respect to their}} religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case. To do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This court cannot conclude from the evidence or the record in this case that any valid governmental interest is advanced by DOMA as applied to the Debtors.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party. Though most Democrats in <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.|$|E
25|$|The Senate {{was modeled}} upon the United States Senate; the two {{chambers}} of <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution {{that has to}} go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the Senate, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the Senate on third reading, the bill is passed to the House of Representatives, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the lower house is different from the one passed by the Senate, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.|$|E

50|$|In this case, the Court {{held that}} <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> imposed a coercive federal {{regulatory}} scheme on farm production under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (AAA). By entering into contracts with farmers who reduced their output of selected crops, <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> placed non-participating farmers at a distinct disadvantage to farmers who cooperated. As such, {{the program was}} not truly voluntary as it left the farmers no real choice; the options for the farmers were either cooperation or financial ruin. Under those circumstances, the regulatory scheme essentially required submission of farmers to a regulatory scheme <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> no power to impose on its own.|$|R
