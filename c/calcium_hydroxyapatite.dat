2500|$|At this stage, {{some of the}} {{fibroblasts}} {{begin to}} lay down bone matrix {{in the form of}} collagen monomers. These monomers spontaneously assemble to form the bone matrix, for which bone crystals (<b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxyapatite)</b> are deposited in amongst, in the form of insoluble crystals. This mineralization of the collagen matrix stiffens it and transforms it into bone. In fact, bone is a mineralized collagen matrix; if the mineral is dissolved out of bone, it becomes rubbery. Healing bone callus on average, is sufficiently mineralized to show up on X-ray within 6 weeks in adults and less in children. This initial [...] "woven" [...] bone does not have the strong mechanical properties of mature bone. By a process of remodeling, the woven bone is replaced by mature [...] "lamellar" [...] bone. The whole process may take up to 18 months, but in adults, the strength of the healing bone is usually 80% of normal by 3 months after the injury.|$|E

5000|$|Unburnt bone {{was once}} thought to be a poor {{candidate}} for radiocarbon dating, but is now possible to test it accurately. The constituents of bone include proteins, which contain carbon; bone's structural strength comes from <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxyapatite,</b> which is easily contaminated with carbonates from ground water. Removing the carbonates also destroys the <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxyapatite,</b> and so it is usual to date bone using the remaining protein fraction after washing away the <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxyapatite</b> and contaminating carbonates. This protein component is called collagen. Collagen is sometimes degraded, in which case {{it may be necessary to}} separate the proteins into individual amino acids and measure their respective ratios and [...] activity. It is possible to detect if there has been any degradation of the sample by comparing the relative volume of each amino acid with the known profile for bone. If so, separating the amino acids may be necessary to allow independent testing of each one—agreement between the results of several different amino acids indicates that the dating is reliable. Hydroxyproline, one of the constituent amino acids in bone, was {{once thought to}} be a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.|$|E

50|$|Osteopetrosis {{is caused}} by {{underlying}} mutations that interfere with the acidification of the osteoclast resorption pit, for example due to a deficiency of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme encoded by the CA2 gene. Carbonic anhydrase is required by osteoclasts for proton production. Without this enzyme hydrogen ion pumping is inhibited and bone resorption by osteoclasts is defective, as an acidic environment is needed to dissociate <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxyapatite</b> from the bone matrix. As bone resorption fails while bone formation continues, excessive bone is formed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a new method to obtain silicate-substituted <b>calcium</b> deficient <b>hydroxyapatite</b> (Si-CDHA) : mechanosynthesis. In previous studies mechanosynthesis has been showed {{to be an}} efficient method to obtain nanosized <b>calcium</b> deficient <b>hydroxyapatite</b> (CDHA). In this study, the silicate ions stemmed from calcium silicate hydrate (CSH). Both, CSH and Si-CDHA were obtained by mechanical activation in a planetary Retsch mill. Titration with 0. 01 M HCl of the samples of Si-CDHA obtained at different milling times demonstrated that a 9. 8 % w/w of silicate had been incorporated into the apatite. Moreover, XRD showed that the silicate incorporation in the apatite increased the crystallinity and {{the stability of the}} apatitic phase. These results indicated that mechanosynthesis is an effective method for incorporating silicate into CDHA. As a result a hydroxyapatite nanosized powder was obtained, with promising characteristics such as an improved bioactivity due to its calcium deficiency and silicate substitution...|$|R

Later, new areas of mineralization occur as globules form in the partially mineralized predentin during the secondary mineralization phase.
