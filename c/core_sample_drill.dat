40|$|AbstractTo asphalt pavement, because asphalt is polymer materials, {{the aging}} of asphalt cannot be ignored; {{bituminous}} mixture {{is made up of}} asphalt and aggregate, meanwhile it contains interior pore space. Because of the rheology behaviour of bituminous, bituminous mixture will emerge viscous-plastic deformation under traffic load, and because of the porous in it, the water which enters the pore will make the bituminous peeling off from aggregates. It is just the environmental influence that leads early damage of asphalt pavements. Analysis on the design of asphalt pavement shows that long-term environmental influence is not directly consideed. To be more accurate to consider the influence of environment on the asphalt pavement, based on structural reliability theory gradation and porosity of asphalt mixture are proposed to be added into design indexes, on the same time it is proposed that detection should depend on the <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> <b>drilled</b> on the spot and the bond status of interlayer {{should be included in the}} acceptance indicators...|$|R

40|$|Downhole {{magnetic}} field measurements {{were conducted in}} Hole 504 B on the Costa Rica Ridge during ODP Leg 111. Three magnetic groups within oceanic basement at this site are tentatively defined, based on the interval mean val ues of the downhole {{magnetic field}}. Statistical analyses show that there are {{significant differences in the}} inclinations of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) among the three magnetic groups. Although this could be caused by various factors, we explain the inclination difference among the three groups by simple tectonic displacements of basement by faulting after its formation, about 5. 9 Ma ago. Based on the intensities of NRM and inclinations measured in the base ment <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> <b>drilled</b> in Hole 504 B on DSDP Legs 69, 70, and 83 and ODP Leg 111, the investigated section of basement formation can be divided into three or four magnetic zones that parallel the zones defined by the downhole magnetic field, alteration, and lithology.

2500|$|Concern among experts {{has grown}} since the 2000s that some organisms {{have adapted to}} live on {{floating}} plastic debris, allowing them to disperse with ocean currents and thus potentially become invasive species in distant ecosystems. Research in 2014 in the waters around Australia confirmed a wealth of such colonists, even on tiny flakes, and also found thriving ocean bacteria eating into the plastic to form pits and grooves. [...] These researchers showed that [...] "plastic biodegradation is occurring at the sea surface" [...] through the action of bacteria, and noted that this is congruent with a new body of research on such bacteria. Their finding is also congruent with the other major research undertaken in 2014, which sought to answer the riddle of the overall lack of build up of floating plastic in the oceans, despite ongoing high levels of dumping.

40|$|Temporal {{changes of}} ostracodes {{during the last}} 100 years {{observed}} in three sediment cores from Hiroshima Bay, the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, provide valuable information about influences on ostracodes caused by anthropogenic pollution. This is the first detailed report of historical records {{of the relationship between}} ostracodes and pollution established from <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> <b>drilled</b> in the polluted inner bay. At least 38 ostracode species were identified from 40 samples. Based on biofacies, the density of ostracodes and the faunal structure, it is elucidated that industrialization combined with the effects of the second world war caused a decrease in the density and a increase in the equitability of ostracodes, and that anthropogenic pollution caused a simplification of ostracode assemblages in Hiroshima Bay. The response of two particular ostracode species to anthropogenic pollution is also demonstrated. Callistocythere alata was sensitive and Bicornucythere bisanensis has a strong resistance for anthorogenic pollution in ostracode species. Thus, the relative frequencies of these two ostracodes can be used as an indication of such pollution.

Low anisotropy degree Pj of 1 - 7 % indicates a low degree of deformation in the Thung-Yai redbed. Distribution of the principal axes of susceptibility indicates an imbrication of the minimum axes (K 3) toward the West which is interpreted as the palaeo-current direction during deposition of sediments. There are probably gravitational and hydrodynamic forces of flowing water that affect the Thung-Yai redbed at the time of deposition. Analyses of magnetic data and fluorescent X-ray images indicate that magnetite and haematite are the predominant magnetic minerals in the Thung-Yai redbed. This shows a non-marine environment during sedimentation. Remanent magnetization derived from a high temperature range of 530 - 630 C directed at Dec/Inc = 32. 6 / 18. 8 is considered to be primary remanent magnetization and its pole position is at Plat/Plon = 57. 8 N/ 184. 6 E. This pole overlaps well with the pole position derived from the Khorat redbeds (Plat/Plon = 60. 7 N/ 181. 0 E).

From <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> <b>drilled</b> in the accumulation area of the Vernagtferner, the gross beta activity was investigated and compared with the data from 2 H, 3 H and 180 analyses and the data from mass balance studies. It is shown that the annual net balance from previous years can be recovered on temperate glaciers using environmental isotope techniques. From the diurnal variations of the 2 H and 3 H contents and the electrolytic conductivity, the following proportions in the runoff of the Vernagtferner {{catchment area}} were obtained during a 24 -hour interval at a time of strong ablation (August 1976) : about 50 % ice meltwater, 25 % direct runoff of firn and snow meltwater, and 7 % of mineralized groundwater. The rest of the runoff consists of non- mineralized meltwater seeping from the glacier body. The annual variations of the 2 H and 3 H contents in the runoff of the glaciated catchment area permit conclusions on the time sequence of the individual ablation periods, and on the residence time, on the basis of model concepts.

There are different types of combustion process depending on the injection fluid, normal dry combustion with injection of air or oxygen, the wet combustion is termed when water is injected with air and the super wet combustion process is defined with relatively high water-air ratio. Wet and super wet combustion is a primarily object of this study.

The literature has been carefully reviewed to recognize the experimental details and analyze the kinetic reactions. The main kinetic reactions are thermal cracking process, low temperature oxidation and high temperature oxidation. The parameters influencing the kinetic reaction are identified and evaluated. The modeling and history matching work has been done to understand the kinetic reactions happened in the experiments. The simulation model is created based on the Belgrave s model for the CT experiment and the data file is run with the STARS. The results are presented and analyzed.

No evidence of preferential pathways for water flow was detected via visual geologic descriptions of the <b>core</b> <b>samples.</b> Laboratory analyses showed physical and hydraulic properties that are typical of alluvial valleys at the Nevada Test Site. Water content values ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 33 cubic meters per cubic meter, with water content tending to increase with depth. Water potential values ranged from - 10. 7 MegaPascals {{at a depth of}} 15. 3 meters to greater than - 0. 40 MegaPascals at 78. 9 meters. Tritium concentrations in pore water extracted from the cores were below the detection limits from the surface to a depth of 118. 9 meters. Below this depth, concentrations generally increased to a maximum of 2, 200 picoCuries per liter in the deepest sample at 146. 9 meters. Unusually wet alluvium recovered from the drill bit during drilling between 50. 9 and 71. 6 meters in the first borehole raised concerns that water condensed in the compressed air system or excess oil introduced into the borehole may have penetrated core segments intended for analyses. The drilling process was modified to preclude introduction of fluids and the borehole was completed without further evidence of excess water. Using the same drilling method, the second borehole adjacent to the first was <b>drilled</b> and <b>sampled</b> over the interval from 47. 5 to 78. 3 meters. Analyses of samples from the second borehole showed water content values, water potential values, and stable isotope concentrations consistent with those of samples from the first borehole. This demonstrated that fluids had not been introduced into core segments intended for analyses during drilling of the first borehole, and thus the elevated water values are considered to be natural...|$|R
