50|$|Lava lakes {{occur in}} a variety of {{volcanic}} systems, ranging from the basaltic Erta Ale lake in Ethiopia and the basaltic andesite volcano of Villarrica, Chile, to the unique phonolitic lava lake at Mt. Erebus, Antarctica. Lava lakes have been observed to exhibit a range of behaviours. A “constantly circulating, apparently steady-state” lava lake was observed during the 1969-1971 Mauna Ulu eruption of Kilauea, Hawaii. By contrast, a lava lake at the 1983-1984 Pu'u 'O'o eruption of Kilauea displayed <b>cyclic</b> <b>behaviour</b> with a period of 5-20 minutes; gas “pierced the surface” of the lake, and the lava rapidly drained back down the conduit before the onset of a new phase of lake activity.The behaviour observed is influenced by the combined effects of pressure within the reservoir, exsolution and decompression of gas bubbles within the conduit and, potentially, exsolution of bubbles within the magma reservoir. Superimposed upon this is the effect of bubbles rising through the liquid, and coalescence of bubbles within the conduit. The interactions of these effects can create either a steady-state recirculating lake, or a lake level that periodically rises and then falls.|$|E

Bersini and Detours (1994) have shown how sensitive Conway's Game of Life is to the updating scheme. Any interesting behaviour disappears in the asynchronous case. Harvey and Bossomaier (1997) pointed out that stochastic updating in random boolean networks results in the expression of point attractors only: there is no repeatable <b>cyclic</b> <b>behaviour,</b> although they introduced the concept of loose cyclic attractors. Kanada (1994) has shown that some one-dimensional CA models that generate non-chaotic patterns when updated synchronously generate edge of chaos patterns when randomised. Orponen (1997) has demonstrated that any synchronously updated network of threshold logic units (see Artificial neuron) can be simulated by a network that has no constraints {{on the order of}} updates. Sipper et al. (1997) investigated the evolution of non-uniform CAs that perform specific computing tasks. These models relax the normal requirement of all nodes having the same update rule. In their models, nodes were organised into blocks. Nodes within a block were updated synchronously, but blocks were updated asynchronously. They experimented with three schemes: (1) at each time step, a block is chosen at random with replacement; (2) at each time step, a block is chosen at random without replacement; (3) at each time step, a block is chosen according to a fixed update order.|$|E

Detection of special causes of variations {{is a basic}} task in manufacturing, {{that has to be}} performed continuously to maintain any process stable as well as predictable. In this paper, a contribution to automate performance control is presented, based on synthesizing Cellular Neural Networks as associative memories for pro-actively recognizing unnatural behaviours. As an example, a test case is developed by considering abnormal <b>cyclic</b> <b>behaviours</b> given by sinusoidal signals. For this purpose, a CNN is synthesized for an associative memory, to recognize these unnatural situations. A robustness analysis of the synthesized network is then developed in the presence of unnatural behaviours in the form of input noises.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this model}} the <b>cyclic</b> plastic <b>behaviour</b> in the {{transition}} cycle (from virgin state to saturated state) has been studied for the material SS 316. The dynamic recovery terms in Chaboche's kinematic hardening law have been modified with a memory function to include <b>cyclic</b> hardening/softening <b>behaviour</b> during transition cycles. The memory function has been calibrated for this material to obtain a saturated value at the stable hysteresis loop. The hardening rate (increase in hardening stress per cycle) is also matched by proper calibration constant. All the material constants have been derived from uniaxial strain controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) test results from virgin state to saturated state at stable hysteresis loop. The material model developed with the kinematic hardening rules has been plugged into a Finite Element (FE) program. The results obtained from FE simulations have been compared with the experimental results at different strain amplitudes...|$|R

40|$|Plastic {{ratcheting}} plays a {{key role}} in wear and rolling contact fatigue crack formation at the wheel-rail interface. Tests to examine the wear and rolling contact fatigue behaviour of rail materials over a wide range of service conditions are expensive and can be impractical. A physical simulation of the deformation behaviour associated with ratcheting is an attractive replacement for such tests. In this work, the Plane Stress Local Torsion (PSLT) test is proposed as a novel mechanical testing method to physically simulate near-surface deformation in rails and to characterize the <b>cyclic</b> deformation <b>behaviour</b> of rail materials. Contrary to the orthodox mechanical tests, the proposed method is capable of producing a nonlinear strain gradient in test samples which resembles the real gradient in the rail-wheel system. The PSLT testing was performed on specimens of the nominated rail steels in a strain-controlled fashion to simulate the unidirectional as well as the fully reversing strain cycles. The test was used to examine the <b>cyclic</b> hardening <b>behaviour</b> and ratcheting characteristics of a range of high strength rail materials under cyclic loading at room temperature. The effect of the cyclic strain amplitude under symmetrical strain cycling on the <b>cyclic</b> hardening <b>behaviour</b> was investigated. Experimental torque-twist data were used to compare the plastic flow behaviour of commonly used rail materials in heavy haul applications under cyclic loading. The cyclic and ratcheting strain accumulation behaviour in the test samples was characterized based on the torque-twist data to allow a comparative study of the mechanical properties.
