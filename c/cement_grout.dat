40|$|Currently, {{hydraulic}} <b>cement</b> <b>grouts</b> {{are approved}} for Iowa Department of Transportation projects {{on the basis}} of a pullout test. However, other properties of the grouts should be evaluated. Therefore, this research was initiated to develop criteria to better evaluate hydraulic <b>cement</b> <b>grouts.</b> Fourteen grouts were tested for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency and shrinkage. Tested grouts all yielded compressive strengths higher than 3000 psi at 7 days and durability factors were well above 70. Time of set and consistency was adequate. The testing showed most grouts tested shrank, even though tested grouts were labeled non-shrink grouts. For many applications of grouts such as setting in anchor bolts and as a filler, minor shrinkage is not a problem. However, for some critical applications, shrinkage cannot be tolerated. The proposed Instructional Memorandum will identify those grouts which do not excessively shrink or expand in the tests used.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the possibility of using fly ash <b>cement</b> as <b>grouts</b> for micropiles. This type of special geotechnical work is commonly used for many applications. Generally, micropiles grouts are prepared using Portland cement, although the standards do not restrict the cement type to use, as long as they achieve a strength requirement. In this research, fly ash <b>cement</b> <b>grouts</b> made with w:c ratios 0. 40, 0. 45, 0. 50 and 0. 55 were studied from 2 up to 90 days of age. Their microstructure was characterized using the non-destructive impedance spectroscopy technique, electrical resistivity, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Their durability properties have been studied by determining the water penetration under pressure, and the chloride diffusion coefficient. The compressive strength was also measured and determined, and a maximum water:cement ratio, different for each cement type was obtained. All the results were compared to those obtained for Portland <b>cement</b> <b>grouts.</b> The results obtained confirm that the performance of micropiles made using fly ash <b>cement</b> <b>grouts</b> is adequate, and as it is well know the cements with mineral admixtures provide environmental benefits, so the use of cement including fly ash will contribute to the sustainability, with similar properties to those given by OPC.
