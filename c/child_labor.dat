50|$|Income from cocoa {{industry}} for small cocoa farmers is not stable because when market price of cocoa is low, the price paid to each {{link in the}} industry is getting lower and cocoa farmers who produce raw products get {{very little in the}} chain. In order to keep the cost of cocoa low, cocoa farmers seek cheapest labor in order to make profit. In Africa, a cocoa labor can only make less than 2 dollars per day, which is below poverty line. <b>Child</b> <b>labors</b> between the age from 12 to 15 in cocoa industry work as much as an adult labors, but they are paid less than adult labors. Coffee farmers also prefer <b>child</b> <b>labors</b> because tamed <b>children</b> are more respectful and easier to be controlled in comparison with adult labors. A survey conducted by U.S Department of Labor indicates that in 2005, 92 percent of children between the age from 5 to 15 are involved in heavy loads carrying works in coca industry which can cause open wounds. <b>Child</b> <b>labors</b> also face physical punishment including withholding meals and beating when they cannot meet work expectations or try to escape.|$|R

The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between social contextual factors and <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>labor.</b> METHODS: Population-based cohort study carried out with 2, 512 families living in 23 subareas of a large urban city in Brazil from 2000 to 2002. A random one-stage cluster sampling was used to select families. Data were obtained through individual household interviews using questionnaires. The annual cumulative incidence of <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>labor</b> was estimated for each district. New <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>labor</b> cases were those who had their first job over the two-year follow-up. The annual cumulative incidence of <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>labor</b> was the response variable and predictors were contextual factors such as lack of social support, social deprivation, unstructured family, perceived violence, poor school quality, poor environment conditions, and poor public services. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression were used to assess the associations. RESULTS: There were selected 943 families corresponding to 1, 326 non-working children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years. Lack of social support, social deprivation, perceived violence were all positively and individually associated with the annual cumulative incidence of <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>labor.</b> In the multiple linear regression model, however, only lack of social support and perceived violence in the neighborhood were positively associated to <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>labor.</b> No effect was found for poor school quality, poor environment conditions, poor public services or unstructured family.
