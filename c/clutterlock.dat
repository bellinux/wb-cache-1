40|$|The Space Shuttle Challenger was maneuvered into an SAR data-acquisition mode {{to capture}} a SIR-B scene of Hurricane Josephine, which {{presented}} itself as an unscheduled target of opportunity during NASA Mission 41 -G during October 1984. Steeply sloped seas approaching 10 m in height were observed several hundred km {{in advance of the}} hurricane track. Mission attitude data indicate that the Shuttle pitch, roll, and yaw were unstable during the data take. The statistical <b>clutterlock</b> used by the ground SAR processor yields a Doppler frequency estimate that tracks the Shuttle yaw variation but is ambiguous with a single discontinuity equal to one multiple of the radar pulse repetition frequency. The SIR-B signal data have been compressed under several Doppler parameterizations to investigate the ambiguity of the <b>clutterlock.</b> Resultant ocean images are analyzed for their contrast and resolution properties...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) is {{a powerful}} tool for mapping and remote sensing. The theory and operation of SAR have seen a period of intense activity in recent years. This paper attempts to review some of the more advanced topics studied in connection with modern SAR systems based on digital processing. Following a brief review of the principles involved in the operation of SAR, attention is focussed on special topics such as advanced SAR modelling and focussing techniques, in particular <b>clutterlock</b> and autofocus, Doppler centroid (DC) estimation methods involving seismic migration technique, moving target imaging, bistatic radar imaging, effects of system nonlinearities, etc...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm {{has been developed}} for estimation of the echo phase delay in spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This algorithm utilizes the spacecraft ephemeris data and the radar echo data to produce estimates of two parameters: (1) the centroid of the Doppler frequency spectrum f(d) and (2) the Doppler frequency rate. Results are presented from tests conducted with Seasat SAR data. The test data indicates that estimation accuracies of 3 Hz for f(d) and 0. 3 Hz/sec for the Doppler frequency rate are attainable. The <b>clutterlock</b> and autofocus techniques used for estimation of f(d) and the Doppler frequency rate, respectively are discussed and the algorithm developed for optimal implementation of these techniques is presented...|$|E
40|$|Radar signal {{processing}} applications frequently require {{an estimate of}} the Doppler centroid of a received signal. The Doppler centroid estimate is required for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing. It is also required for some applications involving target motion estimation and antenna pointing direction estimation. In some cases, the Doppler centroid can be accurately estimated based on available information regarding the terrain topography, the relative motion between the sensor and the terrain, and the antenna pointing direction. Often, the accuracy of the Doppler centroid estimate can be improved by analyzing the characteristics of the received SAR signal. This kind of {{signal processing}} is also referred to as <b>clutterlock</b> processing. A Doppler centroid estimation (DCE) algorithm is described which contains a linear estimator optimized for the type of terrain surface that can be modeled by a quasi-homogeneous source (QHS). Information on the following topics is presented: (1) an introduction to the theory of Doppler centroid estimation; (2) analysis of the performance characteristics of previously reported DCE algorithms; (3) comparison of these analysis results with experimental results; (4) a description and performance analysis of a Doppler centroid estimator which is optimized for a QHS; and (5) comparison of the performance of the optimal QHS Doppler centroid estimator with that of previously reported methods...|$|E
40|$|The basic SAR {{theory is}} conceptually simple (Appendix A) yet when one {{looks into the}} inner {{workings}} of the SAR processor it appears quite complicated. The most difficult part of the problem is related to the coupling between the azimuthal compression and the orbital parameters. In the old days when the satellite orbits were not known very accurately, one would use techniques such as <b>clutterlock</b> and autofocus to derive the orbital parameters from the data. This is no longer necessary with the high accuracy orbits available today. A standard processing sequence follows where the first two steps are done onboard the satellite while the remaining 4 steps are done by the user with a digital SAR processor. The discussion provided here is for the ERS- 1 satellite although the concepts translate to any modern strip-mode SAR satellite. Processing onboard the satellite Demodulate- The electromagnetic wave consists of a chirp of bandwidth B (~ 15 MHz) superimposed on carrier frequency ωo (~ 5 GHz). To record the return signal, one could simply digitize the amplitude of the electric field E(t) at a sampling rate of 10 GHz using 1 -byte encoding. However, this would generate 10 Gbytes of data every second! We are really only interested in how the chirp has been delayed and distorted by the reflection off the Earth’...|$|E
