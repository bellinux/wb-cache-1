Visual {{assessment}} has lack of objectivity and the equipment for color measurement is very expensive. In this study, we developed a device for quantitative analysis of the color using optical elements. With the color sensor, the ratio of RGB was calculated by measuring the light intensity that is reflected from an object.

40|$|Simple dot {{hybridization}} and fluorometric hybridization {{methods in}} microdilution wells were designed and established for rapid and routine genetic identification of viridans group streptococci. Reference DNA extracted from each strain of 24 reference Streptococcus species was fixed both on a nitrocellulose filter {{and in a}} microdilution well. A 1 -ml portion of the bacterial suspension which matched the turbidity of McFarland no. 2 standard was prepared when a streptococcal strain was isolated. It was lysed with achromopeptidase, and the DNA was quickly labeled with photobiotin under a sunlamp for 15 min. Dot hybridization and fluorometric hybridization were then carried out between the labeled DNA of the unknown organism and 24 unlabeled reference DNAs. Hybridized fragments on a nitrocellulose filter were detected by using alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and analyzed with a <b>color</b> graphic <b>analyzer.</b> Hybridized fragments in microdilution wells were quantitatively detected by using an enzyme, streptavidin-conjugated beta-D-galactosidase, and a fluorogenic substrate, 4 -methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside. Strains belonging to each genetically distinct species could be identified by this dot blot hybridization test. However, some clinical strains cross-hybridized with two or more reference species, {{and then they were}} difficult to differentiate by dot blot hybridization. In such a case, fluorometric identification provided reliable results because the fluorometric method was more quantitative than dot blot identification. By these methods, it was possible to determine species assignment within the viridans group...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} reported here was to determine when attention to one attribute adversely affects the identification of another attribute. Specifically, we investigated divided attention between color and shape (1) when observers report the color and {{the shape of the}} same object, and (2) when observers report the color of one object and the shape of another object. To the extent that <b>color</b> and shape <b>analyzers</b> are independent, attention to one attribute should not affect identification performance on the other attribute. Alternatively, if we attend to objects, the identification of attributes will be positively correlated if the attributes are from the same object and negatively correlated if they are from different objects. We investigated the question of feature independence using a dual-task procedure in which observers were instructed to report both the color and shape of either one or two briefly presented target items. On different blocks of trials, observers were instructed to give different attentional priority to reporting the color versus the shape of the target item(s). This procedure enabled us to use descriptive methods, such as the performance operating characteristic (POC; Norman & Bobrow, 1975) or the attention operating characteristic (AOC; Kinchla, 1969, 1980; Sperling & Melchner, 1978 a, 1978 b), {{in order to get a}} complete picture of joint performance across instructions.

Five chemically cured composites, seven light-cured composites, and three resin-modified glass-ionomer cements {{were placed in}} acrylic rings. After curing, they were left at 37 °C for 1 week before baseline measurement, and then stored in 60 °C distilled water up to 4 weeks. Color change was determined by a <b>color</b> <b>analyzer,</b> and contrast ratio representing opacity was calculated. All chemically cured composites tested discolored to dark yellow or dark brown after 4 weeks. Opacity decreased for two macrofilled composites. Light-cured composites discolored slightly, but their opacity change was negligible.

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{objective}} was to relate the coloration of fruits of Jatropha curcas L during the maturation process with morphometric (fruits and seeds) and germinative characteristics (seeds). Fruits were collected at various maturation stages from mast trees located in Eldorado/MS, and six maturation stages were visually classified based on fruit’s epicarp color. Epicarp digital colorimetry was used to characterize maturation stages in addition to morphometric variables of length and width of fruits and seeds, as well their water content. For determining the physiological potential it was used germination test, emergence velocity index and first count of germination. Results indicated that seeds of J. curcas should be harvested when fruit epicarp shows a reading equal or smaller than 82, 70 or 65 nm of red, green or blue scales from a digital <b>color</b> <b>analyzer.</b> Seeds of fruits with that colorimetry can be harvested in virtue of the maxim acumululation of dry mass, water content below 38, 5 % and higher physiological potential.

40|$|A {{simple method}} to {{evaluate}} the thickness distribution of the deposition layer formed on the first wall is proposed using an innovative measurement concept of the optical reflection coefficient, which is measured as the RGB (red, green, blue) value using a compact <b>color</b> <b>analyzer.</b> Analysis of the samples exposed to plasmas during an experimental campaign shows {{the relationship between the}} thickness of the deposition layer and the reflection coefficient, which is followed by the single layer model. The reflection coefficient clearly indicates the thickness of the deposition layer between 10 and 100 nm. The reflection coefficients of stainless steel plates on the helically twisted coil in one of the 10 toroidal sections of the vacuum vessel in the Large Helical Device (LHD) are measured. There is almost no deposition layer on the inner side of the torus, however, the deposition layer reaches a thickness of over 100 nm on the first wall near the divertor region. On the outer side of the torus, almost the entire area is covered by the deposition layer. Reflection coefficient measurements indicate that approximately 60 % of the area on the measured coil can is coated with a deposition layer over 10 nm thick, which suggests that this area plays a role in the wall retention...|$|E

Here we evaluated {{the progression of}} hepatic fibrosis using a pulmonary artery banding (PAB) -induced right heart failure model and investigated whether cardiac output (CO) {{is responsible for the}} progression of hepatic fibrosis. Five-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats divided into the PAB and sham-operated control groups. After 4 weeks from operation, we measured CO by echocardiography, and hepatic fibrosis ratio by pathological examination using a <b>color</b> <b>analyzer.</b> In the PAB group, CO was significantly lower by 48 % than that in the control group (78. 2 ± 27. 6 and 150. 1 ± 31. 2 ml/min, P< 0. 01). Hepatic fibrosis ratio and serum hyaluronic acid, an index of hepatic fibrosis, were significantly increased in the PAB group than those in the control group (7. 8 ± 1. 7 and 1. 0 ± 0. 2 %, P< 0. 01, 76. 2 ± 27. 5 and 32. 7 ± 7. 5 ng/ml, P< 0. 01). Notably, the degree of hepatic fibrosis significantly correlated a decrease in CO. Immunohistological analysis revealed that hepatic stellate cells were markedly activated in hypoxic areas, and HIF- 1 α positive hepatic cells were increased in the PAB group. Furthermore, by real-time PCR analyses, transcripts of profibrotic and fibrotic factors (TGF-β 1, CTGF, procollargen I, procollargen III, MMP 2, MMP 9, TIMP 1, TIMP 2) were significantly increased in the PAB group. In addition, western blot analyses revealed that the protein level of HIF- 1 α was significantly increased in the PAB group than that in the control group (2. 31 ± 0. 84 and 1. 0 ± 0. 18 arbitrary units, P< 0. 05).
