40|$|Apples and pears {{are among}} the most {{important}} commercial fruit species grown in Latvia. Because of suitability to local climatic conditions, mainly domestic cultivars and cultivars originating in neighbouring countries are grown. The planting material of pome fruits produced and used for establishment of new orchards in Latvia corresponds to the <b>Conformitas</b> <b>Agraria</b> <b>Communitatis</b> standard due to the unavailability of nuclear stock. To establish virus-tested, experimental nuclear stock for apple and pear, one to two years old candidate plants were exposed to thermotherapy at + 38 °C for 40 to 70 days. The mother trees and candidate plants before treatment were tested for the presence of the four most widespread pome fruit viruses by RT-PCR. The shoot tips of the heat-treated plants were grafted onto seedling rootstocks and were re-tested for the four viruses by RT-PCR during {{the next three to five}} vegetation seasons. Several plants of apple cultivars ‘Dace’, ‘Zarja Alatau’, ‘Rubin’, and ‘Ausma’ remained infected either with Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, Apple stem growing virus or Apple stem pitting virus after the thermotherapy. Tests on woody indicators were carried out to determine possible presence of graft-transmittable organisms according to EPPO guidelines for the establishment of nuclear stock material for pome fruits...|$|E
40|$|A reverse {{transcription}} nested polymerase chain re-action (RT-n-PCR) {{was developed and}} applied to the detection of Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Cherry leaf roll virus (CLRV), Olive latent virus- 1 (OLV- 1), Olive latent virus- 2 (OLV- 2), Olive latent ringspot virus (OLRSV) and Strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRV) in naturally infected olive cuttings. The method was more sensitive and reliable than conventional RT-PCR. This increased sensitivity al-lowed virus detection in samples that were negative to {{the first round of}} RT-PCR amplification. Coupled with simple sample preparation from cortical scrapings of olive cuttings, this protocol should be useful in routine testing for olive viruses. Key words: olive-infecting viruses, nested-PCR, de-tection, crude extract. In the last twenty years 13 different viruses of seven different genera have been identified in olive trees (Olea europea L.). (Martelli, 1999; Felix and Clara, 2000). Some are well-characterised ubiquitous pathogens that infect many crops, whereas others ap-pear exclusive to olive and have been characterised only in part. Analysis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) profiles from asymptomatic plants suggests that a num-ber of other undescribed viruses also infect olive. These viruses have escaped detection as they probably occur in low concentration and may not be mechanically transmissible. According to legislation enforced by the European Union Directive 93 / 48 on the <b>Conformitas</b> <b>Agraria</b> <b>Communitatis</b> (CAC), olive nurseries should be free from a number of detrimental organisms, including viruses. Due to widespread occurrence of latent viral in-fections, visual inspection is virtually useless, and field observations should be complemented by quick, sensi...|$|E
40|$|Xanthomonas citri pv. citri causes Asiatic {{citrus canker}} (ACC), which induces erumpent, callus-like lesions on all aerial organs, and {{consequently}} defoliation, premature fruit drop, and twig dieback under high inoculum pressure. Present in most tropical and subtropical citrus producing regions, the disease {{can lead to}} important decreases in yield and limitations to export markets due to the quarantine status of the pathogen in some countries (Graham et al. 2004). Strains assigned to genetic lineage 1 within pathotype A, which has the widest host range comprising most citrus cultivars and citrus relatives, were shown to be primarily involved in the worldwide expansion of the bacterium over the 20 th century (Pruvost et al. 2014). ACC has been considered endemic in Réunion Island since the 1970 s, but was likely present earlier and was not subjected to any eradication attempt. Most citrus growers on the island frequently apply copper-based pesticides as part of integrated pest management programs. A recurring lack of ACC control in several citrus groves was investigated in 2014 using our lab collection of authenticated X. citri pv. citri strains. A total of 501 strains from active epidemics as well as 123 historical strains isolated from 1978 onward were tested for copper resistance using PCR assays targeting copL (Behlau et al. 2013). A total of 115 strains produced the expected amplicon whereas others (including all historical strains) and the negative control (H 2 O) did not. Phenotypic tests were carried out on low-complexing mineral salts casitone-yeast extract-glycerol-agar (CYE) plates (Zevenhuizen et al. 1979) flooded with bacterial suspensions (≈ 5 × 10 6 cfu ml – 1) in sterile tris buffer (pH 7. 2), allowed to dry for 15 min., inoculated with a sterile CuSO 4, 5 H 2 O solution (10 mg ml – 1) with an easySpiral plater {{used to create a}} gradient of log-increasing copper concentrations toward the plate center and incubated for 2 days at 28 °C. Using this assay, copL + strains grew over a radius (measured from the plate periphery where the concentration of copper are lowest) > 23 mm whereas copL – strains growth radius were constantly lower. Copper-resistant strains (CRS) had minimum inhibitory concentrations for copper sulfate ranging from 128 to 256 μ l ml – 1 (Pruvost et al. 1998). A subset of 20 CRS and 40 copper-susceptible strains (CSS) (including historical strains) were all assigned to genetic lineage 1 by minisatellite typing (performed as reported by Pruvost et al. 2014) and split into two multilocus haplotypes shared also with CSS. CRS were widespread in most citrus production areas of the island where they coexisted with CSS. The oldest CRS dated from 2010. Because no extreme hurricane hit the island between 2010 and 2014, the fast spread of CRS over the island was very likely related to their presence in a major citrus nursery, as confirmed by our data. In Réunion, the European <b>Conformitas</b> <b>Agraria</b> <b>Communitatis</b> (CAC) standards (directive 92 / 34 /EEC) certify the disease-free status of citrus nursery plants (assessed by visual inspections for ACC). CAC is presently recommended but not compulsory. This report suggests that a strict implementation of this procedure would have helped limiting the spread of CRS in Réunion. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
