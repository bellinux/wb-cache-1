50|$|Similar {{to other}} benzodiazepines <b>clotiazepam</b> has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, amnesic, {{anticonvulsant}} and muscle relaxant pharmacological properties. <b>Clotiazepam</b> binds to the benzodiazepine {{site of the}} GABAA receptor where it acts as a full agonist; this action results in an enhanced GABA inhibitory effect at the GABAA receptor which results in the pharmacological effects of <b>clotiazepam.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Clotiazepam</b> (marketed under {{brand name}} Clozan, Distensan, Trecalmo, Rize, Rizen and Veratran) is a {{thienodiazepine}} drug {{which is a}} benzodiazepine analog. The <b>clotiazepam</b> molecule differs from benzodiazepines in that the benzene ring {{has been replaced by}} a thiophene ring. It possesses anxiolytic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, sedative properties. Stage 2 NREM sleep is significantly increased by <b>clotiazepam.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Clotiazepam</b> has a {{relatively}} short elimination half-life and is less prone to accumulation after repeated dosing compared to longer-acting benzodiazepine agents. It is metabolised via oxidation. <b>Clotiazepam</b> is metabolised to hydroxy-clotiazepam and desmethyl-clotiazepam. After oral ingestion of a single 5 mg dose of <b>clotiazepam</b> by three healthy volunteers the drug was rapidly absorbed. The elimination half-life of the drug and its metabolites range from 6.5 hours to 18 hours. <b>Clotiazepam</b> is 99 percent bound to plasma protein. In elderly men the elimination half-life is longer and in elderly women the volume of distribution is increased. Individuals with liver impairment have a reduced volume of distribution {{as well as a}} reduced total clearance of clotiazepam; renal impairment does not affect the kinetics of <b>clotiazepam.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Clotiazepam</b> {{has been}} trialed {{and found to}} be {{effective}} in the short-term management of anxiety. <b>Clotiazepam</b> is also used as a premedicant in minor surgery in France and Japan, where the drug is commercially available under the brand names Veratran and Rize, respectively.|$|E

50|$|A {{cross-over}} study in six healthy volunteers (median age 28 years) was conducted using single-dose pharmacokinetics of 5 mg <b>clotiazepam</b> drops, oral tablets, and sublingual tablets. The formulations had similar systemic availability. Compared with oral tablets, the sublingual route gave a lower peak concentration and a delayed peak time, while drops gave a greater maximum concentration {{with a similar}} peak time. The use of drops is suggested for a more marked initial effect and the sublingual route for easier administration, especially in the elderly.|$|E
40|$|The anti-ulcer {{action of}} <b>clotiazepam</b> (a {{thienodiazepine}} derivative) was studied in mice subjected to non-physical and physical stimuli in a communication box. There were {{two groups of}} mice: the &# 34;sender&# 34; mice that received electric shocks on the feet and responded by squealing and jumping, and the &# 34;responder&# 34; mice that were affected by the senders' responses without receiving shocks on the feet. Gastric ulcers resulted in both groups. The effect of <b>clotiazepam</b> was {{compared with that of}} diazepam. The incidence of gastric ulcers was suppressed by <b>clotiazepam</b> at a dose of 3 mg/kg, per os, in &# 34;responder&# 34; and &# 34;sender&# 34; mice, and by diazepam at a dose of 1 mg/kg, per os, in &# 34;responder&# 34; mice. These results suggest that <b>clotiazepam</b> has a suppressive action against gastric ulcers produced by non-physical or physical stimuli, although its potency is slightly weaker than that of diazepam. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Heterologous {{expression}} of a 1, b 2 and g 2 S(g 1) subunits produces a mixed population of GABAA receptors containing a 1 b 2 or a 1 b 2 g 2 S(g 1) subunits. GABA sensitivity (lower in receptors containing g 1 or g 2 S subunits) and the potentiation of GABA-activated chloride currents (IGABA) by benzodiazepines (BZDs) are dependent on g 2 S(g 1) incorporation. A variable g subunit incorporation may affect the estimation of IGABA potentiation by BZDs. We propose an approach for estimation of BZD efficiency that accounts for mixed population of a 1 b 2 and a 1 b 2 g 2 S(g 1) receptors. Experimental approach: We investigated the relation between GABA sensitivity (EC 50) and BZD modulation by analysing triazolam-, clotiazepam- and midazolam-induced potentiation of IGABA in Xenopus oocytes under two-microelectrode voltage clamp. Key results: Plotting EC 50 versus BZD-induced shifts of GABA concentration-response curves (DEC 50 (BZD)) of oocytes injected with different amounts of a 1, b 2 and g 2 S(g 1) cRNA (1 : 1 : 1 – 1 : 1 : 10) revealed a linear regression between g 2 S(g 1) -mediated reduction of GABA sensitivity (EC 50) and DEC 50 (BZD). The slope factors of the regression were always higher for oocytes expressing a 1 b 2 g 1 subunit receptors (1. 8 ± 0. 1 (triazolam), 1. 6 ± 0. 1 (<b>clotiazepam),</b> 2. 3 ± 0. 2 (midazolam)) than for oocytes expressing a 1 b 2 g 2 S receptors (1. 4 ± 0. 1 (triazolam), 1. 4 ± 0. 1 (<b>clotiazepam),</b> 1. 3 ± 0. 1 (midazolam)). Mutant GABAA receptors (a 1 b 2 -R 207 Cg 2 S) with lower GABA sensitivity showed higher drug efficiencies (slope factors 1. 1 ± 0. 1 (triazolam), 1. 1 ± 0. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} CPU {{time and the}} wall clock time of the Raffenetti's P file {{algorithm}} with the usual algorithm on the two electron integrals storing with four suffixes of the ab initio Hartree-Fock calculations. The calculations are performed with the flutoprazepam, triazolam, <b>clotiazepam,</b> etizolam, and flutazolam molecules. These molecules are all minor-tranquilizers with the benzodiazepine or thienodiazepine backbone. The 3 - 21 G basis sets ａｒｅ employed. Almost in all cases, P file algorithm gave slower speed than the usual algorithm. The number of two electron integrals increases almost two {{times larger than the}} usual algorithms. In a large molecule, the matrix of the two electron integrals becomes very sparse and the recombination of the integrals just increases the total number of the integrals. It is concluded that the P method sometimes calculates faster but sometimes does not. In a large scale calculation, it should be suggested to perform a test calculation to confirm which method is faster prior to the real calculations. Copyrightは日本コンピュータ化学会, J-STAGEよりダウンロードして使用...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{liquid chromatography}} tandem mass spectrometry method {{was developed and}} validated for simultaneous detection of benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-like hypnotics and some metabolites (7 -aminoflunitrazepam, alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, chlordiazepoxide, chlornordiazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, <b>clotiazepam,</b> cloxazolam, diazepam, ethylloflazepate, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, N-desmethylflunitrazepam, nitrazepam, N-methylclonazepam (internal standard), nordiazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, temazepam, tetrazepam, triazolam, zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone) in urine and whole blood. Sample preparation was performed on a mixed-mode cation exchange solid phase extraction cartridge. Electrospray ionization {{was found to be}} more efficient than atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The use of a mobile phase of high pH resulted in higher retention and higher electrospray ionization signals than the conventional low pH mobile phases. Considering the benefits of a high pH mobile phase on both chromatography and mass spectrometry, its use should be encouraged. In the final method, gradient elution with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 9) and methanol was performed on a small particle column (Acquity C 18, 1. 7 μm, 2. 1 mm × 50 mm).

40|$|A simple chromatographic {{procedure}} is {{reported for the}} determination of some less prescribed but equally important benzodiazepines (<b>Clotiazepam,</b> clozapine and pinazepam) in serum. The optimization studies {{have been made in}} CN, C 18 and C 8 columns, using mobile phase containing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) modified with either propanol, butanol or pentanol. The method proposed for the determination of the three benzodiazepines using a mobile phase of 0. 13 M SDS, 2. 4 % pentanol- 0. 01 M phosphate buffer- 0. 1 % triethylamine (pH 7) at 25 °C and UV detection (240 nm) in a C 8 column. The serum samples was injected directly, without any pretreatment, eluted in less than 8 min, in accordance to their relative polarities, as indicated by their octanol-water partition coefficients. The limits of detection (ng/mL) was in the 1. 6 to 5. 6 and 7 to 87 range, for aqueous and serum samples, respectively. Repeatability and intermediate precision was tested for three different concentrations of the drugs, resulting in the 0. 1 to 2 range. The results obtained here for the separation of the three benzodiazepines in serum were also counter checked at Department of Bio-analytical Chemistry, Universitat Jaume I, Castelló, Spain...|$|E
40|$|Benzodiazepines are {{currently}} {{among the most}} frequently prescribed drugs all over the world. They act as anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, amnesics, antiepileptics and muscle relaxants. Despite their common chemical scaffold, these drugs differ in their pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties. In particular, they are biotransformed by different cytochrome P 450 isoforms and also by different UDP-glucuronosyltransferase subtypes. The most important studies on the metabolic characteristics of several 1, 4 -benzodiazepines, carried out from 1998 onwards, are reported and briefly discussed in this review. Moreover, the analytical methods related to these studies are also described and commented upon and their most important characteristics are highlighted. Most methods are based on liquid chromatography, which provides wide applicability and good analytical performance granting high precision, accuracy and feasibility. Mass spectrometry is gaining widespread acceptance, particularly if the matrix is very complex and variable, such as human or animal blood. However, spectrophotometric detection is still {{used for this purpose}} and can grant sufficient selectivity and sensitivity when coupled to suitable sample pre-treatment procedures.

40|$|GABAA receptors {{composed}} of a 1, ß 2, ? 1 subunits are expressed {{in only a few}} areas of the brain and thus represent interesting drug targets. The pharmacological properties of this receptor subtype, however, are largely unknown. In the present study, we expressed a 1 ß 2 ? 1 -GABAA receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzed their modulation by 21 ligands from 12 structural classes making use of the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method and a fast perfusion system. Modulation of GABA-induced chloride currents (IGABA) was studied at GABA concentrations eliciting 5 to 10 % of the maximal response. Triazolam, <b>clotiazepam,</b> midazolam, 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - octahydro-cyclohepta-(b) pyrazolo[4, 3 -d]pyridin- 3 -one (CGS 20625), 2 -(4 -chlorophenyl) -pyrazolo[4, 3 -c]quinolin- 3 -one (CGS 9896), diazepam, zolpidem, and bretazenil at 1 M concentrations were able to significantly (> 20 %) enhance IGABA in a 1 ß 2 ? 1 receptors. Methyl- 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl-ß-carboline- 3 - carboxylate, 3 -methyl- 6 -[3 -trifluoromethyl-phenyl]- 1, 2, 4 -triazolo[4, 3 -b] pyridazine (Cl 218, 872), clobazam, flumazenil, 5 -(6 -ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 5 - methylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 2 -yl) - 3 -methyl-[1, 2, 4]-oxadiazole (Ru 33203), 2 -phenyl- 4 -(3 -ethyl-piperidinyl) -quinoline (PK 9084), flurazepam, ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 11, 12, 13, 13 a-tetrahydro- 9 -oxo- 9 H-imidazo[1, 5 -a]pyrrolo[2, 1 -c] [1, 4]benzodiazepine- 1 -carboxylate (L- 655, 708), 2 -(6 -ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 5 - methylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 2 -yl) - 4 -methyl-thiazole (Ru 33356), and 6 -ethyl- 7 -methoxy- 5 -methylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 2 -yl) phenylmethanone (Ru 32698) (1 M each) had no significant effect, and flunitrazepam and 2 -phenyl- 4 -(4 -ethyl-piperidinyl) -quinoline (PK 8165) inhibited IGABA. The most potent compounds triazolam, <b>clotiazepam,</b> midazolam, and CGS 20625 were investigated in more detail on a 1 ß 2 ? 1 and a 1 ß 2 ? 2 S receptors. The potency and efficiency of these compounds for modulating I GABA was smaller for a 1 ß 2 ? 1 than for a 1 ß 2 ? 2 S receptors, and their effects on a 1 ß 2 ? 1 could not be blocked by flumazenil. CGS 20625 displayed the highest efficiency by enhancing at 100 M IGABA (a 1 ß 2 ? 2) by 775  17 % versus 526  14 % IGABA (a 1 ß 2 ? 1) and 157  17 % IGABA (a 1 ß 2) (p < 0. 05). These data provide new insight into the pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors containing ? 1 subunits and may aid in the design of specific ligands for this receptor subtype.
