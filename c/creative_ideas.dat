5|$|Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account {{presented}} as a parody of the game designer Peter Molyneux. Created by game artist Adam Capone in 2009, it posts audacious game design ideas {{in the style of}} Molyneux. The account presents Molyneux as a tragicomic character with unrelenting, <b>creative</b> <b>ideas</b> that are continually received by an apathetic audience. Over time, the account evolved from a Molyneux-based persona into a list of potential game concepts. A common theme of the tweets is the untapped potential of emotional game experiences. Molyneux came to appreciate the parody, and has since met Capone in person.|$|E
5|$|Peace on Earth is {{the first}} Christmas album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns. Produced by Mark Hall and Mark A. Miller, it was {{released}} on October 7, 2008. Intended by Hall {{to bring out the}} worshipful aspect of Christmas, the album does not have songs relating to secular Christmas traditions, instead featuring a mix of traditional Christmas carols and original songs. As co-producer, Hall attempted to differentiate the album from their previous ones by attempting to use <b>creative</b> <b>ideas</b> they had not tried before, and he also wanted to utilize the band's female members in a broader and more visible role on the album.|$|E
5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and <b>creative</b> <b>ideas,</b> decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E

40|$|Creativity is {{difficult}} to obtain because people are constrained by their own existing knowledge. One seemingly logical {{solution to this problem}} might be to shift perspectives by taking another person's point of view. However, in this paper I argue and demonstrate that perspective taking seems to have detrimental rather than beneficial effects on <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> generation, particularly when the perspective taker is in a cooperative rather than a competitive mindset. Since perspective taking tends to occur in cooperative, rather than competitive, circumstances in naturalistic settings, I conclude that shifting perspectives by taking another person's perspective might be detrimental to <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> generation. ...|$|R
25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is often used}} in conjunction with divergent thinking. Divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing manner, where many <b>creative</b> <b>ideas</b> are generated and evaluated. Multiple possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. After the process of divergent thinking has been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking to decision making strategies are used leading to a single-best, or most often correct answer. Examples of divergent thinking include using brainstorming, free writing and creative thinking {{at the beginning of the}} problem solving process to generate possible solutions that can be evaluated later. Once a sufficient number of ideas have been explored, convergent thinking can be used. Knowledge, logic, probabilities and other decision-making strategies are taken into consideration as the solutions are evaluated individually in a search for a single best answer which when reached is unambiguous.|$|E
25|$|For an {{organization}} {{to be focused}} on a democratic leadership style, traits, functions and relationships have to be obtained. Before you can classify someone to leadership position, certain qualities have to follow. The common assumptions of leaders are: leaders are born; however, this is not the case. Leaders are developed through different types of training and experience. Through the training and experience, the leader gains different traits to help make the organization functional. Leaders need to be interpersonal, cognitive, and motivational. An interpersonal leader allows for relationships to be built and to communicate messages to their followers. Cognitive leaders are able to problem solve more effective because of their intellectual ability to process information and come up with <b>creative</b> <b>ideas</b> to help eliminate the problem in the organization. Finally, having motivational leaders gets the organization excited about new tasks and this allows for positive productions to occur. Motivation has been associated with ratings of leadership potential, career achievement, and promotion. The three traits will help a leader become successful because others will look up to them, and create a positive organization to work in.|$|E

Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up.

500|$|In June 2009, Adam Capone {{created a}} Twitter account, @PeterMolydeux, as {{a parody of}} the game {{designer}} Peter Molyneux and the audacious game design ideas {{for which he was}} known. The account became a touchpoint for people in the game industry interested in more adventurous game concepts. Capone was inspired by Molyneux's games in his youth, particularly by the open choice structure of the 1994 simulation game Theme Park. Capone, a game artist who worked on titles including Gears of War, Kinectimals, and Saints Row, thought that Molyneux's ambition outweighed his propensity for overstatement, and appreciated the game designer's moxie in an industry known for safe ideas. Capone viewed Molyneux as a tragicomic character: full of <b>creative</b> <b>ideas</b> that are continually received by an unkind or indifferent audience. Capone did not expect the parody account to last long, but he became drawn to the persona. The parody's content came to Capone [...] "naturally" [...] from games, game podcasts, and game news websites. He liked {{that he was able to}} give away his ideas—good and bad—while actual game designers must protect their ideas and implement them before others.|$|E
500|$|Other {{stories were}} {{developed}} from simple concepts. For example, the reformed-vampire episode [...] "Bloodlust" [...] {{was developed to}} suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately. The plot alluded to [...] "racial issues", but not blatantly; rather, as Padalecki noted, they explored it in a [...] "fun way". The episode [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] emerged from the writers' desire to keep the audience guessing. Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a death omen—warning people of future tragedy, {{rather than trying to}} kill them, unlike previous ghosts on the series. However, Humphris had trouble developing the script's outline. Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and have to explain to police what had happened; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode, which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody. The concept for [...] "Tall Tales" [...] originated as a [...] "he said, he said" [...] episode, in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline. The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode, but eventually settled on a trickster because it [...] "can do everything [...] want it to". Although the writers typically prefer to put their own spin on folklore, they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos. Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad, the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean's reaction would be. One of the writers' first <b>creative</b> <b>ideas</b> of the season was depicted in the teaser of [...] "Born Under a Bad Sign", in which a blood-covered Sam wakes up not remembering the past week of his life. The plot, which [...] "fell into place" [...] during the writing process, included demonic possession to explain Sam's actions—an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon.|$|E
40|$|It is {{frequently}} maintained that creativity is a desirable and wholly positive attribute — implicit {{in such a}} claim {{is the idea that}} creativity is also an ideologically neutral attribute. Creativity is regularly understood to exist beyond ideology and politics, and more significantly, perhaps, beyond history. For this reason, cultural histories of the <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> commonly take a substantialist approach to their object of study — in that they take as their starting point an idea of creativity as a fixed or substantial reality that exists outside and beyond the historical field. The manifold possibilities of history are therefore reduced to a narrative about approaches to, or departures from, this fixed constant, and the task of the historian is reduced to one of identifying and describing pure and unadulterated forms of the <b>creative</b> <b>idea,</b> or unmasking corrupt and alienated versions. Hence, for example, in Raymond Williams’ influential histories of the <b>creative</b> <b>idea,</b> successive historical figures come ‘very near to’ (1961 / 2001 : 37) apprehending creativity for what it really is, or else depart from this extra-historical constant in ways that Williams’ judges to be ‘confusing and at times seriously misleading’ (Williams 1976 / 1983 : 84) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{author of}} this article {{considers}} advertising as an example of artistic communication {{with a focus on}} the aesthetic characteristics of the <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> which is one of basic components of an advertising product. The article describes basic principles of aesthetics analysis in advertising communications, their strong and weak points, motives and features of historical transformation of advertising messages, the changed role of the <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> and the artistic image.  The author reviews the main stages of advertising product creation from the perspective of aesthetic function actualization in advertising and makes a special emphasis on the differences of value characteristics and evaluation criteria of the <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> and the final advertising product. This allows to separate the concepts of advertising and an advertising idea in the aesthetic perspective and to consider the creative component as a phenomenon that has its own aesthetic value and potential. On this basis, the author attempts to identify the features of aesthetic concept of a creative idea and to determine its internal potential for further artistic implementation. Aesthetic concept of a creative idea is regarded by the author as the starting point of artistic communication in advertising, which was considered earlier {{from the perspective of the}} genre and stylistic features of the implementation itself. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to explore factors {{external}} to the individual that encourage <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> generation in SME environments, understanding their importance {{in a variety of}} organisational contexts. The original contribution to knowledge made by this thesis is the creation of a framework which aids understanding by splitting the various factors into those responsible for initiating and sustaining idea generation. Literature concerning <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> generation is continuously developing and contains a broad spectrum of topics and understandings. Key amongst these are leadership, the nature of <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> generation, theories such as the ‘strength of weak ties’, collective creativity and the concept of ‘flow’. Fieldwork followed a primarily qualitative, inductive approach, using exploratory surveys, semi-structured interviews and participant observation to develop rich narrative ‘stories’ of idea generation for ten different organisations. Data was analysed in accordance with the principles of grounded theory and resulted in numerous novel findings such as the importance of internal organisational contacts to the development of ideas, the notion that organisational visions can be used to guide idea generation and the effect that physical distance has on the development of interpersonal ties. Leadership also featured heavily within the analysis process with it being found that a combination of transformational and servant qualities best enables idea generation in SME contexts. These and other findings were reflected in the final framework produced by this thesis. From a practical perspective findings from this study arguably have implications for both organisational and leadership development in SME contexts, although overall generalisability is hindered by the chosen sample. Future studies could potentially focus on applying quantitative methodologies to verify the final framework or extend understandings by interlinking organisational factors discussed by this thesis with individual characteristics, mental process and/or experiences that are also known to drive <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> production...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed that successful innovation depends on <b>creative</b> <b>idea</b> generation: the more ideas are generated, {{the higher the}} probability of selecting {{a very good idea}} should be.

The present studies aim to explain this phenomenon. We identified the strong tendency of our participants to select feasible and desirable ideas, at the cost of originality, as the main reason for their poor selection performance. Two manipulations of participants' processing of the available ideas (exclusion instructions and quality ratings) had no effect on selection effectiveness. In contrast, explicitly instructing participants to select <b>creative</b> or original <b>ideas</b> did improve selection effectiveness with regard to idea originality, {{but at the same time}} decreased participants' satisfaction and the rated effectiveness of chosen ideas.
