40|$|We {{have tried}} to design an all terrain vehicle that meets {{international}} standards and is also cost effective at the same time. We have focused on every point of <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> to improve the performance of vehicle without failure of <b>roll</b> <b>cage.</b> We began the task of designing by conducting extensive research of ATV <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> through finite element analysis. A <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> is a skeleton of an ATV. The <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> not only forms the structural base but also a 3 -D shell surrounding the occupant which protects the occupant in case of impact and roll over incidents. The <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> also adds to the aesthetics of a vehicle. The design and development comprises of material selection, chassis and frame design, cross section determination, determining strength requirements of <b>roll</b> <b>cage,</b> stress analysis and simulations to test the ATV against failure...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze {{the design of the}} Formula SAE <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> both analytical and by numerical methods. This analysis is based on the dynamic loads experienced by the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> under normal driving conditions, along with the torsional stiffness of the <b>roll</b> <b>cage.</b> A <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> which is torsionally stiff enables a desirable roll moment distribution to be achieved for good handling balance. A <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> which can absorb high energy impacts whilst controlling the rate of deceleration will increase the likelihood of drivers surviving a crash without injury. This work describes how a common model of the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> is developed using catia v 5 and Hyper Mesh to allow both linear and non-linear Finite Element Analysis to be performed by LS-DYNA software. The results from this analytical calculations will be used in future designs of Formula SAE <b>roll</b> <b>cage,</b> with the recommendations made that the future design incorporate stressed mild steel and carbon-fiber skins on a tubular space frame. This is in preparation for a future semi-monocoque design. Improvements for the testing procedures include a need for a lighter and more accurate car swing setup, along with a more rigid torsional test...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} of this research work {{is to find the}} mode shapeand corresponding natural frequency of a <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> for an ATV. Finite element analysis is used to determine the mode shapes and frequencies. We have designed a <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> which consists of both structural base and 3 -D shell which protects the user in case of impact and roll over incidents. CATIA V 5 has been used for modeling the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> and ANSYS 14. 5 for FEA analysis. The body shape of the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> is fixed from the front end. The frame of the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> consists of three main parts known as boot space, driver cabin and engine chamber.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the Design and Analysis of <b>Roll</b> <b>Cage</b> for the Formula Student Car. In a Formula Student Car the <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> {{is one of the}} main components. It form the {{structure}} or the main frame of the vehicle on which other parts like Engine, Steering, and Transmission are mounted. <b>Roll</b> <b>Cage</b> comes under the sprung mass of the Vehicle. There are a lot of forces acting on vehicle in the running condition. These forces are responsible for causing crack initiation and deformation in the vehicle. Deformation results in Stress Generation in the <b>Roll</b> <b>Cage.</b> Hence it is important to find out these areas of maximum Stresses. In this paper an attempt is made to find out these areas by carrying out FEA of the <b>Roll</b> <b>Cage.</b> We have carried out Crash Analysis (Front and Side Impact), Torsional Analysis, Bump Analysis, and Modal Analysis. In running condition, there are vibrations generated in the vehicle. Here in this paper the Vibration analysis is also done known as Direct Frequency Response Analysis. All these Analysis have been carried out in HyperWorks 13. 0. The design procedure follows all the rules laid down by FSAE Rule Book for Formula Type Cars...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} {{an investigation into}} the mounting points of a <b>Roll</b> <b>Cage</b> on car frame using finite element methods. On most of motorsports competitions vehicles or military purposes vehicles it is compulsory or highly recommended to fit a <b>Roll</b> <b>Cage</b> to the vehicle to prevent major damage of the car and protecting the occupants {{in the event of a}} roll-over accident. A critical point in the design of a <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> is the mounting points where the device is attached to the vehicle. A bad design of that part can result on a poor behaviour of the protection system on a crash event. Beam element model is constructed from a wireframe geometry of a representative <b>roll</b> <b>cage</b> to quantify the forces that the attachments points receive on a typical FIA test. Then, FE models of different mountings configurations are created and parametrical study is performed in order to provide guidance on how to improve mountings performance. Tests of two mountings specimens are carried to validate the FE models using a Rig created for this work...|$|R
