Concluiu que, provavelmente, apenas 48, 1 % das estufas da Grande Florianópolis estavam operando segundo as normas de tempo e temperatura preconizadas na {{literatura}} e pode constatar que houve falha de 22, 5 % na eficácia das 40 estufas da amostra testada. Abstract : The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dry heat dental offices in Florianópolis, S. C., Brazil. The work intended to discover the capacity dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> have to eradicate the spores of B. subtilis on biological indicators strips and also to compare temperatures during the sterilization cycles to the ones proposed in the literature. Moreover, it endeavored to assure that the built in thermometer and thermostat in the dry <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> were reliable, and to analyze the influence how the materials were displayed in the sterilization chambers. As a complementing part, a survey was made in order to investigate who operates the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> in different dental clinics and their specialist field of work. The results indicated that, out of the samples tested, a rate fall of 22. 5 % was found in dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> effectiveness to destroy the spores of R subtilis. Moreover, from the final results, it is possible to infer that only 48. 1 % of the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> investigated actually used the parameters (time and temperatare) as proposed in the literature. From the observed samples, it was also shown that the built in thermometers and thermostat were not reliable. Furthermore, results suggested that there was temperature variation inside the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens,</b> therefore, it was found that the materials placed in the upper shelf received less heat. Finally, findings confirmed that dental assistants were responsible for managing the dry <b>heat</b> <b>ovens</b> in 67. 5 % of the dental offices surveyed. Last but no least, although there was a vast area of specialists participating in the survey, such as periodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics, endodontics, implantodontics, pedodontics, and radiology, general clinics showed to have participated with the highest percentage (57. 5 %) ...|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{intermittent}} heat treatment on cellulose crystallites in wood was studied to evaluate quantitatively the changes of crystallinity induced by intermittent and <b>continuous</b> <b>heating.</b> The changes in crystallinity {{were found to}} be strongly affected by the intermittent heat treatment. The increased crystallinity, the width of the crystals, and the piezoelectric properties were the same for the first intermittent <b>heating</b> as for <b>continuous</b> <b>heating.</b> Further intermittent heating for the same time duration and temperature had no effect on the above properties, probably due to the stopping of the thermal reaction during the interval. Our results suggested that intermittent heat treatment has certain critical cooling temperatures that stop the thermal reaction and are closely related to the duration of the interval. Samples once exposed to a certain duration of heat treatment and then cooled need more time, about twice that of the first duration of intermittent <b>heating</b> compared with <b>continuous</b> <b>heating,</b> to reach maximum crystallinity in wood cellulose.|$|R
