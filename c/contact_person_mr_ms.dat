40|$|BACKGROUND: Persons {{with less}} severe disabilities {{are able to}} express their needs and show {{initiatives}} in social <b>contacts,</b> <b>persons</b> with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD), however, depend on others for this. This study analysed the structure of informal networks of persons with PIMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data concerning the number, type and frequency of contacts were collected in 205 persons with PIMD. RESULTS: The mean number of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> was 5. 1 (range: 0 - 26, SD: 4. 2) per year. 79. 4 % of the <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> are family, {{with an average of}} 72. 3 contacts per year. Parents had significantly more contact compared to the other informal <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> In 2. 2 % of the sample contacts with peers were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The informal networks of persons with PIMD consist mainly of family. The question arises how informal networks can be expanded and which role professionals have in this process...|$|R
