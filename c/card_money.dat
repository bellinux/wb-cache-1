I have ordered the Duchess to let me have an hour with the Duke at his first coming, to give him a true state of persons and things. I believe the Duke of Shrewsbury will hardly be declared your Governor yet; at least, I think so now; but resolutions alter very often. The Duke of Hamilton gave me a pound of snuff to-day, admirable good. I wish DD had it, and Ppt too, if she likes it. It cost me {{a quarter of an hour}} of his politics, which I was forced to hear. Lady Orkney(10) is making me a writing-table of her own contrivance, and a bed nightgown. She is perfectly kind, like a mother. I think the devil was in it the other day, that I should talk to her of an ugly squinting cousin of hers, and the poor lady herself, you know, squints like a dragon. The other day we had a long discourse with her about love; and she told us a saying of her sister Fitz-Hardinge,(11) which I thought excellent, that in men, desire begets love, and in women, love begets desire. We have abundance of our old criers(12) still hereabouts. I hear every morning your women with the old satin and taffeta, etc., the fellow with old coats, suits or cloaks. Our weather is abominable of late. We have not two tolerable days in twenty. I have lost money again at ombre, with Lord Orkney and others; yet, after all, this year I have lost but three-and-twenty shillings; so that, considering <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> I am no loser.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{began as}} a {{short-term}} financial device, {{it was not long}} before the cards began to circulate among people as a medium of common exchange and later issues of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> were provided with this specific aim in mind. Over time, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> became {{an integral part of the}} currency of French Canada and remained in circulation until the fall of Quebec in 1759 (Bank of Canada, 1966, p. 7).|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1685, once {{the first issue of}} <b>card</b> <b>money</b> had been redeemed, Jacques Demeulles wrote of his {{experiment}} in a report to the home government: “No person has refused <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> and so good has been the effect that by this means the troops have lived as usual” (Lester, 1964, p. 11). Upon receiving this report, the King condemned the issue of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> for two reasons; firstly, that so easy a method of raising temporary funds would lead to extravagant expenditure in the colonies, for which he would be responsible when <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was withdrawn from circulation; and secondly, that the cards would be easy to counterfeit. The King’s initial concern would prove to be a considerably greater problem than the latter. However, forgeries of later issues of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> periodically caused a stir in the colonies, and measures for dealing with those responsible had to be developed (Lester, 1964).|$|E

5000|$|In 1685, [...] "card money" [...] was introduced. These {{were simple}} notes, hand {{written on the}} back of playing cards, which were used due to a {{shortage}} of coins. The first issue was redeemed after 3 months. Despite the French authorities' displeasure, further issues were made into the 1690s. Inflation reduced the <b>card</b> <b>money's</b> value, until it was redeemed at half face value in 1717.|$|R
50|$|The {{withdrawal}} of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> in 1717 without a valid replacement left New France in recession (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). In 1722 {{there was an}} attempt to introduce copper coins; however, they were not widely accepted, especially by merchants, and therefore were discontinued (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). Finally in 1727, in response {{to the demands of the}} merchants, the king re-issued <b>card</b> <b>money</b> as the official tender of New France (Bank of Canada 2013). This new reissued <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was printed on plain card stock without colors and was marked for value by either cutting or removing the corners from the cards (Marsh 1985). The new <b>card</b> <b>money</b> would be redeemed each year for goods or bills of exchange, which could be redeemed in France (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). Unfortunately, the new <b>card</b> <b>money</b> quickly gave rise to the same issues as before, and during the War of the Spanish Succession finances in France went from bad to bankruptcy (Heaton 1928, 655). By 1757, the government of New France had discontinued all payments made in specie and was relying on <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> “ordonnances” (promissory notes from the government) and treasury notes in order to fund operations within the colony (Bank of Canada 1990, 7-8).|$|E
5000|$|Veronique Deblon, {{writing for}} the National Bank of Belgium, notes that all issues of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> [...] "could not be called {{unqualified}} successes", as they were capable of solving budget deficits but eventually were overproduced, leading to inflation. The numismatist Neil Shafer concurs, noting that the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> of Guiana [...] "served its purpose" [...] {{in spite of the}} devaluation. In his article on the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> in French Canada, Larry Allen described it as [...] "showing the flexibility, adaptability, and inventiveness of an expanding economic system", despite [...] "seeming ... far-fetched".|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1690s, due to {{excessive}} issuance of <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> inflation began to increase perceptibly (Bank of Canada 1990, 6). At {{the beginning of}} the eighteenth century, due to ongoing wars in Europe, the financial aid to the French colonies decreased, meaning that goods were regularly shipped in place of currency. This caused a higher reliance on <b>card</b> <b>money</b> as a form of payment (Heaton 1928, 654). By 1705, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> had become official tender and was relied upon to pay building costs as well as soldier’s pay (Heaton 1928, 655). As cards continued to be redeemed at full face value, supply far outweighed the demand and in 1717 it was decided that <b>card</b> <b>money</b> would be redeemed at a 50% discount and withdrawn from circulation (Bank of Canada 1990, 7).|$|E

50|$|Initially, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{was issued}} in three {{different}} denominations, {{in the form of}} singular playing cards bearing the intendant’s arms and signature. It was backed by the private promise of redemption, and readily accepted (Pritchard, 2004). However, due to its widespread monetary use, a significant amount of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> failed to be submitted for reimbursement and remained circulating. This meant that the government was able to increase its expenses (Bank of Canada, 1990, p. 8). As a result, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was used as currency in Canada intermittently {{for the remainder of the}} French regime (Pritchard, 2004).|$|E
50|$|As a {{financial}} tool, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{played a significant}} role as a means of exchange. Despite the worries of French officials, colonial authorities were successful in arguing that <b>card</b> <b>money</b> served as {{a financial}} medium in Canada just as coinage did in France (Bank of Canada, 1990, p. 9). An economic substitute to the dangerous transfer of specie across the Atlantic, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> allowed France to benefit, since the King did not have the obligation to send coinage to Canada, which would have risked loss “either from the sea or from enemies” (Bank of Canada, 1990, p. 8).|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1730s, again {{faced with a}} {{shortage}} of specie and letters of exchange, the Count of Maurepas recommended applying a <b>card</b> <b>money</b> system, {{similar to the one}} then in use in Canada, in French Louisiana. This was intended for domestic trade, without any mark-up, and to be backed through letters of exchange. On 14 September 1735, the French Crown approved an issue of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> up to 200,000 livres, with a quota of 150,000 livres for letters of exchange. Cards were prepared and signed by the Crown's comptroller in Louisiana, with higher denominations requiring the countersignatures of the governor and ordonnateur. For the next two years the value of the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> remained stable, sustained by ordonnateur Edmé Gatien Salmon's issuance of letters of exchange in excess of the quota. By 1739, however, value of the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> had decreased, as attempts to redeem the cards for letters of exchange went unfilled. The colony was incurring great expenses during their war with the Chickasaw, and - with the French government unwilling to increase the quota for letters of exchange - by 1741 Salmon was already drawing on his quota for 1744. This shortage, and resulting inflation, meant that by 1743 the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was essentially worthless. In 1745, with war still ongoing, the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> and other paper issued by the colony was burned; before liquidization, notes were exchanged for letters of exchange at two fifths of face value.|$|E
