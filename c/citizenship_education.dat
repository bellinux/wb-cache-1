500|$|Its initial goals achieved, UMNO {{established}} {{itself as}} a political party to fight for independence. At the same time, the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) launched an armed insurgency to form a communist government in Malaya, culminating in the Malayan Emergency which lasted until after independence. The insurgency was marked by a clear racial divide; opposition to the insurrection was almost entirely Malay, while Chinese dominated the communist ranks. The British encouraged {{the establishment of the}} Communities Liaison Committee (CLC), comprising the top echelon of Malayan politicians from different communities, to address sensitive issues, especially those related to race. Compromises on a number of issues, including <b>citizenship,</b> <b>education,</b> democracy, and Malay supremacy, were agreed on. Eventually, a [...] "bargain" [...] between the Malays and non-Malays was formulated; in return for giving up ketuanan Melayu, the Malays would be assisted in closing the economic gap between the Malay and non-Malay communities. CLC member E.E.C. Thuraisingham later said, [...] "I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal. Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non-Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals." ...|$|E
500|$|Levinson {{proposes that}} <b>citizenship</b> <b>education</b> {{can provide the}} [...] "cultural coherence" [...] that may be missing from a [...] "detached" [...] school—which would be a diverse {{community}} that prioritizes [...] "critical thinking, tolerance, and reflectiveness". She argues for a constitutional mandate to establish the [...] "autonomy-promoting aim of education" [...] regardless of public support, and asks for a [...] "culture change". Levinson distinguishes between parental and child rights, as laws exist for parents who do not act in their children's best interests. She adds that children are limited by the restricted scope of their parents' knowledge, and that the state should intervene to combat this small-mindedness {{in the interests of}} children. Specifically, she cites Christian criticism of curricular neutrality as a tactic to justify the imposition of their own [...] "limited and restrictive" [...] worldview, and that external knowledge increases the odds of their children not adopting their worldview. Her argument is that the limited worldviews resulting from [...] "excessive paternalism" [...] consequently stunt children's ability to develop adult autonomy or make rational decisions. Thus, state and parental paternalism should be limited where it will hurt individual [...] "capacity for autonomy".|$|E

40|$|A tension {{evident in}} science {{education}} conversations {{today from the}} classroom to the policy-making level across Canada, New Zealand and Australia is questioning the purpose of science education (for example, Australian Academy of Science, 2010; New Zealand Centre for Education Research, 2011). These conversations seek resolution to the question: {{what is the purpose}} of science education in schools and which of these purposes matters most? At the centre of these concerns is questioning a long held belief that science education experience should continue to primarily serve national interest for economic prosperity by preparing a small number of future scientists at the expense of engaging all young people in Citizenship Science. A question that needs to arise in this ongoing conversation is what is meant by a <b>Citizenship</b> Science <b>education</b> and, more importantly, whose interests does <b>Citizenship</b> Science <b>education</b> serve?

2500|$|Some {{fundamentalist}} critics believe GCE might undermine {{religious education}} and promote secular values. Others {{are concerned that}} the pedagogical approach of most global <b>citizenship</b> <b>education</b> curricula are too often produced in particular Northern, Western contexts. Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic.

2500|$|The most {{important}} features of global <b>citizenship</b> <b>education</b> are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; {{the practice of}} cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, OXFAM UK designed a curriculum for global <b>citizenship</b> <b>education</b> which stressed [...] "the 'active' role of global citizens". In this approach, individuals and groups {{both inside and outside}} the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE curricula, to [...] "strengthen linkages between education and economic development".|$|E
2500|$|Global <b>citizenship</b> <b>education</b> (GCE) {{is a form}} {{of civic}} {{learning}} that involves students' active participation in projects that address global issues of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The two main elements of GCE are 'global consciousness'; [...] the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to compete in the global jobs market. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of supranational institutions, regional economic blocs, and the development of information and communications technologies. These have all resulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, <b>citizenship</b> <b>education,</b> respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness.|$|E

The {{large numbers of}} people migrating across national borders means that the [...] diversity of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, [...] "has raised [...] complex and difficult questions about citizenship, human rights, democracy, and education". [...] In addition, global issues related to sustainability, such as the world's future energy arrangements, have also been incorporated into the domain of global <b>citizenship</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Within the {{educational}} system, {{the concept of}} global <b>citizenship</b> <b>education</b> (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as multicultural education, peace education, human rights education, Education for Sustainable Development and international education. [...] Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity. Teachers are being given the responsibility of being social change agents. [...] Audrey Osler, director of the Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights Education, the University of Leeds, affirms that [...] "Education for living together in an interdependent world is not an optional extra, but an essential foundation".|$|E
2500|$|Global {{citizenship}} {{consists of}} voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status [...] or allegiance to an actual form of government. [...] The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political {{institutions such as}} the European Union, and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global <b>citizenship</b> <b>education</b> [...] programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent NGOs, grass roots organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the International Baccalaureate Organization and UNESCO.|$|E

This paper presents findings from a qualitative case study analysis of two such programs, incorporating interviews with and observations of visiting students, teachers, and parents.

The analysis is based on the International Civics and <b>Citizenship</b> <b>Educations</b> Study (ICCS 2009), with 70, 502 respondents in 21 member countries. The results show that cognitive learning strategies contribute more strongly to European citizenship than creating opportunities for interactions with citizens from other EU member states. The occurrence of an interaction effect between cognitive and social learning strategies, however, suggests that jointly offering both learning strategies can be considered the most effective form of developing European identity. The multilevel analysis reveals no impact of country level variables, suggesting that even in Eurosceptic countries, the education system contributes strongly to the development of European identity among adolescents. We close with observations on how curricula can contribute to a strengthening of European citizenship. status: publishe...|$|R
