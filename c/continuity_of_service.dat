25|$|Despite {{decentralization}} {{efforts and}} continued government support, quality and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> are inadequate in the Dominican Republic. Water scarcity is increasing mainly due to excessive consumption in urban areas, {{a lack of}} demand management (low tariffs, low share of metering, limited environmental consciousness) and watershed degradation. Watershed degradation occurs mainly in the lower sections of most coastal basins and {{is a result of}} unplanned settlements and activities and lack of sanitation services.|$|E
25|$|While {{negotiations}} with relevant {{authorities in the}} UK and destination countries for the grant of interim operating permits to enable the transfer of BOAC's loss-making routes to South America and to ensure <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> were still in progress, BUA's first proving flight to that continent took place on 12 October 1964. It was operated {{with one of the}} brand-new VC10s, which carried a small load of VIPs comprising BUA MD Laker and a high-ranking British trade delegation.|$|E

25|$|A first {{indicator}} {{of the quality of}} water supply services is the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> The urban utilities deliver continuous services in Burkina Faso, Senegal and South Africa, but are highly intermittent in Ethiopia and Zambia. In rural areas, continuity is expressed by the ratio of water points out of order, or by the average time per year or per month that a water point is unusable. In low income Sub-Saharan countries, indicatively, over one third of the rural water supply infrastructure is in disuse.|$|E
25|$|In May 1937, the Broward County Medical Association (BCMA) met {{to discuss}} {{plans to build}} a public hospital, feeling that private {{hospitals}} could not be relied upon for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and only a community-owned hospital would offer security. The consensus of the meeting was to build a hospital supported by the city, county, or a hospital district. The result of the meeting was a unanimous motion to form the Broward Hospital Association (BHA). From that point on, the BHA began its mission to raise the funds needed to build a hospital. The Chairman, James D. Camp, {{as well as the other}} members, explored every possibility of finding funds; however, government-assisted funding simply wasn’t available. During this time, the county was experiencing such rapid growth, the need for facilities became critical.|$|E
2500|$|In field {{installations}} {{of electrical}} power distribution equipment, capacitor bank fault tolerance is often improved by connecting multiple capacitors in parallel, each protected with an {{internal or external}} fuse. [...] Should an individual capacitor develop an internal short, the resulting fault current (augmented by capacitive discharge from neighboring capacitors) blows the fuse, thus isolating the failed capacitor from the remaining devices. [...] This technique {{is analogous to the}} [...] "T metallization" [...] technique described above, but operating at a larger physical scale. More-complex series and parallel arrangements of capacitor banks are also used to allow <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> despite individual capacitor failures at this larger scale.|$|E

[...] Under the COSC, the Navy retains the same scope <b>of</b> NMCI <b>services</b> with HP, but the network becomes a government-owned, contractor-supported, managed services environment.|$|R

Water utilities are expected to build resilience within the water distribution infrastructure {{in order to provide}} <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> to its customers in the face of asset deterioration and growing environmental and man-made threats. However, with such a complex and interconnected network, it is difficult to accurately identify and understand critical links that could lead to disruption <b>of</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|Issues for {{annexation}} {{include a}} desire for a contiguous City <b>of</b> Edmonds, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and a belief that services {{will be easier to}} provide. Arguments against annexation include desire to remain part of unincorporated area of Snohomish county, an expectation that taxes may rise with annexation, and the desire to take part in activities that are possible in the county that would not be permitted under city regulations. The latter includes less regulation for building certain structures and the ability to keep animals.|$|R

5000|$|A {{prediction}} of reliability {{is an important}} element in the process of selecting equipment for use by telecommunications service providers and other buyers of electronic equipment, and it is essential during the design stage of engineering systems life cycle.

[...] has a major impact on maintenance and repair costs and on the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>Continuity</b> {{and quality}} <b>of</b> <b>service</b> (QoS) are {{also related to}} {{reliability}} and availability. Services are dependent {{on the availability of}} the system. If a system is unavailable due to hardware or software failures, then {{it is obvious that the}} system would be unable to continue providing services. A system that is not providing or fails to provide smooth and consistent service, suffers from the problems known as <b>continuity</b> and quality <b>of</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
50|$|Funding {{sources for}} the {{services}} listed above include the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Treasury Department, United States Department of Health and Human Services, United States Department of Energy, and State of Texas general revenue funds.

This theme, in spite of its relevance, is still infrequently explored in the national literature. The authors report international and national uses of this model and discuss its applicability for the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for alcohol dependents.
