5000|$|The iPhone {{features}} an internal rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Like an iPod, but unlike most other mobile phones {{at the time}} of its launch, the battery is not user-replaceable. The iPhone can be charged when connected to a computer for syncing across the included USB to dock <b>connector</b> <b>cable,</b> similar to charging an iPod. Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or [...] "wall charger," [...] also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an AC outlet.|$|E
50|$|Although Apple {{does not}} license the MagSafe {{connector}} {{for use in}} third-party products, manufacturers have devised a workaround: their MagSafe items use the actual connector from Apple's AC adapter, grafted onto their own product. Since this uses an actual Apple product, purchased legally, manufacturers believe that no licensing agreements are needed (a principle {{referred to as the}} first sale doctrine) and the patents are not violated. However, in 2010 Apple still sued one such manufacturer, Sanho Corporation for selling its very popular HyperMac battery extension products which Apple claimed violated their patents. Sanho has since ceased to sell their <b>connector</b> <b>cable</b> for the HyperMac series of external batteries.|$|E

50|$|The Multi-Connector has {{received}} criticism from users who {{were familiar with}} previous connectors such as the Universal Connector.

Another criticism is that the connector is fiddly, harder to remove and feels fragile.|$|R
50|$|The EV Plug Alliance {{was last}} seen in June 2013 at an EU hearing. The web site was not {{maintained}} any more and in October 2014 it was replaced with a shutdown notice. Based on the EU recommendation any new project in France for charging stations, beginning in 2015, started to require a Type 2 socket to get funding. In October 2015, it became known that Schneider (a {{founding member of the}} EV Plug Alliance) only manufactures charging stations with Type 2S connectors (Type 2 with shutters). In November 2015, Renault started selling its electric vehicles in France with a Type 2 <b>connector</b> <b>cable</b> instead of the previously used Type 3. As such the production of Type 3 connectors has been finally abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of the}} Barcode Battler unit in {{conjunction}} with the Famicom was made possible using the Famicom-Barcode Battler interface - a <b>connector</b> <b>cable</b> that came with the Barcode World cassette. In this way, the Famicom was given the capacity to scan external barcodes to expand gameplay for the game to include all manner of household consumer products. Soon books were released by third parties that listed in detail which consumer products had the strongest barcodes. Today, the setup has been seen as a precursor to the 2001 Nintendo e-Reader for the Game Boy Advance. The two devices are very similar in that they serve the same purpose: to scan specially designed cards with barcodes imprinted on them as the primary means of using the device. The game continues to be played today often in emulated form, and modern emulators like FCEUX feature support specifically for the unusual Barcode World setup.|$|E
50|$|A laptop's {{battery is}} charged using an {{external}} power supply which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically {{in the range of}} 7.2—24 volts. The power supply is usually external, and connected to the laptop through a DC <b>connector</b> <b>cable.</b> In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about 400 g to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a smart battery, a rechargeable battery pack with a built-in battery management system (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and SoH (State of Health) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.|$|E

50|$|The Game Boy Four Player Adapter was {{designed}} to allow up to four players to play certain Game Boy games on the original Game Boy. The Game Boy Four Player Adapter consists of a small, gray hub with a single <b>connector</b> <b>cable</b> attached to connect to the first player's Game Boy. The second, third, and fourth players must each use their own Game Link Cables to connect their Game Boys {{to each of the}} three link cable ports on the main hub. Theoretically, using the proper Game Link Cables and adapters, this device is compatible with Game Boy consoles {{all the way up to}} the Game Boy Advance SP. However, the device is only compatible with a select few original Game Boy games, and will not work for Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance games on the aforementioned systems. Since Game Boy Micro is not backwards compatible with original Game Boy games, the Game Boy Four Player Adapter is incompatible with it.|$|E
5000|$|Monkgomery has a rear {{opening that}} allows {{manipulation}} of mouth movements by hand. This opening also gave {{access to a}} pressure-sensitive switch {{on the top of}} the mouth and a solid mass at the bottom to engage the switch mechanism. Engagement triggers the electronic speech integrated circuit TMS5110ANL. Speech consisted of a set of 400 pre-recorded words (100 phrases), in voiceover format (performed by Bill Cochran), stored in Texas Instrument CM62060N2L, CM62059N2L, E7CL04N2L ICs. The words played out on an 8 Ω, 0.25 watt F.S.T F05702 mono speaker. The board contained a never-used nine pin edge connector for expansion modules. These parts were built into a brown plastic box with a 4-AA battery holder. The brown box was zipped inside the back of the monkey's back with two snaps for fastening inside and a removable eight pin <b>connector</b> <b>cable</b> for interactions with mouth switch, [...] "tickle" [...] sensors, right ear and right foot.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} work at Heriot-Watt University using immersive virtual reality (VR) for cable harness design showed that VR provided substantial productivity gains over traditional computer-aided design (CAD) systems. This follow-on work {{was aimed at}} understanding {{the degree to which}} aspects of this technology were contributed to these benefits and to determine if engineering design and planning processes could be analysed in detail by nonintrusively monitoring and logging engineering tasks. This involved using a CAD-equivalent VR system for cable harness routing design, harness assembly and installation planning that can be functionally evaluated using a set of creative design-tasks to measure the system and users' performance. A novel design task categorisation scheme was created and formalised which broke down the cable harness design process and associated activities. The system was also used to demonstrate the automatic generation of usable bulkhead <b>connector,</b> <b>cable</b> harness assembly and cable harness installation plans from non-intrusive user logging. Finally, the data generated from the user-logging allowed the automated activity categorisation of the user actions, automated generation of process flow diagrams and chronocyclegraphs...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a tapered {{stripline}} fast Faraday cup (TSFFC) to perform the impedance matching between the fast cup itself and the signal line (<b>connector,</b> <b>cable,</b> and amplifier) is reported here. The frequency response of the TSFFC as a high-pass filter is analyzed from a theoretical {{point of view and}} some solutions to achieve a broadband response are given. INTRODUCTION The {{design of a}} fast Faraday cup has to respect some rules regarding the required bandwidth and the characteristic impedance (1). If only the TEM (or quasi-TEM) mode has to be transmitted along the line, the cut-off frequency is an important parameter. Using a stripline fast Faraday cup with a thickness between 0. 5 and 1 mm, a bandwidth over 50 GHz can be reached. The characteristic impedance, in planar geometry, given a dielectric medium, is proportional to the ratio between the dielectric thickness and the strip width. For instance, if the dielectric is teflon and its thickness is 0. 5 mm, a width of 10 mm or mo [...] ...|$|E
