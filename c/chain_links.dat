25|$|For {{years it}} has been a United States Coast Guard Academy {{tradition}} for fourth-class cadets (freshman) to hide the <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> that sit outside the cadet library, also known as Waesche Hall. The <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> are historic: they were used during the Revolutionary War to prevent ships from transiting up the Hudson River and attacking West Point. When Benedict Arnold betrayed the United States, the <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> were one of the secrets that he revealed to the British. The family that originally forged the chain donated the links to the United States Coast Guard Academy. Since the donation, the fourth class is challenged each year at the annual homecoming football game to outwit the second class (juniors) and keep the chain hidden until half-time. If the fourth class is successful in hiding the links {{until the end of the}} second quarter, it is granted some sort of reward such as carry-on (this allows the fourth class to have privileges of the upper upperclassman for a day).|$|E

25|$|He {{took out}} a patent for chain-making in 1816, and {{patented}} wrought iron <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> suitable for a suspension bridge in 1817. In the same year, others built Dryburgh Bridge, the first chain-supported bridge in Britain. Brown had been experimenting with a chain-supported suspension bridge already, building a 32m span test structure in 1813.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, work resumed again. Although Roebling {{operated}} his own wire mill at Trenton, New Jersey, the bridge company purchased one million pounds of wire from Richard Johnson at Manchester, England for the cables that would span {{the width of the}} river. Roebling had used Johnson's wire for one of his other bridges. He preferred it over wire made in the United States because it was of better quality and greater tensile strength. Anchorages on both shores were constructed of limestone base and a freestone finish. Eleven ton iron anchors were embedded in each block, securing cables with wrought iron <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> of Roebling's patent. These links resembled almost exactly the ones his son, Washington Roebling, would use {{in the construction of the}} Brooklyn Bridge. The Civil War depleted the work force on the project, hindering speed and efficiency until its end.|$|E
60|$|A {{noise like}} the {{rattling}} of <b>chain</b> <b>links,</b> a small grind and click {{exploded in the}} stillness of the hall and a voice began to swear in Italian. These surprising sounds were quite welcome, they recalled me to myself, and I perceived they came from the front door which seemed pushed a little ajar. Was somebody trying to get in? I had no objection, I went to the door and said: “Wait a moment, it’s on the chain.” The deep voice on the other side said: “What an extraordinary thing,” and I assented mentally. It was extraordinary. The chain was never put up, but Therese was a thorough sort of person, and on this night she had put it up to keep no one out except myself. It was the old Italian and his daughters returning from the ball who were trying to get in.|$|E
