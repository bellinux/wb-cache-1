5|$|During September25–26, {{large-scale}} evacuations {{took place}} in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near New Orleans. More than 1.5million people in New Orleans were advised to leave the city. The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450,000 people. New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during {{the immediate aftermath of}} the hurricane. A curfew was instituted for those who ignored evacuation orders or <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> the city.|$|E
5|$|Special {{weeks have}} also {{included}} shows featuring questions concerning specific topics, such as professional football, celebrity gossip, movies, and pop culture. During {{a week of}} episodes in November 2007, to celebrate the 1,000th episode of the syndicated Millionaire, all contestants that week started with $1,000 so that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> empty-handed, and only had to answer ten questions to win $1,000,000. During that week, twenty home viewers per day also won $1,000 each.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman attack {{began with}} heavy fire from light guns, {{machine guns and}} rifles. Although the {{commander}} of the yeomanry detachment had orders to retire if attacked in force, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> the dismounted engineers. The Ottoman attack was resisted for two hours, but by 07:45 eleven yeomanry officers and 135 other ranks were casualties. The survivors, four officers and forty-two other ranks, surrendered.|$|E

5|$|The ethical {{requirements}} of senators were significant. Senators could {{not engage in}} banking or any form of public contract. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce, and they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked so well they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> it out.|$|E
5|$|He {{began to}} feel pain in his lower back shortly {{after the end of}} his junior season. In May 2011, while {{attending}} a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to miss his senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, and he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers. Despite missing the season, ESPNU ranked him among the top 50 seniors in the country.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} {{a trip to}} a Swiss {{holiday resort}} to go to Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was already working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Fonda {{starred in}} 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film {{was a huge}} {{critical}} and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year. Fonda had long {{wanted to work with}} her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her. On Golden Pond, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> home. He died five months later.|$|E
5|$|Penney {{and some}} of his staff {{returned}} by air on 9 October. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the British Empire on 23 October 1952 for his role in Operation Hurricane. Torlesse was supposed to accompany him, but in view of the degree of radioactive contamination, he felt he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> his command. He sent Captain D. P. Willan, the skipper of Narvik in his stead. The Royal Navy ships departed the Monte Bello Islands on 31 October. Most of the scientific staff were dropped off at Fremantle, and returned to Britain on RAF Transport Command aircraft. The rest returned on Campania, which arrived in the United Kingdom on 15 December. Hawkesbury continued to patrol the area until 15 January 1953.|$|E

60|$|He {{would not}} have delayed had Arthur been alone; but since John was there, he thought their sudden arrival might be more encumbering than consoling, and decided {{to wait for a}} further account, and finish affairs that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> easily <b>leave.</b>|$|R
5|$|After Sukarno was {{replaced}} by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation {{for two and a}} half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> Indonesia {{for two and a half}} years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Two years after returning from Japan, Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest while teaching in Yogyakarta.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them. Stratford residents, {{as well as his}} senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand, explaining that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> Stratford, and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E

5|$|The Peasants' Revolt was {{fed by the}} {{economic}} and social upheaval of the 14th century. At the start of the century, the majority of English people worked in the countryside, as part of a sophisticated economy that fed the country's towns and cities and supported an extensive international trade. Across much of England, production was organised around manors, controlled by local lords– including the gentry and the Church– and governed through a system of manorial courts. Some of the population were unfree serfs, who had to work on their lords' lands for a period each year, although the balance of free and unfree varied across England, and in the south-east there were relatively few serfs. Some serfs were born unfree and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> their manors to work elsewhere without the consent of the local lord; others accepted limitations on their freedom as part of the tenure agreement for their farmland. Population growth led to pressure on the available agricultural land, increasing the power of local landowners.|$|E
5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{wished to}} keep his {{relationship}} with Marten a secret, but {{she gave birth to}} their child in 1827 at the age of 25, and she was apparently keen that she and Corder should marry. The child died (later reports suggested that it may have been murdered), but Corder apparently still intended to marry Marten. That summer, in the presence of her stepmother, Ann Marten, he suggested that she meet him at the Red Barn, from where he proposed that they elope to Ipswich. Corder claimed that he had heard rumours that the parish officers were going to prosecute Maria for having bastard children. He initially suggested that they elope on the Wednesday evening, but later decided to delay until the Thursday evening. On Thursday, he was again delayed; his brother falling ill is mentioned as the reason in some sources, although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time. On Friday, 18 May 1827, he appeared at the Martens' cottage during the day and, according to Ann Marten, he told Maria that they must leave at once, as he had heard that the local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her (no warrant had been obtained, but it is not known if Corder was lying or was mistaken). Maria was worried that she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>leave</b> in broad daylight, but Corder told her that she should dress in men's clothing so as to avert suspicion, and he would carry her things to the barn where she could meet him and change before they continued on to Ipswich.|$|E
