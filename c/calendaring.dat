25|$|The BlackBerry PlayBook was {{the first}} RIM product whose BlackBerry Tablet OS was built on QNX, {{launched}} in April 2011 {{as an alternative to}} the Apple iPad. However, it was criticized for having incomplete software (it initially lacked native email, <b>calendaring</b> and contacts) and a poor app selection. It fared poorly until prices were substantially reduced, like most other tablet computers released that year (Android tablets such as the Motorola Xoom and Samsung Galaxy Tab, and the HP TouchPad). The BlackBerry Tablet OS received a major update in February 2012, as well as numerous minor updates.|$|E

2500|$|Elected {{to office}} as Attorney General in 1992, Gregoire's term {{included}} a scandal wherein her office failed {{to file a}} timely appeal on a $17.8M judgment against the state; {{at that time the}} largest such judgment in Washington State history.

2500|$|With her newfound {{resolve and}} {{professional}} goal in mind, Norton left {{her work in}} the library and began work <b>calendaring</b> manuscript collections at the Indiana State Library Department of Archives and History. [...] From there she went into a two-year fellowship at the University of Chicago.The completion of her fellowship led her into a cataloguer position at the Missouri State Historical Society in Columbia. [...] While working as a cataloguer, Norton was asked {{to become the first}} head archivist at the new Illinois State Archives in Springfield, Illinois. [...] Hesitant at first, Norton finally accepted the position in January 1922 and subsequently began in April 1922. [...] At the time she was just 30 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Julian calendar, {{by which}} England and its colonies were still operating, New Year's Day fell on March 25 (Lady Day or the Feast of the Annunciation). [...] The attack {{took place on}} March 22, 1621 as {{reckoned}} by the colonists, three days before New Years Day 1622. Historians, genealogists, and others who work with dates in this era commonly denote Julian calendar dates in the interval between January 1 and March 24 with the 'Old Style' suffix (OS) when presenting these dates with their original year value, or to use a dual dating syntax which combines original and adjusted values. [...] For example, {{the date of the}} attack on Jamestown can be denoted as March 22, 1621(OS), or March 22, 1621/22. The common practice of showing the date as March 22, 1622 is technically inaccurate, but less confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the differences in <b>calendaring</b> systems.|$|E
2500|$|GVSHP {{and allied}} groups have rallied {{to get some}} notable {{buildings}} designated as individual landmarks, while other structures have been demolished over community objections. Individual landmarks include Webster Hall, a Romanesque Revival concert hall and nightclub designed in 1886 with an [...] "extraordinary cultural history." [...] According to GVSHP's 2007 request for evaluation for the building, [...] "Over the last 120 years, the space has hosted everything from debutante balls and society dinners to wrestling matches, political rallies, union meetings, and bohemian costume dances." [...] Less than one year later, in 2007, the building was designated an individual landmark. A year earlier, the LPC designated P.S. 64, a French Renaissance Revival public school built in 1904-6 by architect and school superintendent C.B.J. Snyder. Supporters hoped the 2006 vote would serve the practical purpose of ending the owner's removal of architectural details; it was but one chapter in a heated, ongoing controversy over the building, which had been used as the CHARAS/El Bohio community center until New York City sold it to developer Gregg Singer. The year 2006 also saw GVSHP call for the Landmarks Preservation Commission to prevent the demolition of [...] the former Van Tassell and Kearney Horse Auction Mart, a building described as both stately and humble, built for horse trade but eventually used as a factory for [...] "Rosie the Riveter"-type women working during World War II, then a studio of the major abstract expressionist Frank Stella. The Commission did so by <b>calendaring</b> the building, and designated it a New York City landmark is 2012.|$|E
