To permit the new pipeline to operate at the intended 94 barg, a Pressure Reduction Installation (PRI) is required before it joins the existing National Transmission System – the 'motorway' of gas distribution in the UK. National Grid applied to Forest of Dean District Council in 2006 for planning permission to construct a PRI at Corse but this was refused by the Council and an appeal against that decision was refused by the Secretaries of State in December 2007. An application to construct a PRI on a second site, 400 metres from the first site, was lodged with Tewkesbury Borough Council in 2008 but was refused unanimously by that Council's Planning Committee on 2 February 2010. National Grid appealed against that decision.|$|E

The depot was opened on January 15, 1954, is owned by GTJ Reit Inc, and was operated by Triboro Coach Corporation before being leased to the City of New York and operated by MTA Bus Company on February 20, 2006 {{for a period of}} 21 years. In 1989, a methanol fuel station was installed at the facility for six General Motors-built RTS methanol buses. It was later used in the early 1990s to fuel an NYCT demonstration bus from the Casey Stengel Depot and three new Triboro-operated RTS buses fitted with special Detroit Diesel Series 92 engines. Beginning in 1994, the facility dispatched compressed natural gas (CNG) buses in addition to its diesel fleet. The depot was decommissioned from CNG operations in 2006 due to not meeting the MTA's safety and environmental standards. On April 10, 2006, while workers from KeySpan were removing CNG from tanks and a private contractor was conducting construction near the depot, a gas <b>compressor</b> <b>station</b> exploded leading to a large fire at the depot. One bus was destroyed and 12 were damaged. Also, work to modify this depot to accommodate articulated-buses is almost completed.|$|E

40|$|Natural gas, {{driven by}} pressure, is transported through {{pipeline}} network systems. As the gas {{flows through the}} network, energy and pressure are lost due to both friction between the gas and the pipes' inner wall, and heat transfer between the gas and its environment. The lost energy of the gas is periodically restored at the <b>compressor</b> <b>stations</b> which are installed in the network. These <b>compressor</b> <b>stations</b> typically consume about 3 [...] 5 % of the transported gas.
