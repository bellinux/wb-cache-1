Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand.|$|E

Buildings in Washington, D.C., remained closed for two days after the hurricane. After the hurricane, several people in central and western Maryland were injured with three killed from carbon monoxide due to improperly running generators in their houses. Additionally, others were injured due to <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> and cleaning up debris. In the days after the hurricane, the Calvert County Hospital reported an extra 130 patients per day.|$|E

40|$|Recently a {{study on}} {{vibration}} disorder among <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operators has been developed rapidly, {{while the number of}} workers suffering from vibration disorder has been increasing. It {{is one of the most}} important disposal as health care among <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operators to leave a worker with disorders off using a <b>chain</b> <b>saw.</b> The author discussed on results of health examination for <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operators performed before and after the disposal introduced in 1973. Two hundred and six examinees were divided into five groups classified by clinical findings of Raynaud's phenomenon, types of work after leaving off a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> work and medical care. The results were as follows: 1) It was not effective for a worker with Raynaud's phenomenon to leave off a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operation. 2) It was also not effective for an elder worker with long term experience of a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operation to leave off the work. 3) It was effective for a worker without abnormal findings on X-ray film of the elbow to stop using a <b>chain</b> <b>saw.</b> The author concluded that the disposal of leaving off a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> operation should be provided before appearance of Raynaud's phenomenon and a change from operating a <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> to using a hand saw and an axe was not effective for the worker with abnormality on X-ray film of the elbow...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} technical exercise to test new ergonomic designs for light machine guns. The <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> was designed to only be fired from the hip, with a handle along the top to hold the firearm (which is mounted instead of a stock) meaning the user would wield the <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> {{as if they were}} using an actual chainsaw. As the <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> is intended to be hip-fired, various targeting aids were developed alongside it to aid the aiming and accuracy, although KAC admits that more work on targeting aids will have to be made before the <b>Chain</b> <b>SAW</b> could be produced and used effectively.|$|R
25|$|After {{the tree}} {{to be used}} for the totem pole is selected, it is cut down and moved to the carving site, where the bark and outer layer of wood (sapwood) is removed. Next, the side of the tree to be carved is chosen and the back half of the tree is removed. The center of the log is {{hollowed}} out to make it lighter and to keep it from cracking. Early tools used to carve totem poles were made of stone, shell, or bone, but beginning in the late 1700s, the use of iron tools made the carving work faster and easier. In the early days, the basic design for figures may have been painted on the wood to guide the carvers, but today's carvers use paper patterns as outlines for their designs. Carvers use <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> to make the rough shapes and cuts, while adzes and chisels are used to chop the wood. Carvers use knives and other woodworking tools to add the finer details. When the carving is complete, paint is added to enhance specific details of the figures.|$|E

40|$|Boatbuilding, {{shaping the}} body with {{chainsaws}} About 30 persons gathered in the forest where a large tree had been felled. Using chainsaws men were taking turns shaping the boat body {{out of the tree}} trunk. Meanwhile women were busy cooking for all participants. It takes long time to make a boat. The first step is felling the tree. Next the body is shaped, as recorded here. It takes several full day sessions before that is done. The next major event is pulling the canoe/boat body to the beach. There was no opportunity to record this stage of boat building. Depending on what kind of boat is made, further steps are taken to finish it on the beach (see separate recordings of men working on boat building in Ujir) The media files are concatenated from the following original files: (date; length of recording; short description of sequence) 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 1 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 19 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 2 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 20 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 3 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 4 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 5 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 6 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 7 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 8 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 08 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 9 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 28 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 10 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 26 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 11 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 21 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 12 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 31 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 13 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 45 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 14 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 15 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 04 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 16 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 25 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing,</b> guys watching 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 17 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 07 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 18 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 19 WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 09 women and kids, serving food 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 20 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 21 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 22 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 32 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 23 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 18 people, end of the big tree trunk 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 24 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 14 people, end of the big tree trunk, cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 25 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 26 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 20 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 27 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 28 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 18 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 29 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 15 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 30 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 25 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 31 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 32 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 17 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 33 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 12 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 34 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 10 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 35 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 36 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 16 cooking area 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 37 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 14 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 38 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 13 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 39 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 23 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 40 _WellfeltE 00 : 01 : 00 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 41 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 27 <b>chain</b> <b>sawing</b> 20130824 _udj_EvntMakingCanoeForBaubesiWau# 42 _WellfeltE 00 : 00 : 59 chain sawin...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a concept, known {{for many years}} and commonly applied in the automotive industry, to improve engine performance of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> (higher maximum power rating and more advantageous torque parameters). The analyses were conducted on a Husqvarna 357 XP power saw, equipped with a modified resonance exhaust system with variable dimensions. The system was designed at the Department of Forest Technology (Poznań University of Life Sciences) to the already existing power unit, with specific timing gear, size, shape and angle of cylinder ducts. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess mechanical vibrations, recorded at the handles of a Husqvarna 357 XP <b>chain</b> <b>saw,</b> at three operation regimes of its engine. Analyses were conducted on the same <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> equipped with an original vibration damper and a modified resonance system in its three variants and it may be stated that the introduction of design changes in the exhaust system has a significant effect on an increase in the power and torque of the tested <b>chain</b> <b>saw.</b> On the basis of recorded results it may be stated that the acceleration of vibrations both on the rear and front handles of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> significantly differs in case of the application of the modified exhaust system in comparison to the original vibration damper. The application of the resonance system in the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> exhaust system leads to increased mechanical vibrations produced by the machine. However, it needs to be observed that the volume of the admissible standard is exceeded both for the chainsaw with the original damper and that with the used exhaust system. Vibrations of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> with a resonance damper on the front handle are higher than those of the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> with the original damper on average by 28 %, while on the rear handle it is by 27 %. We need to stress the significantly higher difference when applying in the <b>chain</b> <b>saw</b> modified damper variants 1 and 3 in comparison with the original design...|$|R
2500|$|Methods {{for cutting}} a block can vary {{depending}} on the formation and other factors, but usually involve three types of saws (wire and two chain types of which all three are diamond edged). [...] The usual approach starts with a horizontal cut at the bottom after which metal rollers are inserted (on which to move the block away from the mountain after all sides have been cut). [...] Next is the back cut with a wire saw followed by <b>chain</b> <b>saws</b> to cut the vertical sides. [...] A metal bag is then inserted behind the back cut and filled with water, which pushes the block away from the rock face (on the metal rollers). [...] The block is then rigged for lifting by forklift and placed on a haul truck and driven out of the mountain and down to the staging area {{on the grounds of the}} old mill site. [...] (When the quarry opened in 1990 a [...] tunnel had been blasted through the mountain and into the quarry interior to enable marble to be driven out of the quarry.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Chainsaw {{protective}} fabric {{works on}} a number of principles. The outermost layer can be made both tough and slippery, to protect against minor damage which could compromise the filler material. Beneath this, long, loose fibres of polyester, Avertic, ballistic nylon or Kevlar are laid in layers. When a saw contacts the trousers, the outer layer is immediately cut through but the inner is drawn out and wraps around the saw's drive sprocket, locking it solid and halting the chain, limiting damage to the operator's leg. The length of the fabrics and number of layers match the safety class. In case of an accident the fabric is pulled out of the upper and lower seam and wrap around the sprocket as described above. Protection is only given for gas [...] <b>chain</b> <b>saws,</b> not for electrical saws. Trousers should be slightly baggy, so that there is give, to prevent the chain pulling the operator's leg into the chainsaw. Instead the 'baggy' excess fabric is pulled out and into the chain mechanism, thereby stopping the saw. After stopping a saw, the damaged trousers must be scrapped, having done their job.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} a {{rotating}} device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified {{used to describe the}} system behavior is the centrifugal clutch. [...] A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as <b>chain</b> <b>saws,</b> go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. [...] At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. [...] The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the centrifugal clutch illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E
