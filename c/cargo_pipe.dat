2500|$|Since the {{earliest}} days of tankships, the need to safely and efficiently transfer bulk liquid to a moored ship has been fundamental. [...] An insufficient solution to this problem led to one of the world's first oil tanker disasters. [...] In 1881, the Branobel tanker Nordenskjöld was taking on kerosene in Baku. [...] The ship was connected to the pier with a simple piece of pipe. [...] While loading, the ship was hit by a gust of wind and the <b>cargo</b> <b>pipe</b> carrying was jerked away from the hold. [...] Kerosene then spilled onto the deck and down into the engine room, where mechanics were working in the light of kerosene lanterns. [...] The ship then exploded, killing half the crew. [...] Ludvig Nobel responded to the disaster by creating a flexible, leakproof loading pipe which was much more resistant to spills.|$|E
5000|$|The Cornships fleet {{has worked}} in the {{worldwide}} arena, but specializes in the Europe, Mediterranean, Black Sea and West African markets. [...] The company deals in <b>cargoes</b> such as <b>pipe,</b> projects, bulk-bagged cocoa, steel, bagged and general cargoes.|$|R
5000|$|Its area of {{operations}} is primarily Atlantic Canada. In December 2007 ATL 2701 was contracted to haul a <b>cargo</b> of steel <b>pipes</b> through the St. Lawrence Seaway into Lake Ontario destined for the Portlands Energy Centre project in Toronto Harbour.http://maritimecalamities.blogspot.com/2007/12/irving-whale-rides-again.html ...|$|R
5000|$|During the early-1980s Dan-Air Engineering's Manchester base {{designed}} and installed a then unique cargo door {{in one of}} sister airline Dan-Air's Hawker Siddeley 748 turboprops that had specifically been acquired for this purpose. This enabled the aircraft — a series 2 HS 748 (registration G-BIUV) fitted with an 8 ft by 8 ft rear cargo door — to carry [...] "outsize" [...] <b>cargoes,</b> such as <b>pipes</b> and oil drilling equipment measuring up to 6 in in diameter and up to 40 ft in length, which made it particularly suitable for oil industry support work.|$|R
2500|$|Madeira was an {{important}} wine {{in the history of}} the United States of America. No wine-quality grapes could be grown among the 13 colonies, so imports were needed, with a great focus on Madeira. [...] One of the major events on the road to revolution in which Madeira played a key role was the British seizure of John Hancock's sloop the Liberty on May 9, 1768. Hancock's boat was seized after he had unloaded a <b>cargo</b> of 25 <b>pipes</b> (3,150 gallons) of Madeira, and a dispute arose over import duties. The seizure of the Liberty caused riots to erupt among the people of Boston.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 June 1995, J.D. Irving Ltd. {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} PCB fluid within the <b>cargo</b> heating system <b>pipes</b> of the barge. On 18 July 1995, divers began preparatory work on the barge. On 21 August 1995, the Federal Court of Canada stayed the decision to lift the barge based upon an injunction filed by the [...] "Société pour vaincre la pollution Inc." [...] (SVP) and the [...] "Regroupement madelinot pour la protection du golfe Inc." [...] to stop salvage efforts pending an investigation under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The injunction delayed work on the salvage operation until 11 September 1995, causing the lift to be deferred to the next [...] "weather window" [...] in summer 1996.|$|R
40|$|Pneumatic capsule {{pipeline}} (PCP) uses {{air blown}} through a pipeline to propel capsules (wheeled vehicles carrying cargoes) through the pipeline. It {{is a modern}} and large version of the century-old technology of “tube transport ” used rather widely and successfully {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century in major European and U. S. cities for transporting mail, parcels, telegraphs, documents, cash, and other lightweight materials. Modern PCP systems, such as those used in Japan for transporting limestone to a cement plant, use large wheeled capsules moving heavy <b>cargoes</b> through <b>pipes</b> of 3 -ft diameter, approximately. Each capsule can carry almost two tons of cargo. The system is driven by blowers located near the beginning of the pipeline, and it is highly automated (by computers and programmable logic controllers). The system is being used very successfully in Japan, with a high reliability record. Yet, only limited use exists today due to its high unit freight transportation cost in $/ton as compared to that by truck. The unit cost is high due to low system throughput (freight capacity). Major improvement in throughput can be made by replacing the pumping mechanism from blowers (which are used currently), to electromagnetic pumps (for the future systems), and using off-line loading/unloading. Research in such improvements of PCP is currently underway at the Capsule Pipeline Research Center at the University of Missouri-Columbia.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the American Meteorological Society via the DOI in this record. For a number of {{maritime}} tasks there is a short time period, typically only a few tens of seconds, where a critical event occurs which defines a limiting wave height for the whole operation. Examples are the recovery of fixed and rotary winged aircraft, <b>cargo</b> transfers, final <b>pipe</b> mating in fluid transfer operations and launch/recovery of small craft. The recovery of a 30 ton rescue submersible onto a mother ship in the NATO Submarine Rescue System is a prime example. In such applications short term Deterministic Sea Wave Prediction (DSWP) can play a vital role in extending the sea states under which the system can be safely deployed. DSWP also has great potential in conducting experimental sea wave research at full scale. This report explores the feasibility of using data from an experimental wave profiling radar in achieving DSWP. The report includes theory, simulation and field testing. Two forms of DSWP are employed, a fixed point system based upon a restricted set of wave directions, from which we obtain some success, and the other a fully two dimensional technique, which requires further development. The main finding is that using wave profiling radar for DSWP offers promise but requires improvements both to the spatial reliability and resolution of the wave profiling radar, and to the temporal resolution of its sweep before the technique can be considered to be viable as a usable tool.
