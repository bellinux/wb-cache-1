These data are the robot’s real positions and joint angles obtained at the calibration points. Then, the summation of errors between all ideal positions and real positions is calculated. Second, calibration is conducted via optimization. An optimization framework that uses deviations of DH parameters as the design variables is then formulated to minimize the position errors. Third, the compensation is applied and verified. The robot arm is controlled {{to move to the}} verification points, which are different from the calibration points, with optimized DH parameters. Then, the position of real points is captured using the Vicon camera system and the errors are determined by comparing ideal and real positions. Finally, the accuracy improvement is assessed.|$|E

40|$|A {{characterization}} of an angular accelerometer sensor is performed with a frequency- response experiment. To assess angular accelerometer dynamic properties, a position-based <b>calibration</b> <b>table</b> is utilized {{to provide the}} excitation input. The angular accelerometer specifications and <b>calibration</b> <b>table</b> limitations dfine a constrained test envelope for this particular setup. Measurement are obtained {{for a number of}} constant accelerations and varied with frequency. Analysis of the input-output relation in the frequency-domain leads to a frequency-response function model of the angular accelerometer. Time-domain data are used to validate the frequency-response model. A fourth-order structure is then preferred as the transfer-function for the 400 deg=s acceleration, with a 99 : 02 %fit.

40|$|With {{the role}} of angular accelerometers in future {{fault-tolerant}} flight control systems, an in-depth evaluation of their performance then becomes a critical issue {{from the perspective of}} control system design. In this paper, a position-based <b>calibration</b> <b>table</b> is utilized to provide a sufficiently accurate angular acceleration reference in the dynamic angular calibration. However, the angular accelerometer measured data contains a high noise level when transmitted through the slip rings. To tackle this issue, a customized sensor Data Acquisition System (DAS) is designed. It is mounted on the turn-table top and has a direct access to the angular accelerometer data channel. To synchronize sensor and table data, two auxiliary signals are generated by the sensor DAS computer to help in the post measurement processing. The first signal is a regular pulse of 100 Hz, which is suitable to align sensor and table data. The second signal is a step function which acts as a data log trigger for the <b>calibration</b> <b>table,</b> as well as a marker of the record starting point. This approach results in a lower angular accelerometer noise level, below the specified limit of 3 mV. The ErrorRMS is 0 : 00195 n, which after being calculated with the measurement results, evidently falls below the Gaussian probability density function specified by the standard of ± 5 : 672. As a result, the customized setup enables a commercially available <b>calibration</b> <b>table</b> to serve as the reference for angular accelerometer calibration experiments.
