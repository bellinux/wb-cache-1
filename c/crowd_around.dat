5|$|The {{date of the}} Gonzaga {{wedding was}} {{repeatedly}} postponed, because of diplomatic problems which delayed the bride's arrival in Mantua until 24 May. The wedding festivities began four days later; L'Arianna was performed on 28 May 1608, {{the first of the}} several spectacular entertainments. A large temporary theatre had been built for the occasion; according to the court's chronicler Federico Follino this held 6,000 people—a figure which Carter deems unlikely. Whatever its size, the arena could not hold everyone who wished to be present. Follino's account records that although the duke had strictly limited the numbers from his household entitled to be there, many distinguished foreign visitors could not be seated and were obliged to <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> the doors.|$|E
5|$|Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, {{the leader of the}} Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob. A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry <b>crowd.</b> <b>Around</b> 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet (4 metres) at a cost of £207.|$|E

25|$|Karachi {{has been}} {{involved}} in sectarian violence in the past and as a result the Shia crowd turned hostile and immediately following the blast, turned their anger on the ambulance workers, security forces and journalists on site. Riots sparked throughout the city as mourners continued to stone ambulances and torch cars. Despite the City Government's appeal for a calmer reaction, the place of the original incident was set ablaze by the angry <b>crowd.</b> <b>Around</b> 3,000 shops in the neighbouring markets fell victim to the arson as people looted and then blazed the shops. Aggressive reactions resulted in the destruction of businesses incurring losses of up to a few billion rupees.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Norman Whitfield {{changed the}} group's dynamic, moving {{them away from}} the {{previous}} one lead singer model and adding elements derived from the rougher soul of artists such as James Brown, Wilson Pickett, and the performers at Stax Records. Whitfield and his lyricists crafted Temptations songs with shifts of dynamics, syncopated horn stabs, and more intricate harmony arrangements which spotlighted each singer's unique vocal range. Onstage, this change was reflected in the group's use of a custom-made four-headed microphone stand, invented by David Ruffin, which allowed each member freedom to perform without having to all <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> one or two microphones. Under Whitfield's control, the Temptations retained their white pop appeal, but also gained popularity amongst black audiences as well.|$|E
500|$|Hunt's {{carriage}} {{arrived at}} the meeting shortly after 1:00pm, and {{he made his way}} to the hustings. Alongside Hunt on the speakers' stand were John Knight, a cotton manufacturer and reformer, Joseph Johnson, the organiser of the meeting, John Thacker Saxton, managing editor of the Manchester Observer, the publisher Richard Carlile, and George Swift, reformer and shoemaker. There were also a number of reporters, including John Tyas of The Times, John Smith of the Liverpool Mercury and Edward Baines Jr, the son of the editor of the Leeds Mercury. By this time St Peter's Field, an area of , was packed with tens of thousands of men, women and children. The <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> the speakers was so dense that [...] "their hats seemed to touch"; large groups of curious spectators gathered on the outskirts of the crowd. The rest of Manchester was like a ghost town, the streets and shops were empty.|$|E
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed, the <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> Private White grew {{larger and more}} boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually {{signified}} a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position {{on the steps of}} the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch. According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White. The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their way through the crowd. En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, [...] "For God's sake, take care of your men. If they fire, you must die." [...] Captain Preston responded [...] "I am aware of it." [...] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted at the crowd, estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.|$|E

[...] The King receives {{a gift from the}} king of Burma, a lovely slave girl named Tuptim, to be one of his many wives. [...] She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love. [...] Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart ("My Lord and Master"). [...] The King gives Anna her first audience. The schoolteacher is a part of his plan for the modernization of Siam; he is impressed when she already knows this. [...] She raises the issue of her house with him, he dismisses her protests and orders her to talk with his wives. [...] They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom ("Hello, Young Lovers"). [...] The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him – several dozen – and is to teach their mothers as well. [...] The princes and princesses enter in procession ("March of the Royal Siamese Children"). [...] Anna is charmed by the children, and formality breaks down after the ceremony as they <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> her.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{compliments}} {{were made}} of the other versions. A reviewer from [...] praised the SNES version's simultaneous four-player function {{and the addition of}} game modes and tracks. [...] reviewer praised the multiplayer, saying it is [...] "simply excellent", and gave the vehicles' manoeuvrability a similar description. [...] reviewer praised the MS-DOS version's variety. Vince Broady of GameSpot praised the [...] "excellent" [...] gameplay, but complained that the CD soundtrack is repetitive, and that the graphics were not as good as competitors. Coming Soon Magazine's reviewer complimented its [...] "terrific" [...] gameplay and praised the track editor, saying it was [...] "a tremendous idea" [...] and that it increases playability. Steve Bauman of Computer Games Strategy Plus had mixed feelings: he believed the game is [...] "shallow as hell", but also described it as [...] "surprisingly entertaining". PC Zones Charlie Brooker liked the graphics and sound, describing them as [...] "cute" [...] and [...] "neat" [...] respectively, and praised the game's [...] "timeless console-style action". The game was named a PC Zone classic. A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that [...] "if you're just interested in simple, arcade-style racing that even runs fine on a 386, well, you've hit the mother lode." [...] He felt the game seemed designed more for consoles, since it is plainly focused on the multiplayer mode but lacks support for networked play, thus requiring the players to <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> a single PC, but was pleased with the cuteness of the cars and the inventiveness of the tracks.|$|E

2500|$|Young Harris did {{not talk}} about his {{charitable}} contributions {{because he was too}} modest. Even his close friends were not aware of the extent of his generosity. It was said [...] "that little children delighted to <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> him and hear from him the wondrous story of our Lord". The author of Harris' obituary in the Athens Weekly Banner quoted Harris just before he died: [...] "I do not think the deeds of a man are near as important in a religious sense as those things he omits to do; and yet a man ought to feel thankful if it can be said of him after death, 'Here lies a blameless man'." ...|$|E
2500|$|People <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> Wilson when {{he works}} {{and he has}} been praised by passersby. He has become a local celebrity as his work has chronicled the changes in the neighborhood.

He does not charge for gum painting requests, a word he prefers to use over [...] "commissions". When he was arrested in 2009 by the City of London Police on suspicion of criminal damage, the case was dropped after dozens of people wrote letters of support a few months later. The Barnet police also came to his support, filing a witness statement on his behalf.|$|E
2500|$|The game gained {{controversy}} when {{a designer}} inserted sprites of shirtless [...] "himbos" [...] (male bimbos) in Speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other, who appear {{in great numbers}} from time to time. Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special rendering mode usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing lights, so they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weather. An unintended emergent behavior of the code caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> the helicopter, {{where they would be}} slashed up by the blades, and then need to be air-lifted to the hospital—which earned the player easy money. The easter egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.|$|E

On 26September 2006, a statue of Maria Feodorovna was unveiled near her favourite Cottage Palace in Peterhof.

2500|$|One thing James {{did have}} in common with Kierkegaard was respect for the single individual, and their {{respective}} comments may be compared in direct sequence as follows: [...] "A crowd is indeed made up of single individuals; it must therefore be in everyone's power to become what he is, a single individual; no one is prevented from being a single individual, no one, unless he prevents himself by becoming many. To become a crowd, to gather a <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> oneself, is on the contrary to distinguish life from life; even the most well-meaning one who talks about that, can easily offend a single individual." [...] In his book A Pluralistic Universe, James stated that, [...] "Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general label. As these heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life of philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing, and complaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up for which both Oxford and Harvard are partly to be thanked." ...|$|E
2500|$|At noon on Thursday, September 24, 1891, Francis Heney's brother Ben, who {{had been}} helping guard Francis, was in San Francisco {{attending}} to family business. Francis Heney left his office for lunch. His secretary Lautaro Roca was to join him momentarily. Handy waited outside the courthouse, and a half-block away at Pennington St. and Church Ave., as Heney walked past Handy, Handy suddenly shouted and grabbed the smaller man from behind, whirled him around, seized Heney by the throat and pushed him against a wall, choking him with all his might. Handy then let go and hit Heney in the face, saying, [...] "Take that {{you son of a}} bitch." [...] Handy's finger-trigger didn't keep up with his hair-trigger temper. Heney broke away and ran, pulling a pistol from his pocket. The noon-time <b>crowd</b> <b>around</b> the courthouse saw the fracas. Some shouted, [...] "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!" [...] Handy grabbed the pistol and tried to take the weapon from Heney. The two men struggled for control of it when it discharged, striking Handy in the lower abdomen. Handy, although wounded, lifted the smaller Heney off the ground and then both men fell to the street, still grappling for the revolver. But Heney refused to release his grip on the pistol while Handy still struggled for it. Deputy Sheriff John Wiegle and several other people finally removed the gun from Heney’s grip and Handy’s fingers from Heney’s hands.|$|E
