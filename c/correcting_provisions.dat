We estimate the effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and the trend in STI prevalences {{before and after the}} introduction of syndromic treatment in 1995. Methods: Data were available from various clinical studies, surveys of public and private health providers, the general population and women attending antenatal, family planning and child immunisation clinics in rural northern KwaZulu-Natal between 1987 and 2004. Overall effectiveness was defined as the estimated proportion of the annual number of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured by syndromic treatment based on separate estimates for six curable STI aetiologies by gender. Results: Median overall effectiveness was 13. 1 % (95 % CI 8. 9 to 17. 8 %) of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured. Effectiveness increased to 25. 0 % (95 % CI 17. 3 to 33. 8 %), 47. 6 % (95 % CI 44. 5 to 50. 8 %) or 14. 3 % (95 % CI 9. 9 to 19. 4 %) if 100 % treatment seeking, 100 % <b>correct</b> treatment <b>provision</b> or 100 % cure were assumed, respectively. Time-trends were difficult to assess formally but there was little evidence of decreasing STI prevalences. Including incurable but treatable herpes simplex virus (HSV) - 2 ulcers in the effectiveness calculation would halve the proportion of ulcers cured or correctly treated, but this reduction could be entirely countered by including episodic antiviral treatment in the national guidelines. Conclusion: Overall effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal remains low and there is little evidence of reduced curable STI prevalences. As syndromic treatment {{is likely to be a}} cost-saving HIV prevention intervention in South Africa, innovative strategies are urgently needed to increase rates of treatment seeking and <b>correct</b> treatment <b>provision.</b> <br/...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In African countries, {{respiratory}} {{infections and}} severe sepsis are common causes of respiratory failure and mortality in children under {{five years of}} age. Mortality and morbidity in these children could be reduced with adequate respiratory support in the emergency care setting. The purpose of this review is to describe management priorities in the emergency care of critically ill children presenting with respiratory problems. Basic and advanced respiratory support measures are described for implementation according to available resources, work load and skill-levels. Methods: We did a focused search of respiratory support for critically ill children in resource-limited settings {{over the past ten}} years, using the search tools PubMed and Google Scholar, the latest WHO guidelines, international âAdvanced Paediatric Life Supportâ guidelines and paediatric critical care textbooks. Results: The implementation of triage and rapid recognition of respiratory distress and hypoxia with pulse oximetry is important to correctly identify critically ill children with increased risk of mortality in all health facilities in resource constrained settings. Basic, effective airway management and respiratory support are essential elements of emergency care. <b>Correct</b> <b>provision</b> of supplemental oxygen is safe and its application alone can significantly improve the outcome of critically ill children. Non-invasive ventilatory support is cost-effective and feasible, with the potential to improve emergency care packages for children with respiratory failure and other organ dysfunctions. Non-invasive ventilation is particularly important in severely under-resourced regions unable to provide intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation support. Malnutrition and HIV-infection are important co-morbid conditions, associated with increased mortality in children with respiratory dysfunction. Discussion: A multi-disciplinary approach is required to optimise emergency care for critically ill children in low-resource settings. In this context, {{it is important to consider}} aspects of training of staff, technical support and pragmatic research...|$|R

In the past users have become accustomed to paying for voice calls but recently we have seen the increasing popularity of free Internet-based voice calls. It is envisaged that IMS will further decrease the barriers to ubiquitous cheap voice communication.

Although some QoS standards have emerged in the last years, together with a trend for covering Internet services with performance guarantees through a SLA, endto-end QoS provisioning remains presently an open research problem.

Six respondents were registered into the research part. Six basic questions were given to the respondents. The questions were chosen to find out information about an injured child, an injury character, a procedure of caring person while giving first aid, or other professional care and permanent effects. While preparing the research part, I was expecting that most of the respondents would manage to give first aid, however, according to the results, half of the parents didn't know how to deal with giving first aid. Non- professional first aid, provided at the right time and done correctly, is one of the basic and essential steps to reverse the injured person back into the normal quality of life.

Although hepatitis B virus encodes three envelope proteins (L, M, and S), {{all of the information}} required to produce an HBsAg particle resides within the S protein. This polypeptide spans the bilayer at least twice and contains three hydrophobic regions, two of which are known to harbor topogenic signal sequences that direct this transmembrane orientation. We have examined the effects of mutations in these and other regions of the S protein on particle assembly and export. Lesions in the N terminal signal sequence (signal I) can still insert into the endoplasmic reticulum bilayer but do not participate in any of the subsequent steps in assembly. Deletion of the major internal signal (signal II) completely destabilizes the chain. Deletion of the C-terminal hydrophobic domain results in a stable, glycosylated, but nonsecreted chain. However, when coexpressed with wild-type S protein this mutant polypeptide can be incorporated into particles and secreted, indicating that the chain is still competent for some of the distal steps in particle assembly. The correct transmembrane disposition of the N terminus of the molecule is important for particle formation: addition of a heterologous (globin) domain to this region impairs secretion, but the defect can be <b>corrected</b> by <b>provision</b> of an N-terminal signal sequence that restores the proper topology of this region.

40|$|Given the {{potential}} serious health consequences of genetic test results, mechanisms {{should be in}} place to assure {{the quality of the}} tests and the interpretation of the data. In this regard, the International Organization for Standardization ISO 15189 (5. 6. 4) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for quality assurance in molecular genetic testing (2. C), contain requirements and recommendations for laboratories to participate in external quality assessment schemes (EQA). Participation in EQA schemes is useful not only to the laboratory, as a key element of its quality assurance processes, but also as a quality indicator to monitor the improvement of laboratory performance. The Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Network has been providing EQA since 1996 and has performance data from more than 10 years. This study focuses on a group of about 100 molecular genetics laboratories that participated in the CF EQA scheme for each of the previous three years. Reporting the <b>correct</b> genotype, <b>provision</b> of appropriate interpretation and additional elements required by ISO 15189 such as unique identification of the patient and sample type, are compared over these three years. In addition, comparable cases and samples with identical genotypes were included during the three-year period, which enabled Genetic counselling, education, genetic services, and public policy 418 us to analyse performance of a laboratory more specifically and to survey if individual comments, provided by the assessors, were taken into account by the laboratory. Regular participation contributes to continuous improvement and monitoring of internal quality in laboratory performance. Moreover, it is a relevant tool for assessors to educate laboratories. status: publishe...|$|R
