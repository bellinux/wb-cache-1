40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a multiple-access channel (MAC) with partial <b>cribbing</b> encoders. This means {{that each of}} the two encoders obtains a deterministic function of the output of the other encoder with or without delay. The partial <b>cribbing</b> scheme is especially motivated by the additive noise Gaussian MAC, where perfect <b>cribbing</b> results in the degenerated case of full cooperation between the encoders and requires an infinite entropy link. We derive a single-letter characterization of the capacity of the MAC with partial <b>cribbing</b> for the cases of causal and strictly causal <b>cribbing.</b> Several numerical examples, such as those of quantized <b>cribbing,</b> are presented. We further consider and derive the capacity region where the <b>cribbing</b> depends on actions that are functions of the previous <b>cribbed</b> observations.

When the injecting time of steam reaches to a certain quantity, the rekindle phenomenon of wood <b>crib</b> would be effective controlled.

40|$|Wood <b>cribs</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} to stabilize openings in underground coal mines. This U. S. Bureau of Mines report describes {{the results of}} full-scale testing of several multitimbered wood <b>crib</b> configurations. Multitimbered configurations are wood <b>cribs</b> that are constructed with two or more timbers per layer. Nine different <b>crib</b> configurations were evaluated. Configuration parameters under study included the aspect ratio (height-to-width relationship) {{and the percentage of}} solid rr:aterial used in <b>crib</b> construction. Test results and generalized wood <b>crib</b> behavior are discussed and recommendations are made concerning <b>crib</b> constructions to maximize strength and stability. <b>Crib</b> performance is enhanced by reducing buckling effects by decreasing the aspect ratio and geometry considerations that increase the moment of inertia. A cost benefit analysis of multitimbered wood <b>crib</b> configurations is made. Generally, increasing the percentage of solid provides more resistance at less unit construction cost. A comparison of laboratory results and underground observations of several wood pack wall supports suggest in situ load capacity is less than that measured in laboratory testing. Reasons for the apparent decrease of in situ load-bearing capability include load rate effects, stiffness of reaction surfaces, and varying boundary conditions that alter the load transfer mechanics of the <b>crib</b> structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} load rate on the {{load-carrying}} capabilities of wood <b>cribs</b> is investigated in this Bureau of Mines study. The modulus of deformation (stiffness) of wood <b>crib</b> blocks {{has been shown}} to increase with increases in rates of load application, causing larger load reactions for increases in convergence rates. Since wood <b>cribs</b> are tested in the laboratory at convergence rates that are orders of magnitude faster than typically would occur underground, wood <b>cribs</b> tested in the laboratory will react larger loads than the same <b>cribs</b> would react underground for the same displacement. Tests conducted in the Bureau's mine roof simulator on green wood <b>crib</b> blocks indicate that the increase in stiffness for increasing load rates diminishes at displacement rates beyond 0. 1 in/min, making <b>crib</b> load nearly independent of load rate for rates faster than 0. 1 in/min. Seasoned wood specimens were not as con-sistent in load-rate dependency. Some possible explanations of observed load-rate behavior on wood <b>crib</b> specimens are also postulated in this paper...|$|R
