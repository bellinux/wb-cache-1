40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the cost-effectiveness of treatments {{for women with}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who ovulate on clomiphene citrate but do not conceive after six cycles. A decision-analytic framework was developed for six scenarios: (1) three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (2) continuation of clomiphene citrate for six cycles, followed by three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF in case of no birth; (3) six <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (4) 12 <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (5) continuation of clomiphene citrate for six <b>cycles,</b> six <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF; (6) continuation of clomiphene citrate for six <b>cycles,</b> 12 <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> IVF. Two-year cumulative birth rates were 58 %, 74 %, 89 %, 97 %, 93 % and 98 % and costs per couple were € 9518, € 7530, € 9711, € 9764, € 7651 and € 7684 for scenarios 1 - 6, respectively. Scenario 2 was the lowest cost option. The extra cost {{for at least one}} live birth in scenario 5 was € 629 and in scenario 6 € 630. In these subjects, continuation of treatment for six <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> clomiphene citrate, 6 or 12 <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> gonadotrophins and IVF is potentially cost-effective.

40|$|Background The National Epirubicin Adjuvant Trial (NEAT) and the BR 9601 trial {{examined}} {{the efficacy of}} anthracyclines in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer. Methods In NEAT, we compared four <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> epirubicin followed by four <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) with six <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> CMF alone. In the BR 9601 trial, we compared four <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> epirubicin followed by four <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> CMF, with eight <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> CMF alone every 3 weeks.

Results The two trials included 2391 women with early breast cancer; the median follow-up was 48 months.

40|$|In 165 {{women with}} breast cancer who were {{candidates}} for mastectomy because the largest diameter of the tumor was 3 cm or more, we administered primary chemotherapy {{in the attempt to}} substitute conservative for mutilating surgery. We then systematically quantitated tumor reduction by clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic evaluations. Five consecutive groups of 33 patients received cyclophosphamide, methotrex-ate, and fluorouracil (CMF); fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC); or fluoro-uracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC).

Today, most patients in this risk group are treated with a combination of chemotherapy followed by small-field radiotherapy. More recent clinical trials such as the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD 10 study demonstrated, that even two <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> ABVD followed by 20 Gy involved-field radiation therapy (IF-RT) are sufficient and result in more than 90 % of patients being cured.

5|$|Mars has a {{relatively}} pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; {{of the seven}} other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity.
