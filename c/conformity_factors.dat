40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a study on}} emission measurements in passenger cars in tests conducted under real traffic conditions – Real Driving Emissions using a Portable Emission Measurement System type of equipment. A special feature of the outlined RDE tests {{is that they were}} performed in Polish road conditions, and thus their parameters may differ from their counterparts adopted in most European Union countries. Based on the findings vehicle emission <b>conformity</b> <b>factors</b> were developed, characterized as the fractional increase (or decrease) of traffic emissions during the homologation test or under normal operation conditions in relation to the emission limit standards (for chosen emission class) of the vehicle. Conducted research and the calculated <b>conformity</b> <b>factors</b> allowed for the environmental impact assessment of the vehicles of various emission classes, while also allowing early actions to restrict the emissions of selected components in passenger vehicles. The methods and measures used can also be applied to other types of vehicles (e. g. heavy duty or off-road vehicles) or vehicles powered by other fuels...|$|E
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{flexible}} active power filter (APF) controller operating selectively {{to satisfy a}} set of desired load performance indices defined at the source side. The definition of such indices, and of the corresponding current references, {{is based on the}} orthogonal instantaneous current decomposition and <b>conformity</b> <b>factors</b> provided by the conservative power theory. This flexible approach can be applied to single- or three-phase APFs or other grid-tied converters, as those interfacing distributed generators in smart grids. The current controller is based on a modified hybrid P-type iterative learning controller which has shown good steady-state and dynamic performances. To validate the proposed approach, a three-phase four-wire APF connected to a non-linear and unbalanced load has been considered. Experimental results have been generated under ideal and non-ideal voltage sources, showing the effectiveness of the proposed flexible compensation scheme, even for weak grid scenarios...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present study}} therefore is twofold. First, to test the Islamic faith-based model developed by Alshehri, Fotaki and Kauser (2013), and second, to develop and validate a scale that measures a Muslim's view of God. To enable this, a sample of 427 responses was collected from people in Saudi Arabia. Notably, the model was empirically valid. Moreover, results showed that the newly constructed Muslim's View of Allah at Work Scale (MVAWS) had adequate psychometric properties in terms of structural validity, internal consistency and correlations, and predicted personal religious practices. To test the validity, <b>conformity</b> <b>factors</b> analysis (CFA) was run. The scale items show a good fit.

Despite permissible limits of NOX emissions at type approval reducing significantly, in-service emissions from diesel vehicles have, in reality, not reduced at all through the Euro 1 – 5 / I–V emission standards. TfL commissioned a programme of laboratory testing {{to better understand the}} in-service emission performance of Euro 6 /VI vehicles over the TfL London Drive Cycle (LDC). This cycle was constructed from instrumented car data making repeated circuits of a set route at different times of day. Twelve Euro 6 passenger cars were tested over the entire 140 kms of the LDC from a warm-start. Three HGVs were tested over the suburban sub-cycle (40 kms) in laden and un-laden condition. NOX emissions from the petrol cars were at a low level and below, or at, their type approval limit of 0. 06 g. km- 1. Only one SCR equipped diesel car achieved NOX emissions close to their 0. 08 g. km- 1 type approval limit.

A biological model was analysed in stereotactic implants. Materials/Methods 31 sequential stereotactic CNS tumour implants were analysed. The analysed implants were compared with appropriate hypothetical implants designed according to the classic standards of the Paris system. Physical parameters of Dose distribution were analysed, including: coverage index (CI), <b>conformity</b> <b>factor</b> (CF), high dosage treatment volume (V 200), and minimum dose. A value for the radiobiological parameter – Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD) – was calculated. ResultsIn comparison with classic Paris System implants, stereotactic implants affected only half the volume of healthy tissue within {{the area of the}} reference isodose, though the high dose volume was greater. EUD was sensitive to changes in minimal dose and coverage index CI. ConclusionsThis parameter may be a criterion in the optimization of dose distribution in radiotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Quality of e-service {{is one of}} the {{critical}} factors that decide {{the success or failure of}} organizations. It may increase competitive advantages as well as enhance the relationships with the customers. Achieving high e-service quality and user satisfaction are challenging since they depend fundamentally on user perception and expectation which can be tricky at times. To date, there is no agreement as to what service quality is, and how it should be measured, whether it is a function of statistical measures of quality including physical defects or managerial judgment, or it is a function of customer perception about the services. This paper deep-dived the quality of e-services offered by five Malaysian Institutes of High Learning (IHL) including two private and three public universities. A quantitative approach was utilized to collect the data and AMOS 21 was used to analyze the data and develop the measurement model. The paper aims to find the relationship between e-service quality dimensions and the user satisfaction by using <b>Conformity</b> <b>Factor</b> Analysis (CFA) test with 320 students in the target universities.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) Youths are {{the future}} leaders {{of society and}} they will strive for the {{betterment}} and advancement of the society. Career choices among young people have recently drawn attention. Recently, graduates have faced fierce competition in finding job {{in the job market}} due to the expansion of higher education. This situation is the same as in Hong Kong. However, most of the graduates have faced difficulties in preparing their career-searching activities and also lack confidence in finding their job in the market (He & Zhou, 2006). To understand what factors influence students’ career choices is becoming more important for most educators and student counselors in colleges and universities. They are required to design appropriate educational programme to cater the diverse needs and inclinations of the students. It is also critical and essential for student counselors to provide suitable support and career advisory services to assist students in finding out and planning for their career after graduation. The objective of this thesis is to investigate and examine the relationships between personality traits and the career commitment process of students studying vocational education and training (VET) programme in Hong Kong. It also examines the degree to which career decision self-efficacy (CDSE) mediates the relationship between these two constructs. Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) is the guiding conceptual framework (Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994, 2000) of this study. It was assumed that personality traits were related to two dimensions of career choices commitment process, namely vocational exploration and commitment (VEC) and the tendency to foreclose (TTF) through the effect of career decision self-efficacy. This is a quantitative research for identifying data patterns or testing a pattern of relationships. This research study was conducted in the form of anonymous questionnaires to be distributed and collected in classes of undergraduate participants in three Hong Kong Institutions of Vocational Education. A total of 362 questionnaires were collected. Among these 362 questionnaires, 58 questionnaires were abandoned for incompleteness or same answers across all questions on the whole questionnaire. Therefore, 304 questionnaires were submitted for final data analysis. Data analysis comprises three stages. Firstly, an overview of the demographic profiles of the participants was conducted. Secondly, the examination of validity and reliability of data using Cronbach’s alpha testing, exploratory <b>factor</b> analysis and <b>conformity</b> <b>factor</b> analysis were also examined. Lastly, the four hypotheses were tested using SPSS version 23. In assessing the research questions, multiple regression analysis was employed in this study. The results indicated that CDSE has significant effect on VEC and TTF. All five Personality traits have significant effect on the CDSE. Extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness to experience are significantly affected VEC, whereas only agreeableness and conscientiousness are significantly affected TTF. In relation to the mediation effect, extraversion shows a partially mediation effect on the relationship between personality and VEC while agreeableness and openness to experience have fully mediated on this. Moreover, all personality except neuroticism shows mediation between personality and TTF...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{researched}} {{the dynamics of}} upward communication within organisations through the rubric of ingratiation theory (Jones, 1964) and impression management (Goffman, 1955). Upward communication was explored via in-depth case studies, in a hundred and five semi-structured interviews across four organisations in Scotland. A qualitative, interpretive methodology was used. The interviews probed how upward communication was transmitted and investigated how ingratiation theory and impression management dynamics could impact on it by exploring the story telling (Gabriel, 200) and sense making approaches (Weick, 1995) employed by interviewees. The data was then tabulated on Excel sheets, using the Framework Analysis (Swallow et al., 2002), thus establishing an easily referenced, perfectly structured database. Finally, the data was sifted, perused, distilled and analysed interpretively. It was found that upward communication was shaped by processes such as downsizing, management and leadership styles, the power dynamics of the organisation, issues of publicness, and the perceived physical and psychological distance of the superior from the subordinate. Finally, the components of opinion <b>conformity</b> (a <b>factor</b> common to ingratiation theory and impression management), employee silence (Morrison and Milliken, 2000, Milliken, 2003), and cynicism (Fleming and Spicer, 2002; Naus, 2004, 2007) were identified as the most significant syndromes that impacted on the levels of upward communication within the four organisations. Hence, a Conformity/Silence/Cynicism model of upward communication (the CSC model) was devised {{as a means of}} illustrating the significance of the most important stimuli of upward communication that the study revealed. The issues raised in this study are fundamental to the theory and practice of management. Openness in the search for solutions to organisational problems is central to organisational learning.

It is commonly believed that the dominant cultural mainstream, in an attempt to uphold patterns of conformity, has marginalised those who resisted the social norm. Writers, artists and intellectuals, according to this version of events, have been forcefully put on the margins of society. A general lack of scholarship about the Fifties does not allow one to establish how true an account of cultural relations this really is. Through perusal of two prominent periodicals this study aims to offer a more detailed picture of the relation between the writer and the cultural mainstream.

The CPS and the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF) were completed by 804 first year university students in Afrikaans. The CPS was translated into Afrikaans by the translation-back translation method. Scores for the 40 subscales of the CPS were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis. Nine factors were extracted and orthogonally rotated with the Tandem Criteria. Subsequently, the factors were compared with the eight factors obtained in the original normative study by means of coefficients of congruence. Six of the factors, namely Trust versus Defensiveness, Orderliness versus Lack of Compulsion, Emotional Stability versus Neuroticism, Extroversion versus introversion, Mental Toughness versus Emotional Sensitivity, and Empathy versus Egocentrism, showed congruence coefficients of 0, 90 or higher. The Social <b>Conformity</b> versus Rebelliousness <b>factor</b> was clearly recognisable in the Afrikaans speaking sample, but the congruence coefficient was only 0, 81. The Activity versus Lack of Energy factor split in two and one of these factors was very similar to the normative Activity factor, with a congruence coefficient of 0, 89. The CPS subscales were also subjected to a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis wherein the measurement invariance of the CPS for Afrikaans speaking students and the normative American group was assessed. The results confirmed that the CPS measures the same constructs in the two groups, but the variance of the Afrikaans group for the Social <b>Conformity</b> versus Rebelliousness <b>factor</b> was much smaller than that of the American group. The measurement invariance of the CPS for Afrikaans speaking males and females was also assessed. The multiple groups confirmatory factor analysis supported the measurement invariance of the CPS for males and females. Subsequently, the mean scores of American male students and the Afrikaans speaking male students for the CPS were compared. The Afrikaans speaking students obtained higher scores for Social Conformity versus Rebelliousness and lower scores for Trust versus Defensiveness than their American counterparts. Similar results were obtained for the Afrikaans speaking and American females. The mean scores of the Afrikaans speaking males and females were also compared. The comparison of the males and females revealed that the males had higher Mental Toughness versus Emotional Sensitivity scores. The females had higher scores for Empathy versus Egocentrism, Trust versus Defensiveness, Orderliness versus Lack of Compulsion, and Social Conformity versus Rebelliousness. In the last place the CPS and the 16 PF scales were subjected to an interbattery factor analysis. Six factors were extracted and orthogonally rotated.
