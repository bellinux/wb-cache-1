40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{kinematics}} of kuzushi/tsukuri (KT) phases of the harai-goshi throw under <b>competitive</b> and non-competitive <b>conditions.</b> A third degree black belt subject served as the tori (thrower) for both conditions. Two black belt participants ranked as first degree and fourth degree served as the uke (faller) for the <b>competitive</b> and non-competitive <b>conditions,</b> respectively. Two video cameras (JVC 60 Hz) and a three dimensional motion analysis system (Vicon-Peak Performance Technologies, Inc., Englewood, CO) were used to collect and analyze peak velocity for the center of mass (COM) of uke and tori and peak angular velocity of tori's trunk (TAV). Data were smoothed using a 4 th order zero lag Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency set by the Peak software optimization technique. All variables were normalized by time as a percentage of the KT phase. In general, the COM directional velocity patterns were similar between conditions. Uke's defensive efforts during the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition</b> created differences in timing and magnitude of peak COM and TAV velocities. During competition, tori created larger peak COM velocities onto uke which indicated greater throwing power. Peak velocities for tori's COM were larger during the non-competitive condition since uke's resistance was minimal. Findings of the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition</b> suggested that mediolateral COM movement towards tori's pulling (left) hand can be an ideal set-up movement prior to execution. Tori's TAV was also greater during the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition.</b> Two distinct TAVs were observed, a counterclockwise TAV created by tori turning their hips during the entrance of the throw and a clockwise TAV created by the shoulders turning to complete the 180 degree body turn with the simultaneous leg sweep. It is thought that the counterclockwise rotation aids in producing a pre-stretch of trunk muscles which helps to create greater trunk rotation powe...|$|R
40|$|In many {{sport and}} {{exercise}} situations cognitive performance is required under conditions of high physiological load and high cognitive anxiety. However, few studies have assessed all these components in-situ. The current study sought to address this issue. Fourteen adults (9 males, 5 females) completed 2 incremental exercise trials (perceived competition or perceived practice) in a counterbalanced order. Cognitive performance, via a test of visual discrimination, RPE, heart rate (HR), blood lactate (Bla), and anxiety scores, were recorded at rest, 70 % 2 max and 90 % 2 max. Visual discrimination response times were faster at rest compared to 70 % (P = 0. 001) and 90 % 2 max (P = 0. 002) and at 70 % compared to 90 % 2 max (P = 0. 04) in the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition.</b> HR post instructions (P = 0. 0001), at 70 % (P = 0. 001) and 90 % 2 max (P = 0. 0001) was significantly higher in competition compared to practice. RPE was higher in the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition</b> compared to the practice condition (P = 0. 023). Cognitive anxiety intensity was significantly higher in the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition,</b> at 70 and 90 % 2 max (P = 0. 001). This study suggests that cognitive performance is more negatively affected when physiological arousal and cognitive anxiety are at their highest. Coaches and athletes should be mindful of such effects and seek to develop skills to offset such responses or to structure training to better represent competition...|$|R

However, the ecological validity {{of these results}} {{is yet to be}} established. There is a need for investigation of whether the results hold in both the classroom context and non-Western culture. Aim. The study investigated the effects of competition on learning motivation among Chinese students in an authentic classroom setting. Sample. The participants were 52 students of grade 7 from two Hong Kong secondary schools. Method. They were randomly assigned to either <b>competitive</b> or non-competitive <b>conditions</b> in a 2 -hour Chinese typewriting course. Results. Students in the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition</b> performed better in easy tasks than their counterparts in the non-competitive condition. However, they were more performance-oriented and more likely to sacrifice learning opportunities for better performance. They were also prone to have worse self-evaluation after failure. Although there were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} conditions in task enjoyment and achievement attribution, the direction of the differences was consistently unfavourable to students in the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition.</b> Conclusion. The findings were consistent with the predictions of goal theory.

Visual information about both players' actions was manipulated by means of self-glowing markers. We recorded the number of successful passes for each player individually. The results showed that participants' performance increased when their own body was rendered visible in both the cooperative and the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition.</b> However, social context modulated the importance of different sources of visual information about the other player. In the cooperative condition, seeing the other player's racket had the largest effects on performance increase, whereas in the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition,</b> seeing the other player's body resulted in the largest performance increase.

40|$|Background. Previous {{literature}} had {{examined how}} {{the adoption of}} cooperative, competitive and individualistic goal structures in academic tasks influence students’ altruistic behaviors. However, little research has investigated the relationship between goal structures in non-academic activities and children’s affective outcomes. Moreover, the specific differentiation of friends from ordinary acquaintances was seldom considered. Aims. This study compares the immediate effect of different goal structures in a non-academic task on children’s mutual liking. Sample. The participants were 116 fourth and fifth grade students in Hong Kong. Methods. Participants were paired to form friend and non-friend dyads and the dyads were randomly assigned into one of three experimental conditions: cooperative, competitive and individualistic. In all the three conditions, dyads were asked to do a photo-hunt task twice, but the content of instructions and the basis of reward were different. Results. In the cooperative condition, participants’ liking towards their partners had significantly increased, and the average rating {{was significantly higher than}} that in the <b>competitive</b> <b>condition.</b> Specifically, the increase in liking between non-friend dyads was greater than that in friend dyads. In <b>competitive</b> <b>condition,</b> the liking between friend dyads had significantly decreased, but the change in liking between non-friend dyads was not significant. No meaningful change was observed in the individualist condition. Conclusion. The findings suggested that children’s liking towards their peers would increase when they were given chance to cooperate with each other; and the liking might decline when they participated in activities that required competition. Implications for activity-planning and group composition are discussed. published_or_final_versionEducational PsychologyMasterMaster of Social Science...|$|R
