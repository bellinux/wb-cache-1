40|$|Abstract <b>Conazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> {{are widely}} used in {{agriculture}} despite their suspected endocrine disrupting properties. In this study, the potential (anti-) androgenic effects of ten conazoles were assessed and mutually compared with existing data. Effects of cyproconazole (CYPRO), fluconazole (FLUC), flusilazole (FLUS), hexaconazole (HEXA), myconazole (MYC), penconazole (PEN), prochloraz (PRO), tebuconazole (TEBU), triadimefon (TRIA), and triticonazole (TRIT) were examined using murine Leydig (MA- 10) cells and human T 47 D-ARE cells stably transfected with an androgen responsive element and a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Six conazoles caused a decrease in basal testosterone (T) secretion by MA- 10 cells varying from 61 % up to 12 % compared to vehicle-treated control. T secretion was concentration-dependently inhibited after exposure of MA- 10 cells to several concentrations of FLUS (IC 50 = 12. 4 μM) or TEBU (IC 50 = 2. 4 μM) in combination with LH. The expression of steroidogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes was not changed by conazole exposure. Also, there were no changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation that could explain the altered T secretion after exposure to conazoles. Nine conazoles decreased T-induced AR activation (IC 50 s ranging from 10. 7 to 71. 5 μM) and effect potencies (REPs) were calculated relative to the known AR antagonist flutamide (FLUT). FLUC {{had no effect on}} AR activation by T. FLUS was the most potent (REP = 3. 61) and MYC the least potent (REP = 0. 03) AR antagonist. All other conazoles had a comparable REP from 0. 12 to 0. 38. Our results show distinct in vitro anti-androgenic effects of several <b>conazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> arising from two mechanisms: inhibition of T secretion and AR antagonism, suggesting potential testicular toxic effects. These effects warrant further mechanistic investigation and clearly show the need for accurate exposure data in order to perform proper (human) risk assessment of this class of compounds...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{our search}} for in vitro {{alternative}} methods to screen for steroidogenesis toxicity, we focused {{on the effects of}} (suggested) endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on cytochrome P 450 17 (CYP 17) enzyme activity. CYP 17 is responsible for conversion of progestagens to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the main precursor for androgens and estrogens, important for (fetal) sexual functioning and development. We developed a new assay to screen for effects on CYP 17 activity using porcine adrenal cortex microsomes (PACMs) and compared this with the well-known H 295 R steroidogenesis assay. Also, effects of selected compounds on CYP 19 (aromatase) activity in the H 295 R assay as well as human placental microsomes were assessed. 28 (suggested) EDCs were screened. The PACM assay showed to be an effective, rapid tool for screening of direct interaction of EDCs with CYP 17. Furthermore, we discovered that CYP 17 activity is regulated differently from CYP 19. The addition of a specific and validated CYP 17 assay to an EDC screening battery would be of added value on top of the existing steroidogenesis assays that mainly consider effects on the CYP 19 enzyme. We further investigated a specific class of suggested EDCs: the conazole fungicide, some of which have been shown to affect male fertility parameters in vitro and in vivo. Ten <b>conazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> were selected and tested for potential in vitro (anti-) androgenic effects using the murine MA- 10 cell line as well as an androgen receptor (AR) activity reporter assay. Exposure of MA- 10 cells to six of these conazoles resulted in a decrease in basal testosterone (T) secretion. Nine of the tested <b>conazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> showed an inhibition of T-induced AR activation. Thus, several of the tested <b>conazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> showed distinct in vitro anti-androgenic effects in the performed assays. These effects are a result of two mechanisms, i. e. inhibition of T secretion and AR antagonism, suggesting that these compounds are potential testicular toxicants in vivo. Subsequently, the effects of two bisphenol analogues, two perfluorinated compounds, and two phthalates on ABC efflux transporters in the blood-testis barrier (BTB) were studied. Bisphenol A (BPA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), as well as perfluorooctane-sulfonic acid (PFOS) inhibited breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) activity. BPA and PFOA showed to be substrates for BCRP. TBBPA, PFOA, and PFOS also showed inhibition of multidrug resistance proteins 1 and 4 (MRP 1 / 4) and P-glycoprotein. In MA- 10 cells, BPA and TBBPA concentration-dependently increased T secretion. For TBBPA, this could be blocked by inhibition of MRPs, generating the hypothesis that transporter-mediated efflux of T precursors is inhibited by TBBPA resulting in a higher availability of precursors for T production. This research indicates that, in EDC risk assessment, ABC efflux transporters present in the BTB are of toxicological and clinical relevance for testicular toxicity and should be taken into account. Next, effects of these several (structural) bisphenol analogues on AR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity modulation were tested, as well as testicular steroidogenesis in MA- 10 cells. BPA, bisphenol F (BPF), and TBBPA, but not bisphenol S (BPS) showed differential inhibition of AR as well as GR activity. BPF and BPS exposure of MA- 10 cells mainly resulted in higher levels of progestagens that are formed {{at the beginning of the}} steroidogenic pathway, whereas TBBPA shows a distinct profile more directed towards the endpoint of testicular steroidogenesis, i. e. T and other androgens production. Furthermore, full steroid profiling of the in vitro MA- 10 cell model shows the presence of a more fetal-like, testicular-specific steroidogenesis pathway. This so-called “backdoor pathway” renders the MA- 10 assay added value on top of the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay for tissue-specific questions related to EDC screening...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} developed a method [1] for the inverse design of small ligands. This method {{can be used}} to design novel compounds with optimized properties (such as drugs) and has been applied successfully to the design of small peptide antagonists to leukocyte functional antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) and its intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM- 1). A key step in our method involves computing the Hilbert basis of a system of linear Diophantine equations. In our previous application, the ligands considered were small peptide rings, so that the resulting system of Diophantine equations was relatively small and easy to solve. When considering larger molecules, however, the Diophantine system is larger and more difficult to solve. In this work we present a method for reducing the system of Diophantine equations before they are solved, allowing the inverse design of larger compounds. We present this reduction on our original LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 dataset, where we were able to reduce a system with 24 equations and 49 variables to an equivalent system with 11 equations and 34 variables, giving a 10 times speedup in performance. We also present the results of our reduction on two new datasets, neither of which we could solve previously: a set of 27 <b>conazole</b> <b>fungicides</b> and a set of 61 γ-secretase inhibitors. 1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Conazoles</b> are <b>fungicides</b> used {{to control}} fungal growth in {{environmental}} settings and to treat humans with fungal infec-tions. Mouse hepatotumorigenic conazoles display {{many of the same}} hepatic toxicologic responses as the mouse liver carcinogen phenobarbital (PB) : constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation, hypertrophy, Cyp 2 b induction, and increased cell proliferation. The goal {{of this study was to}} apply transcriptional analyses to hepatic tissues from mice exposed to PB, propicona-zole (Pro) or triadimefon (Tri) at tumorigenic exposure levels to reveal similarities and differences in response among these treatments. Mice were administered diets containing PB (850 ppm), Pro (2500 ppm), or Tri (1800 ppm) for 4 and 30 days. Targeted transcriptomic analyses were conducted at the gene level examining differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and subsets of DEGs: cell cycle genes, and transcription factors. Analyses were also conducted on function, pathway and network levels examining Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tox Lists and Canonical Pathways, and Gene-Go MetaCore dynamic networks and their central hubs. Genes expressed by PB or the two conazoles were also compared with those genes associated with human hepato-cellular cancer. The results from these analyses indicated greater differences between PB and the two conazoles than similarities. Significant commonalities between the two conazole treatments were also noted. We posit that the transcriptional profiles of tissues exposed to toxic chemicals inherently contain their mechanisms of toxicity. We conclude that although PB and these 2 conazoles induce mouse liver tumors and exhibit similar toxicological responses, their transcriptional profiles are signifi-cantly different and thus their mechanisms of tumorigenic action are likely to differ...|$|R
40|$|Imazalil (IMA) is {{a widely}} used imidazole-antifungal {{pesticide}} and, therefore, a food contaminant. This compound is also used as a drug (enilconazole). As intestine is the first site of exposure to ingested drugs and pollutants, we have investigated the effects of IMA, at realistic intestinal concentrations, on xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and efflux pumps by using Caco- 2 cells, as a validated in vitro model of the human intestinal absorptive epithelium. For comparison, other <b>conazole</b> <b>fungicides,</b> i. e. ketoconazole, propiconazole and tebuconazole, were also studied. IMA induced cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1 activity {{to the same extent}} as benzo(a) pyrene (B(a) P) or 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell-free aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding assay and reporter gene assay suggested that IMA is not an AhR-ligand, implying that IMA-mediated induction should involve an AhR-independent pathway. Moreover, IMA strongly inhibited the CYP 3 A 4 activity in 1, 25 -vitamin D(3) -induced Caco- 2 cells. The other fungicides had weak or nil effects on CYP activities. Study of the apical efflux pump activities revealed that ketoconazole inhibited both P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP- 2) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), whereas IMA and other fungicides did not. Our results imply that coingestion of IMA-contaminated food and CYP 3 A 4 - or CYP 1 A 1 -metabolizable drugs or chemicals could lead to drug bioavailability modulation or toxicological interactions, with possible adverse effects for human health...|$|E
