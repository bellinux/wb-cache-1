40|$|The {{fuel saving}} {{potential}} and cost effectiveness of numerous operational and technical options proposed {{for reducing the}} fuel consumption of the U. S. <b>commercial</b> <b>airline</b> <b>fleet</b> was examined and compared. The impact {{of the most promising}} fuel conserving options on fuel consumption, passenger demand, operating costs and airline profits when implemented in the U. S. domestic and international airline fleets was determined. A forecast estimate was made of the potential fuel savings achievable in the U. S. scheduled air transportation system. Specifically, the means for reducing the jet fuel consumption of the U. S. scheduled airlines in domestic and international passenger operations were investigated. A design analysis was made of two turboprop aircraft as possible fuel conserving derivatives of the DC- 9 - 30...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} and aerodynamic efficiency are the driving forces behind research into methods to reduce turbulent {{skin friction drag}} on aircraft fuselages. Fuselage skin friction reductions as small as 10 percent provide {{the potential for a}} 250 million dollar per year fuel savings for the <b>commercial</b> <b>airline</b> <b>fleet.</b> One passive drag reduction concept which is relatively simple to implement and retrofit is that of longitudinally grooved surfaces aligned with the stream velocity. These grooves (riblets) have heights and spacings on the order of the turbulent wall streak and burst dimensions. The riblet performance (8 percent net drag reduction thus far), sensitivity to operational/application considerations such as yaw and Reynolds number variation, an alternative fabrication technique, results of extensive parametric experiments for geometrical optimization, and flight test applications are summarized...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} quickly detect flaws in thin {{aluminum}} alloy sheets is {{of critical importance}} to the <b>commercial</b> <b>airline</b> <b>fleets.</b> Current eddy-current methods, although very effective at exposing flawed regions, can be very time consuming when applied to airframe structures. The need for a fast, effective means of detecting critical flaws needs to be met. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present preliminary results describing some capabilities of a new instrument, The Magneto-Optic/Eddy Current Imager, as an NDE tool for use in the Airframe Structural Integrity Program...|$|R
50|$|On 24 January 2016 Tehran {{hosted the}} CAPA Iran Aviation Summit {{organised}} by CAPA - Centre for Aviation {{in order to}} bring both Iranian and international aviation authorities together for considering development plans for Iran's aviation industry. CAPA put the size of Iran's economy somewhere between those of Turkey and Australia, whose <b>commercial</b> <b>airline</b> <b>fleets</b> are in the order of 500-600 aircraft. Bombardier presented its regional models during the CAPA summit in Tehran. In a statement, Mr. Parvaresh announced that his airline expected to spend some 3-5 billion US dollars purchasing regional aircraft from manufacturers Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer.|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} and up-to-date diagnostic model {{is critical for}} economic aircraft engine operation. However, for many <b>commercial</b> <b>airline</b> <b>fleets,</b> monitoring and diagnosing engine faults is often left to human operators {{due to lack of}} effective modeling. Individuals must manually interpret engine performance parameters and this results in inconsistent evaluation and the potential for error. A recent work has been performed to capture the knowledge of diagnostic engineers and apply fuzzy logic to engine fault classification. The developed fuzzy model is capable of capturing various engine fault signatures based on expert experience, and it provides accurate diagnosis by assessing the similarity between those fault signatures and observed trends in sensor data. The major drawback with this approach is the manual knowledge extraction and model maintenance process. Manual model tuning is not only labor intensive, but it also brings another source of inconsistency to the overall system performance. In this paper, we will present a hybrid approach to augment the existing expert knowledge-based diagnostic model with automatic learning capability using a genetic algorithm. The proposed approach not only allows for automatic model tuning, but also enables the diagnostic model to adapt throughout the engine service life as operating conditions change...|$|R
50|$|Condor is Germany's {{third largest}} <b>commercial</b> <b>airline</b> based on <b>fleet</b> size and {{passengers}} flown. It is headquartered at Gateway Gardens near Frankfurt Airport with an important branch office at Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport. It is {{a subsidiary of}} the British Thomas Cook Group, but still partners with its former parent Lufthansa through the use of the Lufthansa Group's Miles & More program, its business lounges at Frankfurt Airport and as interline partners. Condor Airlines is also member of Alaska Airlines' Mileage Plan.|$|R
40|$|Preface The {{purpose of}} the conference was to bring {{together}} world leaders in aviation safety research, aircraft design and manufacturing, fleet operation and aviation maintenance to disseminate information on current practices and advanced technologies that will assure the continued airworthiness of the aging aircraft {{in the military and}} commercial fleets. The conference included reviews of current industry practices, assessments of future technology requirements, and status of aviation safety research. The conference provided an opportunity for interactions among the key personnel in the research and technology development community, the original equipment manufacturers, <b>commercial</b> <b>airline</b> operators, military <b>fleet</b> operators, aviation maintenance, and aircraft certification and regulatory authorities. Conference participation was unrestricted, with 623 participants from the international aviation community...|$|R

5000|$|A {{long lasting}} legal {{conflict}} exists between aerospace corporations and {{the manufacturers of}} plastic models. Manufacturers of aircraft have sought royalties from model makers for using their designs and intellectual property in their kits. Hobbyists argue that model kits provide free advertising for the makers of the real vehicles and that any royalties collected would be insignificant compared to the profits made from aircraft construction contracts. They also argue that forcing manufacturers to pay royalties and licensing fees would financially ruin all but the largest model kit makers. Some proponents of the aerospace industry contest {{that the issue is}} not of financial damages, but of intellectual property and brand image. In contrast, most of the world's <b>commercial</b> <b>airlines</b> allow their <b>fleet</b> to be modeled, as a form of publicity. Many cottage industry manufacturers, particularly of sci-fi subjects, avoid the issue by selling their products under generic untrademarked names (e.g. selling a figure that clearly depicts Batman as [...] "Bat Hero Figure"). Similarly, automobile manufacturers occasionally make an effort to collect royalties from companies modeling their products.|$|R
