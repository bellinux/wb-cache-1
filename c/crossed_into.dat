5|$|In {{addition}} to the 11named storms, there were two additional storms in the season, classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The first developed in July in the Australian basin, and briefly <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the south-west Indian Ocean on July14. Soon after it re-entered the Australian basin and dissipated. The other formed just southeast of Diego Garcia on November20. It tracked to the southwest, and the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph). The storm dissipated on November25 northeast of Mauritius. In addition, Cyclone Daryl, which formed in the Australian basin on March6, <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the south-west Indian Ocean on March16 as a weakening storm without being renamed. Two days later it re-entered the Australian basin before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The hajduks, {{who were}} Ottoman subjects, were {{recruited}} by the Republic of Venice as guerilla forces to co-operate in the defence of the Venetian–Ottoman frontier in Dalmatia during the Cretan War (1645–69). They <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Venetian territory from which they conducted raids into Ottoman-controlled lands.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hokies {{had success}} on defense {{during the first}} quarter, Mississippi {{dominated}} the Hokies defensively {{for the rest of}} the game. Such was the defensive dominance of Mississippi in the last three quarters of the game that after Tech's field goal in the first quarter, the Hokies had 11 offensive possessions and <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Ole Miss territory just once.|$|E
25|$|The highway {{continues}} northwest through Carlisle before <b>crossing</b> {{the line}} <b>into</b> Montgomery County from Schoharie County. After <b>crossing</b> <b>into</b> Montgomery County, NY162 <b>crosses</b> <b>into</b> {{the town of}} Charleston, bending northwest through the town. The scenery in Charlestown does not change from where it was in Carlisle, as NY162 remains a two-lane rural road. A short distance later, NY162 enters the hamlet of Charleston Four Corners, where it intersects with Corbin Hill Road (CR104), East Lykers Road (CR103) and Charleston Street (CR134). NY162 continues northwest out of Charleston Four Corners, remaining a two-lane road as it <b>crosses</b> <b>into</b> the town of Root.|$|R
50|$|After departing Cave City, KY 70 {{eventually}} crosses US Route 31E, {{and heads}} for Hiseville, and then <b>crosses</b> <b>into</b> {{the northern part of}} Metcalfe County. Once it <b>crosses</b> <b>into</b> Metcalfe County, it will go through Sulphur Well. Beyond that point, KY 70 will join US 68.|$|R
50|$|State Route 106 {{traverses}} Butler and Crenshaw counties along a two-lane road. As {{it leads}} across Butler County, the route travels eastwardly, continuing this trajectory until it <b>crosses</b> <b>into</b> Crenshaw County. After <b>crossing</b> <b>into</b> Crenshaw County, the route turns southeastwardly {{until it reaches}} its terminus near Brantley.|$|R
5|$|By 26 March, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} located within the near-equatorial trough near Papua New Guinea. Initially located within an area of easterly wind shear, it tracked westward due {{to the presence of}} a ridge to its south, and on 27 March a low pressure area formed over Western New Guinea. Thunderstorm activity increased around a mid-level circulation as it <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the Arafura Sea, and its overall organisation continued to increase. On 29 March, a low-level circulation was visible, though significant tropical development was prevented due to wind shear and land interaction with islands in the Indonesian archipelago. It developed into a tropical low on 30 March, and after turning to the southwest, it crossed the island of Flores on 31 March; upon doing so its convection greatly increased due to increased upper-level divergence, which produced heavy rainfall on Flores and Timor. On 1 April, wind shear decreased as it <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the Savu Sea, and by early on 1 April it developed into a tropical cyclone to the northeast of Sumba.|$|E
5|$|Domoina {{developed}} on January16 off the northeast coast of Madagascar. With a ridge to the north, the storm tracked generally westward and later southwestward. On January21, Domoina struck eastern Madagascar. After crossing the country, Domoina strengthened in the Mozambique channel to peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). On January28, the storm made landfall in southern Mozambique, and slowly weakened over land. Domoina <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Swaziland and later eastern South Africa before dissipating on February2.|$|E
5|$|M-218 {{began at}} a {{junction}} with I-96 in Wixom. From there, the road traveled north via Wixom Road to present-day Pontiac Trail (which {{at the time}} was 14 Mile Road) and continued northeast. The trunkline then continued along Pontiac Trail, meandering through the communities of Walled Lake, Orchard Lake Village, Keego Harbor and Sylvan Lake in Oakland County's lake country. Northeast of Sylvan lake, the highway crossed US10 (Telegraph Road) and <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Pontiac. M-218 terminated at a junction with Bus. US10 in downtown.|$|E

5|$|Michael's cousin, Dan, then laid {{claim to}} Wallachia. Many of Michael's boyars (including the {{influential}} Albul and Utmeș) defected to the pretender. Dan <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Wallachia in early 1420. Initially, Michael {{was able to}} resist, but since {{he had failed to}} implement all provisions of his 1419 treaty with the Ottoman Empire, his cousin was able to obtain military assistance from the Ottomans. Michael received support from Hungary, but their united forces were routed in the summer of 1420. Michael was killed on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|PA 112 {{went through}} the {{community}} of Thornton, intersecting with Glen Mills Road. At an intersection with Thornton Road, the route <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Chester County, but left quickly for Delaware County again. North {{of the community of}} Cheyney, Route 112 crossed the county line, passing the Cheyney University of Pennsylvania before the terminus at an intersection with Pennsylvania Route 926 in the Chester County community of Tanguy.|$|E
5|$|Pierlot and Spaak, {{together}} with Pierlot's family, <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Francoist Spain with an official visa, but {{were arrested in}} Barcelona and held under house arrest in a hotel. On 18 October, they escaped from confinement and headed for Portugal where the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, although neutral, was more sympathetic to the Allied cause than Spain. They finally arrived in London on 22 October.|$|E
50|$|The Clear Fork {{rises in}} Bell County, Kentucky, {{just north of}} the Tennessee state line. It flows west-southwest, <b>crossing</b> <b>into</b> Claiborne County, Tennessee, and passing the village of Clairfield.

5|$|The 1957 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a moderately active {{year in which}} 13 tropical cyclones formed. The {{hurricane season}} ran through {{the summer and fall}} months which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone developed on July 15. The final storm dissipated on December 6, becoming one of the few Pacific storms to exist outside of the seasonal dates. Of the season's 13 storms, five of these formed or <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the central Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The now-common trope {{of dinosaurs}} {{existing}} in isolated locations in today's world {{appeared at the}} same time, with Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 book The Lost World and the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs as pioneers. The Lost World <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the movies in 1925, setting heights for special effects and attempts at scientific accuracy. It is unusual, even today, for attempting to portray dinosaurs as something other than monsters that spent their lives in combat.|$|E
5|$|The storm then {{crossed the}} Tennessee state line at 8:28p.m. EDT (0028 UTC), {{and moved into}} Hamilton County, Tennessee, {{striking}} {{the small town of}} Apison at high-end EF4 strength, where multiple large homes were leveled or swept away, 150 others were damaged, and thousands of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado then <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> Bradley County at low-end EF4 strength, moving across the southern and eastern fringes of Cleveland and affecting mainly residential areas, though a few businesses were damaged or destroyed as well. Subdivisions {{in the southern part of}} the city sustained major damage, with numerous houses destroyed and a few that were leveled. Four people were killed in Cleveland, and many others were injured. Several trees were felled in Polk County (as the tornado had weakened to EF1-strength), before the tornado <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> McMinn County. The tornado re-strengthened to an EF2 and destroyed two houses and a mobile home before lifting south of Athens.|$|E

5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat of the Senators when he <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat got up from the ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E
5|$|While at peak intensity, Jery began {{turning to}} the south, due to {{reaching}} {{the western edge of}} a ridge. An approaching trough increased wind shear over the storm, causing the convection to diminish and expose the center. Late on April10 it weakened below tropical cyclone status, and the next day Jery became extratropical. Shortly thereafter the remnants <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the Australian region, dissipating on April13.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave located {{over the}} open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became exposed. The cyclone <b>crossed</b> <b>into</b> the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. The proximity of Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.|$|E
