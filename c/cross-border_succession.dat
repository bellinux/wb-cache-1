40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gather information about the last habitual residence (LHR) of the deceased in the context of the upcoming EU Succession Regulation. In addition, the aim was to analyze the adequacy of the legally undefined LHR as the principal connecting factor in <b>cross-border</b> <b>succession</b> within the EU. This study was carried out as a part of a bachelor thesis conducted on the same subject. The data were collected from relevant jurisprudence, international law, national acts, the EU published materials and case law. These results suggest that the legally undefined LHR is an unstable connecting factor for the purposes of the Succession Regulation, since it cannot guarantee sufficient legal certainty, and hence, the EU citizens are not able to fully utilize their right to free movement. The findings indicate that there might be a need to amend a legal definition for the LHR, not only for the EU Member States to be able to apply the concept in an harmonized way, but also for the EU citizens to know whether they are considered habitually resident in a state or not...|$|E
40|$|Since 17 August 2015, the Succession Regulation is {{applicable}} in the European Member States, establishing uniform rules on the jurisdiction and applicable law for <b>cross-border</b> <b>successions.</b> The Succession Regulation also introduces a European Certificate of Succession, allowing heirs, legatees, administrators {{of the estate}} and executors of wills to prove their legal capacity and rights in another Member State. As such, the European Certificate of Succession offers a supranational alternative to national instruments with a similar purpose which exist in many Member States, but often do not produce their full effects abroad. In general, the European Certificate of Succession's legal regime is comprehensive and practical, especially as regards its content and procedural aspects. Nevertheless, there remain a few fundamental conceptual lacunae. In particular, it is unclear {{to what extent the}} European Certificate of Succession can give rise to registration in the Member States' land registers, as well as how the European Certificate and the corresponding national instruments relate to each other. The aim of the research project is to develop a conceptual framework for these lacunae. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in the number of <b>cross-border</b> <b>successions,</b> it has become more and more important to provide a uniform regulation, at a European level, of international private law in the field of successions. At the same time, this phenomenon has widen the differences existing among the national rules, where - especially in the civil law tradition - the plurality of the instruments for proving the quality of heir is already known. Just to give a few examples, the German Erbschein and the French acte de notoriété can be recalled; besides, few legal systems - such as Italy - do not know a general instrument certifying the quality of heir. The Regulation 650 / 12 /EU has been enforced to fulfill such needs. In particular, the above said Regulation institutes the European Certificate of Succession, which aims to become a preferential proof of the quality of heir. The Regulation 650 / 12 /EU outlines detailed rules, covering its effects - with limited value of presumption -, its issue, contents and circulation. In conclusion, the European Certificate of Succession is a new instrument, and its achievement will be the simplification of the transfer of assets by reason of death; moreover, it will also implement the protection of third parties contracting with the alleged heirs and the legatees of the assets. Such instrument will have an expansive power in the Italian legal system, with the effect that the application of the Certificate of Succession already existing in the districts covered by the ‘libro fondiario’ recording system could be extended to the rest of the country...|$|R
