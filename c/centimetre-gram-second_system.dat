5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the <b>centimetre–gram–second</b> <b>system</b> of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} {{published}} in 1960 {{as a result of}} an initiative that began in 1948.

SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E

50|$|The erg is a unit {{of energy}} and work equal to 10−7 joules. It {{originated}} in the <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> (CGS) <b>system</b> of units. It has the symbol erg. The erg is not an SI unit. Its name is derived from ergon (’έργον) a Greek word meaning work or task.|$|R
500|$|In 1837 {{the metric}} system was re-adopted by France, and also {{during the first}} half of the 19th century was adopted by the {{scientific}} community. In the middle of the century, James Clerk Maxwell put forward the concept of a coherent system where a small number of units of measure were defined as base units, and all other units of measure, called derived units, were defined in terms of the base units. Maxwell proposed three base units: length, mass and time. This concept worked well with [...] mechanics, but attempts to describe electromagnetic forces in terms of these units encountered difficulties. By the end of the 19th century, four principal variants of the metric system were in use for the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena: three based on the <b>centimetre–gram–second</b> <b>system</b> of units (CGS system), and one on the metre-kilogram-second system of units (MKS system). This impasse was resolved by Giovanni Giorgi, who in 1901 proved that a coherent system that incorporated electromagnetic units had to have an electromagnetic unit as a fourth base unit.|$|E

2500|$|Gaussian {{units are}} a popular {{system of units}} {{that are part of}} the <b>centimetre–gram–second</b> <b>system</b> of units (cgs).

5000|$|A {{centimetre}} (international spelling as {{used by the}} International Bureau of Weights and Measures; symbol cm) or centimeter (American spelling) is a unit {{of length}} in the metric system, equal to one hundredth of a metre, centi being the SI prefix for a factor of [...] The centimetre was the base unit of length in the now deprecated <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> (CGS) <b>system</b> of units.|$|R
5000|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI {{from the}} French {{language}} name Système International d'Unités) is the modern {{revision of the}} metric system. It is the world's most widely used system of units, both in everyday commerce and in science. The SI was developed in 1960 from the metre-kilogram-second (MKS) system, rather than the <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> (CGS) <b>system,</b> which, in turn, had many variants.

50|$|The oersted (symbol Oe) is {{the unit}} of the {{auxiliary}} magnetic field H in the <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> <b>system</b> of units (CGS). It is equivalent to 1 dyne per maxwell.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>Centimetre-gram-second</b> <b>system</b> of units, {{the basic}} {{unit of length}} is the centimetre, or 1/100 of a metre.Other non-SI units are derived from decimal {{multiples}} of the metre.|$|E

50|$|When {{the pound}} {{is used as}} a unit of mass, the core of the {{coherent}} system is similar and functionally equivalent to the corresponding subsets of the International System of Units (SI), using metre, kilogram and second (MKS), and the earlier <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> <b>system</b> of units (CGS).|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{centimetre}}-gram-second</b> <b>system</b> {{of units}} (abbreviated CGS or cgs) is {{a variant of}} the metric system based on the centimetre as the unit of length, the gram as the unit of mass, and the second as the unit of time. All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover electromagnetism.|$|E
50|$|The gram was the {{fundamental}} {{unit of mass}} in the 19th-century <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> <b>system</b> of units (CGS). The CGS system co-existed with the MKS system of units, first proposed in 1901, {{during much of the}} 20th century, but the gram has been displaced by the kilogram as {{the fundamental}} unit for mass when the MKS system was chosen for the SI base units in 1960.|$|E
50|$|The ampere was {{originally}} defined as one {{tenth of the}} unit of electric current in the <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> <b>system</b> of units. That unit, {{now known as the}} abampere, was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two dynes per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart. The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the MKSA system would be conveniently sized.|$|E

5000|$|The metre-tonne-second or MTS {{system of}} units is a system of {{physical}} units. It was invented in France, hence the unit names sthène and pièze, and became its legal system between 1919 and 1961 ("décret" [...] 5 May 1961, [...] "Journal Officiel"). It {{was adopted by the}} Soviet Union in 1933 and abolished there in 1955. It was a metric and coherent {{system of units}}, much as SI and the <b>centimetre-gram-second</b> <b>system</b> (CGS), but with larger units for industrial use, whereas the CGS system was regarded as suitable for laboratory use only.|$|E
5000|$|The Electrostatic and Electromagnetic {{systems are}} derived from units of length and force, mainly. As such, these are ready {{extensions}} of any system of containing length, mass, time.

Because of this, the standards of the CGS system were gradually replaced with metric standards incorporated from the MKS system. The exact list of units used in the MKS system changed over time. It incorporated base units other than the metre, kilogram, and second in addition to derived units. An incomplete list of the base and derived units appears below. Since the MKS system of units never had a governing body to rule on a standard definition, the list of units depended on different conventions at different times.|$|E
