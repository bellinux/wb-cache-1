5000|$|The lower powered {{engines in}} the {{commercial}} [...] "Pro" [...] series had a lower compression, a mechanically timed ignition rather than the breakerless setup found in the passenger cars, and a manual choke. The ER had five crankshaft bearings and the overhead camshaft was driven by a <b>cogged</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{originally}} {{designed for the}} Lycoming O-320 {{a number of people}} have successfully fitted auto (car) engines. The picture is of one such conversion in New Zealand which has been successfully flying for 250 hours as of March 2009 using a Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 engine driving a Dave Blanton designed <b>cogged</b> <b>belt</b> PSRU. This aircraft is also fitted with electric retractable landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|... 4A91's DOHC {{camshafts}} {{are driven}} by a single-stage roller chain of 8.0 mm (0.3 in) pitch and 12.5 mm (0.5 in) width, instead of the previous 4G15's <b>cogged</b> <b>belt</b> drive. Camshafts act directly on bucket-type tappets. The intake camshaft is fitted with a continuously variable cam-phasing, altering timing up to 50 degrees. Valves are inclined at an included angle of 34 degrees versus the 4G15's wider 45 degrees.|$|E
50|$|Microlight {{aircraft}} {{driven by}} high-speed two-stroke engines {{such as the}} Rotax 532 use toothed belt reduction drives to allow {{the use of a}} quieter and more efficient slower-speed propeller. Some amateur-built airplanes powered by automotive engines use <b>cog</b> <b>belt</b> reduction drive units.|$|R
50|$|Timing <b>belts,</b> toothed <b>belts,</b> <b>cogged</b> or <b>cog</b> <b>belts,</b> and {{synchronous}} belts are non-slipping {{mechanical drive}} belts. They are made as flexible belts with teeth moulded onto their inner surface. The belts run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. When correctly tensioned, {{these type of}} belts have no slippage, and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used in lieu of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.|$|R
25|$|Both the 2702 and 2703 use {{free air}} or fan cooling, with Bing 34mm slide carburetors. The {{cylinder}} walls are electrochemically coated with Nikasil. Standard starting is recoil start. Reduction drive systems available are the G-50 gearbox with reduction ratios of 2.16:1, 2.29:1, 2.59:1, 3.16:1, or 3.65:1, or a multi-element <b>cog</b> <b>belt</b> drive. A tuned exhaust and electric start are optional.|$|R
5000|$|For 1963, Coventry Climax {{was able}} to {{convince}} Lucas to supply the <b>cogged</b> <b>belt</b> driven fuel injection system originally developed for BRM with then-unique sliding throttle plates with four round intake bores cut out. With the larger bore (from 63 mm to 68 mm) and shorter stroke (60 mm to 51.5 mm) compared to Mk.II, notable changes include the increase in conrod length (from 4.2" [...] to 5.1" [...] center to center, with a shorter piston crown height) and the switch from crossplane to flatplane crankshaft, which surprisingly did not increase vibration in the higher RPM range because the longer conrod length counteracted the increase in secondary vibration inherent in flatplane design.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was built}} from 1991 to 1997. From 1991 to 1993, it used tuned {{multi-port}} fuel injection, made 200-210 hp (150-160 kW) at 5200 rpm and 215 lbft Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. From 1994 to 1997, it used sequential port fuel injection, making [...] at 5200 rpm and 215 lbft Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. In 1996, the heads were redesigned for better flow {{as well as}} now making the engine an interference design and adapting the engine for federally mandated OBDII emissions. Output for the 1996-1997 LQ1 is [...] and 220 lbft Nm. It had four large valves per cylinder. The 3.4 L engine used a <b>cogged</b> <b>belt</b> to drive the four overhead camshafts and a chain to drive the intermediate shaft, which is mounted in the same slot where the camshaft would go in {{on any of the}} pushrod engines in the 60-degree family. Adapting a pushrod block for the LQ1's overhead cams was difficult, and the 60° angle made this a very tall engine. The power output for this engine was impressive during its time; however, this engine has never been well liked by auto mechanics, as important maintenance such as spark plug and timing belt changes is very troublesome, especially on later models. Spark plug changes for the three rear cylinders are thought by some to require removing the upper intake manifold when performed as directed by factory service manual, and timing belt changes have a labor rate of 5 hours as opposed to 2-3 for a typical belt-driven engine. In fact, cylinders 1, 3, and 5 spark plugs can be changed by removing the crosswise stabilizer bar from atop strut towers, and using proper socket extensions and a mirror. Timing belt procedure has been posted to You Tube with some labor-saving tips.|$|E
50|$|The 230 is a {{conventional}} single-cylinder engine that weighs only 36 lb in its A20 version. The engine features single capacitor discharge ignition, piston porting, tuned exhaust system, slide venturi-type carburetor, fuel pump, a cast iron cylinder liner, ball, needle and roller bearings throughout. The engine was offered with <b>cog</b> <b>belt</b> drive or a gearbox reduction system. Starting is electric starter or recoil starter.|$|R
50|$|The SC 430 is {{a unique}} three {{cylinder}} radial engine that is very compact and lightweight at only 17 kg. The engine features single capacitor discharge ignition, a single Bing 49 diaphragm type carburetor and rotary valve induction. It is currently offered without a reduction drive, although when Zanzottera built it a 1.75:1 <b>cog</b> <b>belt</b> reduction drive was available. Starting is electric starter only and a recoil starter is not an option.|$|R
50|$|The damper will {{be fitted}} {{at the front}} of the engine (opposite the clutch or transmission) just beyond the cover of the timing chain, gears, or belt, and behind the {{accessory}} drive pulley (which may carry one or more V, serpentine or <b>cogged</b> <b>belts.</b> In older vehicles the pulley and damper were separate units that were bolted together. In late model vehicles the two have been combined into one unit. Timing marks are almost always engraved for purposes of setting the ignition timing.|$|R
50|$|The last sets Kenner {{made before}} they sold to General Mills were the Girdermatic sets, {{which seemed to}} be based on {{mechanical}} structures, rather than buildings. These sets introduced many new parts that are unique to Girdermatic sets, including a new green colored motor and battery controller, round platforms, <b>cog</b> <b>belts,</b> truss assemblies, giant beams, and Ferris wheel rings, with which you could build moving cranes, observation towers, several different types of bridges, industrial plants and mills with conveyors, and amusement rides such as a Ferris Wheel, Incline ride and Whirling swing.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} part of a {{bachelor}} thesis implemented at Saab training systems AB in Huskvarna. It treats the concept development of the driveline on Moving infantry target, MIT. Today Saab has a problem in the shape of that their customers uses the wrong moment when tightening the <b>cog</b> <b>belt</b> of the driveline. As a consequence the <b>cog</b> <b>belt</b> has a high risk of snapping if it is too tight or pluck off if it is too loose. Thereto the electrical motors used in the MIT has gone out of production. The task boiled down to produce a number of proposals that improves the chucking or driveline solution together with finding a new electrical motor to replace the outdated one. A concept study was made containing detailed examinations together with Saab. To answer the problems questions, several product development methods were used, like Quality function deployment and Pugh’s matrix, to reach a final concept. The last concepts were modeled in a 3 D-program for an easier comparison between their feasibility. The chosen solution consisted of two motors that via a gearing actuates the respective axle. By replacing the belt drive and choosing more lubrication free gears the maintenance is expected to be improved. In addition the product price is lowered by careful choices of components. The production of a prototype could not be implemented due to lack of time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{seeks to}} {{increase}} interest level on energy efficiency by bringing to fore payback-period assessment of implementing energy-efficient measures {{that could help}} achieve sustainable production processes in a typical medium scale printing manufacturing industry in Lagos, Nigeria. Several energy efficiency measures have been suggested based on identifiable energy management opportunities within this industry. The method used for the economic evaluation and feasibility study is payback period; this approach is aimed at providing guidance for a quick and informed decision on {{the implementation of the}} energy efficiency measures identified. The payback for two of these measures namely; turning off equipment when not in use and replacement of drive belts on large motors with energy efficient <b>cog</b> <b>belts,</b> {{have been found to be}} immediate. When standard fluorescent lighting and incandescent bulbs are replaced with energy efficient lamps and bank of capacitors are installed to improve the power factor of the motors, the company will recoup its initial investment in less than one year. Also, purchasing and installing an advanced electronic meter with data logging capability to help monitor electrical demand has been shown to give the highest payback of 2. 4 years. These payback period results have indicated that investment in the recommended energy efficient technologies are economically viable and worthy of implementation. With this analysis, management of manufacturing industries can now make informed economic decision towards productivity improvement and sustainability...|$|R
25|$|The Challenger {{ultralight}} {{is a high}} wing, tricycle gear kit aircraft with a {{frame structure}} built from 6061-T6 aluminum alloy tubing fastened with aircraft grade AN bolts and rivets and covered with either presewn Dacron envelopes or standard aircraft fabric. The engine is mounted in pusher configuration and turns the propeller through a reduction drive that uses a <b>cogged</b> tooth rubber <b>belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Pontiac's single {{camshaft}} {{was supported}} by journals within the aluminum valve cover; no separate bearing shells were used. The cam was driven by a noise-reducing fiberglass-reinforced <b>cogged</b> rubber <b>belt</b> {{instead of the usual}} metal chain or gears. Valves were opened with finger followers (centered under the cam) that pivoted at one end on stationary hydraulic adjusters. The oil pump, distributor, and fuel pump were driven by an external jackshaft powered by a rubber timing belt nestled within an aluminum housing bolted to {{the right side of the}} block. The head had a single port face with both exhaust and intake valves on the left side and valve stems strongly tilted towards the left. This engine was used in the 1966-67 Tempest and Le Mans and 1967 Firebird.|$|R
5000|$|Timing belts (also {{known as}} toothed, notch, <b>cog,</b> or {{synchronous}} <b>belts)</b> are a positive transfer belt and can track relative movement. These belts have teeth that {{fit into a}} matching toothed pulley. When correctly tensioned, they have no slippage, run at constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used instead of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary. Camshafts of automobiles, miniature timing systems, and stepper motors often utilize these belts. Timing belts need the least tension of all belts and {{are among the most}} efficient. They can bear up to [...] at speeds of [...]|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{transport}} studies incorporating {{radio frequency}} identification (RFID) tracers are becoming a key component in understanding sediment transport dynamics due to the data they provide on spatial and temporal variability. This technique involves inserting small glass cylindrical transponders into stones then seeding those stones in the river bed. Existing methods of using RFID tracers involve either manually sweeping the channel bed after a hydrologic event or placing a series of fixed antennas along the channel to detect when sediment containing a RFID tracer passes that point. The first method is limited {{because it does not}} correlate the hydrodynamic conditions with the movement of the sediment, while the second method is limited by spatial resolution afforded by the fixed antennas. The goal of this research is to develop a flume with the capacity to accurately measure sediment inputs, transport, and export in real time. This is accomplished by automating the sediment supply, using a sediment trap with a light table to monitor sediment leaving the flume, and implementing an RFID sediment tracking system to provide real time tracking of the movement of individual clasts over the course of an experiment. A tilting flume with sediment supply and capture systems was designed and built with an integrated RFID tracking system to enable sediment transport experiments to be conducted in the flume while continuously tracking the position of RFID tagged sediment. The RFID tracking system, located under the floor of the flume, consists of a carriage containing the antennas, tuners, multiplexing RFID readers, batteries, and rollers to enable the carriage to roll along the flanges of the beam supporting the flume. The carriage is transported back and forth the length of the flume using <b>cogged</b> <b>belts</b> and pulleys powered by a DC motor and controlled by a PLC with limit switches. The identification of RFID tags detected by the carriage is transmitted Bluetooth to a stationary computer that also receives carriage position information from a laser range finder. Validation tests were conducted with vertically oriented RFID tags to establish the detection range and accuracy of estimating RFID tag positions. When no steel cross members were present, an RFID tag could be detected up to 21 cm above the flume floor with streamwise position estimation accurate within 1 cm. When steel cross members or multiple RFID tags were present, the detection range and position estimation accuracy decreased. Further refinement to this technique could be achieve by experimenting with different antenna designs which may provide a larger detection range and by using different type of PIT tags to enable tracking of smaller sized sediment. The developed flume and tracking system will allow us to obtain new and better information about sediment transport which should improve fundamental understanding and aid in the design of channel restoration projects...|$|R
60|$|The {{noise in}} the weaving rooms was deafening, the heat oppressive. She began to wonder how these men and women, boys and girls bore the strain all day long. She had never thought much about them before save to compare vaguely their {{drudgery}} with that from which now she had been emancipated; but {{she began to feel}} a new respect, a new concern, a new curiosity and interest as she watched them passing from place to place with indifference between the whirling belts, up and down the narrow aisles, flanked on either side by that bewildering, clattering machinery whose polished surfaces continually caught and flung back the light of the electric bulbs on the ceiling. How was it possible to live {{for hours at a time}} in this bedlam without losing presence of mind and thrusting hand or body in the wrong place, or becoming deaf? She had never before realized what mill work meant, though she had read of the accidents. But these people--even the children--seemed oblivious to the din and the danger, intent on their tasks, unconscious of the presence of a visitor, save occasionally when she caught a swift glance from a woman or girl a glance, perhaps, of envy or even of hostility. The dark, foreign faces glowed, and instantly grew dull again, and then she was aware of lurking terrors, despite her exaltation, her sense now of belonging to another world, a world somehow associated with Ditmar. Was it not he who had lifted her farther above all this? Was it not by grace of her association with him she was there, a spectator of the toil beneath? Yet the terror persisted. She, presently, would step out of the noise, the oppressive moist heat of the drawing and spinning rooms, the constant, remorseless menace of whirling wheels and <b>cogs</b> and <b>belts.</b> But they?... She drew closer to Caldwell's side.|$|R
