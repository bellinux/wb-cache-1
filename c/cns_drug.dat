40|$|Helminthiasis {{becomes a}} global health issue in {{developing}} countries. They {{are the most}} common infectious agents of humans and produce a global burden of disease compared to malaria and tuberculosis. Commonly prescribed drug for clinical management of helminths infestation is Albendazole, but this drug exert some potential toxicity in the individuals upon usage. Hence there is a need foran alternative medicine in particular. Traditional medicinal system like Siddha are known for clinically effective against helminth infections and also devoid of adverse event. Siddha system of medicine become popular throughout the world in recent days as it claims high curative value with minimum toxicity and have less side effects. The present research work aimed at evaluating the in-vitro anthelmintic activity of the formulation ChitramuttiNei (CN) using Indian adult earthworm and also to investigate the bioactive phytocomponents present in the formulation using GCMS analysis. The result of GCMS analysis reveals the presence of most significant phytocomponents like Stigmasterol, Oleic acid, n-Hexadecanoic acid etc. The results of In-vitroanthelmintic activity of CN clearly shown that the maximum time taken for the test <b>drug</b> <b>CN</b> at the dose of 10 gm to cause death of worms is about 303. 3 ± 6. 89 mins, similarly the time taken of CN at the dose of 20 gm would be 260. 5 ± 20. 16 mins for standard drug albendazole it was 88 ± 7. 30 mins at the concentration of 100 mg/ml.

40|$|Research in {{the field}} of nano-neuroscience is {{becoming}} a promising future direction given the advantages presented by nanosystems for central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>drug</b> delivery. Since the blood–brain barrier (BBB) represents an invincible obstacle for the majority of drugs such as antineoplastic agents and a variety of psychoactive drugs such as neuropeptides, “smart” <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> delivery systems with high ability to deliver substances across the BBB are highly desired and will not only enable drugs to reach the CNS but also target specific areas of the CNS. Thus, injectable biodegradable nanoparticles have an important potential application in the treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, in the following, we will highlight the requirement and importance of <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> delivery systems with particular emphasis on nano-scale systems.

Prodrugs are bioreversible derivatives of drug molecules that must undergo an enzymatic and/or chemical transformation in vivo to release the active parent drug, which subsequently exerts the desired pharmacological effect. In both drug discovery and drug development, prodrugs have become an established tool for improving physicochemical, biopharmaceutical or pharmacokinetic properties of pharmacologically active agents that overcome barriers to a drug’s usefulness.

40|$|Summary: The {{worldwide}} {{market for}} therapies for CNS dis-orders {{is worth more}} than $ 50 billion and is set to grow sub-stantially in the years ahead. This is because: 1) the incidence of many CNS disorders (e. g., Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease) increase exponentially after age 65 and 2) {{the number of people in}} the world over 65 is about to increase sharply because of a marked rise in fertility after World War II. However, CNS research and development are associated with significant challenges: it takes longer to get a <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> to market (12 – 16 years) compared with a non-CNS drug (10 – 12 years) and there is a higher attrition rate for <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> candi-dates than for non-CNS drug candidates. This is attributable to a variety of factors, including the complexity of the brain, the liability of CNS drugs to cause CNS side effects, and the requirement of CNS drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This review focuses on BBB penetration, along with pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, in the process of the discovery and development of safe and effective medicines for CNS disorders.

40|$|CYP 2 D 6 {{substrate}} {{status is}} a critical Go/No Go decision criteria in central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>drug</b> discovery efforts because the polymorphic nature of CYP 2 D 6 can lead to variable patient safety and drug efficacy. In addition, CYP 2 D 6 is disproportionately involved in the metabolism of CNS drugs compared with other drug classes. Therefore, identifying trends in small molecule properties of CNS-penetrant compounds that can help discriminate potential CYP 2 D 6 substrates from nonsubstrates would allow additional prioritization in the synthesis and biological evaluation of new therapeutic candidates. We report here {{the conversion of the}} <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> minaprine from substrate to nonsubstrate, as well as the conversion of the related <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> minozac from nonsubstrate to substrate, through the use of analog synthesis and CYP 2 D 6 enzyme kinetic analyses. No single molecular property strongly correlated with substrate status for this 3 -amino- 4 -methyl- 6 -phenylpyridazine scaffold, although molecular volume and charge appeared to be indirectly related. A parsed database of CYP 2 D 6 substrates across diverse chemical structures was assembled and analyzed for physical property trends correlating with substrate status. We found that a complex interplay of properties influenced CYP 2 D 6 substrate status and that the particular chemical scaffold affects which properties are most prominent. The results also identified an unexpected issue in <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> discovery, in that some property trends correlative with CYP 2 D 6 substrates overlap previously reported properties that correlate with CNS penetrance. These results suggest the need for a careful balance in the design and synthesis of new CNS therapeutic candidates to avoid CYP 2 D 6 substrate status while maintaining CNS penetrance...|$|E
30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of CNS drugs depends on drug penetration through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) between the blood capillaries and brain tissue, {{the extent of}} distribution of the drug in the brain, and the drug activities on the targets. These multiple factors increase the complexity of <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> discovery [72]. The main parameter of interest is the unbound brain concentration (Cu,b) of the drug. The Cu,b can be {{directly related to the}} drug concentration at the target site and thus to in vivo drug efficacy. Receptor occupancy is also very important experimental descriptor for evaluating target engagement by the examined drug. Total brain concentration (Cb) is only used as measure of the nonspecific binding of the drug to brain [73, 74]. The development of quantitative structure-exposure relationships between molecular parameters of drugs and experimental parameters of their brain exposure is now a valuable tool for predicting <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> efficacy [74, 75].|$|E
30|$|CNS {{drugs were}} 20.50 and 19.95  % of {{administered}} medications and interacting drugs, respectively. These medications are frequently {{used to control}} seizures, pain, and anxiety and to treat delirium, depression, and psychotic symptoms in ICU settings [26]. A conducted study in a mixed ICU showed that 40  % of the pDDIs were associated to drugs acting on CNS [27]. In the current study, 14.67  % of D and/or X pDDIs with reliability ratings of E and/or G were related to these agents as a precipitant drug. Carbamazepine was the most frequent <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> that interacted with CYP 3 A substrates (such as phenytoin, clonazepam, and warfarin). Monitoring the therapeutic effects of object drugs and considering an alternative medication (if possible) are recommended as appropriate interventions [28].

40|$|Clinical {{translation}} of BCRP inhibitors have failed due to neurotoxicity and novel approaches {{are required to}} identify suitable modulators of BCRP to enhance <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> delivery. In this study we examine 18 compounds, primarily phytochemicals, as potential novel modulators of AhR-mediated regulation of BCRP expression and function in immortalised and primary porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells as a mechanism to enhance <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> delivery. The majority of modulators possessed a cellular viability IC 50 > 100 µM in both cell systems. BCRP activity, when exposed to modulators for 1 hour, was diminished for most modulators through significant increases in H 33342 accumulation at < 10 µM with 2, 6, 4 -trimethoflavone increasing H 33342 intracellular accumulation by 3. 7 – 6. 6 fold over 1 – 100 µM. Western blotting and qPCR identified two inducers of BCRP (quercetin and naringin) and two down-regulators (17 -β-estradiol and curcumin) with associated changes in BCRP efflux transport function further confirmed in both cell lines. siRNA downregulation of AhR resulted in a 1. 75 ± 0. 08 fold change in BCRP expression, confirming the role of AhR in the regulation of BCRP. These findings establish the regulatory role AhR of in controlling BCRP expression at the BBB and confirm quercetin, naringin, 17 -β-estradiol, and curcumin as novel inducers and down-regulators of BCRP gene, protein expression and functional transporter activity and hence potential novel target sites and candidates for enhancing <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> delivery...|$|E
40|$|The {{last two}} decades have brought a {{significant}} increase in our understanding of glial biology and glial contribution to CNS disease. Yet, despite the fact that glial cells make up the majority of CNS cells, no drug specifically targeting glial cells is on the market. Given the long development times of CNS drugs, on average over 12 years, this is not completely surprising. However, there is increasing interest from academia and industry to exploit glial targets to develop drugs for the benefit of patients with currently limited or no therapeutic options. <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> development has a high attrition rate and has encountered many challenges. It seems unlikely that developing drugs against glial targets would be any less demanding. However, the knowledge generated in traditional <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> discovery teaches valuable lessons, which could enable the glial community to accelerate the cycle time from basic discovery to drug development.

40|$|Summary: The {{blood-brain barrier}} (BBB) is {{formed by the}} brain {{capillary}} endothelium and excludes from the brain ∼ 100 % of large-molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98 % of all small-molecule drugs. Despite {{the importance of the}} BBB to the neurotherapeutics mission, the BBB receives insufficient attention in either academic neuroscience or industry programs. The combination of so little effort in developing solutions to the BBB problem, and the minimal BBB transport of the majority of all potential CNS drugs, leads predictably to the present situation in neurotherapeutics, which is that there are few effective treatments for the majority of CNS disorders. This situation can be reversed by an accelerated effort to develop a knowledge base in the fundamental transport properties of the BBB, and the molecular and cellular biology of the brain capillary endothelium. This provides the platform for <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> delivery programs, which should be developed in parallel with traditional <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> discovery efforts in the molecular neurosciences...|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} physicochemical factors for <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> penetration in brain and for efficacy are optimal lipophilicity, hydrogen bonding, aqueous solubility, pKa, and molecular weight of agents. Moderate lipophilicity of CNS drugs at physiological pH [cLogP: 2 – 5, cLogD (pH 7.4): 2 – 5] facilitate transport through BBB [76], while higher lipophilicity increase plasma protein binding, decrease solubility in plasma, and rise metabolic and toxicity {{risks of the}} agents [77].|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is the major area that is {{affected}} by aging. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), brain cancer, and stroke are the CNS diseases that will cost trillions of dollars for their treatment. Achievement of appropriate blood−brain barrier (BBB) pene-tration is often considered a significant hurdle in the <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> discovery process. On the other hand, BBB penetration may be a liability {{for many of the}} non-CNS drug targets, and a clear understanding of the physicochemical and structural differences between CNS and non-CNS drugs may assist both research areas. Because of the numerous and challenging issues in <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> discovery and the low success rates, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to deprioritize their drug discovery efforts in the CNS arena. Prompted by these challenges and to aid in the design of high-quality, efficacious CNS compounds, we analyzed the physicochemical property and the chemical structural profiles of 317 CNS and 626 non-CNS oral drugs. The conclusions derived provide an ideal property profile for lead selection and the property modification strategy during the lead optimization process. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFunctional MRI {{studies have}} helped to {{elucidate}} underlying mechanisms in complex neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Disease processes often involve complex large-scale network interactions, extending beyond the presumed main disease focus. Given both {{the complexity of the}} clinical phenotype and the underlying dysfunctional brain circuits, so called pharmaco-fMRI (ph-MRI) studies probe pharmacological effects on functional neuro-anatomy, and can help to determine early treatment response, mechanisms of drug efficacy and side effects, and potentially advance <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> development. In this review, we discuss recent ph-MRI research in three major neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and associated network alterations, namely selective serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors in affective disorders and emotional processing circuits; antiepileptic drugs in epilepsy and cognitive networks; and stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and networks of attention control. We conclude that ph-MRI studies show consistent and reproducible changes on disease relevant networks, and prove sensitive to early pharmacological effects on functional anatomy associated with disease. Further <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> research and development would benefit greatly from improved disease phenotyping, or biomarkers, using advanced imaging techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} {{and development of}} central nervous system (CNS) drugs is an extremely challenging process requiring large resources, timelines, and associated costs. The high risk of failure leads {{to high levels of}} risk. Over the past couple of decades PET imaging has become a central component of the CNS drug-development process, enabling decision-making in phase I studies, where early discharge of risk provides increased confidence to progress a candidate to more costly later phase testing at the right dose level or alternatively to kill a compound through failure to meet key criteria. The so called " 3 pillars" of drug survival, namely; tissue exposure, target engagement, and pharmacologic activity, are particularly well suited for evaluation by PET imaging. This review introduces the process of <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> development before considering how PET imaging of the " 3 pillars" has advanced to provide valuable tools for decision-making on the critical path of <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> development.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in {{central nervous system}} (<b>CNS)</b> <b>drug</b> research {{is to develop a}} generally applicable methodology for repeated measurements of drug effects on the entire CNS, without task-related interactions and a priori models. For this reason, data-driven resting-state fMRI methods are promising for pharmacological research. This study aimed to investigate whether different psychoactive substances cause drug-specific effects in functional brain connectivity during resting-state. In this double blind placebo-controlled (double dummy) crossover study, seven resting-state fMRI scans were obtained in 12 healthy young men in three different drug sessions (placebo, morphine and alcohol; randomized). Drugs were administered intravenously based on validated pharmacokinetic protocols to minimize the inter- and intra-subject variance in plasma drug concentrations. Dual-regression was used to estimate whole-brain resting-state connectivity in relation to eight well-characterized resting-state networks, for each data set. A mixed effects analysis of drug by time interactions revealed dissociable changes in both pharmacodynamics and functional connectivity resulting from alcohol and morphine. Post hoc analysis of regions of interest revealed adaptive network interactions in relation to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic curves. Our results illustrate the applicability of resting-state functional brain connectivity in <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> research. Hum Brain Map...|$|E
40|$|Brain is a {{delicate}} organ, isolated from general circulation and characterized {{by the presence of}} relatively impermeable endothelial cells with tight junctions, enzymatic activity and the presence of active efflux transporter mechanisms. These formidable obstacles often block drug delivery to the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Although several promising molecules have the potential in the in vitro settings but lack of in vivo response is probably because the molecule cannot reach the brain in a sufficient concentration. Drug delivery across the BBB is a major limitation in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and CNS infections. This review deals with the role of nanobiotechnology in <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> delivery, in which three categories of carbon nanotubes, nanowires and nanoparticles (NPs) are explained. The small size of the NPs makes them an ideal choice to penetrate the BBB. Several mechanisms are involved in this process and various strategies are used.

40|$|The World Health Organizationpredicts {{that central}} nervoussystem (CNS) {{disorders}} {{will become the}} major medical need of the 21 st Century. There are two major dri-vers behind this: 1) the incidence of many CNS disorders (e. g., Alzhei-mers disease, stroke and Parkinsons disease) increases exponentially after age 65 and 2) {{the number of people}} in the world over 65 is about to increase sharply because of a marked rise in fertility after World War II. 1 The need for effective CNS medicines is there-fore increasing sharply. CNS is already the fastest growing therapeutic seg-ment of the pharmaceutical market, with sales in excess of $ 50 billion. Many of the top-selling drugs are in the CNS segment (Table I) and CNS med-icines are predicted to account for a fifth of the sales of blockbuster drugs in 2007. The rewards for successful CNS research and development are clearly high, but are associated with signifi-cant challenges. These are exemplified by the longer time it takes to get a <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> to market (1316 years) com-pared with a non-CNS drug (1012 years) and the higher attrition rate for the <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> candidates compared with non-CNS drug candidates.

40|$|The {{permeation}} {{of drugs}} across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) {{is a prerequisite}} for central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>drug</b> penetration. The BBB, possessing efflux transporters and tight junctions, limits drug penetration to the brain. Consequently, the discovery of novel drugs to treat CNS diseases remains problematic and is lagging behind other therapeutic areas. In vitro assays have progressed understanding of the factors that govern brain penetration. Central nervous system drug penetration is now thought to be modulated by three main processes, namely BBB permeability, active transport at the BBB and drug binding in blood and brain tissue. A more integrated approach to <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> discovery programmes is emerging which encompasses these processes in order to examine the rate and extent of drug brain penetration across species and improve predictions in human. A primary porcine in vitro BBB model was developed and characterised for the prediction of <b>CNS</b> <b>drug</b> permeability in vivo. Characterisation confirmed that the model exhibited physiologically realistic cell architecture, the formation of tight junction protein complexes, transcellular electrical resistance consistently > 2000 Ω. cm 2, functional expression the P-gp efflux transporter and ?-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase activities. Transport of 12 centrally acting test drugs was investigated across four in vitro BBB models in order make comparisons between models and to generate in vitro permeability and efflux measurements. Blood-brain barrier permeability and active efflux processes are two major influences on the rate of drug penetration across the BBB. Species differences in fublood and fubrain, two prime influences on the extent of drug penetration, were investigated using equilibrium dialysis. Fraction unbound in brain was shown to be comparable across species suggesting that species differences in brain penetration could be due to variation in fublood for drugs that cross the BBB by passive diffusion, and/or species differences in transporter characteristics for drugs that are subject to active transport processes at the BBB. An in-house hybrid-PBPK rat CNS model was used to predict calculated rat Kp,uu using in vitro permeability, efflux, fublood and fubrain parameters generated during this work. The predicted Kp,uu generated using the rat CNS hybrid-PBPK model were within 3 -fold of calculated Kp,uu. The rat CNS hybrid-PBPK model has potential use, as a tool for drug discovery scientists to aid the prediction of the extent of drug penetration {{in the early stages of}} drug discovery.

30|$|An {{increasing}} number of recent observations [10],[18],[19] indicate that the brain concentration of a drug can differ significantly among various species.
