40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although coiling {{has been}} favorably {{comparable}} with clipping for treat-ment of most intracranial aneurysms, {{there is a}} controversy on which modality is safer for anterior choroidal artery (AchoA) aneurysm. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes and treatment-related complications after surgical clipping and endovascular coiling of AchoA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three AchoA aneurysms were recruited from 1895 intracranial aneurysms, which were treated either by surgical clipping or by endovascular coiling in 4 institutions between May 1999 and December 2006. The AchoA aneurysms were dichotomized according to the modality of treatment, the <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> (37 patients; 38 aneurysms) and the clip group (35 patients; 35 aneurysms). Clinical outcomes and incidence of treatment-related complications between 2 groups and the factors influencing the clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: There was no rebleeding in both groups during follow-up, for 4 – 72 months (mean, 27 months) in the <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> and for 3 – 84 months (mean, 34 months) in the clip group. In the <b>coil</b> <b>group,</b> 31 patients (83. 8 %) had favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score [mRS], 0 – 3). In the clip group, 31 patients (88. 6 %) had favorable outcome.

This investigation compared the use of detachable balloons and GDCs, which were previously used only in cases of balloon-technique failure and are now increasingly used as a first-line treatment for DCCFs, in terms of the risk of oculomotor nerve deficit, mortality/morbidity, and initial angiographic results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 48 patients with DCCFs treated with endovascular embolization at our institution between March 2004 and May 2009, 38 patients were included in this review. Patients who underwent trapping procedures, a second intervention within 2 weeks, or any procedure that included n-BCA infusion were excluded. Twenty of the enrolled patients were treated with transarterial balloons and the other 18, with GDCs.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent-assisted coiling and balloon-assisted coiling are 2 {{well-established}} {{techniques for}} treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. A direct comparative analysis of angiographic outcomes with the 2 techniques has not been available. We compare the angiographic outcomes of wide-neck aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling versus balloon-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 101 consecutive patients treated at our institution, 69 with stent-assisted coiling and 32 with balloon-assisted coiling. Two multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of aneurysm obliteration and predictors of progressive aneurysm thrombosis at follow-up.

This paper describes the outcomes after treatment of aneurysmal SAH and comparison between patients treated by clipping or coiling in a high volume center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of records of 195 consecu-tive patients with SAH. The overall outcome and the pretreatment variables predicting outcomes and the difference between the clipping and <b>coiling</b> <b>groups</b> were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 105 (55 %) patients had microsurgical clipping and 87 (45 %) had endovascular coiling. At 3 months, 69 % of patients recovered with no or mild disability. The predictors of a 3 -month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were Hunt and Hess (HH) grade on admission and the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether implanting exogenous fibroblasts on platinum coils could enhance intra-aneurysmal fibrosis. Hypotheses included: (1) fibroblast-coated (FBC) platinum coils can improve angiographic results after embolization; and (2) FBC platinum coils can accelerate histological healing of embolized aneurysms. Methods—Experimental aneurysms in rabbits were embolized with control platinum coils (n 18) or FBC coils (n 18). Subjects were euthanized at 14 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after implantation. Digital subtraction angiography was used to evaluate stability after embolization. Histological samples were examined with a grading system (range, 0 to 12) based on neck and dome healing. Results—Histology total scores and fibrosis ratio at 14 days were significantly greater in the FBC <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> compared with controls (6. 61. 9 versus 2. 51. 1, 1. 20. 6 % versus 0. 20. 3 %, respectively; P 0. 0090). Cavities embolized with FBC coils showed cellular proliferation and thrombus organization, with an endothelialized membrane bridging the neck. There were no differences between groups in the later timepoints. The FBC <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> showed radiographic stability in 11 (61 %) cases, coil compaction in 2 (11 %) cases, and progressive occlusion in 5 (28 %) cases.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: When {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms {{and common}} iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms undergo concomitant endovascular repair, endograft limb extension into the {{external iliac artery}} is often necessary. Usually, the internal iliac artery (IIA) is coil embolized {{in such a case}} to prevent endoleak. It has been our practice to coil embolize the IIA only in cases where there is not adequate stent graft seal in the CIA immediately proximal to the IIA origin (effectively sealing the entire IIA origin). In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of this approach. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 204 consecutive endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center from 1996 to 2001. Computed tomographic angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction was the primary preoperative imaging modality, and the decision to cover the IIA without concomitant coil embolization was based before surgery on the presence of adequate graft oversizing (≥ 10 % to 15 %) in the most distal 5 mm of CIA and 15 mm of proximal external iliac artery, respectively. Results: The IIA was occluded 33 times in 31 patients. In 22 cases (67 %), the IIA was covered without coil embolization (COVER group). The remaining 11 patients (33 %) with inadequate graft oversizing in the CIA underwent IIA coil embolization (<b>COIL</b> <b>group).</b> The follow-up periods for the COVER and COIL groups were 19 ± 2 months and 10 ± 3 months, respectively. All operations in both groups were technically successful without evidence of endoleak at completion angiography. No endoleaks, graft migrations, or aneurysm enlargements were associated with the covered or coiled IIAs during the follow-up period. No clinical sequelae were seen in the COVER group, with the exception of buttock claudication in six patients (27 %) that resolved completely in five patients. In the <b>COIL</b> <b>group,</b> five patients (45 %) had buttock claudication. In addition, one case of buttock necrosis and one case of ischemic neuropathy occurred in the <b>COIL</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusion: Covering the IIA without coiling effectively excluded the CIA aneurysm in every case and was associated with a low incidence rate of complications compared with coil embolization. With detailed preoperative imaging and patient selection, IIA coil embolization may not be necessary in as many as two thirds of patients who need IIA occlusion.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{our initial}} experience with hypogastric artery occlusion using a nitinol vascular plug during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsWe reviewed the records {{and images of}} 23 consecutive patients who underwent transluminal vessel occlusion of the hypogastric artery with a nitinol plug, {{as well as a}} cohort of 19 patients who underwent hypogastric artery embolization with coils in conjunction with EVAR. ResultsThere were no demographic {{differences between the two groups}} of patients. Hypogastric artery occlusion was successful in all cases when a nitinol vascular plug was used. When coils were used, there was one unsuccessful embolization which required a second procedure. The number of embolic devices used in the <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> was 7. 53 (range, three to 13) compared with 1. 35 (range, one to six) in the plug group (P <. 05). Only one plug was used in 19 of 23 cases. The average cost to embolize per hypogastric artery was $ 1, 496 compared with $ 470 when a nitinol plug was used. There were two instances of coil migration. No other intraoperative complications occurred. At one month follow up, seven patients (35 %) in the <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> complained of buttock claudication compared with two patients (9 %) in the nitinol plug group (P =. 027). ConclusionOur experience demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of the nitinol vascular plug for hypogastric artery occlusion during EVAR.

50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated <b>groups</b> of <b>coils</b> into the stators of electric motors. The <b>coil</b> <b>groups</b> are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the <b>coil</b> <b>groups</b> are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the <b>coil</b> <b>groups</b> are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|R

The scope for the work in this thesis has been to implement an automated procedure for a detailed modelling of the stator windings, testing of the procedure and analyses of losses from eddy currents and circulating currents. A group of macros was written in ANSYS APDL for the reworking of existing simulation models.

Materials and Methods: Fifteen subjects were included in this study. Fixed orthodontic treatment was planned with the extraction of first premolars to solve crowding in upper and/or lower arches. Stainless steel direct-bonding Roth brackets (0. 022 -inch) were used. For canine distalization su-perelastic NiTi closed coil springs generating 150 g of force were used on one side. Lacebacks made from 0. 010 -inch ligature wire were applied on the contralateral side. Dental and skeletal changes were evaluated from predistalization and postdistalization lateral cephalometric and sub-mento vertical radiographs. A Wilcoxon test was applied to determine the differences between predistalization and postdistalization mean values and to determine the mean differences between the groups. Results: Upper incisor crowns moved posteriorly. Distal movement and tipping of the canines were significant for both groups.

METHODS: 2143 patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were enrolled between 1994 and 2002 at 43 neurosurgical centres and randomly assigned to clipping or coiling. Clinical outcomes at 1 year have been previously reported. All UK and some non-UK centres continued long-term follow-up of 2004 patients enrolled in the original cohort. Annual follow-up has been done for a minimum of 6 years and a maximum of 14 years (mean follow-up 9 years). All deaths and rebleeding events were recorded. Analysis of rebleeding was by allocation and by treatment received. ISAT is registered, number ISRCTN 49866681. FINDINGS: 24 rebleeds had occurred more than 1 year after treatment. Of these, 13 were from the treated aneurysm (ten in the <b>coiling</b> <b>group</b> and three in the clipping group; log rank p= 0. 06 by intention-to-treat analysis).

40|$|IMPORTANCE Preliminary {{clinical}} trials {{have demonstrated that}} endobronchial coils compress emphysematous lung tissue and may improve lung function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms in patients with emphysema and severe lung hyperinflation. OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness and safety of endobronchial coil treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted among 315 patients with emphysema and severe air trapping recruited from 21 North American and 5 European sites from December 2012 through November 2015. INTERVENTIONS Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} continue usual care alone (guideline based, including pulmonary rehabilitation and bronchodilators; n = 157) vs usual care plus bilateral coil treatment (n = 158) involving 2 sequential procedures 4 months apart in which 10 to 14 coils were bronchoscopically placed in a single lobe of each lung. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary effectiveness outcome was difference in absolute change in 6 -minute-walk distance between baseline and 12 months (minimal clinically important difference [MCID], 25 m). Secondary end points included the difference between groups in 6 -minute walk distance responder rate, absolute change in quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (MCID, 4) and change in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1; MCID, 10 %). The primary safety analysis compared the proportion of participants experiencing at least 1 of 7 prespecified major complications. RESULTS Among 315 participants (mean age, 64 years; 52 % women), 90 % completed the 12 -month follow-up. Median change in 6 -minute walk distance at 12 months was 10. 3 m with coil treatment vs - 7. 6 m with usual care, with a between-group difference of 14. 6 m (Hodges-Lehmann 97. 5 % CI, 0. 4 mto infinity; 1 -sided P =. 02). Improvement of at least 25 m occurred in 40. 0 % of patients in the <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> vs 26. 9 % with usual care (odds ratio, 1. 8 [97. 5 % CI, 1. 1 to infinity]; unadjusted between-group difference, 11. 8 %[97. 5 % CI, 1. 0 % to infinity]; 1 -sided P =. 01). The between-group difference in median change in FEV 1 was 7. 0 %(97. 5 % CI, 3. 4 % to infinity; 1 -sided P <. 001), and the between-group St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score improved - 8. 9 points (97. 5 % CI, -infinity to - 6. 3 points; 1 -sided P <. 001), each favoring the <b>coil</b> <b>group.</b> Major complications (including pneumonia requiring hospitalization and other potentially life-threatening or fatal events) occurred in 34. 8 % of coil participants vs 19. 1 % of usual care (P =. 002). Other serious adverse events including pneumonia (20 % coil vs 4. 5 % usual care) and pneumothorax (9. 7 % vs 0. 6 %, respectively) occurred more frequently in the <b>coil</b> <b>group.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with emphysema and severe hyperinflation treated for 12 months, the use of endobronchial coils compared with usual care resulted in an improvement in median exercise tolerance that was modest and of uncertain clinical importance, with a higher likelihood of major complications.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{compare the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of coil embolization (COIL) to Amplatzer vascular plug embolization (PLUG) to achieve internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion prior to endovascular aortiliac aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsData from consecutive patients who underwent IIA embolization prior to EVAR over a 6 -year period (2004 - 2010) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, treatment modalities, and outcomes were compared. ResultsFrom January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2010, a total of 53 patients underwent percutaneous embolization of 57 IIAs prior to EVAR. Twenty-nine IIAs underwent COIL and 28 IIAs underwent PLUG embolization. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between the two groups. Patients underwent repair for aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta {{in conjunction with the}} common or internal iliac arteries (n = 35, 62 %) or isolated iliac artery aneurysms (n = 19, 38 %). A significantly greater number of embolization devices were used in the <b>COIL</b> <b>group</b> (5. 8 ± 3. 8 vs 1. 1 ± 0. 4; P <. 0001). Patients undergoing PLUG embolization demonstrated significantly shorter procedure times (118. 4 ± 64. 7 minutes vs 72. 6 ± 22. 4 minutes; P =. 008) and fluoroscopy times (32. 6 ± 14. 6 vs 14. 4 ± 8. 6 minutes; P =. 002). However, radiation dose between the groups did not differ (COIL: 470, 192. 7 ± 190, 606. 6 vs PLUG: 300, 972. 2 ± 191, 815. 7 mGycm 2; P =. 10). Overall periprocedural morbidity did not differ between the groups (COIL: 11 % vs PLUG: 6 %; P = 1. 0), and there were no perioperative mortalities or severe complications. Nontarget embolization occurred in two COIL and no PLUG cases (COIL: 6. 9 % vs PLUG: 0 %; P =. 49). Patient-reported buttock claudication at 1 month was 17. 2 % for COIL and 39. 3 % for PLUG patients (P =. 08). At last follow-up, persistent buttock claudication was reported in 13. 8 % of COIL and in 14. 3 % of PLUG embolizations (P = 1. 0). There {{was no significant difference in}} charges for the embolization material, operating room, or overall hospital charges (COIL: 44, 720 ± 19, 153 vs 37, 367 ± 10, 915; P =. 22). Lastly, zero endoleaks in the <b>COIL</b> <b>group</b> and three in the PLUG group (P =. 40) were detected on the most recent follow-up computed tomography imaging. No endoleak was related to the site of IIA embolization. ConclusionsCOIL and PLUG embolization both provide effective IIA embolization with low complication rates when used for EVAR. Buttock claudication did occur in approximately one-third of patients but resolved in half of those affected. PLUG embolization took significantly less time to perform and required decreased fluoroscopy times. Based on outcomes and cost-analysis, COIL and PLUG embolization are equivalent methods to achieve IIA occlusion during EVAR...|$|E

The Rashkind umbrella occluder and the Cook coil are two established devices, although the former is no longer manufactured. Aims To assess any difference in outcomes {{between the use of}} the Cook detachable coil and the Rashkind double umbrella in patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occlusion. Methods A retrospective study of 77 patients in whom PDA occlusion was attempted using the Cook detachable PDA coil from March 1996 to March 2000. A comparison was carried out with patients in whom occlusion was attempted using the Rashkind double umbrella between 1989 and 1996. Results The rate of immediate complete occlusion was 24 % compared with 29. 9 % for the Rashkind device. The figure for complete occlusion after 24 hours with the PDA coil was 63 % compared with 61. 5 % in the Rashkind group (p> 0. 1). The overall closure rate in the <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> was 72 % versus 74. 6 % for umbrellas. Conclusion The outcome in terms of complete duct closure using the Cook coil is comparable with figures obtained using the Rashkind umbrella.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the quality difference of short echo time (TE) breathhold 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the liver at 3. 0 T using the body and phased array coils, respectively. In total, 20 pairs of single-voxel proton spectra of the liver were acquired at 3. 0 T using the phased array and body coils as receivers. Consecutive stacks of breathhold spectra were acquired using the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) technique at a short TE of 30 ms and a repetition time (TR) of 1500 ms. The first spectroscopy sequence was "copied" for the second acquisition to ensure identical voxel positioning. The MRS prescan adjustments of shimming and water suppression, signal-to noise ratio (SNR), and major liver quantitative information were compared between paired spectra. Theoretical calculation of the SNR and homogeneity of the region of interest (ROI, 2 cm× 2 cm× 2 cm) using different coils loaded with 3 D liver electromagnetic model of real human body was implemented in the theoretical analysis. The theoretical analysis showed that, inside the ROI, the SNR of the phase array coil was 2. 8387 times larger than that of body coil and the homogeneity of the phase array coil and body coil was 80. 10 % and 93. 86 %, respectively. The experimental results showed excellent correlations between the paired data (all r > 0. 86). Compared with the body <b>coil</b> <b>group,</b> the phased array group had slightly worse shimming effect and better SNR (all P values 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this 2 -year {{retrospective}} study is to compare the outcomes of patients with either surgical clipping or endovascular coiling treatment for ruptured anterior circulation cerebral aneurysms. We enrolled 100 patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from ruptured anterior circulation cerebral aneurysms. We reviewed the demographic information, operative details, and image examinations including computed tomography (CT), digital subtraction angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging of brains. The patients were subdivided into two groups {{on the basis of}} treatment modalities: surgical clipping (N =  44) or endovascular coiling (N =  56). The modified Rankin's scale (mRS) was used as an outcome measures. Unfavorable outcome was defined by a mRS score of 1 – 3. The mean age of 100 patients, comprising 35 men and 65 women, was 57. 48  ±  12. 68 years. The follow-up period was 18. 91  ±  13. 05 months in average. The differences between the clipping and <b>coiling</b> <b>groups</b> in terms of admission Glasgow Coma Scale, Hunt and Hess grade, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade, and Fisher's grade by CT scans were not statistically significant. There was no intergroup difference in the following results: symptomatic or radiographic vasospasm, post-treat rebleeding, and recurrence of aneurysms. Although the incidences of unfavorable outcome at the end of follow-up were 32. 0 % and 27. 0 % in the clipping and <b>coiling</b> <b>group</b> respectively, it revealed no significant difference (p =  0. 202). In dealing with the patients with ruptured anterior circulation cerebral aneurysms, our results provide helpful information when discussing projected outcome before surgical or endovascular treatment...|$|R
30|$|The main {{advantage}} of hydrogel microcoils {{is to increase}} the packing density by hydrogel expansion among the coil interstices and to establish tight mechanical vessel occlusion without the aid of thrombus formation. These features may be helpful in the embolization procedure like for PAVMs under systemic heparinization. However, there have been few reports describing application of hydrogel microcoils for PAVM embolization. In an early report of peripheral application of hydrogel microcoils, the coils were deployed through the existing coil mesh in a partially recanalized PAVM (Nambiar et al. 2008). The additional increase in volume after hydrogel swelling helped to achieve complete occlusion of the PAVM. In other reported indications, hydrogel microcoils reduced the coil numbers when compared with fibered microcoils in prophylactic embolization of the gastroduodenal artery before yttrium- 90 radioembolization for liver cancers (Maleux et al. 2013). In another comparison study for intracranial aneurysms, the higher packing density, shorter total coil length, and lower recanalization rates were proven in the hydrogel microcoil group than in the bare <b>coil</b> <b>group</b> (White et al. 2011). The study suggested that hydrogel microcoils constitute at least 50 % of the total coil length for < 10  mm aneurysms, and at least two thirds of the total coil length for > 10  mm aneurysms. In our series, the median proportion of hydrogel microcoils was 66.7 % of the total coil length. However, there has been no report yet about the optimal proportion of hydrogel microcoils to decrease the recanalization rates of PAVMs. Although the significant sac shrinkage was obtained in our series in the short period up to eighteen months, longer-term follow-up is necessary to ensure the sac involution or freedom from symptoms, as reperfusion can occur in once resolved PAVMs even after more than two years (Milic et al. 2005).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To prospectively {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of time-of-flight (TOF) and contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiography (MRA) with that of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to assess immediate intracranial aneurysm occlusion after selective embolization. METHODS: From August 2006 to March 2007, 33 consecutive patients with 40 aneurysms were included. Thirty aneurysms were treated by endosaccular <b>coils</b> (<b>group</b> 1). Ten aneurysms were treated by stent placement and subsequent endosaccular <b>coils</b> (<b>group</b> 2). All patients underwent MRA within 24 h after treatment. One senior and one fellow radiologist independently reviewed the MR images, and another senior radiologist reviewed the DSA images. RESULTS: DSA showed 22 complete occlusions, ten residual necks, and eight residual aneurysms. For residual neck detection, {{there was no difference}} between TOF-MRA (sensitivity, 80 %- 80 %; specificity, 93. 8 %- 100 %, according to both readers) and CE-MRA (sensitivity, 80 %- 80 %; specificity, 100 %). For residual aneurysm detection, there was a significant difference between TOF-MRA (sensitivity, 50 %- 62. 5 %; specificity, 100 %) and CE-MRA (sensitivity and specificity, 100 %, according to both readers). In group 2, a residual aneurysm was missed by both readers with TOF-MRA in the same 3 aneurysms. Moreover, both readers judged CE-MRA better than TOF-MRA to assess parent-artery patency in group 2. Interobserver agreement was excellent for TOF-MRA and CE-MRA (kappa= 0. 9 and 1, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, both TOF-MRA and CE-MRA had high and comparable sensitivity and specificity for the assessment of immediate aneurysm occlusion after selective embolization, except when a stent-assisted technique was used. In such cases, CE-MRA was superior to TOF-MRA to evaluate aneurysm occlusion and parent-artery patency...|$|R

In a retrospective cohort review on the treatment methods of aneurysm rupture in Hospital Kuala Lumpur over the period of five years (2005 - 2009) a total of 268 patients were treated. These patients were broadly categorized into two groups based on their treatment mode for ruptured aneurysms. Statistical analysis was determined using Chi-Square tests to study these associations. In our study, 67. 5 % of patients presented with Good World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade (WFNS 1 - 2) while 32. 5 % patients presented with Poor WFNS prior to intervention. In our outcome, it was noted that 60. 4 % had good functional outcome (mRS grade 0 - 2) as compared to 39. 6 % patients who had poor mRS(modified rankin scale) outcome (mRS 3 - 6). In the good WFNS group, 76 % of patients in clipping group had a good mRS outcome while, 86. 5 % patients in <b>coiling</b> <b>group</b> had good mRS outcome (p= 0. 114). In poor WFNS presentation, it was noted that in 77. 3 % patients in clipping group, had poor mRS outcome. Similarly with poor WFNS presentation, 83. 3 % of patient in <b>coiling</b> <b>group</b> had poor outcome. (p= 1. 00). Hence when we control the WFNS group, there was no significant association between treatment <b>group</b> (clipping and <b>coiling)</b> and mRS outcome at 6 months. The outcome of patient is determined by initial clinical presentation (WFNS grade) and influenced by requirement of Extraventricular drain (EVD) in presence of hydrocephalus, CSF infection and pneumonia. Therefore the decision regarding treatment option needs to be individualized based on the presentation of the patient.
