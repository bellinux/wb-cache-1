5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, using {{technology}} {{developed for the}} aerospace and nuclear industries, German car makers started complex computer crash simulation studies, using finite element methods simulating the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour</b> of individual car body components, component assemblies, and quarter and half cars at the [...] body in white(BIW) stage. These experiments culminated in a joint project by the Forschungsgemeinschaft Automobil-Technik (FAT), a conglomeration of all seven German car makers (Audi, BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Opel (GM), Porsche, and Volkswagen), which tested the applicability of two emerging commercial crash simulation codes. These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure (Haug 1986) and they ran to completion on a computer overnight. Now that turn-around time between two consecutive job-submissions (computer runs) did not exceed one day, engineers {{were able to make}} efficient and progressive improvements of the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the analyzed car body structure. The drive for improved crash worthiness in Europe has accelerated from the 1990s onwards, with the 1997 advent of Euro NCAP, with the involvement of Formula One motor racing safety expertise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} <b>crashing</b> <b>behaviour</b> of {{thin-walled}} structures having various cross-sections subject of dynamic axial loading. The {{aim is to}} understand the collapse mode formation, energy absorption behaviour and progressive buckling phenomenon regarding TWB thin-walled structures. Three different cross-section shapes were {{used for this study}} as it follows: circular, hexagonal, rectangular. In the fabrication process of the structure itself, homogeneous materials are often used but an attractive solution for the automotive companies is materialized by the use of tailor welded blanks. In this paper, the impact crashing procedure was performed using a custom impact setup and the non-linear finite element platform LS-Dyna V 971 R 5. 0. After these analyses it can be concluded that a correlation between the number of folds and the mean load and the weld line could be made. The number of folds tends to increase as the mean load also increases. The weld line has {{an important role in the}} collapse mode formation and the values of the mean load...|$|R
40|$|Identification of the {{interests}} of potential users is crucial for setting up a useful and broadly supported large-scale naturalistic driving (ND) study. This report describes the results of a survey amongst 72 road transport professionals in Europe from different organisation types that aimed at identifying those interests. The survey was presented on the internet. Whereas the size of the sample is small and may be somewhat biased, the results indicate that road transport professionals consider ND studies most useful for studying road safety issues. Many also considered ND studies useful for human-machine interface design. Traffic management and particularly environmental issues were considered less useful by the respondents. Within the area of road safety, risk-taking <b>behaviour,</b> pre-crash <b>behaviour,</b> <b>crash</b> avoidance <b>behaviour,</b> and driver condition were considered the most interesting topics for naturalistic research. There were only minor differences between {{the interests}} of respondents from different organisation types and from different groups of countries.

40|$|In {{this work}} the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a {{trapezoidal}} bar is investigated using the software LS-DYNA of LSTC. A possible application {{might be a}} crashbox in a helicopter floor. The hybrid structure of the bar consists of both carbon and aramid fabrics. In total four loading conditions are determined. Crash experiments and simulations have already been made in 2000 / 2001 at the Institute of Structures and Design of the German Aerospace Center DLR within a diploma thesis. At that time they used the software PAM-CRASH of ESI to forecast the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In particular the global force-displacement-curves have been generated. In this work the crash procedure of the bar is to be simulated again, using LS-DYNA of LSTC. The main interest is to evaluate the material models for composites by comparing the simulation results with existing data of the former experiments. Thereby {{the focus is on}} many parameters within the material model to be sure about there influence on <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The assembling of the finite element model is explained step by step.

40|$|Abstract. Current crash {{structures}} in cars are still using the buckling of metallic structures {{to absorb the}} kinetic energy {{in case of an}} impact. The disadvantage of this technology is that changes within the static structural behaviour, like e. g. the stiffness or eigenfrequencies, will cause changes in the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour,</b> even if this is not desired. This correlation between static and dynamic behaviour causes many development loops to adjust the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour,</b> e. g. through optimizing trigger geometries which lower the initial crash forces. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Vehicle Concepts has developed a novel method to offer an efficient way of absorbing energy by peeling the outer skin of load bearing structures, like the crash boxes and the longitudinal rails. This technology provides an adjustable force level without changing the static behaviour of the front structure itself. This property offers the opportunity to create adaptable <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour</b> with only smallest changes within the peeling depth. Furthermore, it is possible to generate close to ideal force-deflection curves, which offers the potential to achieve high specific energy absorption. The DLR will show results of static and dynamic testing of crash tubes and of a vehicle front structure equipped with this mechanism. In addition the implementation of the methodology into the dynamic simulation with LS-Dyna will be shown. Benefits and limitations of this novel energy absorption method will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|The study, using mixed methodology, {{examined}} {{perceptions of}} {{risk associated with}} speeding in young rural people. Focus groups discussions (age range 16 - 24) in which speeding was identified as often being an involuntary driving behaviour, informed {{the development of a}} survey instrument. The survey was conducted with two groups of young people, one rural (n = 217) and another semi-rural (n = 235). The results from both the focus groups and surveys indicate that young rural drivers had specific attitudes to speeding, when compared with other risk factors for <b>crashing.</b> Speeding <b>behaviour</b> was viewed as both acceptable and inevitable. Males and those from a rural area viewed speeding, and reducing trip time when compared to that of a peer, to be less risky than did females and those who lived in a semi-rural area. Speeding was considered to be less risky than drink driving. These perceptions of speeding may contribute to the crash rates on rural roads involving young, local drivers and need to be considered in interventions or educational programmes which aim to reduce the rural road crash rate...|$|R
40|$|In London, Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) is paid when a {{property}} changes ownership. The {{amount of tax payable}} {{is determined by}} central government policy, and depends on the value of the property. The current SDLT policy was introduced in 2014. This work aims to predict the SDLT receivable in London {{over the next five years}}. SDLT revenue will depend upon the value of property changing ownership, but also upon the housing market. Any model of SDLT receipts will therefore need to include assumptions about the housing market in London. Here, the housing market is considered in two parts: the total number of properties sold, and the distribution of price across the properties sold. In this way, housing market scenarios are constructed in which: • Growth is extrapolated from previous market trends • Some aspect of the housing market (either price or volume of sales) remains constant • There is a <b>crash</b> These <b>behaviours</b> combine with different predictions of total sales numbers and price distributions to give a range of possible housing market scenarios and, therefore, SDLT receipts.

In this study two of the beams were tested with a partial overlap of the specimen and impactors of different shapes, while a third one was tested on an inclined surface of 20 ° in the longitudinal direction. The forth test was performed on a specimen with two circular holes in the web area to investigate the evolution of damage and failure. In general, a very good correlation between the test results and the simulations with the improved fabric material model was found...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fleet wide vehicle crash {{research}} {{requires a}} wide range of numerical vehicle models to simulate the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a real life vehicle fleet in crashes. Representative simulations of a vehicle fleet may require 10, 000 till 100, 000 crash simulations. This requires relatively simple vehicle crash models in order to obtain acceptable CPU times, in the order of minutes. The current used multi body vehicle models have a relative short CPU time (one hour) with a good representation of the frontal kinematics and global dummy responses including airbag and belt interaction, however {{there is a need for}} even less time consuming models with an acceptable accuracy for (frontal) impact. This paper describes a method to construct simple vehicle (frontal) crash models by an automated process with the use of vehicle measurement and test data which are available for other research purposes. Structural elements are selected which determine the <b>crash</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the vehicle. An algorithm is created which uses a geometry database to build specific vehicle types. These vehicle models are fitted and validated using crash test data. A midsize European vehicle model is built using this new methodology which shows promising results for usage in different crash research activities...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{remember}} how people have behaved in prior encounters is a crucial social skill as this knowledge can guide our behaviour towards them in future interactions. The neural structures that underlie this ability are largely unknown. This {{was the focus of}} the present research, which examined how the neural response to faces is influenced by whether a person behaved appropriately or inappropriately in initial social encounters. This research question was assessed over two experiments investigating both behavioural (Experiment 1) and neural (Experiment 2) effects. In both these experiments, participants were exposed to unfamiliar faces that consistently displayed either an „Appropriate‟ (e. g., smiling towards a chocolate sundae) or „Inappropriate‟ (e. g., smiling towards a plane <b>crash)</b> emotional <b>behaviour.</b> In Experiment 1, participants then completed face evaluation measures to assess perceived pleasantness and implicit memory for the faces. Participants‟ judgements showed no influence of faces‟ prior emotional behaviour. This was followed up with Experiment 2 to examine whether any traces of prior social knowledge would be evident at a neural level. As expected, the neural response to faces was modulated by the prior emotional behaviour associated with the faces, with greater activity in the right medial prefrontal cortex, insula, inferior frontal gyrus and putamen to Inappropriate faces than Appropriate faces. These findings provide a neural basis for the ability to retrieve knowledge of prior social experiences and associate this information with face identities. The functional significance of these neural areas, implications and future directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} seriously injured cyclists is {{increasing}} in the Netherlands. The {{majority of these}} seriously injured cyclists were involved in single-bicycle or bicycle-bicycle crashes. Little {{is known about the}} circumstances in which these crashes occur, as the police only registers 4 % of these crashes. Therefore, an in-depth study was carried out to gain insight into the factors and circumstances that influence the occurrence and consequences of these crashes. The focus was on crashes involving cyclists aged 50 and over, as this group has a large share in the number of cyclist-only crashes. Detailed information on 41 single-bicycle and bicycle-bicycle crashes was collected and analysed. This resulted in a description of the course of events for every analysed crash, including a list of factors that had contributed to the occurrence of the crash and possible injuries. Subsequently, crashes with a similar course of events and a comparable combination of contributory factors were grouped into types of crashes. Results showed that cyclists aged 75 and over are more often involved in falls from a bicycle than younger cyclists. Contributory factors that played a role in a large number of <b>crashes</b> were <b>behaviour</b> of another road user, distraction and narrow cycling facilities or traffic lanes. However, which factors {{played a role in the}} occurrence of a crash depended on the type of crash. Eight types of crashes were identified. Based on the factors that played a role in the occurrence of these crashes, remedial measures can be developed to prevent similar crashes from occurring in the future. (Author/publisher...|$|R

40|$|If an {{intervention}} {{can be shown}} to affect the number of driving offences, is this also evidence that it {{has an effect on}} road crashes? We summarise two recent studies in which we found a difference between groups in respect of driving offences but not in respect of crashes. One study focused on the method of obtaining a driving licence, the other concerned participation in a brief intervention program for young offending drivers. Further, the literature reveals other examples of different effects on offences and crashes. One possible explanation {{is that there is a}} closer link between the behaviours targeted by the intervention and being caught offending than between those same behaviours and being involved in a crash.

30|$|The {{methodology}} to plan, {{design and}} conduct the NDS, and to analyse the results, {{is derived from}} the FESTA methodology for conducting Field Operational Tests (FOT) ([11]; FESTA, [12]). It was developed in the European FESTA project (Field opErational teSt supporT Action) by a consortium {{of a large number of}} partners, both industrial and academic. The methodology is currently maintained by the European Support Action FOT-Net (www.fot-net.eu), and has been revised several times. NDS are now included in this methodology. NDS and FOTs may be seen as different methods because the study design is different (participant selection, experimental conditions, vehicle sample etc.), and the research questions and hypotheses are different. In particular, the main difference relates to the degree of experimental control in the study. However, there is also substantial overlap, especially in the structured approach to develop the study, and the tools and analysis methods used. Between the FOT and the NDS lies the Naturalistic FOT.

40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of speeding penalty changes that occurred in Queensland in 2003 on the behaviour of speeding offenders. These penalty changes included increasing the number of offence categories, and in turn narrowing the range of speeds associated with the offence categories; increasing the monetary fines for all offences, with the largest increases observed for high-range offences; and introducing automatic licence suspension and an eight demerit point penalty for the highest offence category. To explore the impact of the penalty changes, offence data collected for two cohorts of motorists in Queensland who were caught speeding prior to and subsequent to the penalty changes (N = 84, 456) were compared. The first cohort consisted of individuals (operators of all vehicles including motorcycles) who committed a speeding offence in May 2001 (two years prior to the speeding penalty change); and individuals who committed a speeding offence in May 2003 (one month after the introduction of the penalty change). Four measures of recidivism were devised and used to assess the effects of the new penalties with regard to deterring the speeding behaviour of offenders.
