2500|$|Glass Wings {{was first}} {{released}} on December 17, 2003 in Japan by [...] Kadokawa Shoten under the Asuka Comics imprint. Tokyopop released the anthology in the United States and Canada on February 7, 2006 and in Germany in 2005, {{where it was}} entitled Der Prinz mit den gläsernen Schwingen ("The Prince with the Wings of Glass"). The anthology contains the three-chapter-long story [...] "Glass Wings" [...] and the one-chapter-long stories [...] "Firefly" [...] and [...] "Jion Princess", all {{written and illustrated by}} Misuzu Asaoka. Hagane, the main character of [...] "Glass Wings", is featured on the book's <b>cover.</b> <b>Glass</b> Wings is currently out of print in North America. In Japan, the book is currently out of stock and a second printing is pending.|$|E

Take a recently-killed frog, and examine a drop of its blood, spread out on a glass slip, under the microscope; compare it with your own. Before using the high power, put a <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> over the object, of course. Scrape {{the roof of the}} mouth of the frog gently, to obtain ciliated epithelium; and mount in very weak salt solution-- the cilia will still be active. Squamous epithelium may be seen by the student similarly scraping the interior of his own cheek. Take a piece of muscle from one of the frog's limbs, tease out with needles upon a glass slip, and examine. To see the striations clearly, the high power will be needed. Compare a piece of muscle from the wall of the alimentary canal. Similarly examine nerve and connective tissue.|$|E
50|$|Optical bonding {{improves}} optical {{performance of}} displays. It eliminates the air {{gap between the}} <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> and LCD, and usually includes an anti-reflective (A/R) coating (as well as anti-smudge and anti-glare treatments on the <b>cover</b> <b>glass).</b> Optical bonding improves the contrast ratio by {{reducing the amount of}} reflected light, thus improving viewability. This is especially important in outdoor applications, where direct sunlight can decrease viewability.|$|E

The glasses have thin stripes on their surfaces that are heated by the headlight beams; however, the ducted warm air provides demisting when the headlamps are not turned on.

5000|$|One {{approach}} to OGS is called [...] "sensor on lens." [...] (In this case, the [...] "lens" [...] {{refers to the}} <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> layer.) You deposit an Indium tin oxide(ITO, used as electrodes to sense touch) layer {{on the back of}} the <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> and pattern it to create the electrodes. You add a thin insulator layer to the bottom of that, and then deposit a second ITO layer on the back of that, patterning it to create electrodes running at right angles to the first layer. This module then gets laminated onto a standard LCD panel.The other approach is called [...] "on-cell" [...] capacitive touchscreen. (Here the [...] "cell" [...] refers to the LCD.) A conductive layer of ITO is deposited directly onto the top layer of glass in the LCD panel, and then patterned into electrodes. A thin insulating layer is applied, and then the second ITO layer is patterned with the second layer of electrodes. Finally, the top polarizing layer is applied on top, and the display is completed by adding the <b>cover</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E

50|$|A cover slip, {{coverslip}} or <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> {{is a thin}} flat {{piece of}} transparent material, usually square or rectangular, about 20 mm (4/5 in) wide and {{a fraction of a}} millimetre thick, that is placed over objects for viewing with a microscope. The object is usually held between the cover slip and a somewhat thicker microscope slide, which rests on the microscope's stage or slide holder and provides the physical support for the object and slip.|$|E

50|$|MR lamps, {{like all}} quartz-halogen lamps, produce some {{undesirable}} ultraviolet light. Usually, {{this must be}} filtered out. Also, the quartz capsules of the lamps may rupture or explode upon failure of the lamps. For these two reasons, some MR lamps include a <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> that serves as an integrated ultraviolet filter and explosion shield. MR16 lamps lacking this cover {{require the use of}} a fixture that incorporates an external piece of glass specifically designed to provide both ultraviolet and physical protection.|$|E

50|$|The AI2O3 {{content of}} alkali {{aluminosilicate}} glasses is typically 10-25% and the alkali content over 10%. The high alkali content prepares the glass for ion exchange with bigger alkali ions {{in order to}} improve the surface compressive strength. Due to this particular feature, this glass type is especially suitable for the use in touch displays, solar cells <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> and laminated safety glass. High transformation temperatures and outstanding mechanical properties, e.g. hardness and scratch behavior, are characteristic of this glass type.|$|E
50|$|In a LCoS display, a CMOS chip {{controls}} the voltage on square reflective aluminium electrodes buried {{just below the}} chip surface, each controlling one pixel. For example, a chip with XGA resolution will have 1024x768 plates, each with an independently addressable voltage. Typical cells are about 1 - 3 centimeters square and about 2 mm thick, with pixel pitch as small as 2.79 μm. A common voltage for all the pixels is supplied by a transparent conductive layer made of indium tin oxide on the <b>cover</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{thickness}} of the cover slip is crucially important for high-resolution microscopy. Typical biological microscope objectives are designed for use with No. 1.5 cover slips (0.17 mm thickness). Mount is used to attach the <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> to the slide. The use of cover slips that deviate from this intended thickness will result in spherical aberration {{and a reduction in}} resolution and image intensity. Specialty objectives may used to image specimens without coverslips, or may have correction collars that permit a user to accommodate for alternative coverslip thickness.|$|E
40|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>cover</b> of a {{solar still}} {{plays a major}} role in its {{performance}} and efficiency since the output depends directly on the water and <b>glass</b> <b>cover</b> temperature difference.

An experimental study was conducted in order to study the difference between the inner and the outer <b>glass</b> <b>cover</b> temperature difference in a conventional basin type solar still and a low thermal inertia solar still obtained by modifying the conventional still. It was observed that for the conventional still, the temperature difference was maximum upto 7. 14 % at noon and insignificant in the morning and evening hours.
