The abstracts were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements, and Wright and the USDA were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible. Wright's supervisor noted errors in the report, as well as undue enthusiasm for draining, and delayed its release in 1910.

500|$|The Feminist Improvising Group (FIG) {{was founded}} in London in 1977 by Scottish vocalist Maggie Nicols from Centipede and English bassoonist/composer Lindsay Cooper from Henry Cow. Nicols and Cooper first {{discussed}} {{the idea of an}} all-women improvising group at a musician's union meeting. Cooper said, [...] "we agreed that improvisation had become very important and no women were doing it. And suddenly we thought, well let's do it! Let's get women together and do it ourselves!" [...] While Nicols and Cooper had both performed frequently with men, they had little experience performing with other women, but their involvement in class politics as well as feminist and lesbian activism prompted them to pursue this project. The other members of the five-piece ensemble were cellist/bassist Georgie Born, also from Henry Cow, vocalist/pianist Cathy Williams from the British duo Rag Doll, and trumpeter Corinne Liensol from British feminist rock band Jam Today. They had originally intended to call themselves the [...] "Women's Improvising Group", but at their first engagement they discovered that the organisers had billed them as the [...] "Feminist Improvising Group". Nicols said that the [...] "political statement of the band's name never even came from us! But we just thought, 'OK, they've <b>called</b> <b>us</b> feminist, we'll work with that.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} in early 1966 to expand the group, {{resulting}} in the recruitment of Mark Landon (lead guitar) and Doug Rhodes (organ), previously a session musician for the Association. To reflect on the revamped line-up, Bonniwell changed the band's name to the Music Machine. [...] Another purpose for coining the name, Bonniwell explained, was [...] "I seguewayed [...] all the original material with musical segueways [...] [...] So we would be on stage for like an hour and ten minutes, wall-to-wall music just nonstop, which is why I <b>called</b> <b>us</b> the Music Machine". The band built a name for itself with its performances in local clubs in Los Angeles. [...] With Bonniwell as the de facto leader and creative force of the band, the Music Machine began to develop a blend of gritty 60s punk and psychedelia, and a repertoire encompassing Bonniwell's self-penned material along with some cover songs. The band's sound was highlighted by the authoritative and versatile vocals provided by Bonniwell, with an energized technique that juxtaposed the styles of Mick Jagger and Sky Saxon. Unlike these two contemporaries, Bonniwell possessed unusually good intonation in long-sustained passages, {{and the ability to}} breakdown phrases into a series of slow pulsations. The Music Machine's artistic stance was also highlighted by Landon's wiry guitar playing, Olsen's reverberant bass, and Edgar's cymbal-punctuated drumming, which gave the band a harder-edged sound than many of their contemporaries.|$|E

500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to come...

500|$|On October 27, Increase Mather {{recorded}} his {{one and only}} diary entry for all of 1683: [...] "Randolph arrived at Boston." [...] Phips quickly began to provide {{a show of force}} for Randolph by insisting other ships strike their colors and firing across their bows if they did not. [...] Knepp claims that Narborough did not condone this, and many historians have followed his lead in treating Phips' activities in Boston harbor as arrogant showboating, but it seems clear from the letters of Randolph and Blathwayt [...] that Phips was not doing this merely for some explosive fun. Phips cites personal instructions from the King and indeed Charles II was known to have insisted on a salute to his flag. As Phips was creating chaos for the Massachusetts government, he continued to pursue his original intention of gathering diving equipment and divers to take to the Bahamas. Phips later followed the same procedures of requiring ships to strike in the West Indies and with a new crew in Bermuda. Phips lack of experience in the Royal Navy would suggest he likely made mistakes and did not always go about this procedure in the best way. It must have been a strange and uncomfortable chore for someone whose loyalties were with Boston (in '76 the records show initiated the building of a house in Boston). Randolph was never one to withhold criticism, but he did not complain of Phips activities in Boston harbor that winter and Randolph even seems to have assisted Phips by searching a ship for him. [...] But choosing a threatening posture showed Randolph's inability to understand the New England character and it did not produce the effect Randolph intended. The magistrates voted to submit to the crown, but the deputies resisted. [...] Phips and the Rose became a focal point for the resistance, as Knepp dutifully recorded without understanding the subtext: [...] "Phips crew say that they would as soon fire against this town as against Algiers and <b>called</b> <b>us</b> rebels," [...] is one deposition Knepp records though Knepp seems to believe he is merely recording a barroom brawl. [...] "...one of the constables in particular told him that he thought Capt. Phips had been a town born child, Captain Phips answering him, 'Let him be what he would, he had been sworn at sixteen years of age to be true to the King and his government."
