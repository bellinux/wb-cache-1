50|$|Martin and Vincent Zaninovich were {{partners}} in a farming business in San Joaquin Valley in California and used the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> method <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> The partnership entered into a lease of farm land from December 1, 1973 to November 30, 1993. Yearly rent of $27,000 for the period running December 1 to November 30 was payable on December 20 of each lease year. On December 20, 1973, the partnership paid $27,000 in rent for the lease year running December 1, 1973 to November 30, 1974. The partnership deducted this entire amount on its return for the taxable year 1973.|$|R
50|$|The cash method <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> {{also known}} as cash-basis accounting, cash {{receipts}} and disbursements method <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> or cash accounting (the EU VAT directive vocabulary Article 226) records revenue when cash is received, and expenses when they are paid in <b>cash.</b> As a <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> this {{is in contrast to}} the alternative accrual method which records income items when they are earned and records deductions when expenses are incurred regardless of the flow of cash.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court found}} that its {{reasoning}} for the [...] "one year rule" [...] was well illustrated by {{the facts of the}} case before it. If the taxpayers in this situation were forced to deduct their rental payments on a prorated <b>basis,</b> the simplicity <b>of</b> the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> method <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> was sacrificed for an inconsequential change in the timing of deductions. Under the prorated system the taxpayers could only deduct 1/12 of their rental payment in 1973. But in 1974, and every year until 1992, the taxpayers would be able to deduct both 1/12 of the current payment (for the month of December) and 11/12 for the preceding year's payment that covered the rental period in the current tax year (January-November); thus the taxpayers would be deducting 12/12 of rental payment—an entire year's worth of payments. So there was only a difference between the prorated deduction system and the [...] "one-year rule" [...] for the first and last year of the lease term.|$|R

40|$|Since 20 th century 90 's, most of OECD {{countries}} have introduced accrual basis into government accounting through series accounting reform. As the result, visible effect in strengthening government financial control and management {{in those countries}} has attracted the concern from other countries which have not involved in this trend. For Chinese government, <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> has dominated in the area <b>of</b> government <b>accounting</b> for a long period. Chinese government accounting has very tight relationship with state-budget; and it behaves as foundation of entire financial and budget management, therefore, the accounting basis acts as the fundamental guarantee of sound financial and budget management system. For the comparable lower requirements on accounting information in the past, <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> government <b>accounting</b> could satisfy users' demands. But with the changes in government accounting environment, its inherent weaknesses make it quit the stage and give the way to accruals accounting [...] a new power in government accounting. From the start, accruals accounting has revealed its benefit on improving financial control and management in government. With it, government could has better performance on accountability, and provide more transparent report on its financial performance to information users including the investors. After some academic researches on its inherent characteristics and implementation experience, Chinese government has confirmed the implementation <b>of</b> accruals <b>accounting</b> as the key factor {{in the process of}} establishing effective modern government. For current Chinese government, accrual accounting have not been applied in all departments, Chinese government is experiencing the accounting reform which aims at changing the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> to accrual basis. Combined the successful reform experience from some OECD countries (like UK, U. S, New Zealand and Australia) with local environment, Chinese government accounting reform followed the step-by- step way with "Chinese characteristics" which begin from completing/creating reform environment to achieve full accruals accounting in final stage. Chinese government accounting reform definitely is a well planed arrangement. But the unpredictable changes will exist within the reform process. Certain timely adjustment is essential for Chinese government within reform process. Frankly speaking, there is no perfect accounting system in the world. For public financial management, even accruals accounting which has better performance in most fields than others, its inherent weaknesses would bring potential issues to government. And some issues have been existed in developed countries like UK, U. S. Australia and New Zealand. Chinese government has responsibility to pay more attention on those issues within reform process, and Chinese government need to do some analysis and prediction work on the problems which have high possibility to occur in future accruals accounting application. In China, completing the whole plan and apply accruals accounting in all levels of government would be long time process...|$|R

50|$|There {{are certain}} {{advantages}} in tax planning when the cash method of accounting is used: for instance, payment of business expenses may be accelerated before year end, {{in order to}} maximize tax deductions, whereas billings for services may be postponed to after year end, so that payments won't be received until the new year, thus postponing tax payments on such income. Because of these advantages and the manipulations that can occur with it in order to minimize taxable income, the IRS has discouraged (although not prohibited entirely) the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> for tax purposes. For instance the companies that use the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> may not report any inventory in their financial statements, in fact reporting of any inventory at year end can lead to manipulation of taxable income to an enormous extent.|$|E

40|$|The advent and the {{diffusion}} of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have dramatically changed the way Governments convey financial information {{to a wide range}} of stakeholders. Nowadays, the Internet in particular is universally deemed a powerful tool Governments and citizens have at their disposal to prove their accountability and to assess it. Nevertheless, whenever the every-day citizen finds some difficulties in understanding such sort of language smartly named “accounting-ese”- which is, by contrast, commonly and successfully used in professional, institutional and academic communication - specific contents of the information conveyed may be sometimes lost and, as a result, the underlying communication process adversely affected. With an eye towards such a perspective, the aim of the present paper is to test the effective role of the Internet technology in fulfilling the citizens’ information needs. Emphasis will be put on the user-orientation paradigm, specifically analysed with reference to two different governmental environments: the American one, which politically shows an old and strong federal tradition, and the Italian one, which is presently moving its first steps towards such a direction. The paper, which is part of an ongoing research project, will pragmatically focus on a content-analysis-based comparison. The study will be conducted on a purpose-built corpus encompassing a large variety of American and Italian official financial documents available on the two most significant “governmental” websites: the General Accounting Office (www. gao/gov) and the “Dipartimento della Ragioneria Generale dello Stato – National General Accounting Department”(www. rgs. mef. gov. it), respectively. Although the paradigm of the so-called user-orientation ranks as a key-concept in the American accounting realm, it does not seem to have reached a comparable standard in Italy, where financial statements and official documents have been witnessing both resistant formalism and sharp bureaucratic attitudes, despite the Italian progressive shift from <b>cash</b> to accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> {{by governments}} {{is an important}} element to transform the bureaucratic administrative cash-based system to a more informative financial management system to ensure the supply of comprehensive, reliable, and meaningful financial information for appropriate accountability and decision making. Yemen is engaged in such reform, with advent of the E-Government, Information and Telecommunication Technologies era. This study describes the Yemen Central Government’s accounting and reporting system, its institutional framework, its policy characteristics and the environmental conditions that are in favour and unfavourable of such reform change. It also investigates the relationships between attitudes, innovative and organisational factors, {{as well as the}} adoption <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> barriers and its implementation. Additionally, it investigates the moderating effects of E-Government between the abovementioned relationships during the face of change. This is to test if E-Government interaction will influence the strength and direction of the mentioned relationships in the model, and if the predictive power of that model would be increased. Finally, it examines the feasibility <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> in Yemen. This study applied multiple theories, multi-method approaches (mixed-methods), and utilised qualitative and quantitative methodologies for data (analysis), collected from questionnaires and interview surveys. Twenty hypotheses are tested. The findings show that innovative and organisational factors have a positive relationship with an attitude toward change, while barriers have a negative relationship with an attitude toward change, but E-Government has a positive relationship with an attitude toward change. The results show that institutional frameworks such as the current Yemen governmental accounting and reporting framework, have an acceptable level of moving towards accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> while accounting system objectives and reporting policy specifications reveal acceptable level of objectives and insufficient level of reporting policy. Even though the Yemen government officially announced the adoption <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> and performed several alterations on the accounting system toward accrual basis, central government accounting officials are still using (modified) <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> accounting. Computer integration, across governmental departments, is not complete. Environmental factors that contributed to change from <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> to accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> are reform stimuli, pressures related to other reforms, and forces of globalisation. The contextual variables are in favour of moving toward accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> Attitudes toward change were found to have a full mediation effect between innovation factors, organisational factors, barriers, and E-Government, emphasising the important role of accountants, financial managers, and others in the feasible adoption and implementation <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> E-Government shows a moderating effect on the relationships between all independent variables and the mediating variable of attitude toward change. This study found Government officials' attitude toward change from <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> to accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> to be very critical for the adoption and implementation of such change. Government financial officials have to be in line with the change process and their support is crucial for a successful adoption.
