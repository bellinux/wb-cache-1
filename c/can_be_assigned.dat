5|$|Between battles, {{characters}} can {{be managed}} at a Base. In this location, skills <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned,</b> weapons can be traded, purchased, and forged, and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters. There is also a Support system accessible through the Base where player characters can talk {{with each other and}} improve their relationships. These conversations improve affinity between characters and grant stat boots in battle. Supports are ranked from C to A, with A being the highest rank and granting the best bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to each character. The number of skills that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{occur when}} the player {{character}} encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place in real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters {{that can be used}} when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to different buttons on the controller.|$|E

5|$|In XML, a {{namespace}} is {{an abstract}} domain {{to which a}} collection of element and attribute names <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned.</b> The namespace name is a character string which must adhere to the generic URI syntax. However, the name is generally {{not considered to be}} a URI, because the URI specification bases the decision not only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name does not necessarily imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: may have no connotation {{to the use of the}} HTTP.|$|E
5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to each character, and each Arte <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E
5|$|Military squads <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to a barracks {{to train}} in and a uniform (armor and a weapon) can be chosen. Squads can be {{directly}} commanded to attack enemies. Crossbows {{can be made for}} ranged attacks and a range with targets can be constructed for training. Walls can be carved into fortifications and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Training areas can be made to train war animals like dogs. Players can use traps and engineering in addition to training an army. Traps can be made by constructing mechanisms and using metal or wood to construct large weapons like spikes, ax blades or cages. More complex lever-operated and pressure plate-triggering trap components are available.|$|E

If the Supreme Court needs an additional judge on a temporary basis due to illness, an unfilled position, or a justice is disqualified from sitting on a case due to a conflict of interest, the court can appoint a senior judge to serve as a judge pro tempore. Senior judges are all former, qualified judges (a minimum of 12 years on the bench) that have retired from a state court. Only former Supreme Court justices, elected Oregon circuit court judges, or elected Oregon Court of Appeals judges <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to temporary service on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of Paranthodon, BMNH 47338, {{was found}} in a layer of the Kirkwood Formation that has been dated between the Berriasian and early Valanginian ages. It {{consists}} {{of the back of the}} snout, containing the maxilla with teeth, the posterior caudodorsal ramus of the premaxilla, part of the nasals, and some isolated teeth probably from the lower jaw. One additional specimen <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to it based on the dentition, BMNH 47992, including only isolated teeth sharing the same morphology as those from the holotype. However, the teeth do not bear any autapomorphies of Paranthodon, and were referred to an indeterminate stegosaurid in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the Story Mode, players are assigned a number of points determined by their performance, with a maximum of one hundred. Using those points, the player is given the option of creating a racer with customized color and performance. The point value is distributed among five parameters: Max Speed, Acceleration, Grip, Drift, and A.G.S., which determines how fast the racer's ability gauge charges. A maximum of twenty points <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> {{to each of the}} five racing parameters. Customized racers can be used in all of the game's modes except for the Story Mode, and only the main characters and Bahamut are open to customization.|$|E

5|$|The player embarks {{with the}} {{expedition}} team (seven dwarves, their livestock and supplies), {{and does not}} have direct control over them. In order to construct and operate the fortress, the player has to designate specific tasks to be performed and the dwarves will go about it. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> any labors, but their work still depends on their relative skill with it, which can increase as they perform the said task. Some task categories are stone-working, woodworking, metalworking, farming, and crafting; there are further combat-related skills. They are categorized further, such as are leatherworking, butchery, clothesmaking, gem-related, glassmaking, and clay-related industries. Activities take place in workshops which need to be constructed; for example, stills for brewing alcohol. The metal industry has {{a very important role}} because it produces weapons and armor for the military, trap components for defense, and high-value furniture and decorations.|$|E
5|$|Tied {{into the}} battle {{system is a}} Job system: {{beginning}} with the Freelancer, the party can gain additional Jobs by obtaining gems called Asterisks from defeated human bosses. Twenty-four Jobs {{can be found in}} the game, ranging from the agile Valkyrie, and White and Black Mages that respectively specialize in healing and fighting magic. Each Job has different strengths and weaknesses in battle. Outside battle, characters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> any available Job. In addition to the skills of the equipped Job, the skills of a second Job can be learned, allowing for free customization of parties and the mixing of Job abilities in battle. After obtaining the Summoner Job, characters can use summoned monsters to launch attacks that deal high damage on all enemies. Friend characters can also be summoned from other players' games: the more a friend summon is used, the more effective their actions become. Descriptions of defeated enemies, along with story recaps and descriptions of locations, are included in an item called D's journal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and compacts, forming a creamy-white egg mass. Each egg mass may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a single cell to a veliger (a larval form common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are Stage III, and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are Stage IV. L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E
