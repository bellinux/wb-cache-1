5|$|In Europe, a <b>cohort</b> {{study of}} 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective <b>cohort</b> study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective <b>cohort</b> of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E

30|$|Since our {{simulation}} results {{are based on}} the very poor performance of the Eastern Germany labour market since reunification, we have also analysed an alternative scenario {{based on the assumption that}} future employment careers of younger birth <b>cohorts</b> follow the average trend over all <b>cohorts</b> in our observation period. This assumption implies that the future careers of younger birth <b>cohorts</b> improve markedly relative to those of older birth <b>cohorts</b> to compensate for the large difference in unemployment already cumulated by younger birth <b>cohorts</b> at the end of the observation period. In this scenario, the strong employment decline and dramatic increase in cumulated unemployment among younger birth <b>cohorts</b> would be significantly dampened although not fully compensated. This more optimistic scenario would not only require a substantial overall improvement of the East German labour market but also an improvement of future employment careers of younger birth <b>cohorts</b> relative to those of older <b>cohorts.</b> This does not seem very likely, given that the high level of long-term unemployment accumulated since reunification may well have negative effects on future employment careers.|$|R
30|$|If {{we compare}} the same picture for the MENA region, {{we find that}} younger <b>cohorts</b> have {{consistently}} better FPRs.

It starts after only one period for <b>cohorts</b> 25 - 29 and 35 - 39 and after two periods for <b>cohorts</b> 20 - 24 and 30 - 34 (recall that labels refer to age in 1990). This means that FPRs start to decline at age 30 - 34 for the two younger <b>cohorts</b> and at age 40 - 44 for the two older <b>cohorts.</b> Hence, older <b>cohorts</b> have lower FPRs but their tenure in participation is longer. Overall, these results are fairly consistent with results in the top panel of Figure  3 and point to an early female exit from the labor force, but they also show no improvements in tenure for younger <b>cohorts,</b> which may contribute to the explanation of why MENA countries drag for so long around the saddle point of the curve.|$|R

5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of {{the great}} majority of regiments followed a standard configuration: unit type, followed by serial number, followed by name of the peregrini tribe (or nation) from whom the regiment was originally raised, in the genitive plural case e.g. cohors III Batavorum ("3rd <b>Cohort</b> of Batavi"); cohors I Brittonum ("1st <b>Cohort</b> of Britons"). Some regiments combine the names of two peregrini tribes, most likely after the merger of two previously separate regiments e.g. ala I Pannoniorum et Gallorum ("1st Wing of Pannonii and Gauls"). A minority of regiments are named after an individual, mostly after the first prefect of the regiment e.g. ala Sulpicia (presumably named after a prefect whose middle (gens) name was Sulpicius).

5|$|These were cohortes with a cavalry {{contingent}} attached. There {{is evidence}} that their numbers expanded {{with the passage of}} time. Only about 40% of attested cohortes are specifically attested as equitatae in inscriptions, which is probably the original Augustan proportion. A study of units stationed in Syria in the mid-2nd century found that many units which did not carry the equitata title did in fact contain cavalrymen e.g. by discovery of a tombstone of a cavalryman attached to the <b>cohort.</b> This implies that by that time, at least 70% of cohortes were probably equitatae. The addition of cavalry to a <b>cohort</b> obviously enabled it to carry out a wider range of independent operations. A cohors equitata was in effect a self-contained mini-army.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cohort</b> studies select {{subjects}} {{based on}} their exposure status.

However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, Pe=A/(A+B) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, P'u=C/(C+D), i.e. RR=Pe/Pu.|$|E

40|$|Introduction] Prostaglandin E {{receptor}} 4 (PTGER 4) is {{implicated in}} immune regulation and bone metabolism. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze its role in radiological joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). [Methods] Six independent <b>cohorts</b> of patients with RA of European or North American descent were included, comprising 1789 patients with 5083 sets of X-rays. The Hospital Clínico San Carlos Rheumatoid Arthritis, Princesa Early Arthritis Register Longitudinal study, and Hospital Universitario de La Paz early arthritis (Spain) <b>cohorts</b> were used as discovery <b>cohorts,</b> and the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (The Netherlands), Wichita (United States), and National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases (United States and Canada) <b>cohorts</b> as replication <b>cohorts.</b> First, the PTGER 4 rs 6896969 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was genotyped using TaqMan assays and available Illumina Immunochip data and studied in the discovery and replication <b>cohorts.</b> Second, the PTGER 4 gene and adjacent regions were analyzed using Immunochip genotyping data in the discovery <b>cohorts.</b> On the basis of pooled p values, linkage disequilibrium structure of the region, and location in regions with transcriptional properties, SNPs were selected for replication. The results from discovery, replication, and overall <b>cohorts</b> were pooled using inverse-variance–weighted meta-analysis. Influence of the polymorphisms on the overall radiological damage (constant effect) and on damage progression over time (time-varying effect) was analyzed. [Results] The rs 6896969 polymorphism showed a significant association with radiological damage in the constant effect pooled analysis of the discovery <b>cohorts,</b> although no significant association was observed in the replication <b>cohorts</b> or the overall pooled analysis. Regarding the analysis of the PTGER 4 region, 976 variants were analyzed in the discovery <b>cohorts.</b> From the constant and time-varying effect analyses, 12 and 20 SNPs, respectively, were selected for replication.

40|$|Background : Teen {{and young}} adult mothers have lower {{socioeconomic}} status than older mothers. Objective : This study analyzes the socioeconomic status (SES) of teen, young adult, and older adult mothers across four five-year birth <b>cohorts</b> from 1956 to 1975 who were teens from 1971 to 1994. Methods : Data were pooled from the 1995, 2002, and 2006 - 2010 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Mothers were categorized by {{age at first}} birth and by their birth <b>cohorts.</b> The SES (education, single motherhood, poverty, employment) of teen, young adult, and older mothers was compared across <b>cohorts</b> and within <b>cohorts.</b> Results : Among teen mothers, the odds of fulltime employment improved across birth <b>cohorts</b> and the odds of educational attainment beyond high school did not vary. Their odds of single motherhood and living in poverty increased across <b>cohorts.</b> The odds of higher education and single motherhood increased across birth <b>cohorts</b> for young adult mothers as did the odds of living in poverty, even if working fulltime. Among older adult mothers, educational attainment and the odds of single motherhood rose for recent <b>cohorts.</b> Conclusions : Comparisons between teen mothers and both young adult and all adult mothers within <b>cohorts</b> suggest that gaps in single motherhood and poverty between teen and adult mothers have widened over time, {{to the detriment of}} teen mothers.
