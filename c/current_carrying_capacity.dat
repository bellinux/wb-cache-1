However, the efficiency {{of this type of}} solar cells is limited by some fundamental weaknesses such as 1) high metal shading; 2) high recombination at front contact regions and rear surface; and 3) parasitic light absorption at the rear surface. This thesis investigates methods to improve front and rear metallization to overcome these limitations and increase the cell efficiency. On the front side, the development of a novel screen-printing based metallization scheme is presented. An efficiency gain of 1. 1 % absolute is demonstrated on this advanced semiconductor finger structure compared to a conventional screen printed solar cell fabricated under the same environment. This is achieved by incorporating laser doping and metal plating to reduce shading and recombination losses, while maintaining the large <b>current</b> <b>carry</b> <b>capacity</b> and solderability of screen printed metal. Further investigation on the voltage potential of the advanced semiconductor finger front shows over 700 mV implied VOC and 680 mV real VOC can be achieved on test structures using solar grade p-type CZ wafer. On the rear side, the thesis investigates a passivated and locally contacted structure using laser to open the dielectric layer followed by screen printing to form contacts. Optimization of the process conditions to minimize the Kirkendall void formation while maintaining an adequate thickness of localized back surface field is presented. Cell efficiency of over 20 % is demonstrated on solar grade p-type CZ substrate. An alternative approach is investigated in which deep boron laser doping is incorporated to pre-form the localized back surface field to avoid the trade-off between Kirkendall voids and adequate localized back surface field formation.

40|$|The ITER Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICC) are {{composed}} of an assembly of pure copper wires and composite superconducting strands (with embedded brittle Nb 3 Sn microfilaments) cabled together and inserted in a stainless steal jacket. If the <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of individual ITER strands are clearly identified, by a dependence of the critical current on the applied strain and by a statistical quantification of possible microfilaments breakage, the characterization of cable-in-conduit is not yet fully achieved. What are the local strain values of strands inside CICCs under operating conditions is still an open question. A deeper understanding of how local strains develop and where critical strains appear in complex cabled structures could help to optimize CICCs designs in term of losses of conductivity. The present work aims at providing for a finite element model of CIC conductors, able to predict local strains, especially bending, at the scale of individual strands. The finite element software, MULTIFIL, initially developed to model various kinds of entangled media, has been adapted to consider the specific issues related to CIC conductors. The MULTIFIL's main feature is basically to handle the evolution of contact-friction interactions between wires. In this study, the initial conductors' geometry (trajectories of all individual wires), a priori unknown, is determined by a simulation of the shaping process by means of moving rigid tools. Starting from formed cables, both the thermal restraint and the transverse Lorentz loads are simulated through successive applications of proper loading. An important issue concerns proper boundary conditions to be applied at each strands ends. In that sense, the so-called pseudoperiodic boundary conditions, relevant to cable modelling, will be introduced. By the way, experimental and numerical “Force/Displacements” curves, obtained on cables under standard axial and transverse loading, show good agreement. A quantitative approach based on metallographic analysis of sub-cables and comparison of conductor's sections with numerical results will be presented as well. Results of full simulations (from initial shaping to magnetic loading) will be exposed for different conductors. Relevant information at the scale of strands (curvatures and strains distributions) can be retrieved from these simulations. The influence of changes in global design parameters (pitches lengths, void fraction and strands material properties) on local strains will be shown and discussed.

It follows that the sustainability of tourism depends simultaneously upon the sustainable use of local resources and the minimisation of the costs of conflict between the populations involved. The latter also depend on attitudes and perceptions that distinct groups of residents have toward tourism and other groups in their community. This issue is investigated within the tourism <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> framework. The paper analyses both theoretically and empirically the likely outcomes of conflicts between distinct groups of residents.
