5|$|Romulus' father Orestes was a Roman citizen, {{originally}} from Pannonia, {{who had served}} as a secretary and diplomat for Attila the Hun and later rose through the ranks of the Roman army. The future emperor was named Romulus after his maternal grandfather, a nobleman from Poetovio in Noricum. Many historians have noted the <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last western emperor bore the names of both Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, and Augustus, the first emperor.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court. It was no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E

25|$|Heating is {{the most}} obvious application, but solar cooling can be {{achieved}} for a building or district cooling network by using a heat-driven absorption or adsorption chiller (heat pump). There is a productive <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> greater the driving heat from insulation, the greater the cooling output. In 1878, Auguste Mouchout pioneered solar cooling by making ice using a solar steam engine attached to a refrigeration device.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest and}} most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version {{composed}} c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and the Lay of el Cid in Spain). It is perhaps no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot {{may be seen as}} a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E

25|$|On January 24, 1996, {{after the}} musical's final dress {{rehearsal}} before its off-Broadway opening, Larson {{had his first}} (and only) newspaper interview with music critic Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, attracted by the <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see Rent's success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome) {{in the early morning}} of January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of Rent became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.|$|E
25|$|On the {{accession}} of Ismail Pasha, Nubar Bey was in {{the prime}} of life. He was already on friendly terms with him; he even claimed to have saved his life — at all events, it was a <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two had together refused to travel by the train an accident to which caused the death (on May 14, 1858) of the prince Ahmed, who would otherwise have succeeded Said. Ismail, himself a more capable man than his immediate predecessors, at once recognized the ability of Nubar, and charged him with a mission to Constantinople, not only to notify his accession, but to smooth the way for the many ambitious projects he already entertained, notably the completion of the Suez Canal, the change in title to that of khedive and the change in the order of succession.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the practice of}} quarantine drove Hamilton's work in public health. It was no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hygienic Laboratory began in an attic at Staten Island's Marine Hospital, near Ellis Island, the single busiest port of entry for immigrants during this period. Earlier on, Hamilton had established a Marine Hospital on Bedloe's Island, future site of the Statue of Liberty. Although MHS would not receive formal authority to issue domestic quarantines until 1893, Hamilton and his staff worked with the Congress to advance incremental changes toward a national policy. Maritime quarantine legislation (Act of August 1, 1888) strengthened the Act of 1878, adding new Federal quarantine stations along the East and West coasts; March 1891 legislation made medical inspection of immigrants part of MHS's duties; and interstate quarantine legislation (Act of March 27, 1890) gave MHS authority to establish quarantines against epidemic cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, and plague. On the request of his successor, Surgeon General Walter Wyman, Hamilton also returned to New York during the 1892 cholera pandemic, {{to set up a}} quarantine camp at Sandy Hook (Camp Low).|$|E

[...] "For this is another in the growing list of Hollywood melodramatic {{exercises}} in which the war is dragged in simply to give an old story formula a semblance of freshness. In this case Paramount even stretched a point in labeling the film 'Night Plane From Chungking', for it is by <b>the</b> merest of <b>coincidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> characters get aboard a transport plane {{on their way to}} the Indian frontier, and at that they are quickly shot down by a squadron of Japs." ...|$|R

500|$|Some {{believe that}} the modern breed is {{actually}} the same one mentioned in the Bible, having accompanied the westward expansion of human civilisation through Northern Africa, Sicily, Spain and eventually England. Elisha Gootwine, a sheep expert at the Israeli Agriculture Ministry, says that the resemblance of a British breed to the Bible story is a <b>coincidence,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breed was not indigenous to ancient Israel, and that [...] "Jacob Sheep are related to Jacob {{the same as the}} American Indians are related to India".|$|E
500|$|The first charter {{produced}} by [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] in 928 described the king as rex Anglorum, [...] "king of the English", {{the first time}} that title had been used. By 931 he had become [...] "king of the English, elevated by the right hand of the Almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain". Some charters were witnessed by Welsh kings, and occasionally by the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde, signifying acceptance of Æthelstan's lordship. In Keynes's view, it cannot be a <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> charters commenced immediately after the conquest of Northumbria, and [...] "Æthelstan A"'s primary aim was to display the [...] "grandeur of Æthelstan's kingship". Foot argues that the king's inner circle quickly seized on the potential of the conquest for [...] "ideological aggrandizement of the king's public standing". To Keynes, the diplomas [...] "are symbolic of a monarchy invigorated by success, developing the pretensions commensurate with its actual achievements and clothing itself in the trappings of a new political order." [...] He sees the fifty years from 925 to 975 as [...] "the golden age of the Anglo-Saxon royal diploma".|$|E
500|$|Scholars such as Charles Oman {{note that}} {{one element of}} the children's account, the entry into a {{different}} reality {{by way of a}} cave, seems to have been quite popular. Gerald of Wales tells a similar story of a boy who, after escaping his master, [...] "encountered two pigmies who led him through an underground passage into a beautiful land with fields and rivers, but not lit by the full light of the sun". But the motif is poorly attested; E. W. Baughman lists it as the only example of his F103.1 category of English and North American folk tale motifs: [...] "Inhabitants of lower world visit mortals, and continue to live with them". Martin Walsh considers the references to St Martin to be significant, and sees the story of the green children as evidence that the feast of Martinmas has its origins in an English aboriginal past, of which the children's story forms [...] "the lowest stratum". [...] suggests a Celtic connection in a 1900 edition of Notes and Queries: [...] "'Green' spirits are 'sinless' in Celtic literature and tradition... It may be more than a <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> green girl marries a 'man of [...] Lynn.' Here the original [...] would be lein, evil, i.e. the pure fairy marries a sinful child of earth." ...|$|E

500|$|Many Muslims saw the {{cartoons}} {{as a sign}} of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West. Egyptian preacher and television star Amr Khaled urged his followers to take action to remedy supposed Western ignorance, saying, [...] "It is our duty to the prophet of God to make his message known... Do not say that this is the task of the ulema (religious scholars)it is the task of all of us." [...] Ana Soage said, [...] "the targeting of a religious symbol like Muhammad, the only prophet that Muslims do not share with Jews and Christians, was perceived as the last in a long list of humiliations and assaults: it is probably not a <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> more violent demonstrations were held in countries like Syria, Iran and Libya, whose relations with the West are tense." [...] Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic theologian, called for a day of anger from Muslims in response to {{the cartoons}}. He supported calls for a UN resolution that [...] "categorically prohibits affronts to prophetsto the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, [...] "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence." ...|$|E

[...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make everything all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not to do that to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up".
