5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> dismounted which meant that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Force were {{exempt from}} {{service as a}} peace officer or parish officer, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{compelled}} to serve on a jury; field officers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> required {{to serve as a}} high sheriff. Officers of the Force who were sheriffs were discharged from performing this duty when embodied, with the responsibility taken by the under sheriff. Accepting a commission as an officer of the Force did not vacate the seat of a Member of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the prior}} CBA, players <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> traded {{until after the}} lockout was resolved, meaning Roberto Luongo <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> moved. Once a new CBA was reached, the trade rumors returned, {{including}} one that alleged Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke was fired {{in order to help}} facilitate a trade. For his part, Luongo reiterated {{that he was willing to}} remain with the Canucks for the shortened season, but did not want to remain long-term.|$|E
5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines was {{released}} on November 16, 2004 in competition with Half-Life 2, , Halo 2, and several other titles. Valve's contract for Troika's use of the Source engine guaranteed that Bloodlines <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> released before Half-Life 2, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> introduced to the public until after the announcement of Half-Life 2, over eighteen months after development began. In February 2004, the game was scheduled for release in spring 2005, partially to avoid competing with Half-Life 2 and the competitive Christmas period, before Activision moved the date to November 2004.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> installed incorrectly.|$|E
6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California. It <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for the prospect, since a more barren, dreary, monotonous, and uninviting {{landscape}} never stretched before human eye; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for convenience or contiguity, as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for health or salubrity, as {{the breath of}} the ague-haunted tules in the outlying Stockton marshes swept through the valley; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for space or comfort, for, encamped on an unlimited plain, {{men and women were}} huddled together as closely as in an urban tenement-house, without the freedom or decency of rural isolation; it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> for pleasant companionship, as dejection, mental anxiety, tears, and lamentation were the dominant expression; it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a hurried flight from present or impending calamity, for the camp had been deliberately planned, and for a week pioneer wagons had been slowly arriving; it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> an irrevocable exodus, for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places. It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|R

5|$|By early afternoon, the strong-point {{guarding}} the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy.

5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen.

5|$|Despite {{criticism}} {{that such a}} large event <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> carbon-friendly, the presidential committee incorporated environment-friendly measures in its planning of the inaugural events.
