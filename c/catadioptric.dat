In these devices lenses are sometimes paired up with curved mirrors to make a <b>catadioptric</b> system where the lens's spherical aberration corrects the opposite aberration in the mirror (such as Schmidt and meniscus correctors).|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} apparatus was a [...] H Wilkins & Co. <b>catadioptric.</b> The {{light source}} was twelve kerosene lamps with a parabolic reflector for each lamp, on a revolving iron frame, in four groups of three. Two groups {{were white and}} two groups were red, resulting in a light characteristic of an alternating red and white, with intensities of 500cd and 200cd, respectively. It was originally manned by three keepers.|$|E

In 1928–1930, the keepers' cottages were replaced with timber framed fibro clad structures. In 1930, the lantern underwent major modification. The lantern house was replaced with [...] diameter Chance Brothers lantern room. The optical apparatus was replaced with either a third order Chance Bros dioptric lens or a four panel [...] AGA <b>catadioptric</b> lens on an AGA pedestal. The light source was replaced by an AGA incandescent gas mantle operated by acetylene gas, and a sun valve was also installed.|$|E

50|$|A <b>catadioptric</b> sensor is {{a visual}} sensor that {{contains}} mirrors (catoptrics) and lenses (dioptrics), a combined <b>catadioptric</b> system. These are panoramic sensors created by pointing a camera at a curved mirror.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>catadioptric</b> {{optical system}} {{is one where}} {{refraction}} and reflection are combined in an optical system, usually via lenses (dioptrics) and curved mirrors (catoptrics). <b>Catadioptric</b> combinations are used in focusing systems such as search lights, headlamps, early lighthouse focusing systems, optical telescopes, microscopes, and telephoto lenses. Other optical systems that use lenses and mirrors are {{also referred to as}} [...] "catadioptric" [...] such as surveillance <b>catadioptric</b> sensors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catadioptric</b> dialytes are the {{earliest}} type of <b>catadioptric</b> telescope. They {{consist of a}} single-element refractor objective combined with a silver-backed negative lens (similar to a Mangin mirror). The first of these was the Hamiltonian telescope patented by W. F. Hamilton in 1814. The Schupmann medial telescope designed by German optician Ludwig Schupmann {{near the end of}} the 19th century placed the <b>catadioptric</b> mirror beyond the focus of the refractor primary and added a third correcting/focusing lens to the system.|$|E

50|$|<b>Catadioptric</b> lens - <b>catadioptric</b> lenses are {{a form of}} {{telephoto}} lens but with a light path that doubles back on itself and with an objective that is a mirror combined with some form aberration correcting lens (a <b>catadioptric</b> system) rather than just a lens. A centrally-placed secondary mirror and usually an additional small lens group bring the light to focus. Such lenses are very lightweight and can easily deliver very long focal lengths but they can only deliver a fixed aperture and have none {{of the benefits of}} being able to stop down the aperture to increase depth of field.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{general purpose}} {{photographic}} <b>catadioptric</b> lens was Dmitri Maksutov 1944 MTO (Maksutov Tele-Objectiv) 500mm f/8 Maksutov-Cassegrain configuration, adapted from his 1941 Maksutov telescope. Designs followed using other optical configurations including Schmidt configuration and solid <b>catadioptric</b> designs (made {{from a single}} glass cylinder with a maksutov or aspheric form polished into the front face and the back spherical surface silvered to make the [...] "mirror"). In 1979 Tamron was able to produce a very compact light weight <b>catadioptric</b> by using rear surface silvered mirrors, a [...] "Mangin mirror" [...] configuration that saved on mass by having the aberration corrected by the light passing through the mirror itself.|$|E
5000|$|Mangin mirrors {{are used}} in {{illumination}} and image forming optics such as search lights, headlamps, aircraft gunsights and head-mounted displays. Many <b>Catadioptric</b> telescopes use negative lenses with a reflective coating on the back surface that {{are referred to as}} [...] "Mangin mirrors", although they are not single-element objectives like the original Mangin, and some, like the Hamiltonian telescope, predate the Mangin's invention by over 60 years. <b>Catadioptric</b> mirrors similar to the Mangin are found in the Klevtsov-Cassegrain, Argunov-Cassegrain telescopes, and Ludwig Schupmann's Schupmann medial telescope. They are also used in compact <b>catadioptric</b> photographic lens designs that save on mass since aberration can be corrected by mirror itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catadioptric</b> {{combinations}} {{have been}} used in many early optical systems. In the 1820s, Augustin-Jean Fresnel developed several <b>catadioptric</b> lighthouse reflectors. Léon Foucault developed a <b>catadioptric</b> microscope in 1859 to counteract aberrations of using a lens to image objects at high power. In 1876 a French engineer, A. Mangin, invented {{what has come to be}} called the Mangin mirror, a concave glass reflector with the silver surface on the rear side of the glass. The two surfaces of the reflector have different radii to correct the aberration of the spherical mirror. Light passes through the glass twice, making the overall system act like a triplet lens. Mangin mirrors were used in searchlights, where they produced a nearly true parallel beam. Many <b>Catadioptric</b> telescopes use negative lenses with a reflective coating on the backside that are referred to as “Mangin mirrors”, although they are not single-element objectives like the original Mangin, and some even predate the Mangin's invention.|$|E

50|$|Several {{companies}} made <b>catadioptric</b> lenses {{throughout the}} later {{part of the}} 20th century. Nikon (under the Mirror-Nikkor and later Reflex-Nikkor names) and Canon both offered several designs, such as 500 mm 1:8 and 1000 mm 1:11. Smaller companies such as f.e. Tamron, Samyang, Vivitar, and Opteka also offered several versions, with the three latter of these brands still actively producing a number of <b>catadioptric</b> lenses for use in modern system cameras. Sony (formerly Minolta) offered a 500 mm <b>catadioptric</b> lens for their Alpha range of cameras.

5000|$|<b>Catadioptric</b> {{photographic}} lenses (or [...] "CAT" [...] for short) combine many historical inventions {{such as the}} <b>Catadioptric</b> Mangin mirror (1874), Schmidt camera (1931), and the Maksutov telescope (1941) {{along with}} Laurent Cassegrain's Cassegrain telescope (1672). The Cassegrain system folds the light path and the convex secondary acts as a telephoto element, making the focal length even longer than the folded system and extending the light cone to a focal point well behind the primary mirror so it can reach the film plane of the attached camera. The <b>Catadioptric</b> system, where a spherical reflector is combined with a lens with the opposite spherical aberration, corrects the common optical errors of a reflector such as the Cassegrain system, making it suitable for devices that need a large aberration free focal plane (cameras).|$|E
50|$|Most apochromatic ('APO') lenses do {{not have}} an Infrared index mark and {{do not need to be}} refocused for the {{infrared}} spectrum because they are already optically corrected into the near-infrared spectrum. <b>Catadioptric</b> lenses do not often require this adjustment because their mirror containing elements do not suffer from chromatic aberration and so the overall aberration is comparably less. <b>Catadioptric</b> lenses do, of course, still contain lenses, and these lenses do still have a dispersive property.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catadioptric</b> Cassegrains use two mirrors, {{often with}} a spherical primary mirror to reduce cost, {{combined}} with refractive corrector element(s) to correct the resulting aberrations.|$|E
50|$|Various {{types of}} <b>catadioptric</b> systems {{are also used}} in camera lenses known {{alternatively}} as <b>catadioptric</b> lenses (CATs), reflex lenses, or mirror lenses. These lenses use some form of the cassegrain design which greatly reduces the physical length of the optical assembly, partly by folding the optical path, but mostly through the telephoto effect of the convex secondary mirror which multiplies the focal length many times (up to 4 to 5 times). This creates lenses with focal lengths from 250 mm up to and beyond 1000 mm that are much shorter and compact than their long-focus or telephoto counterparts. Moreover, chromatic aberration, a major problem with long refractive lenses, and off-axis aberration, a major problem with reflective telescopes, is almost completely eliminated by the <b>catadioptric</b> system, making the image they produce suitable to fill the large focal plane of a camera.|$|E
