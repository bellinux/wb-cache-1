My remarks are based on my experience as a World Bank economist providing policy advice to countries of Eastern Europe, in particular Hungary.

There are two important issues that arise once the political decision to decentralize is made: the first is to design—or redesign—the institutional framework. All the laws of the country have to be redone; new systems have to be put in place; etc. to adapt tax policy, grants and transfers, tax administration, expenditure policies and budget management. Having well functioning institutions is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for successful decentralization. The second important issue is sequencing. This is important to ensure that the overall incentive structure is correctly set up.

Effectively this left Blumenthal open to perjury charges and the additional costs that the legal proceedings would entail. It left a rift between Blumenthal and Hitchens. The major break was over the 'War on Terrorism' beginning in 2001 when Hitchens launched an attack on Noam Chomsky for the position he took in the aftermath of 9/11.

On the night before polling day, 24 May 2007, Fitzpatrick distributed leaflets to households asking people to vote for her as their first preference. In {{the early hours of}} the following morning, a letter had been hand-delivered from Ahern's office to 30,000 voters in the constituency, urging them give their first preference to the Taoiseach and their second to Brady. Since Ahern was expected to be elected with a large surplus, and the overall Fianna Fáil vote was likely to be large enough to elect two candidates, the destination of the Taoiseach's transfers would determine whether Brady or Fitzpatrick won the second Fianna Fáil seat in Dublin Central. After Ahern's transfers secured Brady's election, Fitzpatrick complained that [...] "I didn't think they'd go out to completely undermine me and shaft me." [...] Ahern's election agent Chris Wall blamed Fitzpatrick, saying [...] "She was asked not to do this sort of thing.

Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked [...] "real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs". She stated: [...] "It is disgraceful to see a publicly funded broadcaster deliberately spreading misinformation about the child protection process because it is too lazy and arrogant to get it right. We regularly give advice to programmes about social work storylines; we would like to know who advised EastEnders so badly. Social workers have a difficult enough job as it is. Unlike the writers and actors on EastEnders, they have to step through those front doors that no one else wants to step through, and they do it on a daily basis, to protect children, not to target families. EastEnders shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made a tough job even tougher."

40|$|The couch {{has long}} been the most widely {{recognised}} icon of psychoanalysis, save perhaps for the image of Freud. The couch is identified as pertaining, or even essential, to psychoanalysis, even by the most psychoanalytically unacquainted of laypersons.

In either case, the icon of the couch seems serviceable for humorous, anxiety-softening remarks on one’s first visit to therapy. Even at the other extreme of psychoanalytic familiarity, the couch had for many years been a distinguishing feature of psychoanalysis “proper”. Once upon a time, it could reassure us that we were indeed doing psychoanalysis with our patients—before the very definition of psychoanalysis became less certain (Goldberg, 1990), before the border between psychoanalysis and other psychotherapies became less secure...|$|R

In three dimensions there is a threshold in the coupling strength for the existence of Bose-gas superconductivity at very low carrier concentrations, and, for strengths slightly above the threshold, the pair binding energy is proportional to the square of the difference of the coupling from the threshold value. Thus, for example, an error in calculated coupling giving a value 5 % above threshold instead of 1 % above threshold would make a factor of 25 error in the pair binding energy.

I just added this introductory paragraph. If need be, I will publish an updated version later. We introduce the notion of hard homogeneous space (HHS) and briefly develop the corresponding theory. We show that cryptographic protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem have a counterpart for any hard homogeneous space. Indeed, the notion of hard homogeneous space is a more general and more natural context for these protocols. We exhibit conjectural hard homogeneous spaces independant from any discrete logarithm problem. They are based on complex multiplication theory. This shows the existence of schemes for authentication and key exchange that do not rely on the difficulty of computing dicrete logarithm in any finite group nor factoring integers. We show that the concept of HHS fits with class field theory to provide a unified theory for the already used discrete logarithm problems (on multiplicative groups of finite fields or rational points on elliptic curves) and the HHS we present here. We discuss a few algorithmic questions related to hard homogeneous spaces. The paper is looking for a wider point of view on the discrete logarithm problem both mathematically and cryptographically...|$|R
