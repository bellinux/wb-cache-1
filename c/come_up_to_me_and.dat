It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, 'No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.'" [...] Cast member Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name [...] "F" [...] and lived in the room next door at his college.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to keep his anonymity, Grohl planned to release the songs under the name Foo Fighters. It {{would be a very}} low-key release, with only 100 LP records being pressed after the {{sessions}} were finished. Grohl also went to a cassette duplication lab in Seattle and created 100 cassette copies of the session and started handing them to friends for feedback and [...] "I'd give tapes to everybody. Kids would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say 'Nirvana was my favourite band' and I'd say 'well here, have this'". Eddie Vedder premiered two songs from the recording on January 8, 1995 during his Self-Pollution radio broadcast. The recordings quickly circulated amongst the music industry, which in turn created record label interest. A deal was eventually signed to Capitol Records, as president Gary Gersh was a personal friend of Grohl ever since he worked on Nirvana's label Geffen Records.|$|E

500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E
500|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles at age 23, he composed, arranged, and {{performed}} alongside Yanni {{for more than}} six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame. [...] His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra filming a video project. [...] "It was a real trial by fire for me", said Joseph. [...] "First show + 10,000 people + TV cameras equals NERVOUS." [...] He told Jane Fredericksen of the St. Croix Valley Press that [...] "It was a big jump, you don't really realize it at the time, but there's no in-between — going from playing nightclubs to arenas." [...] Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion, Revolution in Sound, Dare to Dream, Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers. [...] Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, Live at the Acropolis. [...] He recounts, [...] "When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni. [...] Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems. [...] I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show. [...] People still <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> comment how that show has affected their lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Howarth {{went on to}} say Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding did {{not make}} sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. [...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said. [...] "People have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.'

2500|$|Pete's catchphrase was [...] "alright treacle?" [...] {{pronounced}} [...] "awight treacle", {{often used}} when addressing female characters. Peter Dean has discussed why the catchphrase came into existence: [...] "I had this saying - treacle. There was this long scene with Den and his mistress and I {{had to ask}} her for a drink, but I completely forgot her name, so said 'Give us a drink, treacle'. And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I could say {{it was in the}} script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea. And it just means someone sweet and nice. I always said it and my granddad said it. Even now people <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> ask if I'll say 'awight treacle' down their mobile phone to someone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, {{band members}} {{continued}} with the sentiment {{that it was}} possible, depending mostly on everyone's schedule. In a November 2011 interview, Patrick said {{of the future of}} the band: Those guys are amazing, it's basically this simple: Robert has a studio in his basement where he can totally do his old-fashioned kind of classic sound. They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it {{for a week or two}} and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> talk about that Army of Anyone record". And I think that I honestly could probably do a way better job just 'cause of what I've learned lately as a singer...I think the best Army of Anyone record is still to come, it's still totally doable and could be even better.|$|E
2500|$|June 12, 2009: Both teams played {{each other}} {{for the first time at}} the new Yankee Stadium. The game had several lead changes, {{including}} Mariano Rivera giving up the go ahead run to the Mets in the 8th. In the bottom of the 9th, after Derek Jeter stole 2nd base and Mark Teixeira was intentionally walked, the Mets new closer Francisco Rodríguez (K-Rod) paired off against Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod). In what seemed a routine pop with two outs, Mets 2nd baseman and three time gold glove award winner Luis Castillo dropped the ball. Teixeira wound up scoring the winning run all the way from first on the error to give the Yankees the 9-8 victory. It would prove to be the Yankees' 7th walk off game that season and the first statistical blown save for K-Rod as a Met. After the game, injured Yankees pitcher Brian Bruney criticized K-Rod and his animated behavior on the mound to reporters. [...] " [...] couldn't have happened to a better guy on the mound, either", said Bruney. [...] "He's got a tired act. ... He gets what he deserves, man. I just don't like watching the guy pitch. I think it's embarrassing." [...] Rodriguez responded, [...] "Instead of sending a message in the paper, next time when he sees me at Citi Field, <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say it. Don't be sending a message to the media. I don't even know who that guy is, somewhere in Double-A and not even pitching one full season." ...|$|E
