Examination of the interpersonal lives of depressed women reveals several characteristics that portend recurrent depression and intergenerational transmission of depression. From a large community sample of families in which the mothers had varying histories of depressive disorders (or no depression), 4 sources of stress are illustrated: marriage to men with psychopathology, children with disorders and impaired functioning, marital distress and relatively problematic relationships with children, and high levels of stressful life events to which these sources have contributed. These stressful circumstances were then shown to predict current depressive episodes (recurrence) and symptomatology.

Differential susceptibility of only older leaves to water stress in the field during summer months appeared related to gradients in leaf osmotic potential within the plant and by an age dependency {{in the ability of}} leaves to adjust osmotically when challenged by periodic water deficits. Under greenhouse conditions, older leaves senesced invariably during an imposed water stress while control leaves of comparable age and stressed younger leaves remained green.

PolyQ tracts may impede the activity of the proteasome, and evidence from single cell imaging suggests that the sequestration of polyQ into inclusion bodies can reduce the proteasomal burden and promote cell survival, {{at least in the short}} term. The presence of misfolded protein also leads to activation of stress kinases such as p 38 MAPK, which can be cytotoxic. The relationships of these systems are not well understood. We have used fluorescent reporter systems imaged in living cells, and stochastic computer modeling to explore the relationships of polyQ, p 38 MAPK activation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteasome inhibition, and inclusion body formation. In cells expressing a polyQ protein inclusion, body formation was preceded by proteasome inhibition but cytotoxicity was greatly reduced by administration of a p 38 MAPK inhibitor. Computer simulations suggested that without the generation of ROS, the proteasome inhibition and activation of p 38 MAPK would have significantly reduced toxicity.

Typical intraplate continental crust has hydrostatic fluid pressure and a near-surface thermal gradient of 31 [*]±[*] 15 degrees Celsius per kilometre 2, 3. At temperatures above 300 – 450 degrees Celsius, usually found at depths greater than 10 – 15 kilometres, the intra-crystalline plasticity of quartz and feldspar relieves stress by aseismic creep and earthquakes are infrequent. Hydrothermal conditions control the stability of mineral phases and hence frictional–mechanical processes associated with earthquake rupture cycles, but there are few temperature and fluid pressure data from active plate-bounding faults. Here we report results from a borehole drilled into {{the upper part of}} the Alpine Fault, which is late in its <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> accumulation and expected to rupture in a magnitude 8 earthquake in the coming decades 4, 5.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new theoretical model {{to describe the}} spatial variability in tillage forces {{for the purpose of}} fatigue analysis of tillage machines. The proposed model took into account both the variability in tillage system parameters (soil engineering properties, tool design parameters and operational conditions) and the cyclic effects of mechanical behavior of the soil during failure ahead of tillage tools on the spatial variability in tillage forces. The stress-based fatigue life approach was used to determine the life time of tillage machines, {{based on the fact that}} the applied stress on tillage machines is primarily within the elastic range of the material. Stress cycles with their mean values and amplitudes were determined by the rainflow algorithm. The damage friction caused by each <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> was computed according to the Soderberg criterion and the total damage was calculated by the Miner's law. The proposed model was applied to determine the spatial variability in tillage forces on the shank of a chisel plough. The equivalent stress history resulted from these forces were calculated by means of a finite element model and the Von misses criterion. The histograms of mean stress and stress amplitude obtained by the rainflow algorithm showed significant dispersions. Although the equivalent stress is smaller than the yield stress of the material, the failure by fatigue will occur after a certain travel distance. The expected distance to failure was found to be df= 0. 825 × 106 km. It is concluded that the spatial variability in tillage forces has significant effect on the life time of tillage machines and should be considered in the design analysis of tillage machines to predict the life time. Further investigations are required to correlate the results achieved by the proposed model with field tests and to validate the proposed assumptions to model the spatial variability in tillage force...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} research demonstrating {{the link between}} depression and interpersonal stress. This literature has included support for the phenomenon of stress generation, or the tendency for individuals with depression histories to {{have higher levels of}} stress in their lives, particularly interpersonal stressors, even after depression remits. Currently missing from the existing literature, but supported by multiple psychological theories and research on constructs related to depression, is the possibility that individuals prone to depression may self-select into maladaptive romantic partnerships that promote stress and exacerbate depression. The current project sought to explore whether depression portends risk for choosing romantic partners with higher levels of psychopathology or disordered personality traits. This question was explored in two complementary studies. Study 1 utilized a longitudinal, community sample of 252 individuals followed from birth to early adulthood with romantic partners at age 20. Results indicated that individuals with higher levels of depressive symptoms at age 15 had romantic partners by age 20 with higher levels of personality disorder symptoms. Insecure attachment mediated this relationship. Partner personality pathology, in turn, marginally predicted increases in depressive symptoms 2 to 5 years later. Study 2 explored the role of depression in the mate selection process by using a mock online dating laboratory paradigm in which college-aged women rated hypothetical romantic partners based on fabricated dating profiles. Some profiles included antisocial personality disorder traits. Results revealed that current depressive symptoms and major depression history indirectly predicted lower initial interest in "antisocial" profiles via lower self-esteem and lower perceived similarity to these individuals, respectively. However, when participants were later asked to imagine that an "antisocial" individual was interested in dating them, depressive symptoms predicted greater positive change in interest in this individual and a greater likelihood of changing an initial refusal to date this individual to a positive response. Findings from both studies indicate that depression plays a role in the mate selection process and can have detrimental consequences.

40|$|Increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, the {{immunological}} {{response to}} pathogens, {{have been observed}} in close to one third of patients with major depression. Further, interpersonal stressors, the most potent and well-established risk for depression, have also been found to elicit pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, inflammation may represent a biological response to stress that heightens the risk of depression. A {{better understanding of the}} relationships among stress, depression and inflammation has the potential to shed light on the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and depression, as well as the increased prevalence of inflammatory illness in depressed patients, which is of growing concern in our aging population. This dissertation sought to confirm that among young, healthy adults, depressive symptoms tend to develop before, and contribute to elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to determine whether functional variation in immunological genes would create susceptibility to depression and inflammation in response to stress, and/or create susceptibility to inflammation following an elevation in depressive symptoms. The dissertation explored these questions in a pair of longitudinal cohort studies, the first of which followed Australian youth with a high prevalence of familial risk for depression from ages 15 to 20, and included assessments of depressive symptoms, stress exposure and genotypic information for a trio of immunological genes. Exposure to interpersonal stress was moderated by variation at IL 6 and IL 1 β, so that - 174 C allele carriers at IL 6, and - 511 C carriers at IL 1 β had greater depressive symptoms in response to stress, while neither of these genotypes affected the prediction of depressive symptoms from exposure to non-interpersonal stressors, such as finances and work. TNF genotype was not a moderator of either type of stress exposure. In the second dissertation study, the prediction of growth in depressive symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) from childhood stress exposure, and potential moderation of these paths by IL 6 genotype, was examined in 4, 276 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development Study of Young Adults. Stress exposure in the childhood home was predictive of depressive symptoms at age 30, which were in turn associated with slight, but significant growth in CRP between age 32 and age 50. African Americans in this sample showed a unique moderating effect of IL 6 genotype, so that the relationship between stress and CRP was significant among G allele carriers, but not among African American CC homozygotes, or among Caucasians, regardless of genotype. Taken together, the two dissertation studies suggest that genetic variation at IL 6 may contribute to increases in depressive symptoms and CRP following interpersonal stress exposure. Further, although a strong relationship from stress exposure to depression was observed in both study populations, a direct relationship between stress and CRP was not found. Instead, stress led to depression which in turn predicted CRP, and this effect was more pronounced in Caucasians...|$|E

40|$|Authors: Yeh-Chuin Poh & Ning Wang ### Abstract Mechanical {{forces are}} known to play a {{significant}} role in biological processes. These forces can be transmitted to the cell through the cytoskeletal filament network, inducing different biochemical responses within the cytoplasm. Although there have been ample reports showing that cytoplasmic enzymes can be directly activated by a local stress on the cell surface via integrins, there has been no evidence that mechanical forces can directly alter nuclear functions without intermediate biochemical cascades. Recently, we showed evidence that forces on the cell membrane can be transmitted directly into the nucleus, inducing structural changes of protein complexes in Cajal bodies. Here, we describe a protocol that utilizes the optical magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC) for force application and fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor the dynamics and interaction of various Cajal body proteins. ### Introduction It is well known that human bodies are constantly under the influence of mechanical forces. These mechanical forces influence the growth of tissues and organs. Cells integrate both chemical and mechanical cues to regulate biological processes as diverse as differentiation, vascular development, tumor growth and malignancy (1 - 5). However, little is known about the mechanism by which individual cells sense the mechanical forces and convert them in to biochemical signals within the cell and influence the gene expression, a process known as mechanotransduction. Advances in the field of mechanotransduction have demonstrated that focal adhesion complex proteins such as spectrin (6), talin (7), and integrin (8) can be deformed, unfolded, and thus activated by forces of physiologic magnitudes. Proteins and enzymes within the cytoplasm can be rapidly activated and phosphorylated upon mechanical stress (9, 10). Stem cells differentiate in respond to different surface topology (11), substrate rigidity (12), and applied stress (13), a clear indication of gene expression change within the nucleus. Nonetheless, direct force-altered protein localization/activity and thus gene expression within the nucleus remains elusive. Immunoblotting and immunostaining have been used to study mechanotransduction (14), but these techniques do not provide sufficient resolution and real time results in a single living cell. Because gene expression in a live cell involves many complicated processes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and takes time, it is impossible, at the present time, to attribute any changes in gene expression to direct effects of the applied force at the cell surface, without involving intermediate biochemical signaling cascades. Therefore, we asked if localizations of protein complexes in the nucleus can be directly altered by a local surface force, since there is evidence that interactions among nuclear proteins are critical in regulating gene expression. We employed a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) based technique to monitor the dynamics and interaction of proteins within the Cajal Body (CB) complex in response to mechanical stress (15). CBs are critical for the biogenesis and recycling of several classes of small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing (16, 17), and assembly and delivery of telomerase to telomeres (16 - 19). Recent advances in the dynamics, assembly, and function of CBs suggest that the CBs organize as a direct reflection of highly active genes with which they are physiologically associated (20). Intermolecular FRET can be used to visualize protein-protein interactions. In this protocol, we labeled various CB proteins with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The CFP labeled protein acts as the donor while the YFP labeled protein act as the receptor. Only CFP is excited during the experiment while both CFP and YFP were monitored simultaneously. By observing the relative intensity changes of CFP and YFP, we can then quantify the distance and interaction between CB proteins. When the CFP and YFP labeled proteins are close to each another (< 10 nm), FRET occurs when the emission of CFP is transferred to excite YFP. As we observe the FRET ratio of CFP/YFP, there will be a decrease in FRET ratio when the two proteins come closer to each other, because there is a decrease in CFP intensity and an increase in YFP intensity (anti-correlation). On the other hand, when the two proteins are separated and thus there is an increase in distance between the two proteins, the ratio of CFP/YFP will increase. Here, we outline the use of magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC) 21 in detail to study the spatial and temporal mechano-chemical response within the cell nucleus. We also describe the use of a dynamic sinusoidal load to quantify the viscoelastic and dissipative behavior between protein pairs within the CB. Our results showed that mechanical force at the apical membrane can be directly transmitted through the actin microfilaments and nuclear envelope to remote cites within the nucleus. The stress induced protein dissociation was rapid and did not require intermediate biochemical signaling, diffusion, or translocation. ### Reagents 1.

Suspend the magnetic beads stock in 95 % alcohol (for sterilization) and aliquot them into small 2 ml vial each containing 1 mg of beads. - Leave a vial open and evaporate the alcohol out. - Add 1. 5 ml of PBS buffer to rinse the beads. Centrifuge it down and discard the PBS carefully. - Add 1 ml of Cabonate buffer to the beads. - Add 50 μg of RGD peptides (diluted in DMSO) to the bead-buffer solution. - Rotate the beads at 4 OC overnight. - Before using beads, centrifuge the beads and discard the supernatant RGD. Then rinse it once with PBS as described in step 3. - Store the coated beads in serum free DMEM. **Cell culture and transfection** 1. All cells used for experiments are preferred low passages. - Regular cells culture was done in T- 25 flask and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-Glutamine at 37 oC in 5 % CO 2. - For experiments, cells need to be prepared 3 days in advance. Day 1, coat the 35 mm glass bottom dishes with Collagen-I and store at 4 oC to allow absorption of collagen on to the glass surface. - Day 2, sterilize the collagen-coated culture dish by leaving it under UV light for 10 minutes. Then seed (~ 300, 000) cells in the collagen-coated 35 -mm glass bottom dish such that it is ~ 80 % confluent the following day. - Day 3, double transfect the cells with plasmid constructs of CFP and YFP labeled proteins. Dilute 1 μg of CFP plasmid and 1 μg of YFP plasmid to 100 μg of Opti-MEM I medium in a small vial. - In another vial, add 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 to 100 μg of Opti-MEM I medium in a small vial. - Wait 5 minutes in room temperature before mixing the contents of both vials together. Then wait another 20 minutes. - Add the total ~ 200 μl of DNA-Lipofectamine mixture to the dish containing cells. - Optional: To minimize photobleaching, 0. 05 mM Trolox solution was added to the dish along with the DNA-Lipofectamine mixture (22). - Incubate for 6 hours at 37 oC in 5 % CO 2 before replacing the culture medium with regular DMEM culture medium. - Day 4, cells are transfected and ready for imaging. **Magnetic Twisting Cytometry (MTC) ** 1. On the day of the experiment (day 4 in t in the previous section), take the dish out of the incubator and remove most of the culture medium, such that only the cells in the center well (glass region) is slightly covered in medium. - Add 20 μl of RGD-coated magnetic beads (~ 20 μg of beads) to the center well of the dish by scattering them all over. - Carefully place the beads back into the incubator and leave for 10 minutes to allow for integrin clustering and formation of focal adhesions surrounding the beads. - Remove cells from incubator and rinse it once with PBS. Avoid disturbing cells in the center well. Add and remove PBS gently by the side of the dish. - Add CO 2 -independent medium to the dish. This is to maintain the pH of the cell culture when it is exposed to the open while under the microscope. - Place the dish in the MTC stage where coils are located. Then place it on the inverted microscope. - Find a single cell that is well transfected with both CFP and YFP plasmids. The cell also needs to have a single bead attached to it. Exclude all cells that are not well transfected, have more than one bead attached, or are in contact with neighboring cells. - After the good cell is found, magnetize the magnetic beads by applying a strong magnetic pulse (~ 1000 G, < 0. 5 ms). - Now that the beads are polarized and magnetized, apply a magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to that of the magnetizing pulse. This will cause the bead to rotate. Input the parameter for MTC. Parameters of stress peak magnitude for FRET analysis are typically 17. 5 Pa (50 G step load) or other magnitudes, where for phase lag analysis is 24. 5 Pa (70 G oscillatory load). - While force is being applied, capture the necessary brightfield or fluorescence images. **FRET imaging and analysis** 1. For FRET imaging, the Dual-View imaging system was used to split the image into two (1344 × 512 pixels each). The top view filters for YFP, while the bottom view filters for CFP. Each image is 1344 × 1024 pixels and simultaneously captures both CFP and YFP activity. - While force is being applied by the MTC, FRET dual-view time course images are captured to monitor the protein-protein interaction within the nucleus before and after force. - After experiments are done and images obtained. A customized Matlab program is used to analyze the data. The program first divides the top (YFP) and bottom (CFP) image in to two separate files. - The region of interest (an individual CB in our case) is then selected. The program crops this region from the CFP and YFP images, then aligns them by cross-correlation. - A binary mask is then created for CFP and YFP images by using Matlab’s “graythresh” function. The binary mask is then multiplied with the fluorescent images generating images that have only the fluorescing region and a black background. - The CFP/YFP ratio value is then calculated for each individual pixel that has been aligned and cross-correlated. An average of the region is obtained and reported. Each image or time point will generate one CFP/YFP value. - Note: More details on the Matlab program has been described by Na S et. al. (14) **Polyacrylamide gels for traction force measurement** 1. Polyacrylamide (PA) gels with 0. 2 μm fluorescent beads embedded within are used to measure the traction force each cell generates. By varying the concentration of bis and acrylamide, different gel stiffness can be obtained. - To prepare PA gels, first smear 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane over the glass surface of a 35 mm glass-bottom-dish using a cotton-tipped swab and let it sit there for 6 min. - Wash it thoroughly with water before applying 100 μl/ dish of 0. 5 % gluteraldehyde for 30 min. - Wash again thoroughly and let them dry. Avoid touching the glass surface throughout the whole gel making procedure. - Determine the bis:acrylamide solution proportions to get the desired substrate stiffness. 0. 6, 2, and 8 kP, corresponds to 0. 06 % bisacrylamide and 3 % acrylamide, 0. 05 % bisacrylamide and 5 % acrylamide, 0. 3 % bisacrylamide and 5 % acrylamide respectively. Prepare 1 ml of each desired mixture in a small 2 ml vial. - Add 10 μl of 0. 2 μm fluorescent beads to the bis-acrylamide mixture. Before adding fluorescent beads, be sure to vortex or sonicate. - Add polymerizing activator/initiator to the beads-bis-acrylamide mixture. 10 % APS at 1 : 200 volume ratio (5 μl in this case). TEMED at 1 : 2000 volume ratio (0. 5 μl in this case). Mix everything together thoroughly. - Add 15 μl of the mixture to the glass surface of the treated dish. (15 μl would give 75 μm thick substrates) - Flatten droplet with a 12 mm circular cover glasses. - Turn the glass bottom dish upside down. This ensures the fluorescent beads to be closer to the top surface. - Place the upside down dishes in a 37 oC incubator for 30 - 45 minutes. Elevated temperature helps in the polymerization. - After the gels are fully polymerized, flood the dish with 100 mM HEPES. Then carefully remove the circular cover glass with a single edge razor. - Make 1 mM solution of SANPAH with DMSO and 100 mM HEPES. Add DMSO to SANPAH first to dissolve the solid powder, and then add it to HEPES. For example, 5 mg SANPAH+ 50 μl DMSO+ 10 ml (100 mM) HEPES. - Take out HEPES from the glass bottom dishes, dab excess HEPES with Kim wipes from around gel edge - Apply 200 μl of SANPAH solution the gel (center well of dish). - Expose surface to UV for 6 min (6 ″ away from the lamp) to photo activate the gel surface. SANPAH color will turn dark. Without SANPAH treatment, collagen will not bind to gel surface. - Rinse off SANPAH with 100 mM HEPES. - Repeat photo activation procedure once more and rinse it off with 100 mM HEPES. - Coat the gel surface with the desired concentration of collagen and incubate at 4 ° C overnight. - Before seeding cells onto the gel surface, sterilize it under UV light for 10 - 15 minutes. - PA gels can be stored in PBS at 4 ° C for three weeks. - Note: To determine the ratio of bis to acrylamide for desired substrate stiffness, refer to references (23 - 25). **Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) ** 1. Cells are cultured on the PA gels. Depending on the PA gel stiffness, the cell will generate different traction forces, and hence different magnitude of deformation. - Three images need to be captured. First is the brightfield or phase contrast image of the cell which will be used to identify the cell boundary. Second is the fluorescent beads marker image while the cell is still on the substrate. Third is the reference fluorescent beads marker image after the cell has been removed or trypsinized from the gel surface. - A customize Matlab program was used to analyze the traction force generated. The displacement field induced by each individual cell’s tractional forces was determined by comparing the fluorescent bead positions before and after trypsinization (cell-free and thus force-free). - An image correlation method where the flourecent images are divided into small window areas is used to determine the displacement vectors (26). - The root-mean-square (RMS) traction field was then calculated from the displacement field using Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry (FTTC) based on the Boussinesq solution (27). **Cell stiffness measurement** 1. The stress applied to the cell (in Pa) can be calculated from the applied twisting magnetic field (in G) by multiplying the bead constant (in Pa/G) with the applied twisting field (in G). The bead constant reflects the magnetic property of the bead and may differ from batch-to-batch. The beads are calibrated by immersing them in a known viscous fluid, and applying a constant magnetic field while measuring the remnant magnetic field (21). For example, a 50 G applies 17. 5 Pa of stress to the cell if the bead constant is 0. 35 Pa/G(9). - When a cell with a single bead bound to its apical surface is found under the microscope, an oscillatory stress of 0. 3 Hz is applied using the MTC. - The MTC software tracks the displacement coordinates of the magnetic bead and saves them in a text file. - By quantifying the magnetic bead displacement, and the bead embedded area, the cell complex modulus can be estimated. A custom Matlab program is then used to calculate the cell stiffness. - The beads whose displacement waves are synchronized to the input sinusoidal signals were selected. This is to filter out spontaneous movements of the beads or microscope stage shifts. - Beads with displacements less than 5 nm (detectable resolution) and loosely bound beads were not selected for analysis. To increase the signal to noise ratio, the peak amplitude of the displacement was averaged over 5 consecutive cycles for each cell. - The complex stiffness is calculated using the equation G*=T/d. For each bead, the elastic stiffness G’ (the real part of G*) and the dissipative stiffness G” (the imaginary part of G*) was calculated based on the phase lag. The measured stiffness has the units of torque per unit bead volume per unit bead displacement (Pa/nm). - A finite element model is then used to convert the cell stiffness (Pa/nm) to modulus (Pa) based on the bead to cell surface contact (28) (Figure. 1). ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *Figure 1. Quantification of magnetic bead embedment in HeLa cells. An RGD-coated bead was bound to the apical surface of the cell for ~ 15 minutes before it was fixed and stained with phalloidin. Integrin-mediated focal adhesions form around the bead-cell contact area, giving rise to an actin ring. The bead embedment was estimated by measuring the actin ring diameter from the fluorescent image and comparing it to the bead diameter from the brightfield image (double arrows). Bead embedment in HeLa cells is 20 - 30 %. Scale bar = 10 μm*. 9. More details on how to calculate cell stiffness have been described by Fabry B et. al. (29). **Phase lag quantification** 1. An oscillatory stress (0. 3 Hz or 0. 83 Hz) is applied to a cell that is well transfected, similar to the stress used to measure cell stiffness - Time course images of the bead, CFP labeled protein, and YFP labeled protein are captured while the cyclic force is being applied. - A custom Matlab program is used to analyze the images and the displacement of bead, CFP and YFP labeled proteins are determined. The phase lag of fluorescent proteins to the bead is then calculated. - One complete <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> corresponds to 360 o. For example, at 0. 3 Hz, the period for one complete cycle is 3. 33 s. If CFP lags behind the bead displacement by 0. 3 s, that will correspond to a phase lag of ~ 32 o. **Mean Square Displacement (MSD) ** 1. For CB dynamics, an oscillatory stress (0. 3 Hz) needs to be applied. Fluorescent images used for MSD analysis were obtained using single-view fluorescence filter. - Time course images of the bead, CFP labeled protein, and YFP labeled protein are captured before, during and after the cyclic force is being applied. - Binary images of the bead, CFP and YFP are obtained by using the “graythresh” Matlab function. The centroid coordinates of the bead and each fluorescing protein are then obtained. - The coordinates of each fluorescence particle obtained was then used to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) of Coilin and SMN. The MSD before, during, and after mechanical loading were calculated using a customized Matlab program based (15). The same procedure is performed on bright-field images to obtain the bead MSD. ### Timing Preparation for experiments takes up to 3 days. Dishes need to be coated with collagen or other matrix proteins. Beads need to be coated with RGD or ligands to integrins. Cells need to be transfected. Depending on the transfection efficiency and how magnetic beads bind to the cell surface, locating an appropriate cell for data collection may take up sometime. The whole process of making PA gels may take a day (excluding incubation time...|$|E

40|$|Potato tubers {{were held}} in {{refrigerated}} storage and their firmness periodically sampled {{over a period of}} 140 days. At each sampling, the rheological properties uniaxial compression, shear, uniaxial tension, successive <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation, creep compliance and texture profile analysis were determined, as was moisture content. Compression energy, maximum shear force, longitudinal tension stiffness and maximum tension deformation, stress relaxation parameters and moisture content were all significantly affected by storage time. Relaxed forces decreased consistently and linearly with time over a 140 -day storage period, reflecting the decrease in cell turgor pressure resulting from the predominance of water loss through evaporation over water production. Longitudinal tension stiffness and maximum shear force increased linearly in the early stages, reflecting the increase in cell wall stiffness and elastic tissue behavior. Maximum tension deformation increased linearly with time reflecting the plastic deformation of the cell wall caused by growth in cell turgor pressure at early stages. Changes in the trends of rheological parameters over 140, 64 and 28 days evidenced the importance of extending the time period considered for rheological parameters of potato tissue. © Springer-Verlag 2000.

40|$|Based on the {{real-time}} monitoring data, a fatigue damage model using continuous damage mechanics and a methodology and strategy for evaluating fatigue damage and possible critical locations of local fatigue on bridge-deck sections are developed. The proposed local damage model {{to evaluate the}} fatigue damage of bridge-deck sections allows fatigue damage to be considered at a continuum scale as a deteriorating process with its physical mechanism such as fatigue crack initiation and growth. Therefore the fatigue damage variable associates not only <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> range on the accumulating process of fatigue, but also directly associates the state of deterioration and the mechanics behavior. The effective stress range for the variable-amplitude stress spectrum due to traffic load is {{used to evaluate the}} fatigue strength of the bridge-deck section at different locations, by which possible location of critical fatigue failure can be primarily determined.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{measured by}} x-rays {{in the near}} surface region of polycrystalline materials are always average over a varying diffracting volume. This volume variation is due to beam tilting during a measurement and the exponential decay of x-rays during penetration. Different methods have been devised to correct this biased data.

Accidents {{have been reported}} after service of high strength landing gear components at low applied <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> and {{have been attributed to}} Hydrogen Embrittlement. For evaluation of the mechanical properties reduction of high strength structures, after re-treatment during maintenance, specific sustained load creep tests are carried out. When an electrochemical plated notched specimen is strained, hydrogen is carried by mobile dislocations to the root of the notch. Transient cracks formed by dislocation interaction, are stabilized by the hydrogen and stresses which would be relieved by deformation in absence of hydrogen are relieved by cracking when the hydrogen content exceeds a critical value. However, these tests provide information of mechanical behaviour based only to Hydrogen absorption. In real cases the A/C components phases a combined effect of highly corrosive environment like seawater, hydrogen and loading.
