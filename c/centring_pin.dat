We have observed the dc electric field generated in this regime in films without intentionally created anisotropic <b>pinning</b> <b>centres,</b> i. e. plain films, both in strip geometry as in cross-shape geometry, and also in films with symmetric periodic <b>pinning</b> <b>centres.</b> The electric field appears in both directions along and transverse to the alternating current and is essentially different at opposite film sides.

Pentacene films deposited by SuMBD exhibited about one order of magnitude lower island- and polycrystalline island densities compared to OMBD, on both types of substrates.

40|$|This thesis uses a {{multidisciplinary}} approach drawing primarily on archival and bibliographical research {{as well as}} the fields of children’s literature, book history and translation to explore British translation of Nordic children’s fiction since 1950. Which works of Nordic children’s literature have been published in the UK during the period in question? And how were Nordic children’s authors and texts selected by British publishers, along with British translators and illustrators? Chapter One gives an overview of limited past research in this area, focusing on publishing and book history and Translation Studies (particularly Polysystem Theory). Chapter Two considers bibliographical research already undertaken in Children’s Literature Translation Studies and is followed by a detailed study of the British National Bibliography (1950 - 2000). This methodological approach has documented {{for the first time the}} depth and breadth of the corpus of British translations of Nordic children’s fiction since 1950, enabling key authors, publishers, translators and genres to be identified. A brief analysis is given of the Golden Age of Nordic children’s literature in British translation up to 1975, followed by a decline into the twenty first century. The thesis then goes on to examine the principles and practices of text and translator selection as its second major research element, with extensive use made here of archival sources. Chapter Three explores publishing archives as a research resource and details issues in their distribution and potential use. Chapter Four gives an overview of the key role of the editor as a <b>centre</b> <b>pin</b> in the process of publishing works in translation, drawing on a wide range of publishing archives as well as introducing the case study part of the thesis which examines an independent press and a major international academic publishing house.

Therefore, we investigated the growth of REBCO thin films containing nanometre-scale BaHfO 3 (BHO) particles as <b>pinning</b> <b>centres</b> for magnetic flux lines, with emphasis {{on the influence of}} crystallization temperature and substrate on the microstructure and superconductivity. Conductivity, microscopy and x-ray investigations show an enhanced performance of BHO nano-composites in comparison to pristine REBCO. Further, those measurements reveal the superiority of GdBCO to YBCO - e. g. by inductive critical current densities, J c, at self-field and 77 K. YBCO is outperformed by more than 1 MA cm- 2 with J c values of up to 5. 0 MA cm- 2 for 265 nm thick layers of GdBCO(BHO) on lanthanum aluminate. Transport in-field J c measurements demonstrate high pinning force maxima of around 4 GN m- 3 for YBCO(BHO) and GdBCO(BHO). However, the irreversibility fields are appreciably higher for GdBCO. The critical temperature was not significantly reduced upon BHO addition to both YBCO and GdBCO, indicating a low tendency for Hf diffusion into the REBCO matrix. Angular-dependent J c measurements show a reduction of the anisotropy in the same order of magnitude for both REBCO compounds.

The magnetic moment versus temperature indicated that the transition temperature of MgB 2 samples was around 34 K, which {{is less than the}} typical transition temperature of commercial powders and also the transition temperature strongly depended on the milling time. It is well known that introduction of defects, grain boundaries and impurities act as effective flux <b>pinning</b> <b>centres</b> in MgB 2 and results in increased critical current density, Jc and decreased the transition temperature, Tc. The magnetization measurements were performed using VSM at 10 K, 20 K and 30 K, and the M-H curves indicated a complete flux jump effect, which is a severe problem for the application of superconductors. It was determined that a noticeable amount of heating (∼ 0. 3 K jumps at 10 K) occurs at these jumps. In addition, {{it was found that the}} sweeping rate of magnetic field and the size of bulk sample are very effective to promote the flux jumping and whereas a low sweeping rate (12 Oe/s) avoids these "avalanches", consistent with a kind of supercritical phenomenon: going slower allows the field gradients to stay close enough to equilibrium so that the avalanche effect is not triggered.
