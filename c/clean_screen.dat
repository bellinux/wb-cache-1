In this study, C 8 (octyl-silica, useful for nonpolar to moderately polar compounds), ENV+ (hydroxylated polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer, for extraction of aliphatic and aromatic polar compounds), Oasis MCX (sulfonic-poly(divinylbenzene-co-N-polyvinyl-pyrrolidone) copolymer), and <b>Clean</b> <b>Screen</b> DAU (mixed mode, ion exchanger for acidic and basic compounds) {{were used as}} sorbents for the MEPS. The focus was on fast extraction and preconcentration of the drugs with rapid analysis using a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer as the detector with direct analysis in a real-time (DART) source. The combination of an analysis time of less than 1 min and accurate mass of the first monoisotopic peak of the analyte and the relative abundances of the peaks in the isotopic clusters provided reliable information for identification.

40|$|EPA {{is today}} {{releasing}} draft guidance on the interim use of <b>clean</b> <b>screening</b> methodologies in state Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs. The {{purpose of the}} guidance is to share technical information with states and other interested parties, and to advise them of certain types of I/M changes EPA is inclined to approve, should states choose to incorporate them into existing or planned I/M programs.

40|$|A new {{invention}} disclosure discusses a structure and process for separating gas from liquids in microgravity. The Microgravity Passive Phase Separator {{consists of two}} concentric, pleated, woven stainless- steel screens (25 -micrometer nominal pore) with an axial inlet, and an annular outlet between both screens (see figure). Water enters {{at one end of}} the center screen at high velocity, eventually passing through the inner screen and out through the annular exit. As gas is introduced into the flow stream, the drag force exerted on the bubble pushes it downstream until flow stagnation or until it reaches an equilibrium point between the surface tension holding bubble to the screen and the drag force. Gas bubbles of a given size will form a front that is moved further down the length of the inner screen with increasing velocity. As more bubbles are added, the front location will remain fixed, but additional bubbles will move to the end of the unit, eventually coming to rest in the large cavity between the unit housing and the outer screen (storage area). Owing to the small size of the pores and the hydrophilic nature of the screen material, gas does not pass through the screen and is retained within the unit for emptying during ground processing. If debris is picked up on the screen, the area closest to the inlet will become clogged, so high-velocity flow will persist farther down the length of the center screen, pushing the bubble front further from the inlet of the inner screen. It is desired to keep the velocity high enough so that, for any bubble size, an area of <b>clean</b> <b>screen</b> exists between the bubbles and the debris. The primary benefits of this innovation are the lack of any need for additional power, strip gas, or location for venting the separated gas. As the unit contains no membrane, the transport fluid will not be lost due to evaporation in the process of gas separation. Separation is performed with relatively low pressure drop based on the large surface area of the separating screen. Additionally, there are no moving parts, and there are no failure modes that involve fluid loss. A patent application has been filed...|$|E

Several electronic devices and systems have been realized. In late 2003 a commercial printing press was installed to test large scale production of these devices. Prior to the summer of 2005 the project made significant progress. As a step towards industrialisation, the variability and yield of the printing process needed to bee studied. A decision to implement Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Design of Experiments (DOE) to evaluate and improve the process was taken. SPC has been implemented on the EC-patterning step in the process. A total of 26 Samples were taken during the period October-December 2005. An - and s-chart were constructed from these samples. The charts clearly show that the process is not in statistical control. Investigations of what causes the variation in the process have been performed. The following root causes to variation has been found: PEDOT:PSS-substrate sheet resistance and poorly <b>cleaned</b> <b>screen</b> printing drums. After removing points affected by root causes, the process is still not in control. Further investigations are needed to get the process in control. Examples of where to go next is presented in the report. In the DOE part a four factor full factorial experiment was performed. The goal with the experiment was to find how different factors affects switch time and life length of an electrochromic display. The four factors investigated were: Electrolyte, Additive, Web speed and Encapsulation. All statistical analysis was performed using Minitab 14. The analysis of measurements from one day and seven days after printing showed that: - Changing Electrolyte from E 230 to E 235 has small effect on the switch time - Adding additives Add 1 and Add 2 decreases the switch time after 1 and 7 days - Increasing web speed decreases the switch time after 1 and 7 days - Encapsulation before UV-step decreases the switch time after 7 day...|$|R
40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{presents}} general guidance regarding {{the management of}} screen printing wastewater. If you follow {{the intent of the}} Best Management Practices (BMPs) you may discharge your wastewater to the Metro sanitary sewer. These guidelines are important because Metro must protect {{the health and safety of}} those who collect and treat wastewater. Metro also ensures that municipal treatment plants operate effectively, that biosolids (sludge) from these plants is not contaminated, and that federal and state water quality and hazardous waste regulations are complied with. To accomplish this, Metro develops discharge limitations and best management practices for industrial wastewater discharges. If your wastewater has different characteristics than those described in this fact sheet, or you have other questions call the Business Waste Line at 296 - 3976. Background Screen cleaning operations may generate wastewater that is disposed of in the sanitary sewer. About 75 % of screen print shops,generate wastewater. Out of 22 randomly selected King County shops, 7 did not generate wastewater, each of the 15 shops that. generated wastewater was sampled. The volume and characteristics of wastewater varies among shops. Volumes range from 0. 5 to 170 gallondday. Characteristics of wastewater depend on the inks used, the products used to <b>clean</b> <b>screens,</b> and the cleaning procedure. Metals Metals are found in some ink pigments. In general, textile printers use inks that are free of lead pigments. Sign, poster, label and electronic component printers tend to use solventbased inks that may contain lead pigments.

However, steel of a much higher quality {{is used in the}} manufacture of car and truck tyres and a significant volume of this material is recovered each year when end-of-life tyres are recycled.

Whilst tyre steel tends to be of smaller diameter and length than the steel fibres traditionally used in SFRC, research has identified the range of fibre geometries that are effective.

In conducting this research problems have been encountered with the manufacture of specimens for the internationally recognised prism test which disadvantage fibres of this type and recommendations are made that address this issue.
