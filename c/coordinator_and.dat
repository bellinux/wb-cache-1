5|$|In December 2007, Maryland hired Kansas State {{offensive}} coordinator James Franklin {{to serve in}} that same role for the Terrapins.

In 2003 and 2004, he also served as the recruiting <b>coordinator,</b> <b>and</b> Rivals.com ranked Franklin {{as one of the}} nation's top-25 recruiters both years. Because of the arrival of Franklin, 2008 was the first since 2005 that head coach Ralph Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself. At Maryland, Franklin installed a West Coast offense, which was well suited to quarterback Chris Turner's playing style and an experienced wide receiver corps that included play-maker Darrius Heyward-Bey and sure-handed Danny Oquendo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} the season, several changes were made to the Alabama coaching staff.

5|$|Maryland's {{offense was}} run by first-year {{offensive}} <b>coordinator</b> <b>and</b> former wide receivers coach James Franklin, who utilized a West Coast system. During the 2008 regular season, starting quarterback Chris Turner threw for 2,318yards, 11touchdowns, and 10interceptions. NFL Draft prospect Darrius Heyward-Bey accumulated 561receiving yards in ten games. Heyward-Bey also recorded 208rushing yards and was often utilized in reverses and other trick plays due to his breakaway speed. Maryland had another offensive weapon in running back Da'Rel Scott, who ran for 959yards during the regular season. Overall, the rushing offense gained 134.5yards per game and was ranked 72nd in the nation. Against Virginia Tech and Boston College, Maryland rushed for −12and −6yards, respectively. The previous year, in the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State, Maryland recorded 19yards on the ground against the then second-ranked rushing defense.|$|E

However, after going 5–7 {{the following two}} seasons and suffering a season-ending blowout in 2003 by intrastate rival Clemson, Skip was demoted from the offensive <b>coordinator</b> <b>and</b> assistant head coaching positions to quarterbacks coach. Four assistant coaches—including the team's defensive coordinator—were fired in the same shakeup that saw Skip demoted. On November 22, 2004, one season after Skip's demotion, Lou Holtz announced he was retiring as head coach of South Carolina.

5|$|In 1997, Maryland had a {{new head}} coach, Ron Vanderlinden, and he {{immediately}} saw that Navy was a natural rival for his team, but {{was unaware of the}} past history. Vanderlinden attempted to renew the game, {{but it was not until}} after his relief that the idea materialized. In 2001, Ralph Friedgen was hired as his successor and spearheaded efforts to reinvigorate the team's old rivalries, including that against Navy. Friedgen, who played for Maryland as an offensive guard, was at the 1964 game as a recruit. He had also coached for nine years as Georgia Tech's offensive <b>coordinator,</b> <b>and</b> he harbored nostalgic feelings for a rivalry with the passion of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Friedgen stated that, in addition to the rivalries with West Virginia and Virginia, a renewed in-state series would be even more meaningful. In 2002, the two schools agreed to meet for the first Crab Bowl Classic in forty years, scheduled for 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the conclusion of the season, several changes were made to the Alabama coaching staff.
