50|$|Brookhaven's mills {{were perhaps}} its most notable {{commercial}} activity. Thomas Coebourn established the second gristmill {{in the new}} Pennsylvania colony, successfully challenging William Penn's monopoly vested in the Caleb Pusey Mill (the Caleb Pusey house is still standing) downstream on Chester Creek. After a 1687 court battle went in Coebourne's favor and granted individuals the right to establish mills, the area's creeks powered a multitude of industries. The original Coebourne Log Mill was replaced in 1750 by a stone structure which was sold to Jonathan Dutton (Dutton Mill Road is a major road in the area) in 1792. A redrawing of Chester Township's borders in 1829 placed this site in present Middletown Township, with only the mill race and the owner's mansion in Brookhaven. The Johnson Ax Factory, the Lower Bank (Todmorden-Sackville) Hair <b>Cloth</b> <b>Mills,</b> Bickley's Gristmill and the Crozer <b>Cloth</b> <b>Mill</b> all utilized the notable drop for streams from the inland plateau to power their machinery. Both the 1826 and the post-flood 1844 mill surveys show large outputs for these factories.|$|R
