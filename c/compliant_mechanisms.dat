Due to the flexures a miniaturised mechanism is possible overcoming {{the limitations of}} rigid link mechanisms. In addition since a <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> has a monolithic structure no assembly is required. The <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed using Pseudo Rigid Body Model (PRBM) approach and results obtained are compared with finite element analysis. An experimental setup is developed incorporating a microslide as an actuator for 4 -bar <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> and displacement is measured using 3 D optical profilometer. The performance of the <b>compliant</b> parallel <b>mechanism</b> demonstrated by experiments validates the simulation results and hence PRBM results.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we review the world-wide study on micro-motion systems both from an {{academic}} and an industrial perspective. The {{objective of the}} review is {{to answer the following}} questions: (1) What are the limitations of technologies to develop a micro-motion device in terms of function, motion range, accuracy, and speed it can achieve? (2) What is any economic implication of these technologies? (3) What are future research directions? The micro-motion systems considered in this paper are classified into four kinds in terms of their motion ranges: (a) 1000 μm. This review concludes that the PZT actuation element integrated with the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is the most promising technology which can achieve high accuracy (sub-nanometer) of all four kinds of motion ranges. This promise is further based on the amplification technology using the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> concept. The amplification mechanism is used to com-pensate the problem with a limited stroke of the PZT actuation element. The compliant amplification mecha-nism allows one to achieve a high resolution and high stiffness motion which does not compromise the loss of accuracy due to motion amplification. The PZT actuation element and the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> are both econom-ically viable. Future research direction should generally focus on the interface between the PZT actuation element and <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the reliability of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> under cyclic deformation of com-pliant materials...|$|R

The actuator is obtained by coupling a conically shaped DE film with a <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed to suitably modify the force generated by the elastomer film. The resulting actuator provides a nearly constant force along the entire actuator stroke when the DE film is activated and quickly returns to an initial rest position when the DE film is deactivated.

40|$|In this {{research}} a variable-stiffness <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{was developed to}} generate vari-able force-displacement profiles at the mechanisms coupler point. The mechanism {{is based on a}} <b>compliant</b> Roberts straight-line <b>mechanism,</b> and the stiffness is varied by changing the effective length of the compliant links with an actuated slider. The variable-stiffness mechanism was used in a one-degree-of-freedom haptic interface to demonstrate the effectiveness of varying the stiffness of a <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Unlike traditional haptic interfaces, in which the force is controlled using motors and rigid links, the haptic interface developed in this work displays haptic stiffness via the variable-stiffness <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The force-deflection behavior of the mechanism was analyzed using the Pseudo-Rigid Body Model (PRBM), and two key parameters, KΘ and γ, were optimized using finite element analysis (FEA) to match the model with the behavior of the device. One of the key features of the mechanism is that the inherent return-to-zero behavior of the <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> was used to provide the stiffness feedback felt by the user. A prototype haptic interface was developed capable of simulating the force-displacement profile of Lachmans Test performed on an injured ACL knee.

40|$|In this paper, a new piezo-actuated XY {{parallel}} <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{for large}} workspace nano-positioning with decoupled motions is developed by incorporating a novel Z-shaped flexure hinge (ZFH) -based mechanism into the mirror-symmetrically distributed structure.

Based on finite element theory, a high-precision analytical model of the XY <b>compliant</b> <b>mechanism</b> is established by considering all the connecting linkages as flexible components.
