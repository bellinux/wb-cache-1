5|$|Major land runs, {{including}} the Land Run of 1889, were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time. Usually land {{was open to}} settlers on a first come first served basis. Those who broke the rules by <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into the territory before the official opening time {{were said to have}} been <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> sooner, leading to the term sooners, which eventually became the state's official nickname.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the people}} who visit Big Twenty Township are Canadians who have {{illegally}} <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in search of cheaper food and gas. One such incident occurred in 2002, when Michel Jalbert <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in to save 20 cents a gallon on gas and was arrested and imprisoned. Some people even have property that straddles <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> and have received written consent from <b>border</b> patrol to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> when they want to avoid issues.|$|R
50|$|Whether the Argentine {{infantry}} actually <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Chile or only {{waited at}} <b>the</b> <b>border</b> for <b>the</b> {{result of the}} naval combat cannot be established. Argentine sources insist that they <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> which would be inconsistent with the two-phase war plan.|$|R
50|$|Late on 4 September 2015, Chancellor Werner Faymann of Austria, in {{conjunction}} with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, announced that migrants {{would be allowed to}} <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> from Hungary into Austria and onward to Germany, and early on 5 September 2015, buses with migrants began <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> Austro-Hungarian <b>border.</b> Austria noted that 6,500 migrants had <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> by <b>the</b> afternoon of 5 September 2015, with 2,200 already on their way to Germany.|$|R

5|$|Palestinian {{immigration}} into Israel first emerged {{among the}} Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, living in camps in Jordan (including the Jordanian-occupied West Bank), Lebanon, Egypt (including the Egyptian protectorate in Gaza), and Syria. Initially, most infiltrations were economic in nature, with Palestinians <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> seeking food or {{the recovery of}} property lost in the 1948 war.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian General Ali Abdul Hameed was {{dispatched}} by plane, {{and arrived}} on September 29 {{to assess the}} situation {{and needs of the}} Yemeni Revolutionary Command Council. Egypt sent a battalion of Special Forces (Saaqah) on a mission to act as personal guards for Sallal. They arrived at Hodeida on October 5. Fifteen days after he had left San'a, al-Badr sent a man ahead to the Saudi Arabia to announce that he was alive. He then went there himself, <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> near Khobar, at the north-eastern edge of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|From late 1987, the British {{authorities}} {{were aware that}} the IRA was planning to detonate a bomb at {{the changing of the}} guard ceremony outside the governor's residence in the British Dependent Territory of Gibraltar. When Savage, McCann and Farrell—known IRA members—travelled to Spain in preparation for the attack, they were tracked {{at the request of the}} British government. On the day of the shootings, Savage was seen parking a white Renault in the car park used as the assembly area for the parade; McCann and Farrell were seen <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June Army Norway {{launched}} {{its effort to}} capture Murmansk in a pincer attack. The northern pincer, conducted by Mountain Corps Norway, approached Murmansk directly by <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> at Petsamo. However, in mid-July after securing {{the neck of the}} Rybachy Peninsula and advancing to the Litsa River the German advance was stopped by heavy resistance from the Soviet 14th Army. Renewed attacks led to nothing, and this front became a stalemate for the remainder of Barbarossa.|$|E

5|$|Portugal {{was part}} of the Entente and a belligerent, {{employing}} troops in France and Africa; so a force under Major João Teixeira Pinto was sent to stop von Lettow-Vorbeck from <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> The Portuguese were flanked by the Germans, while encamped at Ngomano on 25 November 1917. The battle saw the Portuguese force nearly destroyed, with many troops killed and captured. The capitulation of the Portuguese enabled the Germans to seize a large quantity of supplies and continue operations in East Africa {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Tension between Tutsi and Hutu {{had been}} {{escalating}} during the 1950s, and {{culminated in the}} 1959 Rwandan Revolution. Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, forcing more than 100,000 to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Kagame's family abandoned their home, living {{for two years in}} the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Uganda. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi refugee camp in the Toro sub-region in 1962. It was around this time that, as young boys, Kagame and his future comrade, Fred Rwigyema, first met one another.|$|E
5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were not doing enough to tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E

5|$|After a brief spell in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) {{with the}} Manchester Millrats, {{he signed with}} KK Lirija in Macedonia but left the team after one season after facing {{unpleasant}} playing conditions and racist abuse, accepting a lucrative offer with Al-Nasr. When conflict erupted, Owumi was trapped in Mutassim Gaddafi's apartment without food or electricity for several days {{in the midst of}} the violence before <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Egypt, where he was arrested and detained. After his release, before returning home, he won the league championship with El-Olympi.

5|$|The brigade {{arrived in}} Normandy on 8 August 1944 and was {{involved}} in the fighting in Northern France alongside British and Canadian units. The brigade {{was one of the first}} Allied units to enter Belgium, <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> on 3 September. The following day, the brigade was the second Allied unit to enter Brussels (after the Welsh Guards). After the liberation of Belgium, the brigade {{was involved in}} fighting in the Netherlands until November 1944 when it returned to Belgium and reorganized, expanding on account of the new manpower. The reorganized brigade had three infantry battalions, an artillery regiment of six batteries, and an armored car regiment. Returning to combat in the Netherlands in April 1945, the brigade's units fought at Nijmegen and Walcheren.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E

5|$|When living {{conditions}} deteriorated, Gershkovitch traveled to Chita and obtained permission to visit Vladivostok via Manchuria. After <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> to China in 1921, {{he remained in}} Harbin, where he met Lucia, who had also escaped from Russia. Together {{they made their way}} to Tientsin, where they met and became close friends with composer Aaron Avshalomov. When ballerina Anna Pavlova heard that Gershkovitch had escaped from Russia, she offered him a position as assistant conductor with her orchestra, which was touring throughout Asia. Following three months of touring, Gershkovitch settled in Tokyo to undertake the newly organized Tokyo Symphony Orchestra under the patronage of Baron Okura, a wealthy nobleman and relative of the Mikado.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{trial in}} the death of James Kinne was {{scheduled}} for October 1964; however, in September 1964, Kinne, still free on her $25,000 bond, traveled to Mexico with an alleged lover, Francis Samuel Puglise leaving her children with James Kinne's father and traveling as Pugliese's wife under the name Jeanette Pugliese. The couple later said that they had come to Mexico to get married. Under the legal terms of her bail, Kinne was permitted to leave the country, but her contract with the company that posted her bond prohibited her from leaving Missouri without written permission from the company's agents. After <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> the couple registered at a local hotel, Hotel Gin, again as husband and wife. Kinne, saying that she felt unsafe in the foreign country, bought a pistol—which meant that the couple now possessed multiple guns, having brought one or two with them from the United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{reports of}} a rebellion at York, Marius heads north to aid the defeated legion stationed there. Upon capturing King Oswald and his daughter Boudica, Basilius, {{the son of the}} Emperor, reveals that his brother Commodus (Gerald Kyd) has been captured by the barbarians, whose whereabouts are unknown. Basilius, threatens and forces King Oswald into revealing the location of Commodus, who has been traded to the fearsome men north of Hadrian's Wall. Basilius orders Vitallion and Marius to retrieve him. After <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Caledonia, the party is ambushed, Vitallion is taken hostage by barbarians, and Marius is separated from his legion. Marius makes his way into the enemy camp, freeing and rallying captured Roman soldiers along the way. He kills the barbarian leader Glott and rescues Commodus and Vitallion from being burned inside a giant Wicker man.|$|E
50|$|Sweden and Norway {{have the}} same ATC system and the same voltage, meaning that trains can {{generally}} <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> without being specially modified.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>border</b> between Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia was guarded {{exclusively}} by ethnic Germans. After sending some scouts across, the unit's first experimental attempt to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> {{took place on}} 25 August 1944 near Velké Karlovice. A skirmish with German border guards ensued, with 20 Germans being wounded. After the arrival of German reinforcements, the unit was forced to pull back to Štiavnik. It was then decided that next time a smaller group should try to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> On 28 August, 60 men {{under the command of}} D B Murzin <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> while some 300 others remained in Slovakia, being daily joined by more anti-fascists.|$|R
