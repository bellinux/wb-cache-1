From 1990 to 1994 he worked with First Fidelity Bank, where he served as an executive vice president and oversaw technology and operations.

25|$|Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, {{the chief}} {{underwriter}} of Citigroup's <b>Consumer</b> <b>Lending</b> Group, began warning {{the board of}} directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that at the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Lending</b> Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing {{as one of the first}} witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.|$|E

[...] SBC acquired Banque Populaire Valaisanne, Sion, Switzerland, and the Banque Populaire de Sierre. [...] The firm continued to open new offices in the US in the mid-1960s and it was also at this time that SBC began to expand into Asia and opened representative offices throughout Latin America. [...] The bank opened a full branch office in Tokyo in 1970. [...] The bank also made a number of acquisitions to enhance its position in various products. [...] SBC acquired a controlling interest in Frei, Treig & Cie. in 1968, Warag Bank in 1970 and Bank Prokredit in 1979 (later sold to GE Capital in 1997). All three banks focused on <b>consumer</b> <b>lending.</b> [...] Similarly, SBC acquired a number of banks in the private banking sector, including Ehinger & Cie. in 1974; [...] Armand von Ernst & Cie. and Adler & Co. in 1976; and a majority interest in Geneva-based Ferrier Lullin & Cie. in 1978.

500|$|UBS {{continued}} its {{rapid growth in}} the 1960s punctuated by the acquisition of Interhandel (Industrie- und Handelsbeteiligungen AG) in 1967. Interhandel, originally, was a large Swiss conglomerate that up until the 1960s had both financial as well as industrial holdings. Interhandel was the corporate successor of I.G. Chemie, which the U.S. government had claimed was a front for Germany's I.G. Farben during World War II. During the war, the U.S. government seized General Aniline & Film (later GAF Corporation), an Interhandel subsidiary, {{and it was not}} until 1963 that the long-running dispute between Interhandel and the U.S. government was resolved. [...] The shares in GAF Corporation were sold in a highly competitive auction in 1965 and the proceeds were split between Interhandel and the U.S. government. [...] As a result of the sale of GAF, {{at the time of its}} merger with UBS, Interhandel held substantial amounts of cash. The addition of the Interhandel capital, which propelled UBS into the top spot among Swiss banks in 1968, also made UBS one of the strongest banks in Europe and helped fuel the bank’s further expansion in the late 1960s and 1970s. [...] UBS consolidated four affiliated mortgage lenders and assumed their domestic retail operations. The bank further expanded into <b>consumer</b> <b>lending</b> through the acquisition of a series of Swiss financial businesses in 1969, including Banque Orca, Abri Bank Bern, Aufina Bank and AKO Bank.|$|E

Absent higher delinquency, the extra credit from payday lenders does not fit our definition of predatory." [...] The caveat to this is that with a term of under 30 days there are no payments, and the lender is more than willing to roll the loan over at the end of the period upon payment of another fee. [...] The report goes on to note that payday loans are extremely expensive, and borrowers who take a payday loan are at a disadvantage in comparison to the lender, a reversal of the normal <b>consumer</b> <b>lending</b> information asymmetry, where the lender must underwrite the loan to assess creditworthiness.|$|E

While empirical observations suggest that producers take this into account, existing research has concentrated on analyzing the demand side. This paper investigates how a monopolist optimally designs its product line when consumers differ both in their taste for quality and their desire for a positive social image. The monopolist distorts qualities and prices to allocate images to consumers. It generically pools consumers with different tastes because high-taste <b>consumers</b> <b>lend</b> a positive image to the product of their choice and thereby increase the product's value to others.

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} assess whether <b>consumer</b> mortgage <b>lending</b> is being carried out responsibly in New Zealand through an investigation of banking corporations’ and mortgage brokers’ lending processes and of their related disclosures to borrowers. The research assesses whether changes were made to these lending practices since the global financial crisis began, to ensure more responsible lending practices. Through this exploratory investigation the research aims to inform the question of “just how socially responsible Australasian banking corporations are?” This paper commences with a review of relevant literature on the global financial crisis, corporate social responsibility and its role within financial institutions developing a theoretical framework in which to view responsible <b>consumer</b> mortgage <b>lending.</b> Data for the study were collected {{by means of a}} questionnaire sent to a sample of 300 mortgage brokers and 9 banking corporations operating within New Zealand. Corporate disclosure analysis was subsequently undertaken. Documents reviewed included the corporations’ corporate social responsibility reports, independent assurance statements, annual reports, media releases and websites through the period 2006 – 2010. The key characteristics highlighted in the theoretical framework, namely, ‘transparency’, ‘equality’ and ‘adequacy’ were used to interpret the responses to the questionnaires and corporate disclosure information to allow an assessment as to whether <b>consumer</b> mortgage <b>lending</b> is being carried out responsibly in New Zealand. The findings indicate that <b>consumer</b> mortgage <b>lending</b> in New Zealand overall, is being carried out in a responsible manner, with an emphasis being placed on prudent lending practice by banking corporation respondents. This has been further strengthened by a number of changes that have been made {{as a result of the}} global credit crisis. The results have illustrated concerns regarding three keys areas of the responsible lending theoretical framework, namely, commission payment processes, adequate insurance protection requirements and the continuing availability of subprime lending through ‘second-tier’ lenders. This paper adds to the limited literature of sustainability reporting in the financial sector. The study is important from a public policy perspective on disclosure of banking corporations’ lending practices and contributes to a global dialogue on corporate social responsibility in the financial industry. 27 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Our {{research}} empirically analyzes consumer {{behavior at}} Internet shopbots — sites that allow consumers to make “one-click ” price comparisons for product offerings from multiple retailers. By allowing researchers to observe exactly what information {{the consumer is}} shown and their search behavior {{in response to this}} information, shopbot data has unique strengths for analyzing consumer behavior. Furthermore, the method in which the data is displayed to <b>consumers</b> <b>lends</b> itself to a utility-based evaluation process, consistent with econometric analysis techniques. While price is an important determinant of customer choice, we find that, even among shopbot consumers, branded retailers and retailers a consumer visited previously hold significant price advantages in head-to-head price comparisons. Further, customers are very sensitive to how the total price is allocated among the item price, the shipping cost, and tax, and are also quite sensitive to the ordinal ranking of retailer offerings with respect to price. We also find that consumers use brand as a proxy for a retailer’s credibility with regard to non-contractible aspects of the product bundle such as shipping time.
