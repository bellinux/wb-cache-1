In this article we explore one of the major challenges that China is facing in the transition from middle to high income: the management of inequality. In particular, we explore the possible roots of future inequality that is associated with a nation’s underinvestment in the human capital of broad segments of its population. To meet this goal, we describe two challenges that China faces in the light of rising wage rates and highly unequal income distribution today. We first discuss the structural and institutional barriers that are discouraging many students (and their parents) from staying in school to achieve the levels of learning that we believe are necessary for preparing individuals for employment in the coming decades.

The state’s effort to achieve the transformation of the economy from a primary-producing one to an industrialized one has not been achieved due to deficiency in the planning procedure. The state’s economy is characterized by low per capita income, low capital formation, inadequate exploitation of potential natural resources and inadequate development of socio-economic infrastructure. The urgent necessity of the state is to build up an infrastructure base and to create conducive environment to boost investment in the state economy. The amount of investment flowing to an economy normally depends on the rate of return it is likely to generate. Sectoral pattern of investment depends on the income generating capacity of the different sectors of the economy. A backward economy characterized by <b>capital</b> <b>deficiency</b> has to carry out its investment programme in a careful manner and this requires a detailed understanding of the inter-sectoral dependence in the economy.

40|$|The Basle Agreement of 1988 is a twelve-nation banking accord that {{established}} international bank capital standards. A major {{implication of this}} agreement is that capital adequacy became central to regulatory oversight of banking systems around the world.

In this regard, this paper examines the efficacy of early warning systems (EWSs) {{with respect to the}} determinants and identification of capital inadequacy among U. S. commercial banks. Based on samples of banks in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, EWS models are empirically tested using financial and economic data for individual banks. The empirical results reveal that banks pending <b>capital</b> <b>deficiency</b> are much different from other banks in terms of their financial health.

40|$|Risk-based capital (RBC) is an {{important}} component of deposit insurance reform. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the new 1992 RBC bank standards, applying them to data on virtually all U. S. banks from 1982 to 1989. The data reveal strong associations between several measures of future bank performance (including bankruptcy) and the RBC relative risk weights. These associations suggest that the weights constitute a significant improvement over the old capital standards, although there are several instances in which the weights for specific categories appear to be out of line with the performance results. Tests of the informational value of passing or failing the new and old capital standards show that both have independent information, but that the new RBC standards better predict future bank performance problems. The data also indicate that, in contrast to the old standards, the RBC capital burden falls much more heavily on large banks. As a result, banks representing more than one-fourth of all bank assets would have failed the new RBC standards as of 1989. The new standards are also more stringent overall. More banks would have failed the new standards than the old ones, with larger average <b>capital</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Deposit insurance; Bank supervision; Bank capital...|$|E
40|$|Although {{business}} ownership {{has implications}} for income inequality, wealth accumulation and job creation, surprisingly little research explores why Mexican-Americans {{are less likely to}} start businesses and why the businesses that they start are less successful on average than non-Latino whites. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of Mexican-American entrepreneurship using microdata from the 2000 U. S. Census, the matched and unmatched March and Outgoing Rotation Group Files of the Current Population Survey from 1994 to 2004, and the Legalized Population Survey (LPS). We find that low levels of education and wealth explain the entire gap between Mexican immigrants and non-Latino whites in business formation rates. Nearly the entire gap in business income for Mexican immigrants is explained by low levels of education and limited English language ability. Using the natural experiment created by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), we find that legal status represents an additional barrier for Mexican immigrants. A conservative estimate suggests that the lack of legal status reduces business ownership rates by roughly seven-tenths of a percentage point for both men and women. Human and financial <b>capital</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are found to limit business ownership and business success among second and third-generation Mexican-Americans, but to a lesser extent.

In this dissertation a comparative case study was used within a critical race theory framework. The purpose was to explore the role of racial oppression in shaping social capital in majority African American communities. Data were collected from 2 majority Black communities in Florida.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to calls for}} more strategy-as-practice studies that foreground structural and relational linkages in strategy practice, this thesis investigated strategic networking practices of informal printing businesses in Ghana. Despite the increasing interest in strategy as situated practice, studies that examine strategy work in the informal economy are lacking. The informal economy has been pervasive despite earlier predictions of its demise; it contributes significantly to social and economic lives through the provision of essential low cost products and services, and generation of employment. Informal businesses are integral to the competitiveness of formal firms in some economies, through their involvement in supply chains and strategic networks. Their contribution to global commerce has also been acknowledged, however we know little about how they organise, manage, and strategise to achieve these. The informal economy thus presents opportunities for unveiling new insights, given the peculiar characteristics of the setting and participants, and the consequence these may have for shaping their strategising practices. Previous calls for strategy-as-practice research that bridge micro-macro treatments, in order to connect strategy work to agents embedded in states, fields, sectors, institutions, societies, cultures, and organisations remain to be fully realised. Invariably, {{an investigation of the}} informality phenomenon and its implicit complicity with strategic networking practices at the level of individual actors, businesses, field, institutions, the state, and the larger society in which they are embedded is expected to fill some of these gaps. The research employed Pierre Bourdieu’s practice theory incorporating the concepts of field, capital and habitus as a theoretical framework for the analysis. A case study employing organisational ethnographic data collection techniques was adopted. An embedded case design option was employed to select participant informal printing businesses which were sampled purposefully and accessed via snowballing strategies. Network partners were also contacted by these means in a multi-sited data collection approach. Ghana, a developing country, was selected because of its history of a large informal economy and ease of access. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, shadowing, observations, and documents that provided secondary sources of data. A two-phase data analysis process with thematic analysis phase preceding a Bourdieusian analysis phase was adopted. The findings categorised strategic networking practices of the informal printing businesses and their network partners into five main themes: ‘Drivers’, ‘Nature of relationships’, ‘Partners and exchanges’, ‘Building and managing relationships’, and ‘Outcomes’. Bourdieusian analysis that interpreted these findings articulated the strategic networking practices as an enactment of field logic of practice. The informal businesses engaged in strategic networking for the sake of practical coping in consonance with <b>capital</b> <b>deficiencies</b> that necessitated the creation of exchange-value. Exchange-value was created through capital exchanges amongst agents from fields with different logics, in order to transition to market opportunities controlled by dominant formal organisation field players. Interdependence behaviours (cooperative and/or co-opetitive) that sat comfortably with the focal field’s social structures (including material artefacts), and therefore agents’ dispositions and implicit codes of conduct, structured the conditions for these capital exchange and utilisation practices. To this end, the strategic networking practices were influenced by micro, meso and macro-level factors such as agents’ trajectories, the creative industry, the market, dominant players in the field of the informal printing economy, the regulatory framework, society, and trends in global trade. Again these ‘drivers’ delivered ‘outcomes’ at multiple levels that reached far beyond the local level of strategic networking practice. The study further suggests that the ‘drivers’ and ‘outcomes’ constructed, and were constructed by each other in a continuous cycle, {{much the same way that}} the strategic networking practice shaped, and was shaped by the social structures of the field in which the practices happened. This is depicted in a conceptual framework developed to summarise the findings. The findings make a number of contributions that relate to the structural and relational approach to the study of strategy work. They capture the contextual complexities that are often treated lightly in traditional strategy scholarship generally, and network studies specifically. Also the research has given impetus to macro-level influences, as well as generative mechanisms that underlie strategy practice. The ways these were internalised by agents are illustrated. The findings further demonstrate the role of materiality in strategy work, especially how work spaces could produce strategy, and at the same time, be products of strategy work. Secondly the findings demonstrate the institutionalisation of materiality in a field of practice. Finally, the findings highlight the fine-grained ‘on-goings’ in the relationships between formal and informal businesses which is yet to be significantly captured in the strategic management literature.

40|$|One of {{the major}} lenders to small and medium-size {{enterprises}} (SMEs) is nonbank financial institutions. Unlike deposit-taking banks, nonbank financial institutions - {{those that do not}} take deposits - tend to charge high interest rates, instead of asking for collateral, in extending credit to SMEs. Thus, there is a high possibility that information asymmetry between such nonbank lenders and SME borrowers may be creating adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Using the data taken from the "Survey of Financial Environment" conducted by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, this paper empirically examines whether or not moral hazard exists on the part of SMEs borrowing from nonbank financial institutions. The paper asserts the following two points: 1) Despite a decrease in both the amount of outstanding loans and the number of establishments, nonbank financial institutions are maintaining a high level of return on assets (ROA), measured as a percentage of recurring profits to total assets, and the total number of branches is not decreasing. Thus, judging from the data available on the part of nonbank financial institutions, it is hard to say that the market for nonbank financial institutions is shrinking. 2) Findings from an analysis of microdata on SMEs with a Bivariate Probit Model point to a high probability that borrowers from a nonbank financial institution will fall into a state of net <b>capital</b> <b>deficiency</b> within one year after resorting to such nonbank financing. Based on this, it is conceivable that companies using nonbank financing are opting for high-risk businesses thus resulting in higher loan loss risks.

[...] "Human capital refers to the skills, abilities, and knowledge possessed by specific individuals". This allows college-educated parents who have large amounts of human capital to invest in their children in certain ways to maximize future success- from reading to them at night to possessing a better understanding of the school system which causes them to be less differential to teachers and school authorities (...) [...] Research also shows that well-educated black parents are less able to transmit human capital to their children when compared to their white counterparts, due to a legacy of racism and discrimination.|$|R
