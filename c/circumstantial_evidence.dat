40|$|Abstract: Considering a fatal {{case of an}} aged individual, {{who died}} due to falling down stairs, {{the cause of the}} fatal fall was {{investigated}} through experiments. A witness, who was with the victim, when the fatal accident occurred, stated that the aged individual had miss-footed, lost balance {{at the top of the}} stairs, and fell accidently from an upper floor to a lower floor. It was very question-able whether or not this witness’s statements were true. The true cause of the fatal fall was unclear, because of the witness’s inconsistent statements, which showed discrepancies between the initial and later statements. The cause of a fatal fall can be presumed from external and internal damages to the body and other <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidences.</b> But it was difficult to prove the true cause of a fatal fall only from the results of the autopsy and investigation of <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidences.</b> The author was officially requested to conduct experiments to elucidate possible falling patterns. Judging from the experimental results, deep questions about the witness’s statements arose. These experimental methods and analyses in this paper could be applied to elucidate possible falling patterns of fatal falls from stairs where the fatal causes are controversial...|$|R
30|$|I can {{speculate}} that 〈dv⊥〉 was larger at earlier times from <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidences.</b> First, {{the rotation of}} the sun should be faster at earlier times because of loss of angular momentum with time. Hence, in addition to surface convection, interior differential rotation will lead to stronger surface fluctuations. From observational facts, younger stars show higher X-ray activities as discussed in the introduction section, which also anticipates larger 〈dv⊥〉. An important issue is that a small increase of 〈dv⊥〉 leads to a large increase of mass flux of solar wind.|$|R
30|$|Decision tree {{algorithms}} {{have several}} advantages. Since decision trees use an intuitive white box model, it easily predicts the target class of query data using Boolean logic. Especially, decision trees are simple {{to understand and}} interpret. Moreover, decision tree algorithms are robust and scalable for large data and they can train a classification model in reasonable processing time. Hence the decision tree model is effective not only to filter noisy PPI pairs from high-throughput experimental PPI data, but also to gain important insights that describe <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidences</b> of PPIs.|$|R
5|$|Checkmate is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Focusing {{on the subject of}} convictions by <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidence,</b> the plot has a French baron and an American businessman vie for the affections of an heiress. She chooses the American and the French baron conspires with the heiress's aunt to take revenge. The American falls into their trap and is accused of stabbing the baron by the conspirators. The <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidence</b> was enough to convict him and he is sent to prison. Through the aid of a homeless doppelgänger who looks like the fiancé, he is substituted in prison and the original forces a confession from the aunt. For his plot, the baron is convicted of perjury and sent to prison. Released on February 17, 1911, the film was a critical failure for its improbable plot and its prison substitution scene. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E

30|$|MiRNAs are small, non-coding {{transcripts}} that functioned in many tissues by repressing {{target gene}} expression (Chen et al., 2012). <b>Circumstantial</b> <b>evidences</b> suggest that miRNAs {{play a crucial}} role in the central nervous system (Ji et al., 2013). To elucidate the role of miRNAs in cerebrum development, we analyzed the miRNAs expression pattern in mice cerebrum and found several miRNAs that increase significantly during different developmental stages, among which miR- 29 a changed most significantly. The expression level of miR- 29 a showed no significant differences until postnatal stages when it increased dramatically both in cortex and hippocampus, indicating miR- 29 a may be associated with the process of neural maturation.|$|R

The court acknowledged that end users could enable fragmentation through software control and therefore might infringed the patents at issue. However, because fragmentation is merely an optional component of the IEEE 802.11 specification and Netgear products did not enable fragmentation by default, the court could not find any explicit <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidences</b> that third parties indeed infringed the 952 patent.|$|R
5|$|Before 2010, the {{computing}} {{reliability of}} GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidence</b> {{related to the}} lack of built-in error detection and correction in GPU memory raised reliability concerns.

These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.|$|E

It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidence</b> of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity.

After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the History series Brad Meltzer's Decoded also summarized the <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidence</b> linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.|$|E
30|$|While {{vast amounts}} of data {{obtained}} from high-throughput experiments allow for efficient identification {{of different kinds of}} PPI information, they are prone to higher false positive rates than small-scale studies [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Some studies have reported that approximately half of the interactions obtained from high-throughput data may be false positives [17, 19]. This necessitates an additional experimental or computational method to estimate the reliability of each PPI precisely. To do this, selecting relevant properties of PPI as <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidences,</b> and adopting efficient computational methodologies are important. Several circumstantial features have previously been used to identify true PPIs from high-throughput experimental data in yeast [17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].|$|R

Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E
5|$|The Second and Third of May 1808 {{are thought}} to have been {{intended}} as parts of a larger series. Written commentary and <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidence</b> suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the Royal Academy in 1867, José Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Cristóbal Ferriz—an artist and a collector of Goya—mentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks. Contemporary prints stand as precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection.|$|E

METHODS: Surgical samples of prostate and seminal vesicles were fixed {{in a mixture of}} paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, and embedded in Epon resin without previous osmication. Ultrathin sections were treated for the intracellular localization of statherin by means of an immunogold staining method. RESULTS: Reactive statherin was revealed in secreting cells of both seminal vesicle and prostate epithelia: labeling was found in secretory granules of seminal vesicle cells and in cytoplasmic vesicles of prostatic cells.

5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} rongorongo {{may have been an}} invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As <b>circumstantial</b> <b>evidence,</b> they note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form of writing, but that the concept of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own system of writing. If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than a hundred years.|$|E
