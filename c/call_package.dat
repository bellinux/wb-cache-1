The general programme design principles referred to are based on courseware features such as log-on, menus and hierarchy, reference materials, utilities, student recording devices, feedback, progress reports and exercises. A general overview is given on the template approach to designing and creating a multimedia <b>CALL</b> <b>package.</b> &# 13; Throughout the paper examples are given from the author's own experience in multimedia development for language learning purposes...|$|E

However, due to the influence of mother tongue, Hong Kong students often unconsciously employ Cantonese dialect expressions in their writing. This paper introduces CPWrite, an implemented Web-based <b>CALL</b> <b>package</b> to help tackle this problem. The important functions of the software are to test and improve students’ ability in Cantonese dialect recognition and Putonghua translation, at both lexical and grammatical levels. The underlying strategies employed by CPWrite can be applicable to converting authentic language to standardized formats. Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studie...|$|E

Oxford Placement Test (OPT), pretest and posttest in form of paragraph writing and adopted editing checklist were used to collect data from 50 homogenous intermediate English as a foreign language (EFL) participants selected from a large sample at Azad university of Marivan Branch. The data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially using ANCOVA to test the CALL effectiveness on EFL learners ’ mechanics of writing.

40|$|Because {{we like to}} run the AFS {{distributed}} {{file system}} on dataless clients at our homes, {{it is vital that}} the meager bandwidth available be used effectively. This makes Rx, the AFS remote procedure <b>call</b> <b>package,</b> a critical link in the overall system performance chain. In this paper, we report on our progress in adapting Rx to networks characterized by low bandwidth, high delay, or variable round-trip time. When we started, the throughput delivered by Rx over dialup networks was approximately zero, due to fragmentation and congestion collapse. By making extensive modifications to Rx, focusing on congestion avoidance and control and header compression, we have accomplished our throughput objectives and made Rx a high-performing transport layer. 1. Introduction AFS [1] is a distributed file system that employs aggressive client caching on local disk for performance and scalability. AFS was designed with highspeed networking and continuous connectivity as a given; this bias is reflected [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a project, Callguide, {{to investigate the}} hypertext system Guide as an authoring shell for computer assisted language learning programs. The paper begins by considering the advantages of computers in CALL. It goes on to discuss the interface requirements for a <b>CALL</b> <b>package.</b> The Callguide programs were written, under a hypertext system without audio-visual facilities, to improve the intensive reading skills of advanced students who have A-level or equivalent in English as a Foreign Language and who are additionally motivated {{by the need to}} study a technical discipline in the foreign language. Herr, the discipline is computing, but the techniques would apply equally well to other subjects. The project has largely concentrated on exercises to improve the student's lexical skills and ability to understand, in detail, a technical text. Lexical skills include exercises to recognise antonyms and synonyms, word formation to correspond with part of speech and understanding idiomatic expressions. Discourse skills include maintaining coherence throughout a passage by verb correspondence in tense, mode and aspect, identifying referents of pronouns and relative pronouns, and traditional comprehension exercises including completing Cloze texts and connectivity matrices. A brief user evaluation of the project is followed by a conclusion...|$|E

5000|$|Calls to most 084 and 087 non-geographic {{telephone}} numbers {{are generally not}} included in bundled minutes from landlines and even less so from mobile telephones.

5000|$|In 1999, {{landline}} providers {{started to}} offer [...] "inclusive" [...] <b>call</b> <b>packages</b> where <b>calls</b> to 01 and 02 numbers were free. Within {{a few years}} most customers were on this type of plan. The price for calling 0870 numbers continued {{at roughly the same}} levels as before - and as they were not usually included in <b>calling</b> <b>packages</b> or free minutes, they effectively became more expensive to call than regular geographic numbers in most cases. Mobile operators also began to charge a higher rate for 0870 calls than for geographic numbers. As a result, the term [...] "national rate" [...] was no longer an accurate description of the price for calling 0870 numbers. The Advertising Standards Authority made several rulings against companies claiming that their 0870 numbers were charged at national rates over the following years.|$|R
