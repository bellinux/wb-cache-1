40|$|The Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) is a {{class of}} complex {{stochastic}} dynamical systems with interacting continuous and discrete dynamics. Many cyber-physical systems with continuous/physical parts interconnected with discrete/logical elements can be well modeled as the SHS. This paper develops a set of theories and algorithms for state estimation and optimal control of the SHS. Firstly, to describe the time-evolution of the SHS, two kinds of dynamical models are proposed: the Discrete-Time SHS (DTSHS) and the Continuous-Time SHS (<b>CTSHS).</b> Then, a hybrid estimation algorithm is developed to estimate both the continuous and discrete states of the DTSHS with noisy sensor measurements. Also, the proposed hybrid estimation algorithm is applied to aircraft surveillance sensor fusion, aircraft trajectory prediction and conflict detection for air traffic management. As for the <b>CTSHS,</b> its state estimation problem is mathematically formulated and solved using proposed filtering equations which are able to characterize the time evolution of the probability distribution of the hybrid state estimates. The filtering equations are numerically solved via a Markov Chain (MC) approximation algorithm. It is proved that this algorithm is able to give a result that weakly converges to the exact solution of the filtering equation when {{the resolution of the}} approximation converges to zero. Finally, the optimal control problem for the DTSHS is solved via a 2 ̆ 2 separable 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 control scheme: the controller uses the proposed hybrid estimation algorithm to estimate the state of the DTSHS and the optimal control inputs are computed from the state estimates. To numerically compute the optimal mapping from the state estimates to the admissable control inputs, the Q-learning approach is applied, which is based on discretizing the distribution function space of all possible state estimates. The proposed optimal control algorithm is validated through a spacecraft rendezvous example. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The 11 human {{cysteine}} cathepsins are proteases mainly {{located in}} the endolysosomal compartment of all cells and within the exocytosis pathways of some secretory cell types. Cathepsin H (<b>Ctsh)</b> has amino- and endopeptidase activities. In vitro studies have demonstrated <b>Ctsh</b> involvement in the processing and secretion of the pulmonary surfactant protein B (SP-B). Furthermore, <b>Ctsh</b> is highly expressed in the secretory organelles of alveolar type II pneumocytes where the surfactant proteins are processed. Methodology/Principal Findings: Hence, we generated <b>Ctsh</b> null mice by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to investigate the role of this protease in surfactant processing in vivo. The targeting construct contains a ß-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter enabling the visualisation of <b>Ctsh</b> expression sites. Ctsh-deficiency was verified by northern blot, western blot, and measurement of the <b>Ctsh</b> aminopeptidase activity. <b>Ctsh</b> 2 / 2 mice show no gross phenotype and their development is normal without growth retardation. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) from <b>Ctsh</b> 2 / 2 mice contained lower levels of SP-B indicating reduced SP-B secretion. The BAL phospholipid concentration was not different in Ctsh+/+ and <b>Ctsh</b> 2 / 2 mice, but measurement of surface tension by pulsating bubble surfactometry revealed an impairment of the tension reducing function of lung surfactant of <b>Ctsh</b> 2 / 2 mice.

40|$|The cytoskeletal protein talin, an actin- and Ž-integrin tail-binding protein,plays an {{important}} role in cell migration by promoting integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Here, we show that talin is a substrate for cathepsin H (<b>CtsH),</b> a lysosomal cysteine protease with a strong aminopeptidase activity. Purified active <b>CtsH</b> sequentially cleaved a synthetic peptide representing the N terminus of the talin F 0 head domain. The processing of talin by <b>CtsH</b> was determined also in the metastatic PC- 3 prostate cancer cell line, which exhibits increased expression of <b>CtsH.</b> The attenuation of <b>CtsH</b> aminopeptidase activity by a specific inhibitor or siRNA-mediated silencing significantly reduced the migration of PC- 3 cells on fibronectin and invasion through Matrigel. We found that in migrating PC- 3 cells, <b>CtsH</b> was co-localized with talin in the focal adhesions. Furthermore, specific inhibition of <b>CtsH</b> increased the activation of Ž(v) Ž(3) -integrin on PC- 3 cells. We propose that CtsH-mediated processing of talin might promote cancer cell progression by affecting integrin activation and adhesion strength...|$|R

40|$|Over 40 {{susceptibility}} loci {{have been}} identified for type 1 diabetes (T 1 D). Little is known about how these variants modify disease risk and progression. Here, we combined in vitro and in vivo experiments with clinical studies to determine how genetic variation of the candidate gene cathepsin H (<b>CTSH)</b> affects disease mechanisms and progression in T 1 D. The T allele of rs 3825932 was associated with lower <b>CTSH</b> expression in human lymphoblastoid cell lines and pancreatic tissue. Proinflammatory cytokines decreased the expression of <b>CTSH</b> in human islets and primary rat β-cells, and overexpression of <b>CTSH</b> protected insulin-secreting cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic studies indicated that <b>CTSH</b> exerts its antiapoptotic effects through decreased JNK and p 38 signaling and reduced expression of the proapoptotic factors Bim, DP 5, and c-Myc. <b>CTSH</b> overexpression also up-regulated Ins 2 expression and increased insulin secretion. Additionally, islets from Ctsh-/- mice contained less insulin than islets from WT mice. Importantly, the TT genotype was associated with higher daily insulin dose and faster disease progression in newly diagnosed T 1 D patients, indicating agreement between the experimental and clinical data. In line with these observations, healthy human subjects carrying the T allele have lower β-cell function, which was evaluated by glucose tolerance testing. The data provide strong evidence that <b>CTSH</b> is an important regulator of β-cell function during progression of T 1 D and reinforce the concept that candidate genes for T 1 D may affect disease progression by modulating survival and function of pancreatic β-cells, the target cells of the autoimmune assault.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyrotropin (TSH) can be {{increased}} in humans with primary hypoadrenocorticism (HA) before glucocorticoid treatment. Increase in TSH is a typical finding of primary hypothyroidism and both diseases can occur concurrently (Schmidt's syndrome); therefore, {{care must be taken}} in assessing thyroid function in untreated human patients with HA. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate whether alterations in <b>cTSH</b> can be observed in dogs with HA in absence of primary hypothyroidism. ANIMALS: Thirty dogs with newly diagnosed HA, and 30 dogs in which HA was suspected but excluded based on a normal ACTH stimulation test (controls) were prospectively enrolled. METHODS: <b>cTSH</b> and T 4 concentrations were determined in all dogs and at selected time points during treatment (prednisolone, fludrocortisone, or DOCP) in dogs with HA. RESULTS: <b>cTSH</b> concentrations ranged from 0. 01 to 2. 6 ng/mL (median 0. 29) and were increased in 11 / 30 dogs with HA; values in controls were all within the reference interval (range: 0. 01 - 0. 2 ng/dL; median 0. 06). There was no difference in T 4 between dogs with increased <b>cTSH</b> (T 4 range 1. 0 - 2. 1; median 1. 3 μg/dL) compared to those with normal <b>cTSH</b> (T 4 range 0. 5 - 3. 4, median 1. 4 μg/dL; P= 0. 69) and controls (T 4 range 0. 3 - 3. 8, median 1. 8 μg/dL; P= 0. 35). After starting treatment, <b>cTSH</b> normalized after 2 - 4 weeks in 9 dogs and after 3 and 4 months in 2 without thyroxine supplementation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Evaluation of thyroid function in untreated dogs with HA can lead to misdiagnosis of hypothyroidism; treatment with glucocorticoids for up to 4 months can be necessary to normalize <b>cTSH...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hypothyroidism may {{predispose}} to {{the development}} of canine leishmaniosis or it may appear {{during the course of the}} latter due to infiltration and destruction of the thyroid gland by infected macrophages. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate thyroid function through measurement of serum total thyroxin (tT(4)), free thyroxin (fT(4)), and canine thyroid stimulating hormone (<b>cTSH)</b> concentrations in 36 dogs with leishmaniosis, before and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with allopurinol with or without meglumine antimonate. Before treatment 27 / 36 (75 %) dogs had serum tT(4) concentrations below the lower limit of the reference interval but only 2 of them had concurrently serum fT(4) concentrations below the lower limit of the reference interval and none had increased serum <b>cTSH</b> concentrations. During treatment there were no significant changes in serum tT(4) or fT(4) concentrations, whereas a significant increase in serum <b>cTSH</b> was observed. Two dogs had decreased serum tT(4) and fT(4) but normal <b>cTSH</b> concentrations before treatment and two other dogs had decreased serum tT(4) and increased <b>cTSH,</b> but normal fT(4) concentrations during the treatment period. Although hypothyroidism could not be definitively excluded in these dogs it is considered unlikely based on their overall hormonal profile, clinical presentation, and response to treatment. Therefore, hypothyroidism does not appear to be an important predisposing disease or a frequent complication of canine leishmaniosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} recombinant human (rh) thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in dogs with suspected hypothyroidism. ANIMALS: 64 dogs with clinical signs of hypothyroidism. PROCEDURES: Dogs received rhTSH (75 microg/dog, IV) at a dose independent of their body weight. Blood samples were taken before and 6 hours after rhTSH administration for determination of total serum thyroxine (T(4)) concentration. Dogs were placed into 1 of 3 groups as follows: those with normal (ie, poststimulation values indicative of euthyroidism), unchanged (ie, poststimulation values indicative of hypothyroidism; no thyroid gland stimulation), or intermediate (ie, poststimulation values between unchanged and normal values) post-TSH T(4) concentrations. Serum canine TSH (<b>cTSH)</b> concentration was determined in prestimulation serum (ie, before TSH administration). RESULTS: 14, 35, and 15 dogs had unchanged, normal, and intermediate post-TSH T(4) concentrations, respectively. Basal T(4) and post-TSH T(4) concentrations were significantly different among groups. On the basis of basal serum T(4) and <b>cTSH</b> concentrations alone, 1 euthyroid (normal post-TSH T(4), low basal T(4), and high <b>cTSH</b> concentrations) and 1 hypothyroid dog (unchanged post-TSH T(4) concentration and low to with-in reference range T(4) and <b>cTSH</b> concentrations) would have been misinterpreted as hypothyroid and euthyroid, respectively. Nine of the 15 dogs with intermediate post-TSHT(4) concentrations had received medication known to affect thyroid function prior to the test, and 2 of them had severe nonthyroidal disease. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The TSH-stimulation test with rhTSH is a valuable diagnostic tool to assess thyroid function in selected dogs in which a diagnosis of hypothyroidism cannot be based on basal T(4) and <b>cTSH</b> concentrations alone...|$|R

40|$|Myopia is an {{extremely}} common eye disorder but the pathogenesis of its isolated form, which accounts for {{the overwhelming majority of}} cases, remains poorly understood. There is strong evidence for genetic predisposition to myopia, but determining myopia genetic risk factors has been difficult to achieve. We have identified Mendelian forms of myopia in four consanguineous families and implemented exome/autozygome analysis to identify homozygous truncating variants in LRPAP 1 and <b>CTSH</b> as the likely causal mutations. LRPAP 1 encodes a chaperone of LRP 1, which is known to influence TGF-β activity. Interestingly, we observed marked deficiency of LRP 1 and upregulation of TGF-β in cells from affected individuals, the latter being consistent with available data on the role of TGF-β in the remodeling of the sclera in myopia and the high frequency of myopia in individuals with Marfan syndrome who characteristically have upregulation of TGF-β signaling. <b>CTSH,</b> on the other hand, encodes a protease and we show that deficiency of the murine ortholog results in markedly abnormal globes consistent with the observed human phenotype.

40|$|Background Filaggrin, {{which is}} encoded by the filaggrin gene (FLG), is an {{important}} component of the skin's barrier to the external environment, and genetic defects in FLG strongly associate with atopic dermatitis (AD). However, not all patients with AD have FLG mutations. Objective We hypothesized that these patients might possess other defects in filaggrin expression and processing contributing to barrier disruption and AD, and therefore we present novel therapeutic targets for this disease. Results We describe the relationship between the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 / 2 protein subunit regulatory associated protein of the MTOR complex 1 (RAPTOR), the serine/threonine kinase V-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT 1), and the protease cathepsin H (<b>CTSH),</b> for which we establish a role in filaggrin expression and processing.

Synthesis of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX 2) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) was evaluated by ELISA. Gene expression and protein secretion of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. F. nucleatum increased the production of COX 2 and PGE 2, which was further increased by CTS.

40|$|Objective: To {{monitor the}} {{long-term}} {{health status of}} a cohort of client-owned Basenji dogs over several years; to compare the accuracy of various laboratory methods to assess thyroid status; and to document any adverse effects of routinely recommended doses of thyroxine for confirmed or presumptive hypothyroidism. Methods: Health outcomes were followed by 1 - 8 years of clinical surveillance using serum total thyroid hormone (TT 4) and canine thyroid-stimulating hormone (<b>cTSH)</b> concentrations, and either dynamic thyroid testing using recombinant human (rh) TSH, and/or thyroid histopathology at necropsy. The long-term accuracy of the various diagnostic interpretative criteria for rhTSH stimulation was analysed. The clinical history and serial concentrations of TT 4 and <b>cTSH</b> in dogs suspected of exhibiting adverse clinical responses to standard thyroxine supplementation were reviewed. Results: When rhTSH interpretative criteria were compared with thyroid histology at necropsy, Larsson's equation correctly identified normal Basenji dogs from dogs with hypothyroidism and extensive thyroid pathology, yet provided an equivocal result for dogs that were not hypothyroid. Despite sequential low TT 4 concentration measurements over several years of clinical surveillance, these 'equivocal' dogs had unremarkable thyroid histology (consistent with breed and age) at necropsy. Thyroxine supplementation at recommended dose rates resulted in clinical signs of thyrotoxicosis in six elderly Basenji dogs. Conclusion: Age and breed may account for dose-related adverse responses in Basenji dogs dosed with thyroxine at recommended doses. We recommend that when conducting therapeutic thyroid supplementation trials in this breed, the drug be administered in gradually increasing doses to avoid dose-related side effects. In a breed with a lower than 'normal' reference interval for serum TT 4 concentration, attempts to achieve the post-pill TT 4 concentration achieved in normal dogs may induce signs of thyrotoxicosis. Serial <b>cTSH</b> concentration measurements are helpful when adjusting thyroxine supplementation in Basenji dogs.

The prevalence of hyperthyroidism (tT 4 > 50 nmol/L or tT 4 between 30 - 50 nmol/L with <b>cTSH</b> 50 pmol/L) within this population was 7. 0 % with no significant difference in prevalence between healthy (5. 1 %) and sick (8. 2 %) cats. Cats ≥ 12 years of age (OR= 4. 3, p= 0. 02) and cats with canned food in their diet (OR= 2. 1, p= 0. 1) were more likely to be diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. No significant relationship between vaccinations, parasite control or indoor environment and hyperthyroidism was observed. Hyperthyroid cats were more likely to present with weight loss (OR= 3. 2, p= 0. 01) and with a heart rate ≥ 200 bpm (OR= 5, p= 0. 01) than cats without the disease.

This disorder is now recognised as the most common feline endocrinopathy in many geographical locations, with diabetes mellitus coming a close second. Epidemiological studies performed to date have also suggested a geographic variation in the prevalence of the disease. This seemingly apparent variation may, in fact, reflect differences in dietary, environmental or genetic factors. Although clinical features of feline hyperthyroidism {{as well as its}} pathological lesions are well described, the exact pathogenesis of the disease still remains obscure and despite a plethora of epidemiological studies, clear risk factors for the disease have not been identified. Further information on worldwide prevalence of the disease and possible causative factors would increase our understanding of the aetiology of this disease and help identify any preventive measures. As far as the author is aware, prevalence studies have not yet been performed in South Africa, a geographic area in which hyperthyroidism in cats has relatively recently been observed and reported and the incidence of which anecdotally appears to be on the increase. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of feline hyperthyroidism in South Africa and to identify any potential risk factors associated with the disease in this geographic location. This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in cats that were presented for either geriatric check-ups and routine vaccinations or various illnesses at five general veterinary practices throughout South Africa between February 2014 and June 2015. Cats were included in the study if they were nine years of age or older and had resided solely in South Africa. Cats were excluded from the study if their demeanour precluded the collection of a blood sample, or if they had been treated with drugs that could potentially affect tT 4 and TSH concentrations. At the time of blood sampling a questionnaire was completed regarding the health status of the cat, vaccination history, internal and external parasite control, diet and environment. Consent for blood collection was obtained from the owners and ethical approval for the study was also applied for and granted by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Pretoria. Serum tT 4 and <b>cTSH</b> concentrations were determined in all cats by use of a chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay (Immulite ® 1000 Canine total T 4, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics) and a chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Immulite ® 1000 Canine TSH, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics) respectively. The reference interval for tT 4 was 14 - 50 nmol/L and for <b>cTSH</b> 0 - 0. 07 ng/ml (laboratories historical reference intervals). Serum fT 4 concentrations were measured in cats with a serum tT 4 concentration between 30 - 50 nmol/L and a serum <b>cTSH</b> concentration less than 0. 03 ng/ml using equilibrium dialysis (Antech Diagnostics Inc ® Free T 4 by Equilibrium Dialysis) with a reference interval of 10 - 50 pmol/L (laboratories historical reference intervals). All cats with a serum tT 4 concentration greater than 50 nmol/L or cats with a serum tT 4 concentration between 30 - 50 nmol/L, a serum <b>cTSH</b> concentration less than 0. 03 ng/ml and a serum fT 4 concentration greater than 50 pmol/L were classified as hyperthyroid. Prevalence of hyperthyroidism, with exact binomial 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), was calculated for all cats combined, for cats classified as healthy (no clinically significant disease identified) and for those classified as sick. Prevalence was compared between healthy and sick cats using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Univariable associations between potential risk factors and hyperthyroidism were assessed using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Thereafter, all predictors were entered into a multiple logistic regression model to estimate their effect on the risk of hyperthyroidism. Associations between clinical signs and hyperthyroidism were assessed on a univariable level using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. The study population consisted of a total of 302 cats. The most common breeds represented included domestic shorthair (DSH) (n= 201), domestic longhair (DLH) (n= 29), Siamese and Siamese crosses (n= 26), Persian and Persian crosses (n= 10), Burmese (n= 10), Balinese (n= 6) and Maine Coon and Maine Coon crosses (n= 5). There were 161 females and 141 males, 265 of which were sterilised. The median age of the cats was 12 years (range 9 - 24 years). Dissertation (MMedVet) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|Narcolepsy is a {{neurological}} disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagonic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disturbed nocturnal sleep patterns. Narcolepsy {{is caused by}} the loss of hypocretin (orexin) -producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Evidence, such as a strong association with HLA DQB 1 * 06 : 02, strongly suggests an autoimmune basis targeting hypocretin neurons. Genome-wide association studies have strengthened the association between narcolepsy and immune system gene polymorphisms, including the identification of polymorphisms in the T cell receptor alpha locus, TNFSF 4 (also called OX 40 L), Cathepsin H (<b>CTSH)</b> the purinergic receptor P 2 RY 11, and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT 1. Recently, attention has been raised regarding a spike in cases of childhood narcolepsy in 2010 following the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic (pH 1 N 1) in China and vaccination with Pandemrix, an adjuvanted H 1 N 1 vaccine that was used in Europe. How the immune system may be involved in disease initiation and/or progression remains a challenge to researchers. Potential immunological pathways that could lead to the specific elimination of hypocretin producing neurons include molecular mimicry or bystander activation, and are likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as upper airway infections...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of minor H antigen {{mismatching}} on the outcome of renal transplantation are scarce and concern mainly single center studies. The International Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Workshops (IHIW) provide a collaborative platform to execute crucial large studies. In collaboration with 16 laboratories of the IHIW, the role of 15 autosomal, 10 Y-chromosome encoded minor H antigens and 3 CD 31 polymorphisms, was investigated in relation to the incidence of renal graft rejection and graft loss in 444 human leukocyte antigens (HLA) -identical sibling renal transplantations. Recipient and donor DNA samples were genotyped for the minor H antigens HA- 1, HA- 2, HA- 3, HA- 8, HB- 1, ACC- 1, ACC- 2, SP 110, PANE 1, UGT 2 B 17, C 19 Orf 48, LB-ECGF- 1, <b>CTSH,</b> LRH- 1, LB-ADIR and HY. The correlation between minor H antigen mismatch and the primary outcome graft rejection or graft loss was statistically analyzed. The incidence of rejection was very low and no correlation was observed between one or more minor H antigen mismatch(es) and a rejection episode (n[*]=[*] 36), of which only eight resulted in graft loss. In summary, in our study cohort of 444 renal transplants, mismatching for neither autosomal nor HY minor H antigens correlate with rejection episodes or with graft loss...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{analysis}} of rodent disease models provides {{a powerful tool}} to investigate how modifier loci cause variation in the phenotypic expression of a disease. In order to test the existence of modifier loci influencing polycystic kidney disease (PKD) phenotypes, we derived a backcross between PKD susceptible Han:SPRD(cy/+) and control Brown Norway (BN) rats, and performed a whole-genome scan in 182 PKD affected hybrids showing different grades of disease severity. The genetic dissection of PKD in the cross allowed us to detect a modifier locus, Modpkdr 1, on rat chromosome 8 that controls PKD severity, kidney mass and plasma urea concentration. Results from database searches and computational analyses demonstrated that the Modpkdr 1 locus shows strong evidence of synteny conservation with human and mouse chromosomal regions controlling kidney diseases, including disease progression of Alport syndrome. Comparative genome mapping also provided an inventory of potential candidate genes for modifier(s) of PKD. Analyses of the coding regions for four strong candidates (<b>Ctsh,</b> Bcl 2 a 1, Trpc 1 and Slc 21 a 2) in (cy/+), BN and Lewis rat strains did not reveal sequence variants that could be associated with PKD. The characterization of Modpkdr 1 may provide new insights into modulating mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PKD that could delay disease progression in humans. It may also have strong implications {{in the identification of}} pathophysiological factors common to different renal disorders...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Lacrimal glands (LGs) of male NOD mice, a {{model of}} Sjögren's {{syndrome}} (SjS), exhibit immune cell infiltration and lipid deposition. The mechanism of SjS was further investigated by characterizing gene expression profiles of NOD mouse LGs in comparison with those of healthy control mice. Differentially expressed genes were further investigated at the protein level to correlate changes in location and abundance with development of disease. Methods. Microarray followed by real-time RT-PCR was conducted to compare the gene expression in 12 -week-old male NOD mouse LG relative to that in matched BALB/c mouse LG. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses were used to localize and quantify proteins of interest. Enzymatic assays measured catalytic activity of cathepsins. Results. Cathepsin H (<b>Ctsh),</b> S (Ctss), and Z (Ctsz) and proinflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), interleukin 6 (Il 6), and interleukin 1 beta (Il 1 b), were upregulated at the mRNA level. Increased cathepsin S immunofluorescence was detected in lysosomes and secretory vesicle-like organelles in LG acinar cells and CD 68 -positive infiltrating macrophages in NOD mouse LG. Cathepsin S (CATS) and cathepsin H (CATH) activities were significantly higher in NOD mouse LG lysate than in control lysates, and CATS was also significantly elevated in NOD mouse tears. Conclusions. Expression of CATS and CATH increases in parallel with proinflammatory cytokines during the development of autoimmune inflammatory disease in the NOD mouse disease model. Tear CATS may represent a biomarker for diagnosis of dacryoadenitis in SjS...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} gene {{expression}} patterns of synovial cells from inflamed or normal/reactive areas of synovial membrane {{obtained from the}} same patient with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods At the time of total knee replacement, synovial tissues were obtained from 12 patients with knee OA. The inflammation status of the synovial membrane was characterized according to macroscopic criteria and classified as normal/reactive or inflamed. Biopsy samples were cultured separately for 7 days. Microarray gene expression profiling was performed on normal/reactive and inflamed areas. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm the identified genes that were differentially expressed. Results We identified 896 genes that were differentially expressed between normal/reactive and inflamed areas. The key pathways were related to inflammation, cartilage metabolism, Wnt signaling, and angiogenesis. In the inflammation network, the genes TREM 1 and S 100 A 9 were strongly up-regulated. The genes MMP 3, MMP 9, <b>CTSH</b> (cathepsin H), and CTSS (cathepsin S) were significantly up-regulated in the cartilage catabolism pathway, while the most up-regulated anabolism enzyme gene was HAS 1. In the Wnt signaling pathway, the genes for Wnt- 5 a and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 were up-regulated, while the gene FZD 2 and the gene for Dkk- 3 were down-regulated. Finally, STC 1, which codes for a protein involved in angiogenesis, was identified as the most up-regulated gene in inflamed compared with normal/reactive areas. Conclusion This study {{is the first to}} identify different expression patterns between 2 areas of the synovial membrane from the same patient. These differences concern several key pathways involved in OA pathogenesis. This analysis also provides information regarding new genes and proteins as potential targets of treatment. © 2014 The Authors.

40|$|Hypoxia {{correlates}} with abnormal angiogenesis, {{increased risk of}} metastasis and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. The structural and functional abnormalities of the tumour vasculature impair the delivery and efficacy of existing cancer therapies, aid the metastatic dissemination and fuel an aggressive tumour milieu. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an abundant stromal component in breast tumours; yet, their role in angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions is poorly characterised. Here, using a 3 D co-culture system, we have shown that endothelial cells (ECs) co-cultured with CAFs under hypoxia or exposed to the conditioned medium (CM) of hypoxic CAFs sprouted significantly more than the normoxic counterpart. To identify the secreted factors responsible for this phenotype, we have used SILAC-based MS secretomics of mammary CAF cell lines. More than 1, 000 proteins were quantified in the soluble and extracellular vesicles fractions of the CAF secretome. We found that targets of HIF 1 α and TGFβ were highly induced by the low oxygen environment. Moreover, a variety of secreted proteins known to influence angiogenesis were regulated by hypoxia. Strikingly, we have identified two novel hypoxia-induced secreted proteins, a leucine-rich repeat containing (LRRC) protein and an antisense protein (AS). The up-regulation of LRRC by hypoxia occurred at transcriptional level in a HIF 1 α-dependent manner only in fibroblasts but not in cancer or endothelial cells. In agreement with this finding, in vivo LRRC is expressed specifically in the stroma of murine and human breast tumours. The increased levels of the protein AS 2 induced by hypoxia was not a result of transcriptional regulation, and in vivo AS 2 was found in both cancer and stromal cells. Strikingly, ECs treated with the CM of hypoxic CAFs silenced for LRRC or AS 2 significantly decreased their sprouting and migration ability. We then measured in an unbiased fashion the global changes induced in the secretome of hypoxic CAFs upon silencing of LRRC and AS 2. Notably, the knockdown of LRRC in hypoxic CAFs decreased the secretion of IL- 6, <b>CTSH</b> and SOD 3, which {{have been reported to}} induce angiogenesis. The silencing of AS 2 in hypoxic CAFs decreased the levels of secreted VEGFA, the master pro-angiogenic growth factor. We have identified novel stroma-derived secreted proteins that enhance angiogenesis in hypoxic conditions. Our findings can provide new avenues to normalise the dysfunctional vasculature found in advanced breast tumours...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: In our {{previous}} {{investigations of the}} role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in promoting neurite growth we have observed that a permissive laminin (LN) substrate stimulates differential growth responses in subpopulations of mature dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons expressing Trk and p 75 receptors grow neurites on a LN substrate in the absence of neurotrophins, while isolectin B 4 -binding neurons (IB 4 +) do not display significant growth under the same conditions. We set out to determine whether there was an expression signature of the LN-induced neurite growth phenotype. Using a lectin binding protocol IB 4 + neurons were isolated from dissociated DRG neurons, creating two groups - IB 4 + and IB 4 -. A small-scale microarray approach was employed to screen the expression of a panel of ECM-associated genes following dissociation (t= 0) and after 24 hr culture on LN (t= 24 LN). This was followed by qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry of selected genes. Results: The microarray screen showed that 36 of the 144 genes on the arrays were consistently expressed by the neurons. The array analyses showed that six genes had lower expression in the IB 4 + neurons compared to the IB 4 - cells at t= 0 (<b>CTSH,</b> Icam 1, Itgβ 1, Lamb 1, Plat, Spp 1), and one gene was expressed at higher levels in the IB 4 + cells (Plaur). qRT-PCR was carried out as an independent assessment of the array results. There were discrepancies between the two methods, with qRT-PCR confirming the differences in Lamb 1, Plat and Plaur, and showing decreased expression of AdamTs 1, FN, and Icam in the IB 4 + cells at t= 0. After 24 hr culture on LN, there were no significant differences detected by qRT-PCR between the IB 4 + and IB 4 - cells. However, both groups showed upregulation of Itgβ 1 and Plaur after 24 hr on LN, the IB 4 + group also had increased Plat, and the IB 4 - cells showed decreased Lamb 1, Icam 1 and AdamTs 1. Further, the array screen also detected a number of genes (not subjected to qRT-PCR) expressed similarly by both populations in relatively high levels but not detectably influenced by time in culture (Bsg, Cst 3, Ctsb, Ctsd, Ctsl, Mmp 14, Mmp 19, Sparc. We carried out immunohistochemistry to confirm expression of proteins encoded by a number of these genes. Conclusions: Our results show that 1 B 4 + and IB 4 - neurons differ in the expression of several genes that are associated with responsiveness to the ECM prior to culturing (AdamTs 1, FN, Icam 1, Lamb 1, Plat, Plaur). The data suggest that the genes expressed at higher levels in the IB 4 - neurons could contribute to the initial growth response of these cells in a permissive environment and could also represent a common injury response that subsequently promotes axon regeneration. The differential expression of several extracellular matrix molecules (FN, Lamb 1, Icam) may suggest that the IB 4 - neurons are capable of maintaining /secreting their local extracellular environment which could aid in the regenerative process. Overall, these data provide new information on potential targets that could be manipulated to enhance axonal regeneration in the mature nervous system...|$|R
