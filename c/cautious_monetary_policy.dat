We employ a Bayesian structural vector autoregression model and impose sign restrictions to simultaneously and uniquely identify contractionary <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks and depreciation shocks in an integrated framework. This study covers Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea stock markets, over the period 1989 - 2008. Our main results acquired using sign restrictions show that <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks result in a strongly persistent effect on market index real stock prices whereas the impact of exchange rate shocks is short-lived over the short-run. The variance de-composition suggests that exchange rate is as important as <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> for explaining the dynamics of market and financial sector index real stock prices. More precisely, for all countries examined, real exchange rate developments have been more important in the short-run. Based purely on our findings, two conclusions are made. Firstly, because of the mistimed and/or persis-tent effect of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> on both real economy and financial markets, we argue that one needs to be <b>cautious</b> in using <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> to constrain asset price misalignment. Secondly, due to the evidence that exchange rates principally have a contemporaneous impact on equity prices, we suggest that, in the short-run, such incorrectly aligned asset price might be potentially corrected by focusing on exchange rate movements...|$|R

A longstanding macroeconomic issue is how <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> affects the real economy. Asset price channel is one of the most important channels of monetary transmission mechanism. In this study, we explored the asset price channel of monetary transmission mechanism in a developing countryâ€™s setup. We carried out our analysis in the framework of Vector Auto Regression while taking account of all the limitations of time series data. Our benchmark model accounts for simultaneity and interdependence among variables. We tested for both short and long term relationships. Our data set contains quarterly data for twenty years. We applied Johansen Co integration test, Vector Error Correction Model and Granger causality. We came across some puzzling and alarming results. Our analysis reveals that stock prices have a negative long run relationship with investment and output while it is generally expected that a tight <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is linked with decrease in prices. This kind of puzzling results should be taken into consideration by the central bank.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Argentinaâ€™s Second Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement and Requests for Modification and Waiver of Performance Criteria. The {{economy is}} recovering rapidly, while inflation remains subdued. Strengthening consumer and business confidence and <b>cautious</b> <b>monetary</b> and fiscal <b>policies</b> have facilitated further reductions in interest rates, a stable peso, and further reserve accumulation. Buoyant tax revenues resulted in larger-than-programmed fiscal savings in 2003. Although high commodity prices and strengthening partner country demand are pushing export receipts to record levels, imports {{also continue to}} surge, driven by buoyant economic activity.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a how-to guide to model-based forecasting and <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> analysis. It describes a simple structural model, {{along the lines}} of those in use in a number of central banks. This workhorse model consists of an aggregate demand (or IS) curve, a price-setting (or Phillips) curve, a version of the uncovered interest parity condition, and a <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> reaction function. The paper discusses how to parameterize the model and use it for forecasting and policy analysis, illustrating with an application to Canada. It also introduces a set of useful software tools for conducting a model-consistent forecast.

The test {{results show that the}} expansionary and tight <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks on the stock and bond markets have dual asymmetric effects; the expansionary and tight <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks have dual asymmetric effects during the rise and fall periods. Therefore, when laying down capital market regulation and control policies, government needs to consider the dual asymmetric effects of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shock, and adopts appropriate <b>monetary</b> <b>policies.</b> Key words: <b>Monetary</b> <b>policy</b> shocks; Dual asymmetric effects; Two-step OLS method; Empirical tes...|$|R
40|$|We explore <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> {{transmission}} by estimating VAR {{impulse response}} functions {{to illustrate the}} Belarusian economy''s response to unexpected changes in policy and exogenous variables. We find a significant exchange rate pass-through to prices, and interest rate policy following, rather than leading, financial market developments. Our estimated <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> reaction function shows the central bank striking a balance between real exchange rate stability and containing inflation. We discuss dollarization, administrative interventions, and other features complicating <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> transmission, review specific constraints and vulnerabilities, and conclude with observations on possible measures that could raise the effectiveness of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in Belarus.
