Ahead of the party, Freddie gives Reg {{the use of}} his car, to return unused decorating {{materials}} to Guildford and he takes his father, Reenie and her boyfriend Clayton Cooper (Roger Griffiths) with him. They run out of petrol on the way, leaving Freddie and Joan the only ones at the party. They dance, and Freddie admits {{that he wanted to be}} alone with Joan so they <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> art. They end the night by sleeping together.|$|E
5|$|The telethon's {{talent pool}} becomes {{so low that}} Leslie is forced to flip a coin {{in front of the}} camera and talk about her {{favorite}} episodes of Friends. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being awake for two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so they <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E

Also housemates <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> nominations to their partner. This rule was only in play for the first week.|$|E

25|$|Scipione {{followed}} his father shortly afterwards and the eldest sibling Marcantonio then took over power in Favale. Isabella {{grew up in}} a hostile family environment, with a helpless mother and brothers who were uncouth, unruly and brutish. She was deeply affected by the sudden departure of her father, which tormented her {{for the rest of her}} life. She was given a tutor who guided her in the study of Petrarch and Latin poets, and was probably the only person with whom she <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> literature.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E

500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would never accept anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream because you <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a decision and he would accept it and there it was, in his game." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Most movie {{executives}} and producers," [...] said Brooks, [...] "are usually boring and dull, and not well-read. They don't care about art or painting, they just care about profits. But Sidney {{was always an}} artist. You <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> anything with him - great literature, life and love." [...] The writer and critic Michael Coveney knew Glazier as demanding , irascible, impatient but full of charm", someone who [...] "epitomised 's spirit of tolerance, intellectual curiosity, fast living and taste for the high life".|$|E
2500|$|In his Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics, Dodd {{noted with}} humor how Long became irritated with McCrory, {{who had been}} invited on Long's intraparty ticket [...] "to harass and, we hoped, defeat Uncle Earl's old {{political}} enemy, Dave Pearce. All McCrory <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> was pesticides {{and how to get}} rid of different kinds of crop-killing bugs. His main topic and claim to fame, which dominated all of his speeches, whether he was in cotton country, forestry areas, or the city of New Orleans, was his eradicating the pink boll worms from Louisiana cotton fields. Uncle Earl almost went crazy when had to listen to ... McCrory kill enough pink boll worms to fill the Atlantic Ocean." ...|$|E

2500|$|The affair led to {{pop culture}} celebrity for Lewinsky, {{as she had}} {{become the focus of}} a {{political}} storm. Her immunity agreement restricted what she <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> publicly, but she was able to cooperate with Andrew Morton in his writing of Monica's Story, her biography which included her side of the Clinton affair. The book was published in March 1999; it was also excerpted as a cover story in TIME magazine. [...] On March 3, 1999, Barbara Walters interviewed Lewinsky on ABC's 20/20. The program was watched by 70 million Americans, which ABC said was a record for a news show. Lewinsky made about $500,000 from her participation in the book and another $1 million from international rights to the Walters interview, but was still beset by high legal bills and living costs.|$|E
2500|$|Stone was {{introduced}} to Gary Kellgren, a recording engineer working at several New York City recording studios on sessions for musicians such as Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix. Stone and Kellgren met because Kellgren's wife Marta was seven months pregnant and scared of the upcoming birth. Mutual friends thought that the two couples <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> being parents and ease Marta's worry. Though they were [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] in nature, with Stone all business and Kellgren very creative, the two quickly became friends. During his lunch hours, Stone visited Kellgren in the studio, and {{began to see that}} Kellgren was not making full use of his genius. Stone noticed that Kellgren was getting only 4 percent of the money that studios were charging, and he helped Kellgren raise that to 20 percent.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time during}} early to mid-1972 the Riglers overheard Genie saying, [...] "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." [...] to herself, demonstrating that she <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> her life {{before she had}} started to learn language. During {{the rest of her}} stay with the Riglers she would {{constantly}} repeat, [...] "Father hit" [...] to herself, and before the Riglers worked with Genie to understand the concept of death she often asked them where her father was, afraid that he would come to get her. Although she did not speak to others about her childhood often she gave researchers valuable new information when she did, and the scientists tried to get Genie to tell them as much as possible. As she learned more language, she gradually began to speak about her father and his treatment of her in greater detail.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tension between}} {{traditional}} models of masculinity and the experiences within the war runs throughout the novel. Critic Greg Harris identifies Regeneration, {{along with the}} other two novels in the trilogy, as profiling the non-fictional experience of Sassoon and other soldiers who must deal with ideas of masculnity. These characters feel conflicted by a model of masculinity common to Britain during this time: [...] honour, bravery, mental strength, and confidence were privileged [...] "manly" [...] characteristics. Yet they explore, internally and through conversation, what that model means for them and how the war changes how they should experience it. In an interview with Barker in Contemporary Literature, Rob Nixon distinguishes between these ideas of [...] "manliness" [...] and the concept of masculinity as providing a larger definition for identity. Barker agrees with his assessment, saying, [...] "and what's so nice about them is that they use it so unself-consciously: they must have been the last generation of men who <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> manliness without going [...] "ugh" [...] inside." ...|$|E

40|$|In 2009, Teresa Margolles {{represented}} Mexico at the Venice Biennial. Her exhibition, What Else <b>Could</b> We <b>Talk</b> <b>About?,</b> {{consisted of}} nine works {{that caused a}} controversy in Venice and the art world in general, as they incorporated contentious objects made with disturbing materials such as blood found in public sites in Mexico, where narco–murders occurred. This MRP seeks to understand the dynamics of this exhibition, especially its conceptual and visceral evocation of death and violence. By analyzing What Else <b>Could</b> We <b>Talk</b> <b>About?</b> through the frames of abjection, nationalism/globalism, and the critique of luxury, I seek to elucidate why the works were considered shocking, yet also fascinating, to viewers. I also aim to explore the relevance of Margolles’ cultural formation in Mexico in her choice of death and violence as principal themes, along with {{the implications of the}} exhibition as a commentary on contemporary Mexican politics and society...|$|R
