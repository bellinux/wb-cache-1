5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{proposes to}} Cooder, {{that if he}} <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> a hula hoop onto the chimney, they get their house back. If he misses, he will sign the deed over to Cooder. Cooder agrees and steps onto the lawn to watch Homer's attempt. Homer {{stretches}} and warms up, as if about to throw, but instead {{he and his family}} suddenly rush into the house, leaving Cooder and Spud dumbfounded.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of methods to {{approach}} missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped with a digital camera, which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies, animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player and enemies. Players can also hunt and skin animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> the tethered enemy.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the game}} is derived from the Hindi word pachis, meaning twenty-five, the largest score that <b>can</b> be <b>thrown</b> with the cowrie shells. Thus this game is also known by the name Twenty-Five. There are other {{versions}} of this game where the largest score that <b>can</b> be <b>thrown</b> is thirty.|$|R

5|$|In The Path of the Hobbits, Frodo, Sam and Gollum {{must first}} escape from Osgiliath, {{fighting}} past orcs {{to get to}} the sewers and ensuring that Frodo is not captured by the Nazgûl. However, upon escaping, Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself. He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam, but Sam follows them into Shelob's lair. In the lair, Gollum abandons Frodo, and Sam must fight past spiders and orcs, eventually facing Shelob herself, who has attacked Frodo. Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. About to go to Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive, and hears them say that Frodo is alive, but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting among themselves, and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo. Together, they head to Mount Doom. However, before Frodo <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> the Ring into the lava below, he is attacked by Gollum, who takes the Ring. In the final level, the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum {{on the edge of the}} precipice. Frodo successfully defeats Gollum, knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever.|$|E

25|$|The {{configuration}} of the baseball diamond effectively bars left-handers from the fielding positions that make throwing to first base a primary responsibility. Right-handers <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> to their left – i.e. toward first base – with much greater ease than can left-handers. So in practical terms, all second basemen, shortstops, and third basemen are right-handed. Left-handed catchers are also exceedingly rare; while the reasons appear to be primarily cultural, handling bunts up the third-base line and throws on plays at home pose particular obstacles to left-handed catchers.|$|E

5000|$|Nintendo {{created a}} {{widescreen}} Game & Watch called Popeye in 1981. The handheld game featured Popeye on a boat, and {{the aim was}} to catch bottles, pineapples, and spinach <b>cans</b> <b>thrown</b> by Olive Oyl while trying to avoid Bluto's boat. If Bluto hit Popeye on the head with his mallet or Popeye failed to catch an object three times, the game would end.|$|R
25|$|The game {{contains}} some time-bound social challenges {{that provide a}} reward if successful. Sims <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school. Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in University or dating in Nightlife. In Nightlife, each date {{is a challenge to}} keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, Plantsims, and Witches.|$|E
25|$|Like any cancer, metastasization affects {{many areas}} of the body, as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and organ to organ. For example, if it spreads to the bone marrow, it will prevent the body from {{producing}} enough red blood cells and affects the proper functioning of the white blood cells and the body's immune system; spreading to the circulatory system will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> the nervous system into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body.|$|E
25|$|The staff sling has {{a similar}} or {{superior}} range to the shepherd's sling, and can be as accurate in practiced hands. It is generally suited for heavier missiles and siege situations as staff slings can achieve very steep trajectories for slinging over obstacles such as castle walls. The staff itself can become a close combat weapon in a melee. The staff sling <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> heavy projectiles a much greater distance and at a higher arc than a hand sling. Staff slings were in use well into the age of gunpowder as grenade launchers, and were used in ship-to-ship combat to throw incendiaries.|$|E

25|$|Bilbo {{has three}} weapons {{available}} to him during combat. He begins the game with his walking stick, {{which can be used}} in melee combat, and stones, which he <b>can</b> <b>throw.</b> To use stones, he must switch to first-person view. Later in the game, he acquires a dagger, Sting. All three weapons can be powered up by finding magical scrolls scattered throughout the game. These scrolls grant such abilities as increased damage, jump attacks, double and treble combo attacks, and charged attacks. The game also features the use of the One Ring, which can temporarily turn Bilbo invisible, allowing him to avoid certain enemies.|$|E
25|$|It has {{gradually}} become {{clear to the}} reader that John Rokesmith is the missing heir, John Harmon. He had been robbed of his clothes and possessions by the man later found drowned and mis-identified as him. Rokesmith/Harmon has been maintaining his alias {{to find out more}} about Bella Wilfer before committing himself to marry her as required by the terms of his father's will. Now that she has married him, believing him to be poor, he <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> off his disguise. He does so and it is revealed that Mr Boffin's apparent miserliness and ill-treatment of his secretary was part of a scheme to test Bella's motives and affections.|$|E
25|$|Indirect free-kicks <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> a defence into {{confusion}} {{when taken}} quickly, or in unexpected directions. The third goal of Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method. Brazil's midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead ball {{in a high}} arc almost from the midfield line. It found Pele perfectly positioned near the Italian goal. The Brazilian headed down softly and accurately, straight {{into the path of}} the onrushing winger Jairzinho, who virtually walked the ball into the net. Italy's catenaccio defence was caught out of position here, not only failing to neutralise Pele, but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho. A rapid, daring set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences.|$|E

50|$|After five rounds apiece in {{the wall}} and city block, a bonus round is played. Here, the player has a limited supply of {{ammunition}} with which to shoot up to ten tin <b>cans</b> <b>thrown</b> {{from one side of}} the screen, trying to bounce them onto ledges at the opposite side for points. After this round, the player returns to the wall rounds and the game continues at an increased speed.|$|R
25|$|The planing {{hull form}} is {{configured}} to develop positive dynamic pressure {{so that its}} draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is {{to have at least}} one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.|$|E
25|$|Once transformed, Tuxedo Mask {{displays}} additional powers. In the anime shows {{these as}} mainly physical, while the manga depicts them as rare and magical. His iconic mainstay in the anime {{involves the use}} of roses, thrown like darts to injure or distract enemies. He can also twirl them or throw a wide array to block attacks, or <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> many at a time to pin an enemy down. He seems to have an unlimited supply of these roses, which are supernaturally strong and embed themselves in most any material, including concrete. In addition, when Mamoru takes on different forms or aspects, his roses change color accordingly. Tuxedo Mask's roses are red, the evil Prince Endymion's are black (and electrified), and the Moonlight Knight's are white.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} fired {{pitching coach}} Jeff Andrews and first-base coach Lou Frazier {{the day after}} the 2008 season concluded, but are expected to retain the rest of the staff through 2009. In October 2008, Joe Kerrigan—previously of the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies—was hired as the new pitching coach, while Perry Hill became the first base coach. On November 24, the Pirates signed Dinesh Patel and Rinku Singh of India. The pair participated in the Million Dollar Arm, a contest held in their home country to discover who out of the 30,000contestants had the strongest, most accurate arm. Having never heard of baseball prior to 2007, both Patel and Singh <b>can</b> <b>throw</b> over 90mph. The pair will participate at spring training. Management plans to keep closer observations of players' off-season workouts.|$|E
