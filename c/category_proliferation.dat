40|$|Despite {{advances}} {{in the management of}} osteosarcoma (OSA) and other solid tumors, the development of metastasis continues to be the most significant problem and cause of death for cancer patients. To define genetic determinants of pulmonary metastasis, we have applied cDNA microarrays to a recently described murine model of OSA that is char-acterized by orthotopic tumor growth, a period of minimal residual disease, spontaneous pulmonary metastasis, and cell line variants that differ in metastatic potential. Microarray analysis defined 53 genes (of 3166 unique cDNAs) that were differentially expressed between the pri-mary tumors of the more aggressive (K 7 M 2) and less aggressive (K 12) OSA models. By review of the literature, these differentially expressed genes were assigned to six nonmutually exclusive metastasis-associated <b>categories</b> (<b>proliferation</b> and apoptosis, motility and cytoskeleton, inva-sion, immune surveillance, adherence, and angiogenesis).

40|$|To {{correlate}} {{left ventricular}} function and histologic features {{in patients with}} dilated cardiomyopathy, precise indexes of hemodynamics and semiquantitative histologic data were combined for multivariate analysis. Right endomyocardial biopsy was performed {{at the time of}} cardiac catheterization. Five hemodynamic indexes were used for functional assessment: 1) ejection fraction, 2) ratio of end-systolic stress to volume index, 3) end-dia-stolic stress, 4) time constant (T) of left ventricular pressure fall, and 5) end-systolic stress. Six histologic findings (disarray of myofibers, hypertrophy of myofibers, scarcity of myofibrils, nuclear changes of myofibers, vacuolization of myofibers and proliferation of collagen fibers) were graded from (−) to (4 +). Each finding was assigned to category (−) or (+) according to the absence or presence of significant abnormality. Ordinary statistical analysis revealed that, although ejection fraction was lower in <b>category</b> (+) for <b>proliferation</b> of collagen fibers, ratio of end-systolic to volume index was reduced for category (+) of hypertrophy of myofibers.

With a family of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, we explore the dynamical impact of proliferation among HBV-infected hepatocytes. Here we show that proliferation of infected hepatocytes in this class of models generates a threshold that divides the dynamics into two <b>categories.</b> Sufficiently compromised <b>proliferation</b> of infected cells produces complex dynamics characterized by oscillating viral loads, whereas higher proliferation generates straightforward dynamics that always results in chronic infection, sometimes with liver failure.

40|$|Introduction: We {{performed}} a whole-transcriptome correlation analysis, {{followed by the}} pathway enrichment and testing of innate immune response pathway analyses to evaluate the hypothesis that transcriptional activity can predict cortical gray matter thickness (GMT) variability during normal cerebral aging. Methods: Transcriptome and GMT data were available for 379 individuals (age range = 28 – 85) community-dwelling members of large extended Mexican American families. Collection of transcriptome data preceded that of neuroimaging data by 17 years. Genome-wide gene transcriptome data consisted of 20, 413 heritable lymphocytes-based transcripts. GMT measurements were performed from high-resolution (isotropic 800 μm) T 1 -weighted MRI. Transcriptome-wide and pathway enrichment {{analysis was used to}} classify genes correlated with GMT. Transcripts for sixty genes from seven innate immune pathways were tested as specific predictors of GMT variability. Results: Transcripts for eight genes (IGFBP 3, LRRN 3, CRIP 2, SCD, IDS, TCF 4, GATA 3, and HN 1) passed the transcriptome-wide significance threshold. Four orthogonal factors extracted from this set predicted 31. 9 % of the variability in the whole-brain and between 23. 4 and 35 % of regional GMT measurements. Pathway enrichment analysis identified six functional <b>categories</b> including cellular <b>proliferation,</b> aggregation, differentiation, viral infection, and metabolism. The integrin signaling pathway was significantly (p − 6) enriched with GMT. Finally, three innate immune pathways (complement signaling, toll-receptors and scavenger and immunoglobulins) were significantly associated with GMT. Conclusion: Expression activity for the genes that regulate cellular proliferation, adhesion, differentiation and inflammation can explain a significant proportion of individual variability in cortical GMT. Our findings suggest that normal cerebral aging {{is the product of a}} progressive decline in regenerative capacity and increased neuroinflammation. </p...|$|R

To establish whether grading of melanocytic dysplasia has any biologic relevance, dermatopathologists {{must be able to}} consistently recognize two or more grades of atypia. We studied the concordance among five dermatopathologists for recognition and grading of 60 nevomelanocytic lesions. Ten cases from each of the following <b>categories</b> of melanocytic <b>proliferation</b> were retrieved from the Massachusetts General Hospital files: (1) common melanocytic nevi, (2) melanocytic nevi with features of dysplastic nevi, (3) dysplastic nevi with slight cytologic atypia, (4) dysplastic nevi with moderate cytologic atypia, (5) dysplastic nevi with severe cytologic atypia, and (6) primary malignant melanoma. The slides were reviewed independently; no discussion of diagnostic criteria preceded the review. Overall concordance for diagnosing dysplastic nevi was 77 %, with a kappa statistic of 0. 55 – 0. 84. Furthermore, in grading dysplastic nevi, experienced dermatopathologists had a concordance ranging from 35 to 58 % (kappa value 0. 38 – 0. 47). Those with less experience in grading dysplastic nevi had a concordance of 16 – 65 % (kappa value 0. 05 – 0. 24). The five observers in this study reliably distinguished dysplastic nevi from common acquired nevi and malignant melanoma. Further refinement of the criteria for grading of nevomelanocytic dysplasia and experience in grading are critical for accuracy in subcategorization of dysplastic nevi. Consistent, reproducible subcategorization or dysplastic nevi is a requisite before the issue of biologic or prognostic relevance of grading (dysplastic nevi) can be addressed. This study supports the validity of existing criteria for the diagnosis of dysplastic nevi because the problems in diagnosis were at the limits of the spectrum, namely, discrimination of slightly atypical dysplastic nevi from common nevi and severely atypical dysplastic nevi from radial growth phase melanoma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since its {{inception}} in 1992, the fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural network (NN) has attracted researchers ’ attention as a fast, accurate, off and online pattern classifier. Since then, many studies have explored different issues concerning FAM optimization, training and evaluation, e. g., model sensitivity to parameters, ordering strategy for {{the presentation of the}} training patterns, training method and method of predicting the classification accuracy. Other studies have suggested variants to FAM to improve its generalization capability or overcome the prime limitation of the model, which is <b>category</b> <b>proliferation</b> (i. e., model complexity that increases with data complexity). <b>Category</b> <b>proliferation</b> is pronounced in problems that are noisy or contain a large degree of class statistical overlapping. In many investigations, FAM was improved by incorporating elements of optimization theory, Bayes ’ decision theory, evolutionary learning, and cluster analysis. Due to its appealing characteristics, FAM and its variants have been applied extensively and successfully to real-world classification problems. Numerous applications were reported in, for example, the processing of signals from different sources, images, speech, and text; recognition of speakers, image objects, handwritten, and genetic abnormalities; and medical and fault diagnoses. When compared to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, FAM and its variants showed superior speed and ease of training, and in most cases they delivered comparable classification accuracy. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The thymus is {{an immune}} organ {{essential}} {{for life and}} {{plays a crucial role}} in the development of T cells. It undergoes a fetal to adult developmental maturation process occurring in mouse during the postnatal months. The molecular modifications underlying these ontogenic changes are essentially unknown. Here we used a differential proteomic-based technique (2 D-Difference Gel Electrophoresis) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to search for key proteins in the postnatal development of the thymus. Eight different BALB/c mice were used in the study: four mice aged of 1 day (neonatal) and four mice aged of 60 days (adult). Protein samples derived from thymus were labeled and run in 2 D-PAGE (Two-Dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis). One whole-thymus tissue from each mouse was run on gels and each gel containing a pooled sample of the eight mice was run in parallel. The pooled sample was set as the internal pool, containing equal amount of each protein extract used in the experiment. Gels were matched and compared with Difference In-gel Analysis software. Differential spots were picked, in-gel digested and peptide mass fingerprints were obtained. Results Among the differentially regulated proteins in neonatal thymus group, 111 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, of which 95 proteins were up-regulated and 16 proteins were down-regulated. The identified proteins belong to several functional <b>categories,</b> including cell <b>proliferation,</b> cycle and apoptosis, transcription regulation, signal transduction, nucleotide processing, proteolysis and translation, protein folding, metabolism, oxidoreduction, cytoskeleton, immune response, and embryonic development. The major interaction networks comprised of cellular function and maintenance, cellular assembly and organization, and metabolism were also identified by STRING analysis. Conclusions The demonstrated molecular changes are relevant for understanding thymus development as well as neonatal immune function, and they provide the diagnostic disease markers. Further studies will be required to describe in detail the role of the identified proteins in thymus maturation and in the specific functions of neonatal thymus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Realistically, no two nuclear proliferating or {{defensive}} entities {{are exactly}} identical; Agent Based Modeling (ABM) is a computational methodology addressing {{the uniqueness of}} those facilitating or preventing nuclear proliferation. The modular Bayesian ABM Nonproliferation Enterprise (BANE) tool has been developed at Texas A &M University for nuclear nonproliferation analysis. Entities engaged in nuclear proliferation cover a range of activities and fall within proliferating, defensive, and neutral agent classes. In BANE proliferating agents pursue nuclear weapons, {{or at least a}} latent nuclear weapons capability. Defensive nonproliferation agents seek to uncover, hinder, reverse, or dismantle any proliferation networks they discover. The vast majority of agents are neutral agents, of which only a small subset can significantly enable proliferation. BANE facilitates intelligent agent actions by employing entropy and mutual information for proliferation pathway determinations. Factors including technical success, resource expenditures, and detection probabilities are assessed by agents seeking optimal proliferation postures. Coupling ABM with Bayesian analysis is powerful from an omniscience limitation perspective. Bayesian analysis supports linking crucial knowledge and technology requirements into relationship networks for each <b>proliferation</b> <b>category.</b> With a Bayesian network, gaining information on proliferator actions in one category informs defensive agents where to expend limited counter-proliferation impeding capabilities. Correlating incomplete evidence for pattern recognition in BANE using Bayesian inference draws upon technical supply side proliferation linkages grounded in physics. Potential or current proliferator security, economic trajectory, or other factors modify demand drivers for undertaking proliferation. Using Bayesian inference the coupled demand and supply proliferation drivers are connected to create feedback interactions. Verification and some validation for BANE is performed using scenarios and historical case studies. Restrictive export controls, swings in global soft power affinity, and past proliferation program assessments for entities ranging from the Soviet Union to Iraq demonstrates BANE?s flexibility and applicability. As a newly developed tool, BANE has room for future contributions from computer science, engineering, and social scientists. Through BANE the framework exists for detailed nonproliferation expansion into broader weapons of mass effect analysis; since, nuclear proliferation is but one option for addressing international security concerns...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} unifying {{framework}} to integrate two of organizational sociology’s theory fragments on categorization: typecasting and form emergence. Typecasting is a producer-level theory that considers the consequences producers face for specializing versus spanning across category boundaries. Form emergence considers {{the evolution of}} categories and how the attributes of producers entering a category shapes its likelihood of gaining legitimacy among relevant audiences. Both theory fragments emerge from the processes audiences use to assign category memberships to producers. In this paper, we develop this common foundation and clearly outline the arguments that lead to central implications of each theory. We formalize these arguments using modal expressions to represent key categorization processes and the theory-building framework developed by Hannan, Polos, and Carroll (2007). Categorization in market contexts has attracted considerable interest in recent years, spurred {{in large part by}} Zuckerman’s (1999) seminal work in capital markets. Empirical work on this subject covers a range of topics, including <b>category</b> emergence, <b>proliferation,</b> and erosion (Carroll and Swaminathan 2000; Ruef 2000; Rao, Monin, and Durand 2005; Bogaert, Boone, and Carroll 2006; Pontikes 2008), the consequences of different categorical positions and category structures for individual producers (Zuckerman and Kim 2003; Hsu, 2006; Negro, Hannan, and Rao 2008; Hsu, Hannan, and Koçak 2008), and the role of audience members in structuring understanding of categories (Boone, Declerck, Rao, and Van Den Buys 2008; Koçak 2008; Koçak, Hannan, and Hsu 2008). This paper focuses on two theory fragments, typecasting and form emergence, which exemplify the different emphases in research approaches. Typecasting theory focuses on well-established categories and considers the implications for individual producers of specializing in versus generalizing across categorical boundaries (Zuckerman, Kim, Ukanwa, and von Rittman 2003). Research suggests that audiences have an easier time making sense of specialists but that a clear association with a single category restricts the range of future opportunities. Form-emergence theory considers how the attributes of producers associated with an emerging category shapes its likelihood of gaining legitimacy among relevant audiences (McKendrick and Carroll 2001; McKendrick, Jaffee, Carroll, and Khessina 2003). Work in this area finds that a category is more likely to become a well-established form when new entrants have focused identities (as in the case of de-novo entrants, the producers who begin as members of the category). These theory fragments have progressed largely independently of one another. This is not surprising given differences in levels of analysis and key outcomes. Yet, they are clearly conceptually connected. Both theory fragments address the positioning of producers in a space of categories and the effect of such positions on an audience’s understandings. In this paper, we flesh out these connections to clarify the processes that lie at heart of theories of ategorization. In particular, demonstrate that a common foundation, a theory of partiality in memberships, gives rise to predictions central to both of these fragments. We use the formal theory-building tools and framework developed by Hannan, Pólos, and Carroll (2007) and extended by Pólos, Hannan, and Hsu (2008). These accounts developed modal constructions that allow for subtle formalization of key sociological concepts such as legitimation, identity, and social form, which revolve around the beliefs held by relevant audiences. As we aim to illustrate, this approach to theory building has Series: DBS Working Papers in Economics We begin with a brief overview of key concepts from recent heoretical work by Hannan et al.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} {{of skin cancer}} in Australia has increased rapidly {{in the last few}} decades. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a major risk factor for skin carcinogenesis. UV, particularly the UVB spectrum, causes formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in cellular DNA. Persistent and incorrectly repaired CPDs lead to DNA mutations and consequently, formation of cutaneous lesions. Interestingly, recent epidemiological studies have shown a significant increase in skin cancer incidence in geographical locations with high environmental temperatures. Thus, heat stress may potentiate the effects of UV exposure and act as an additional risk factor for skin cancer. Previous studies in mice have shown that repeated and concurrent exposure to UVB and heat stress, increases the rate and {{incidence of}} cutaneous tumour formation relative to UVB alone. However, the effects of UVB plus heat on human epidermal cells have yet to be determined. Furthermore, the exact mechanisms responsible for the observed effects of heat stress need to be characterised in skin keratinocytes to increase knowledge of its risk in skin cancer. Heat stress induces upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), particularly HSP 72 and HSP 90 which are known to affect the activity of the p 53 protein. Furthermore, heat stress has been linked with increased Sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) protein activity. SIRT 1 is an important histone deacetylase that helps maintain chromosomal integrity but can also induce post-translational modifications of the p 53 protein. By mediating deacetylation of the p 53 protein, SIRT 1 can diminish the ability of p 53 to bind to its downstream gene targets. The p 53 protein is an integral mediator of the cellular stress response in skin cells, particularly keratinocytes. Thus, impairment of p 53 transcription factor functions could compromise the ability of epidermal cells to mount an appropriate response to DNA damage. Moreover, loss of p 53 function may induce survival of cells harbouring DNA lesions. We hypothesise, therefore, that exposure to UVB plus heat induces survival of DNA damaged keratinocytes and that these cells escape apoptosis surveillance as a result of heat-mediated alteration to the p 53 signalling pathway. Thus, exposure to heat stress could exacerbate the carcinogenic effects of UV and increase the risk of skin tumour formation in humans AIMS: In this study, we aimed to determine whether repeated exposure to UVB followed immediately by heat stress (39 °C) has a more damaging effect on human keratinocytes than UVB alone. In particular, we assessed the effects on DNA damage, apoptosis, cell cycle and DNA repair. Furthermore, we aimed to unravel the mechanism through which heat mediates the survival of UVB DNA-damaged keratinocytes, focusing on the effects on the p 53 signalling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: Primary adult human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and ex vivo punch biopsies of normal human skin called NativeSkin® (Genoskin, France), were used as experimental models for this study. A UV cabinet fitted with a TLUVB Narrowband lamp (Philips, GERMANY), with a spectral output of 290 - 315 nm, was used to administer UVB irradiation at a dose of 1 KJ/m². Heat stress involved culture in a normal CO 2 incubator, with temperature maintained at 39 °C for three hours. The temperature used in the experiments was based on previous measurements of skin surface temperature of open cut miners, who are prone to intense heat stress, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. For UVB plus heat exposures, cells and skin models were sequentially exposed to 1 KJ/m 2 of UVB, (at room temperature), followed immediately by 3 hours incubation at 39 °C once per day, for four consecutive days. Unexposed skin models and NHEK, maintained at 37 ºC, were used as experimental controls. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and whole genome expression profiles were analysed at four hours post day 4 exposure, to understand earlier events, and at 2 days post-exposure, to assess persistent outcomes of these exposures. Treated primary NHEK cells were counted in a Vi-CellTM Viability Analyser and the level of apoptosis for exposed primary cells was determined using Annexin V/Propidium Iodide apoptosis assay at 4 hours and 2 days post exposure. To determine the presence of DNA damage, total and active p 53 protein, as well as total and active SIRT protein, in the skin models and primary NHEKs, immunohistochemistry and/or immunocytochemistry was performed. Skin FFPE and primary NHEKs were incubated with antibodies to thymine dimers (CPD, DNA damage) and p 53 (total), acetylated p 53 - 382 (active), SIRT 1 (total) or SIRT 1 -p (active) antibodies. To measure apoptosis in skin, an anti-pan-cytokeratin marker was used to label keratinocytes and active-caspase- 3 antibodies were used to identify apoptotic cells. To determine the expression of p 53 -downstream target genes at 4 hours, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan probes for BAX, Survivin (BIRC 5), ERCC 1 and XPC genes, with Human 18 S gene as the endogenous reference gene. Relative quantification of the expression levels of each transcript in each sample were calculated using the Delta-Delta CT method relative to untreated controls. A whole genome expression analysis was performed at 2 days postexposure using the Human HT- 12 Expression v 4 BeadChip (Illumina, USA). The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen, USA) software was used to annotate the effects of altered gene expression on cell function and upstream signalling pathways. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyse differences across treatment groups, while parametric unpaired t-tests were used to detect differences between specific treatment groups in all experimental <b>categories,</b> i. e. <b>proliferation,</b> apoptosis and gene expression, with p-values RESULTS: Outcome 1 –Using ex vivo skin models and NHEKs, we show {{for the first time that}} UVB plus heat treated keratinocytes exhibit DNA damage, as observed after UVB treatment alone. However, apoptosis was significantly reduced, possibly as a result of inactivation of the p 53 -mediated stress response, in DNA damaged cells of UVB plus heat treated samples. Furthermore, whole genome expression and IPA upstream analysis showed that heat induces SIRT 1 activation, which was confirmed via immunohistochemistry assays. Heat-induced SIRT 1 expression was linked to a decrease in acetylated p 53 and consequently, downregulation of p 53 -regulated pro-apoptotic and DNA damage repair genes. These results suggest that p 53 -mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, known to be induced by UVB, are ablated with the addition of heat, leading to survival of DNA damaged cells after UVB plus heat treatment. Outcome 2 – We further confirmed that SIRT 1 activation did not inhibit the transcription of the p 53 protein but mediated deacetylation of p 53, resulting in significant deregulation of expression of p 53 downstream gene targets and decreased keratinocyte apoptosis in UVB plus heat treated samples. Importantly, chemical inhibition of SIRT 1 by Ex- 527, a known chemical inhibitor of SIRT 1, in UVB plus heat exposed keratinocytes, resulted in reactivation of the p 53 signalling pathway and increased apoptosis of DNA damaged keratinocytes. This clearly demonstrated the role of heat-mediated SIRT 1 activation in the survival of DNA damaged keratinocytes after exposure to UVB plus heat. CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that the efficiency of cellular stress response to UVB-induced DNA damage is diminished in the presence of heat and, for the first time, provide a molecular mechanism that explains these effects. With the novel use of an ex vivo human skin model, this study showed that heat stress prevents human keratinocytes, damaged by UV irradiation, from undergoing apoptosis and/or necrosis. We found UV plus heat exposure mediates SIRT 1 activation which has been found to induce deacetylation of p 53 and, consequently, the inactivation of the p 53 signalling pathway. SIRT 1 inhibition precluded the downregulation of p 53 signalling by UV plus heat exposure, restoring apoptosis levels to those observed in UVB-only exposures. Thus, we demonstrated that SIRT 1 activation is the main molecular mechanism driving UVB plus heat-induced survival of DNA damaged keratinocytes. Overall, the results of this study suggest that by allowing the survival of DNA damaged keratinocytes, via induction of SIRT 1 activation, heat stress can exacerbate the carcinogenic effects of UVB radiation. Exposure to heat stress, in addition to UV, could therefore increase the accumulation of mutations in keratinocytes, possibly leading to the transformation of normal cells into pre-cancerous cells. Further research is warranted to determine the role of UVB plus heat in skin cancer pathogenesis. Such knowledge could be utilised in public health campaigns to decrease risk, particularly for people exposed to combinations of these environmental hazards in workplaces such as in the mining, construction and petroleum industries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is an unsu-pervised neural network. Fuzzy ART is a {{variation}} of ART, allows both binary and continuous input patterns. However, Fuzzy ART has the <b>category</b> <b>proliferation</b> problem. To solve this problem, we have proposed Fuzzy ART Combining Overlapped Category in consideration of connections (C-FART) in previous study. In this study, we propose a improved C-FART. The important features of the improved C-FART are that the vigilance parameters are arranged for every category and they are varied according {{to the size of}} respective categories with learning. We investigate the behavior of the improved C-FART, and compare the improved C-FART with the simple Fuzzy ART and the conventional C-FART. I...|$|E

However, a number of papers have indicated that there are important weaknesses to the Fuzzy ARTMAP approach, such as sensitivity to noisy data and <b>category</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Gaussian ARTMAP was developed to help overcome these weaknesses, raising the question of whether Gaussian ARTMAP could be a more effective approach for building energy management systems? This paper aims to answer this question. In particular, our results show that Gaussian ARTMAP not only has the capability to address the weaknesses of Fuzzy ARTMAP but, by doing this, provides better and more efficient EMS controls with online learning capabilities...|$|E

Subpixel-level mapping is essential for the successful description of many land cover patterns with spatial resolution of less than 1 km and also useful for finer resolution data. This paper presents a novel adaptive resonance theory MAP (ARTMAP) neural network–based mixture analysis model—ART mixture MAP (ART-MMAP). Compared to the ARTMAP model, ART-MMAP has an enhanced interpolation function that decreases the effect of <b>category</b> <b>proliferation</b> in ARTa and overcomes the limitation of class category in ARTb. Results from experiments demonstrate the superiority of ART-MMAP in terms of estimating the fraction of land cover within a single pixel.

In addition, the BA estimates the class posterior probability and thereby enables the introduction of loss and classification according to the minimum expected loss. Based on these characteristics and using synthetic and 20 real-world databases, we show that the BA outperformes the FA, either trained for one epoch or until completion, with respect to classification accuracy, sensitivity to statistical overlapping...|$|E
40|$|ART and ARTMAP neural {{networks}} for adaptive recognition and prediction {{have been applied}} {{to a variety of}} problems, including automatic mapping from remote sensing satellite measurements, parts design retrieval at the Boeing Company, medical database prediction, and robot vision. This paper features a self-contained introduction to ART and ARTMAP dynamics. An application of these networks to image processing is illustrated by means of a remote sensing example. The basic ART and ARTMAP networks feature winner-take-all (WTA) competitive coding, which groups inputs into discrete recognition categories. WTA coding in these networks enables fast learning, which allows the network to encode important rare cases but which may lead to inefficient <b>category</b> <b>proliferation</b> with noisy training inputs. This problem is partially solved by ART-EMAP, which use WTA coding for learning but distributed category representations for test-set prediction. Recently developed ART models (dART and dARTMAP) retain stable coding, recognition, and prediction, but allow arbitrarily distributed category representation during learning as well as performance...|$|E
40|$|ARTMAP based {{architectures}} {{have several}} desirable properties {{that make them}} very suitable for pattern classification problems. However, they suffer from <b>category</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Distributed coding has been proposed as a solution for memory compression. dARTMAP neural network has been introduced as a modification of Fuzzy ARTMAP that, due to distributed learning, achieves code compression while fast stable learning is retained. A critical analysis of dARTMAP architecture and performance in pattern recognition problems is presented here, concluding that distributed learning excels the original Fuzzy ARTMAP only under certain geometrical configurations of the output classes, or {{in the presence of}} noise in the training set. A new architecture called dFasArt is presented here, introducing distributed learning into FasArt neuro~fuzzy system, which is more suitable for identification tasks, showing that the advantages of distributed code can be extended to other neural architectures. Experimental results show dFasArt performs similarly to dARTMAP in classification tasks, while being less sensitive to pattern presentation order...|$|E
40|$|The main {{concept of}} the {{presented}} research is an autonomous robot learning model for which a novel ARTgrid neural network architecture for the classification of spatial structures is used. The motivation scenario includes incremental unsupervised learning which is mainly based on discrete spatial structure changes recognized by the robot vision system. The learning policy problem {{is presented as a}} classification problem for which the adaptive resonance theory (ART) concept is implemented. The methodology and architecture of the autonomous robot learning model with preliminary results are presented. A computer simulation was performed with four input sets containing 22, 45, 73, and 111 random spatial structures. The ARTgrid shows a fairly high (> 85 %) match score when applied with already learned patterns after the first learning cycle, and a score of > 95 % after the second cycle.

40|$|The Fuzzy ART system {{introduced}} herein incorporates computations from {{fuzzy set}} theory into ART 1. For example, the intersection (n) operator used in ART 1 learning {{is replaced by}} the MIN operator (A) of fuzzy set theory. Fuzzy ART reduces to ART 1 in response to binary input vectors, but can also learn stable categories in response to analog input vectors. In particular, the MIN operator reduces to the intersection operator in the binary case. Learning is stable because all adaptive weights can only decrease in time. A preprocessing step, called complement coding, uses on-cell and off-cell responses to prevent <b>category</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Complement coding normalizes input vectors while preserving the amplitudes of individual feature activations.
