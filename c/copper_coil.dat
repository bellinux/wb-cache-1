25|$|The {{discovery}} of hydrogen isotopes also impacted {{the field of}} physics in the 1940s, as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was first invented. Today, organic chemists utilize NMR for mapping protein interactions or identifying small compounds, but NMR was first a passion project of physicists. All three isotopes of hydrogen {{were found to have}} magnetic properties suitable for NMR spectroscopy. The first chemist to fully express an application of NMR was George Pake, who measured gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) as a crystal and powder. The signal observed, called the Pake doublet, was from the magnetically active hydrogens in water. Pake then calculated the proton-proton bond distance. NMR measurements were further revolutionized when commercial machines became available in the 1960s. Before this, NMR experiments involved constructing massive projects, locating large magnets, and hand wiring miles of <b>copper</b> <b>coil.</b> Proton NMR remained the most popular technique throughout advancements in following decades, but deuterium and tritium were used in other flavors of NMR spectroscopy. Deuterium has a different magnetic moment and spin than protium, but generally a much smaller signal. Historically, deuterium NMR is a poor alternative to proton NMR, but has been used to study the behavior of lipids on membranes. Recently, a variation of deuterium NMR called 2H-SNIF has shown potential for understating position specific isotope compositions and comprehending biosynthetic pathways. Tritium is also used in NMR, as it is the only nucleus more sensitive than protium, generating very large signals. However, tritium's radioactivity discouraged many studies of T-NMR.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{high-temperature}} superconducting (HTS) coil as the transmitting coil is {{an optional}} {{way to increase}} the efficiency and the distance of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. In practical cases, receiving coils might be not only one, or not convenient to get a low-temperature environment, or not in the same sizes with the transmitting coil. Thus, we constructed a WPT system from one HTS <b>coil</b> to two <b>copper</b> <b>coils,</b> and one of the <b>copper</b> receiving <b>coils</b> had a different size from the HTS transmitting coil. In addition, we placed one HTS relaying coil between the transmitting coil and the receiving coils {{to increase the efficiency}} and the distance.

50|$|PM {{machines}} have {{permanent magnets}} in the rotor which {{set up a}} magnetic field. The magnetomotive force in a PM (caused by orbiting electrons with aligned spin) is generally much higher than what is possible in a <b>copper</b> <b>coil.</b> The <b>copper</b> <b>coil</b> can, however, be filled with a ferromagnetic material, which gives the coil much lower magnetic reluctance. Still the magnetic field created by modern PMs (Neodymium magnets) is stronger, which means that PM machines have a better torque/volume and torque/weight ratio than machines with rotor coils under continuous operation. This may change with introduction of superconductors in rotor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{magnetization}} of superconducting pellets is a worth {{point in}} the development of trapped flux superconducting motors. Experimental and simulated data have been reported extensively according to the framework of one or several pulses of a homogeneous magnetizing field applied to a pellet or a set of pellets. In case of cylindrical rotors of low power motors with radial excitation, however, the use of the <b>copper</b> <b>coils</b> to produce the starting magnetization of the pellets produces a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field which cannot be reduced to a 2 D standard model. In this work we present an analysis of the magnetization of the superconducting cylindrical rotor of a small motor by using a commercial FEM program, being the rotor magnetized by the working <b>copper</b> <b>coils</b> of the motor.

50|$|Between each <b>copper</b> <b>coil</b> leg {{are placed}} {{the pieces of}} the sub-divided and {{insulated}} iron ferrite cores making up the ferrite ring. The ferrite ring carries the magnetic flux between the fixed permanent magnets, without needing to use the copper strips (which carry electric current). As the armature spins, current flows from the one brush, into the commutator, outwards along one <b>copper</b> <b>coil</b> leg, which is sandwiched between the iron ferrite core pieces. When the current reaches the connecting crimp positioned on the outer edge, it transfers to a new leg on rear side of the armature and runs back to the centre, again sandwiched between ferrites 45-degrees out of phase from the previous ferrites. The electric current then arrives back at the centre, 90-degrees later and swaps sides back to the front face before reaching the corresponding brush (of the opposite electrical polarity) 135-degrees from the initial brush.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Design, {{fabrication}} and {{preliminary testing}} {{of a flat}} pump with millimetre thickness are described in this paper. The pump is entirely made of polymer materials barring the magnet and <b>copper</b> <b>coils</b> used for electromagnetic actuation. The fabrication is carried out using widely available microelectronic packaging machinery and techniques. Therefore, the fabrication of the pump is straightforward and inexpensive. Two types of prototypes are designed and built. One consists of <b>copper</b> <b>coils</b> that are etched on an epoxy plate and the other has wound insulated wire of 90 µm diameter {{to serve as a}} coil. The overall size of the first pump is 25 mm × 25 mm × 3. 6 mm including the 3. 1 mm-thick NdFeB magnet of diameter 12 mm. It consists of a pump chamber of 20 mm × 20 mm × 0. 8 mm with <b>copper</b> <b>coils</b> etched from a copper-clad epoxy plate using dry-film lithography and milled using a CNC milling machine, two passive valves and the pump-diaphragm made of Kapton film of 0. 089 mm thickness.

A breadboard circuit and DC power supply are used to test the pump by applying an alternating square-wave voltage pulse. A water slug in a tube attached to the inlet is used to observe and measure the air-flow induced by the pump against atmospheric pressure. The maximum flow rate was found to be 15 ml/min for a voltage of 2. 5 V and a current of 19 mA at 68 Hz. 1...|$|R
