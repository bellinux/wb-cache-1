5000|$|The {{accident}} {{flight was}} the first flight after maintenance personnel replaced the forward elevator trim cable. When the flightcrew received the airplane, the captain {{did not address the}} recent <b>cable</b> <b>change</b> noted on his maintenance release. The captain also did not perform a first flight of the day checklist, which included an elevator trim check. Shortly after takeoff, the flightcrew reported a runway (sic) trim, and manually selected nose-up trim. However, the elevator trim then traveled to the full nose-down position. The control column forces subsequently increased to 250 pounds, and the flightcrew was unable to maintain control of the airplane. During the replacement of the cable, the maintenance personnel skipped a step in the manufacturer's airliner maintenance manual (AMM). They did not use a lead wire to assist with cable orientation. In addition, the AMM incorrectly depicted the elevator trim drum, and the depiction of the orientation of the cable around the drum was ambiguous. The maintenance personnel stated that they had completed an operational check of the airplane after maintenance. The Safety Board performed a mis-rigging demonstration on an exemplar airplane, which reversed the elevator trim system. An operational check on that airplane revealed that when the electric trim motor was activated in one direction, the elevator trim tabs moved in the correct direction, but the trim wheel moved opposite of the corresponding correct direction. When the manual trim wheel was moved in one direction, the elevator trim tabs moved opposite of the corresponding correct direction. NTSB ...|$|E
40|$|In most {{practical}} applications for cable-driven parallel robots, cable lifetime {{is an important}} issue. While there is extensive knowledge of steel cables in traditional applications such as elevators or cranes, it cannot be easily applied to cable robots. Especially new polymer based materials behave substantially different, but also the conditions for the <b>cable</b> <b>change</b> dramatically. Cable robots have more bending points and a higher variability in cable force and speed than traditional applications. This paper presents a form of bending cycle analysis which {{can be applied to}} assess cable wear. This algorithm counts the number of bends per trajectory in each cable segment. The sum gives an indication how much wear a cable receives. Experiments are conducted on a cable robot using different kinds of polymer fibers. The results show that this method is successful in predicting the point at which a cable finally breaks...|$|E

40|$|Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) {{was originally}} developed to find breaks {{in power and}} communication cables. When a coaxial cable is deformed, the impedance characteristics of the <b>cable</b> <b>change.</b> Changes in impedance are noted as changes in the characteristic TDR signature of the cable. This technology has been adapted to monitor slope and embankment movements. Coaxial cables were placed in boreholes and slope movements monitored remotely by a cable tester and computer at the site, or by using a data logger and cellular phone. Four sites in California were monitored using TDR and the data compared with conventional inclinometer monitoring. Results showed that TDR can reliably determine the depth and location of shear planes. The advantages of TDR are that: 1. cumbersome equipment need not be brought to, or maintained at, the site to monitor movement; 2. slope monitoring can be done from any location with a modem and computer, and 3. installation and monitoring can be economically accomplished. The result is increased safety, and a considerable cost savings...|$|E

Since damage in a <b>cable</b> <b>changes</b> its natural vibration frequency, {{it can be}} assessed with a vibration-based finite element updating procedure.

40|$|Cable life depends {{mainly on}} the thermal stress, which relates to the current applied on the <b>cable.</b> Voltage <b>changes</b> in medium voltage (MV) cables due to {{transformer}} tap changes will also change the current flowing through the <b>cable,</b> which will <b>change</b> the <b>cable</b> temperature. In order to extend the cable life, this paper aims to simulate and analyse the potential thermal lifetime improvement of cables through long-term tap changes within the statutory levels. Firstly, the IEC standard (60287) method for rating and modelling cables is applied to evaluate the cable temperature under different voltages and relative currents. Different cable configurations will also be considered in simulations as temperature {{is dependent on the}} cable dimensions. Then, typical thermal lifetime analytical expressions will be used to evaluate the long-term influence of voltage changes. Lastly, the obtained thermal lifetime assessments under different transformer tap <b>changes</b> and different <b>cable</b> configurations will provide a potential understanding of <b>cable</b> lifetime <b>changes</b> through implementation of permitted regulatory voltage changes...|$|R

The transmission lines are modeled by cable element {{which accounts for}} the nonlinearity of the cable based on a real project. Nonuniform ground motions are generated using a stochastic approach based on random vibration analysis. The effects of multicomponent ground motions, correlations among multicomponent ground motions, wave travel, coherency loss, and local site on {{the responses of the}} cables are investigated using nonlinear time history analysis method, respectively. The results show the multicomponent seismic excitations should be considered, but the correlations among multicomponent ground motions could be neglected. The wave passage effect has a significant influence on the responses of the <b>cables.</b> The <b>change</b> of the degree of coherency loss has little influence on the response of the cables, but the responses of the cables are affected significantly by the effect of coherency loss. The responses of the <b>cables</b> <b>change</b> little with the degree of the difference of site condition changing.

In stability monitoring applications using TDR, a coaxial cable is installed in a vertical borehole passing through the region of concern. The electrical impedance at any point along a coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>changes</b> with deformation of the insulator between the conductors. A brittle grout surrounds the cable to translate earth movement into an abrupt cable deformation that shows up as a detectable peak in the reflectance trace. Until recently, the technique was relatively insensitive to small slope movements and could not be automated because it relied on human detection of changes in the reflectance trace over time. Farrington and Sargand (2004) developed a simple signal processing technique using numerical derivatives to extract reliable indications of slope movement from the TDR data much earlier than by conventional interpretation.|$|R

The depth, pitch and roll of FLYING FISH are controlled by a main wing and horizontal tail wings. The roll control {{is based on the}} PID control method and the depth and pitch control are based on the LQI (linear quadratic with integral) control method. The LQI controller was designed in consideration of the mathematical model of the towing cable. The experimental results controlled by the LQI controller were successful around the near equilibrium point but it seems that the performance is reduced at far field. The reason is that towing tension is drastically changing with the submerged depth of the vehicle and the linear mathematical model of the towing <b>cable</b> <b>changes</b> from that of equilibrium point. In this paper, the H_infty controller is designed in consideration of the change of the towing tension at the towing point versus submerged depth in order to improve the performance of the depth and pitch control.

40|$|The contact {{mechanical}} characteristics {{in the cross}} section of the Nb 3 Sn cable are sensitive to the cryogenic cooling and cyclic transverse electromagnetic loads, which may affect the cable’s performance. In this paper, based on a proposed discrete dynamic model (DEM), where the contact heat transfer among strands and the convective heat transfer in liquid helium are taken into account, the cooling process under two heat transfer mechanisms is performed. Simulation results show that the temperature variation of Poloidal Field Insert Sample (PFIS) cable with time agrees well with the existing experimental results, and the role of contact heat transfer cannot be neglected during cryogenic cooling. It is obtained from the further analysis that the effect of contact heat transfer becomes more prominent with the decrease of mass flow rate of liquid helium, which leads to the stress status within <b>cable</b> <b>changed</b> significantly. With the temperature boundary condition imposed on the cable radial direction, the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of cable can be obtained.

These results may provide the guide for the design and application of the future CICC conductors...|$|R
40|$|The cable {{equation}} {{describes the}} voltage {{in a straight}} cylindrical cable, this model has been employed to model electrical potential in dendrites and axons. However, sometimes this equation might give incorrect predictions for some realistic geometries, in particular when the radius of the <b>cable</b> <b>changes</b> significantly. <b>Cables</b> with a non constant radius are important for some phenomena, for example discrete swellings along the axons appear in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, HIV-associated dementia and Multiple Sclerosis. In this paper, using the Frenet-Serret frame, we propose a generalized cable equation for a general cable geometry. This generalized equation depends on geometric quantities such as the curvature and torsion of the cable. We show that when the cable has a constant circular cross-section, the first fundamental form of the cable can be simplified and the generalized cable equation depends on neither the curvature nor the torsion of the cable. Additionally, we find an exact solution for an ideal cable which has a particular variable circular cross-section and zero curvature. For this case we show that when the cross-section of the cable increases the voltage decreases. Inspired in this ideal case, we rewrite the generalized cable equation as a diffusion equation with a source term generated by the cable geometry. This source term depends on the cable cross-section area and its derivates. In addition, we study different cables with swelling and provide their numerical solutions. The numerical solutions show that when the cross-section of the <b>cable</b> has abrupt <b>changes,</b> its voltage is smaller than the voltage in the cylindrical cable. Furthermore, these numerical solutions show that the voltage can be affected by geometrical inhomogeneities on the cable. Comment: 13 page, 7 figure...|$|R
