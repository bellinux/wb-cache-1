40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine {{the ways in which}} the idea of the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> high {{vulnerable}} to risk is constituting new pedagogical subjects, ie, the teacher/caregiver as a professional risk-manager, and the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> a risk-management ‘case’. It does so by indicating how an expanded notion of the duty of care has reconstituted the <b>child</b> <b>as</b> a work-in-progress case rather than 'the concrete subject of [educational] intervention' (Castel, 1991 : 288). It examines how the new teacher as a risk-conscious professional caregiver both needs and comes to acquire a new intimacy with the <b>child</b> not <b>as</b> a fleshly body but as a case of risk minimisation...|$|R

5|$|Sociologist Joel Best {{wrote in}} 1993 {{that during the}} late 19th century, adults {{developed}} an increased concern {{for the welfare of}} children.

According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and <b>children</b> <b>as</b> invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults, saw <b>children</b> <b>as</b> potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.|$|E
