5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked <b>chests</b> (white <b>chests</b> in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other <b>chests</b> contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. <b>Chests</b> with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the game}} world, the player finds <b>chests</b> colored green, blue, or red, and each chest {{contains}} orbs of the corresponding color.

40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the utility of <b>chest</b> sonography in common paediatric diseases and to present <b>chest</b> sonography images with possible explanation for the same. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted in Department of Paediatric Medicine, Bharati Medical College, Sangli. The patients admitted in paediatric ward, NICU, PICU with respiratory complaints and findings were subjected to <b>chest</b> sonography after <b>chest</b> x-ray. The <b>chest</b> sonography images were interpreted and an attempt was made to correlate with findings of <b>chest</b> xray. The information given by <b>chest</b> sonography was analysed and possible cause of image was evaluated. RESULTS The <b>chest</b> sonography appearances were found to be specific and in certain instances more informative than <b>chest</b> x-ray. It can differentiate between collapse and consolidation easily. The limitation of <b>chest</b> sonography was- it can assess only peripheral lung regions with inability to assess deeper lesions, especially with aerated peripheral lung. CONCLUSION The <b>chest</b> sonography is superior to <b>chest</b> x-ray in diagnosing minimal effusion and minimal pneumothorax. Also, when there is difficulty in differentiating pulmonary from pleural pathology. Though, <b>chest</b> sonography cannot replace <b>chest</b> x-ray, it is very useful additional investigation and often times very helpful with additional diagnostic information...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{computed}} tomography and <b>chest</b> X-ray in the diagnosis of rib fractures in patients with blunt <b>chest</b> trauma. Materials and Methods: A total of 83 patients with blunt <b>chest</b> trauma who were treated in three hospitals between May 2010 and June 2011 and who had received both <b>chest</b> computed tomography scan and <b>chest</b> X-ray as part of their initial assessment were included in the study. Results: The number of rib fractures was 2. 15 ± 2. 12 on <b>chest</b> X-ray, however, on <b>chest</b> computed tomography the number was 3. 75 ± 2. 35. There was a significant difference between the <b>chest</b> X-ray and the computed tomography (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Chest computed tomography is the best and a significantly more sensitive radiological method than <b>chest</b> X-ray in the detection of rib fracture, and it should be routinely used in the initial assessment of <b>chest</b> trauma. However, <b>chest</b> X-ray can be a suitable method in follow-up period...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although many {{patients}} who experience <b>chest</b> pain or pressure consult their physicians, unfortunately {{a large number}} of them do not, and consequently they remain undiagnosed and untreated. Chest pain, in a subset of these patients, may be relieved with a bronchodilator or other asthma drugs. Methods: This retrospective study included twenty cases of <b>chest</b> pain that were relieved with asthma drugs. Chest pain was categorized into three types: <b>chest</b> pain variant asthma, bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> pain, and non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> pain. Chest pain variant asthma was defined as <b>chest</b> pressure that improved in response to a bronchodilator, without the characteristic attacks of bronchial asthma. Bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> pain was defined as <b>chest</b> pressure, with the characteristic attacks of bronchial asthma that improved following the administration of a leukotriene receptor antagonist, systemic corticosteroid, or bronchodilator. Non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> pain was defined as <b>chest</b> pressure without the typical asthma attack, but with <b>chest</b> pressure that improved in response to a leukotriene receptor antagonist or systemic corticosteroid, but not a bronchodilator. Results: Fourteen cases of <b>chest</b> pain were diagnosed as variant asthma, three cases were diagnosed as bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> pain, and three cases were diagnosed as non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> pain. Conclusions: The results suggest that the mechanism underlying <b>chest</b> pain that is relieved with asthma drugs can involve either an airway constriction pathway or a non-constrictive pathway presumably airway inflammation. Analysis of the patient's response to treatment with asthma medication is useful for the correct diagnosis of the source of <b>chest</b> pain...|$|R
