Solvent sublation is one among the several adsorptive bubble separation techniques wherein a hydrophobic compound is levitated on a bubble surface {{to the top of}} an aqueous column where they encounter a solvent layer to which the material is transferred as the bubbles move through the solvent layer. A model for the removal mechanism of the chlorinated compounds from {{aqueous solution}} was constructed. Removal rate constants for air stripping and for solvent sublation respectively are possible to calculate from the model's equations. The experiments were conducted on a laboratory batch scale using the 0. 1 m inner diameter bubble column. Bubbles were generated from the perforated plate. The <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compound</b> is dichrolomethane. The solvent layer is kerosine. Dichrolometane was removed at high efficiency by solvent sublation as compared with conventional air stripping, The removal rate constant from the model was compared with experimental result. The mass adsorbed on the bubble surface of 8 types of chlorinated compounds were assumed by the measurements of surface tension. The removal rate constants of these chlorinated compounds, for solvent sublation or for air stripping, are calculated from model equations using the linear adsorption constant...|$|E

40|$|Summary. One of {{the major}} causes of decline {{in the quality of}} {{granulated}} sugar is bacterial contamination of sugar beet. This {{is due to the fact}} that the beet-sugar industry is a good object for the development of different groups of microorganisms. The main sources of infection of products of sugar manufacture can be soil, water, air, packaging, packaging materials, vehicles, clothing, equipment. The higher the beet contamination with the microorganisms, the more they decompose sucrose and secrete metabolic byproducts. In this regard, there is a need to reduce the negative impact of various groups of microorganisms and to minimize the loss of sucrose from decomposition. In accordance with the problem given the studies to determine the bacteriostatic properties of chlorinated compounds for sugar production were carried out. We used the cultivated fluid colonized with a pure culture of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and reagent treated as an object of study. In the experiments, we determined the accumulation of biomass of L. mesenteroides with nephelometric method by measuring the optical density of bacterial suspension. It was found out that after 24 hours of bacterial culturing the level of optical density in the control and active acidity were considerably higher compared with the sample treated with germicide. The number of microorganisms in the nutrient medium was determined by Vinogradsky-Shulgina-Brid’s. According to the study in the control is 1, 7 * 10 ^ 16, in experiment with the introduction of the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compound</b> it is 5, 8 * 10 ^ 14.

40|$|Organochlorine compounds, such as {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs), {{pentachlorophenol}} (PCP), p,p'-DDE and Toxaphene, {{have been widely}} used in industry and agriculture for more than fifty years. Although they have served their purpose very effectively and at low cost, many of these compounds have been banned in the United States due to their persistence in the environment and their threat to human health. Their natural resistance to degradation has made organochlorine compounds the target of many studies that have been designed to convert them into less toxic compounds. At present there is not a single, simple method than can completely dechlorinate PCBs, PCP, p,p'-DDE and Toxaphene. The work presented here reports the use of a novel bimetallic system, palladized iron (Pd/Fe), to effect the complete dechlorination of these compounds, at ambient temperature and pressure, in a matter of minutes. The dechlorination reaction occurs {{on the surface of the}} palladized iron, with removal of all the chlorine atoms from the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compound</b> and yields the completely dechlorinated molecule and chloride ions as reaction products. The <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compound</b> is reductively dechlorinated while the iron particles are oxidized to Fe²⁺ Water is also reduced in the presence of iron, generating hydrogen, which is collected in the palladium lattice. The palladium is therefore necessary to store hydrogen gas; the "Pd·H₂" acts as a powerful reducing agent and is primarily responsible for the rapid and complete dechlorination of the organochlorine compounds. The Pd/Fe bimetallic system is potentially useful for the large scale remediation of groundwater or soil contaminated with organochlorine compounds. Palladized iron is relatively inexpensive and easy to prepare, and it rapidly and completely dechlorinates organochlorine compounds. For these reasons, the Pd/Fe system should be investigated further for applications in the field...|$|E

40|$|The {{remediation}} of soils {{contaminated with}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> was investigated. The process consists of solvent extraction followed by catalytic hydroprocessing (hydrodechlorination) of the extract phase. A mixture of ethylacetate-acetone-water (E-A-W) was adopted as solvent in the extraction process. Tests of extraction of chlorobenzene from a model contaminated soil {{were carried out}} and the Langmuir adsorption equation was characterized. The solvent, contaminated with different <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> was then hydrotreated with a Pd/C catalyst. The <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> tested are: chlorobenzene, hexachlorobenzene and hexachloroethane at various initial concentrations. The reaction runs were carried out at room temperature and at a hydrogen pressure of 1 bar. Hydrotreating of these compounds takes place according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism whose kinetic parameters were determined. The experiments show that high destruction efficiencies may be reached in reasonably short times, particularly for hexachloroethane. Longer times are necessary for the aromatic compounds (chlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene) for which the C-Cl bond is much stronger than that in the aliphatic compound. Time for a 95 % destruction efficiency for all experimental runs was determined. A noteworthy finding is that ethylacetate and acetone do not undergo any reaction during hydrotreating. Thus the treated extract solution may be recycled inasmuch as it conserves its full extracting capacity towards <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compounds.</b> A limitation in recycling is the inhibiting effect of benzene on the HDCl rate: benzene produced by HDCl of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compounds,</b> accumulates in the solvent mixture {{in the event of}} recycling.

Molecular monitoring and model simulations were applied to determine degradation performance of an in situ dechlorinating bioreactor and its influence on the contamination plume. Dehalococcoides was the dominant dechlorinating microorganism as revealed by qPCR targeting 16 S rRNA- and chloroethene reductive dehalogenase-encoding genes (tceA, vcrA, bvcA). The presence of all three reductive dehalogenases genes indicated coexistence of several distinct organohalide respiring bacterial populations in the bioreactor and groundwater. Mass balancing revealed that main dechlorinating activities were reduction of cis-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride. Analysis of growth kinetics showed that when performance of the bioreactor improved due to especially the addition of molasses, dechlorinating microorganisms were growing close to their maximum growth rate.

40|$|Trichloroethene is {{degraded}} by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. In {{the absence}} of ammonia, TCE transformation proceeds at moderate rates. Under the experimental conditions tested, the presence of PCE and cis-DCE, competitive inhibitors of TCE, slowed the rate and extent of TCE transformation. The capacity of these microorganisms to degrade TCE in the absence or presence of mixtures is diminished by the inactivation of the cells {{as a consequence of}} the transformation of the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compounds.</b> The potential application of ammonia oxidizers as a stand-alone in situ treatment process for TCE degradation is diminished by the inactivation of the cells and the inhibitory effects that mixtures of TCE and other <b>chlorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> pose to the microorganisms...|$|R
