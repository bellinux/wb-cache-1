40|$|In the {{cultivation}} of various fish species in aquaculture is an important to have enough dissolved oxygen available for fish respiration. This oxygen can be produced by the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and algae. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the influence of two macrophytes Myriophyllum spicatum and Lemna minor on uptake of oxygen in the feeding of perch. The experimental part was consisted of three tanks with Perca fluviatilis- as one without macrophytes (like a control) and the other two with macrophytes (Lemna minor, Myriophyllum spicatum). Oxygen uptake rate was measured at water temperature 23 ± 1 °C. The measurement of pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature was made with a portable <b>combined</b> <b>meter.</b> The mean oxygen uptake rate is better in {{the cultivation}} of Perca fluviatilis with Lemna minor...|$|E

50|$|An ESR meter is a two-terminal {{electronic}} {{measuring instrument}} designed and used primarily to measure the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of real capacitors; usually without the need to disconnect the capacitor from the circuit it is connected to. Other types of meter used for routine servicing, including normal capacitance meters, cannot be used to measure a capacitor's ESR, although a few <b>combined</b> <b>meters</b> are available which measure both ESR and out-of-circuit capacitance. A standard (DC) milliohmmeter or multimeter cannot be used to measure ESR, because a steady direct current cannot be passed through the capacitor.Most ESR meters {{can also be used}} to measure non-inductive low-value resistances, whether or not associated with a capacitor; this leads to a number of additional applications described below.|$|R

Moreover, ramp metering and route guidance are properly coordinated {{in order to reduce}} the total travel time and the total emissions in the freeway system in a balanced way. The controller proposed in the paper is of the predictive feedback type, i. e. the control computed at each time step depends on the measured system state and on the prediction of the system evolution, considering both a traffic and an emission model. Some simulation results are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme...|$|R
