Therefore, we investigated {{the effects of the}} cotransplantation <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> with BMSCs on antiapoptotic effects in adult rats for which the models of SCI are induced. We examined the changes in body weight, histopathological changes, apoptosis, and the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins after 14 days and 28 days after transplantation. We also assessed animal locomotion using BBB test. We found that treatment with OECs and BMSCs had a remissive effect on behavioral outcome and histopathological changes induced SCI. Furthermore, we observed the significant antiapoptotic effect on cotransplant treated group. In addition, cotransplantation <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> with BMSCs was found to have more significant repairing effect than that <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> or BMSCs alone. Furthermore, the recovery of hind limb could be related to antiapoptotic effect <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> and BMSCs through downregulating the apoptotic pathways.

However, little is understood {{about the nature and}} role <b>of</b> interactions between <b>OECs</b> and axons during development of the olfactory nerve pathway. We have used high resolution time-lapse microscopy to examine the growth and interactions of olfactory axons and OECs in vitro. Transgenic mice expressing fluorescent reporters in primary olfactory axons (OMP-ZsGreen) and ensheathing cells (S 100 ߭DsRed) enabled us to selectively analyse these cell types in explants of olfactory epithelium. We reveal here that rather than providing only a permissive substrate for axon growth, OECs play an active role in modulating the growth of pioneer olfactory axons. We show that the interactions between OECs and axons were dependent on lamellipodial waves on the shaft <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> processes.

In this study a standard protocol {{based on the}} isolation of mononuclear cells from adult peripheral blood was modified by adding a passaging step 7 days after the isolation. OEC colonies gained by both protocols were evaluated after 28 days and resulted in different frequencies <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> colonies depending on the donor and culture protocol. Accordingly, we defined two groups, namely, high colony-forming cultures (HCC) and low colony-forming cultures (LCC) for further analysis.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence for endothelial markers indicated an enrichment <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> by protocol modification in HCC.

40|$|One of the {{promising}} strategies for neural repair therapies is the transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) {{which are the}} glial cells of the olfactory system. We evaluated the effects of curcumin on the behaviour <b>of</b> mouse <b>OECs</b> to determine {{if it could be}} of use to further enhance the therapeutic potential <b>of</b> <b>OECs.</b> Curcumin, a natural polyphenol compound found in the spice turmeric, is known for its anti-cancer properties at doses over 10 µM, and often at 50 µM, and it exerts its effects on cancer cells in part by activation of MAP kinases. In contrast, we found that low-dose curcumin (0. 5 µM) applied to OECs strikingly modulated the dynamic morphology, increased the rate of migration by up to 4 -fold, and promoted significant proliferation <b>of</b> the <b>OECs.</b> Most dramatically, low-dose curcumin stimulated a 10 -fold increase in the phagocytic activity <b>of</b> <b>OECs.</b> All <b>of</b> these potently stimulated behavioural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> are favourable for neural repair therapies. Importantly, low-dose curcumin gave a transient activation of p 38 kinases, which is in contrast to the high dose curcumin effects on cancer cells in which these MAP kinases tend to undergo prolonged activation. Low-dose curcumin mediated effects on OECs demonstrate cell-type specific stimulation of p 38 and ERK kinases.

40|$|The {{regenerative}} {{capacity of}} the olfactory system is partly attributed {{to the presence of}} olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) as they are intimately associated with primary olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons from the olfactory epithelium until the final targeting of axons within the olfactory bulb. However, fundamental aspects <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> and OSN axon biology remain unclear and little is understood about how OECs and OSN axons interact and are capable of detecting and responding to each other. This thesis addresses the cellular and molecular processes and mechanisms that mediate OEC-OEC and OEC-axon interactions and migration in vitro. To start to understand how OECs interact in vitro and in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing a variant of the Discosoma species red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under the control of 9. 6 kb of the human S 100 ß gene regulatory sequence. Primary cultures derived from the neuroepithelium of these mice allowed for the first time clear identification and visualisation <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> in vitro and in vivo. Using high resolution time-lapse microscopy we report here that novel lamellipodial protrusions, termed lamellipodial waves, are integral to peripherally derived OEC migration. Time-lapse imaging <b>of</b> migrating <b>OECs</b> revealed that these highly dynamic waves progress along the shaft of the cells and are crucial for mediating cell-cell adhesion. Without these waves, cell-cell adhesion does not occur and migrational rates decline. The activity of waves is modulated by both GDNF and inhibitors of the JNK and SRC kinases. Furthermore, the activity of lamellipodial waves can be modulated by Mek 1, independently of leading edge activity. OECs are not a uniform population of cells and express distinct markers and are thought to play different roles depending on their anatomical position in the olfactory nerve pathway. As OECs arise from a common progenitor and migrate to populate the primary olfactory nerve, the different subpopulations must intermingle and sort out with considerable cell-cell interactions occurring. However, little is understood about how OECs interact and how the different subpopulations <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> are capable <b>of</b> detecting and responding to each other. We have micro-dissected anatomically distinct subpopulations <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> from the olfactory bulb and from the peripheral nerve and performed cell behaviour assays to reveal that the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> dramatically alters depending on their anatomical location and developmental age. In particular, centrally-derived OECs are a heterogeneous population of cells that respond to cell-cell contact with a mix of adhesion, retraction and indifference. In contrast, OECs derived from the peripheral olfactory nerve are clearly a homogeneous population. We have further determined that lamellipodial waves along the shaft <b>of</b> centrally-derived <b>OEC</b> processes are imperative for initiating and mediating behaviour during cell-cell contact. Inhibition of lamellipodial waves via Mek- 1 resulted in OECs losing their ability to distinguish between different subpopulations. These results demonstrate that centrally-derived OECs are a heterogeneous population of cells and that cell-cell recognition and responses are regulated through lamellipodial waves. To start to understand how olfactory axons interact in vitro and in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing a coral ZsGreen fluorescent protein {{under the control of the}} full length (5. 5 kb) olfactory marker protein (OMP) promoter. Primary cultures derived from the neuroepithelium of these mice allowed clear identification and visualisation of olfactory axons in vitro. Using high resolution time-lapse microscopy, we reveal here that OSN pioneer axons play a passive role in axon guidance; the motility <b>of</b> the underlying <b>OECs</b> is primarily responsible for pathfinding and migration of OSN axons. This intimate association is in part initiated and mediated by lamellipodial waves on the shaft <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> processes. Moreover, pioneer OSN axon migration can be indirectly modulated via GDNF and inhibitors of the JNK and SRC kinases. We also reveal that inhibition of NCAM results in the disruption <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> cell-cell recognition. Loss <b>of</b> the <b>OEC</b> scaffold by selective ablation <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> resulted in reduced axon survival. These results suggest that OEC growth and guidance are crucial to primary olfactory axon navigation in the olfactory system. This thesis demonstrates that OECs utilize novel cellular mechanisms to facilitate migration and cellular interactions. These findings have important implications for our understanding <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> in the primary olfactory system. Moreover, the ability to selectively regulate cell migration via lamellipodial waves has implications for manipulating the migratory behaviour <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> during neural repair...|$|R

Methods To demonstrate the role of TLR 4 /MyD 88 signaling in ovarian epithelial cancers (OECs), we examined the expression of TLR 4, MyD 88 and nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) in <b>OECs.</b> The expression <b>of</b> TLR 4, MyD 88, and NF-κB was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the relationships between these and clinicopathologic features in 123 cases <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> were also analyzed. Results The expression of TLR 4, MyD 88, and NF-κB in OECs was observed in 46. 3 % (57 / 123), 36. 6 % (45 / 123) and 65 % (80 / 123) <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> cases, respectively. The TLR 4, MyD 88, and NF-κB expressions were associated with the histologic type <b>of</b> <b>OECs,</b> particularly with the clear cell type <b>of</b> <b>OEC.</b> There was no significant correlation between TLR 4 or NF-κB expression and histologic grade, tumor size, mitotic count, FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage, disease recurrence. However, there was a significant correlation between MyD 88 expression and FIGO stage, disease recurrence as well as histologic type. In univariate analysis, the expression of TLR 4 and MyD 88, and the coexpression of TLR 4 /MyD 88 and TLR 4 /MyD 88 /NF-κB had a significant impact on the survival <b>of</b> patients with <b>OECs.</b> Only MyD 88 expression had an independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis.

We noted that OECs appeared to act as a physical substrate for the growth of post-injury neurite sprouts. We also found that while post-injury sprouting was promoted most when OECs were allowed to directly contact injured neurons, physical separation using tissue culture inserts (1 mm pore size, permeable to diffusible factors but not cells) did not completely block the promoting properties <b>of</b> <b>OECs,</b> suggesting that they also secrete soluble factors which aid post-injury neurite sprouting. Furthermore, this in vitro model allowed direct observation of the cellular interactions between OECs and sprouting neurites using live-cell-imaging techniques.

40|$|Disorders of the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} constitute serious complications of spinal cord injury (SCI) and their treatment is usually highly prioritised by spinal patients. Among these, autonomic dysreflexia and impaired thermoregulation are potentially life threatening conditions and require effective management. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), progenitor cells and polymeric scaffolds have been tested in animal models of SCI {{and some of them}} have been considered for clinical trials. However, evaluation of the effect of such interventions on autonomic functions has received only rudimentary attention and would require a more thorough experimental assessment before the methods are utilised in human patients. This thesis tested two potential therapeutic strategies for autonomic dysreflexia and examined disorders of thermoregulatory functions in a rat model of spinal cord transection. Magnitude and duration of autonomic dysreflexia were evaluated with radio telemetry in spinalised animals treated with (i) implants <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> and olfactory neurosphere-derived cells seeded in poly(lactic co glycolic) porous scaffolds or with (ii) transplants <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> alone. (iii) Effects of SCI and <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> on the morphology of sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs; which are involved in pathogenesis of autonomic dysreflexia) stained for NADPH diaphorase were examined. (iv) Doppler ultrasonography and infrared thermography were used to assess responses of tail blood flow and surface temperature to cold. Transplants <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> alone, but not in combination with olfactory neurosphere-derived cells and polymeric scaffolds, resulted in significantly shortened episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. This may be attributed to the alterations to the morphology of SPNs adjacent to the lesion: a transient increase in the morphometric features of the SPNs was evoked by spinal cord transection and this was further altered by transplantation <b>of</b> <b>OECs.</b> The thesis also showed that local responses of tail blood flow and temperature to cold were not abolished by complete SCI suggesting that temperature homeostasis could still be maintained in response to cold. It is hypothesised that OECs facilitate improved recovery from autonomic dysreflexia through alteration of the morphology of SPNs. Furthermore, it is suggested that the role of the tail in heat conservation can be regulated by mechanisms that are independent of the descendent neural control from supraspinal centres...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As {{olfactory}} receptor axons {{grow from}} the peripheral {{to the central}} nervous system (CNS) aided by olfactory ensheathing cells (<b>OECs),</b> the transplantation <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> has been suggested as a plausible therapy for spinal cord lesions. The problem with this hypothesis is that OECs do not represent a single homogeneous entity, but, instead, a functionally heterogeneous population that exhibits a variety of responses, including adhesion and repulsion during cell-matrix interactions. Some studies report that the migratory properties <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> are compromised by inhibitory molecules and potentiated by chemical gradients.

40|$|The glia of the {{olfactory}} system, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) {{are excellent}} candidates for neural repair. In their natural environment within the olfactory system, OECs are present within the {{peripheral nervous system}} and {{the central nervous system}} and they are considered to be crucial to the ability of olfactory neurons to regenerate throughout life. However, OECs are not a uniform population. Instead there are different subpopulations, each with a different molecular profile and proposed role in vivo. If OECs are to be used for neural repair therapies, it is therefore important to consider the different characteristics of the various subpopulations <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> and their potential therapeutic benefit. Using in vitro assays, we have determined that OECs derived from the peripheral nervous system in the nasal cavity respond differently to OECs isolated from the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system. Peripheral OECs are a uniform population that predominantly adhere to each and thereby promote contact-mediated migration of each other. In contrast, OECs from the olfactory bulb are a heterogeneous population that exhibit differential preference for contact with each other and are less likely to promote contact-mediated migration. We have further purified OECs from distinct anatomical regions of the olfactory bulb and used cell behaviour assays to reveal that OECs obtained from the rostral, ventral, dorsal and caudal regions of the olfactory bulb all exhibit strikingly different behaviours during cell-cell contact. The behaviours of the different subpopulations <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> are consistent with their proposed roles in vivo. We found that the heterogeneity <b>of</b> the <b>OECs</b> is regulated by motile lamellipodial waves and that inhibition of the lamellipodial wave activity abolishes the ability of the cells to distinguish between each other. These results demonstrate that individual subpopulations <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> with distinct properties exist within the olfactory nervous system. These results have important implications for selecting the source <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> for neural transplant therapies. Faculty of Science, Environment, Engineering and TechnologyNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) transplanted to {{the site}} of a spinal cord injury can promote axonal sparing/ {{regeneration}} and functional recovery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if OEC enhance the effects of grafted dopamine-neuron-rich ventral mesencephalic tissue (VM) in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease. We co-grafted VM with either OEC or astrocytes derived from the same olfactory bulbs as the OEC to rats with a unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigrostriatal system. Co-grafting fetal VM with OEC, but not with astrocytes enhanced dopamine cell survival, striatal reinnervation and functional recovery of amphetamineand apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour compared with grafting embryonic VM alone. Grafting OEC or astrocytes alone had no effects. Intriguingly, only in the presence <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> co-grafts, did dopamine neurons extend strikingly long neurites that reached peripheral striatal compartments. Comparable results were observed in a co-culture system where OEC promoted dopamine cell survival and neurite elongation through a mechanism involving both releasable factors and direct contact. Cell type analysis of fetal VM grafts suggested that dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra rather than of the ventral tegmental area were increased in the presence <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> co-grafts. We conclude that the addition <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> enhances efficacy <b>of</b> grafted immature dopamine neurons in a rat Parkinson’s disease model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Insulin-like {{growth factor}} binding protein (IGFBP- 3) is an antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic and {{invasion}} suppressor protein which is transcriptionally regulated by p 53. Promoter methylation {{has been linked}} to gene silencing and cancer progression. We studied the correlation between IGFBP- 3 and p 53 expression as well as IGFBP- 3 promoter methylation in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (OEC) by immunohistochemical staining and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP). Additionally, we assessed the molecular regulatory mechanism of wild type (wt) p 53 on IGFBP- 3 expression using two subclones <b>of</b> <b>OEC,</b> the OVTW 59 -P 0 (low invasive) and P 4 (high invasive) sublines. Results In 60 cases <b>of</b> <b>OEC,</b> 40. 0 % showed lower IGFBP- 3 expression which was significantly correlated with higher IGFBP- 3 promoter methylation. p 53 overexpression was detected in 35. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> and was unrelated to clinical outcomes and IGFBP- 3. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with lower IGFBP- 3, higher IGFBP- 3 promoter methylation, and normal p 53 were associated most significantly with lower survival rates. In OEC cell line, IGFBP- 3 expression was correlated with IGFBP- 3 promoter methylation. IGFBP- 3 expression was restored after treatment with a DNA methy-transferase inhibitors (5 -aza-deoxycytidine) and suppressed by a p 53 inhibitor (pifithrin-α). The putative p 53 regulatory sites on the promoter of IGFBP- 3 were identified at - 210, - 206, - 183 and - 179 bases upstream of the transcription start site. Directed mutagenesis at these sites quantitatively reduced the transcription activity of IGFBP- 3. Conclusion Our data suggests that IGFBP- 3 silencing through IGFBP- 3 promoter methylation in the absence of p 53 overexpression is associated with cancer progression. These results support a potential role of IGFBP- 3 methylation in the carcinogenesis <b>of</b> <b>OEC.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} implicated in mediating plasticity, particularly in situ in the olfactory nerve where {{they support the}} extension of olfactory sensory neuron (OSNs) axons from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb (OB). OECs are specialized glia whose processes surround OSN axon fascicles within the olfactory nerve and across the OB surface. Despite their purported importance in promoting axon extension, and following transplants, {{little is known about}} either morphology or biophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> in situ. In particular, cell-cell interactions that may influence OEC function are largely unexplored. Here, we studied OEC connectivity and morphology in slice preparations, preserving tissue structure and cell-cell interactions. Our analyses showed that OECs form a matrix of cellular projections surrounding axons, unique among glia, and express high levels of connexin- 43. Lucifer Yellow injections revealed selective dye coupling among small subgroups <b>of</b> <b>OECs.</b> Two types <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> were biophysically distinguished with whole cell voltage clamp recordings: 1) with low input resistance (Ri), linear current profiles, and frequently dye coupled; and 2) with high Ri, non-linear current profiles, and infrequent dye coupling. Pharmacological blockade of gap junctions changed OEC membrane properties such that linear OECs became non-linear. Double recordings indicated that the appearance of the non-linear current profile was associated with the loss of electrical coupling between OECs. We conclude that the diversity <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> current profiles can be explained by differences in gap junction connectivity and discuss implications of this diversity for OEC influences on axon growth and excitability.

40|$|Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) migrate with {{olfactory}} axons {{that extend}} from the nasal epithelium into the olfactory bulb. Unlike other glia, OECs {{are thought to}} migrate ahead of growing axons instead of following defined axonal paths. However it remains unknown how the presence <b>of</b> axons and <b>OECs</b> influences the growth and migration of each other during regeneration. We have developed a regeneration model in neonatal mice to examine whether (i) the presence <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> ahead <b>of</b> olfactory axons affects axonal growth and (ii) the presence of olfactory axons alters the distribution <b>of</b> <b>OECs.</b> We performed unilateral bulbectomy to ablate olfactory axons followed by methimazole administration to further delay neuronal growth. In this model OECs filled the cavity left by the bulbectomy before new axons extended into the cavity. We found that delaying axon growth increased {{the rate at which}} OECs filled the cavity. The axons subsequently grew over a significantly larger region and formed more distinct fascicles and glomeruli in comparison with growth in animals that had undergone only bulbectomy. In vitro, we confirmed (i) that olfactory axon growth was more rapid when OECs were more widely distributed than the axons and (ii) that OECs migrated faster in the absence of axons. These results demonstrate that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> can be increased by pressing by growth of olfactory axons and that olfactory axon growth is significantly enhanced if a permissive OEC environment is present prior to axon growth.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) {{is being}} trialled in humans for spinal injury regeneration and other neural disorders. However in humans and in animal models of these therapies, {{the results have}} been limited or inconsistent. One reason for the variation in results is that it is often assumed that OECs are a uniform population of cells that have the same characteristics, and are therefore uniformly suitable for neural regenerative therapies. We have now used time-lapse imaging <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> interactions to examine in detail the behavioural characteristics of anatomical and developmental subpopulations <b>of</b> <b>OECs.</b> We have found that OECs are a heterogeneous population of cells with fundamental differences in their behaviour and migration. Not only were peripheral OECs significantly different from OECs derived from the olfactory bulb, but OECs from different anatomical regions of the olfactory bulb displayed vastly different characteristics. These behaviours were consistent with their proposed roles in vivo with OECs from the olfactory bulb display a mix of adhesion, repulsion or indifference following cell-cell contact. Consistent with our previous findings, lamellipodial waves along the shaft <b>of</b> the <b>OEC</b> processes are always associated with initiating cell-cell contact and mediating the resultant behaviours of both peripheral and central OECs. These results have important implications for the use <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> in neural regeneration therapies as it is clear that OECs are not a uniform population of cells. Instead, these cells display distinct behavioural differences depending on their topographical location and age. These differences in cell origin and behaviour are likely to contribute to the variations in OEC transplantation outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC), which {{normally}} associate closely with {{but do not}} myelinate axons in situ, myelinate axons in the adult mammalian spinal cord. They are of clinical interest as candidate cells for autologous transplantation but the ability <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> to myelinate axons in vitro has been controversial. To clarify this issue, we isolated OEC from olfactory bulbs (OB) of juvenile and adult rats expressing GFP and analyzed their ability to myelinate axons. Using a well-defined assay for myelination of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) axons in culture, we found that OEC from juvenile pups associated with and then myelinated DRG axons. OEC assembled into bundles with the axons by 1 week and required {{more than a week}} before myelination on axons was detected. In contrast, rat Schwann cells did not bundle axons and they formed P 0 + and MBP+ myelin segments after as little as 1 week. Most <b>of</b> the <b>OEC</b> in culture exhibited staining for calponin, a marker that was not found on Schwann cells in culture, whereas in both OEC and Schwann cell populations nearly all cells were positive for p 75 NTR and GFAP. These results confirm previous reports showing only subtle immunological differences between Schwann cells and OEC. Besides differences in the rate of myelination, we detected two additional functional differences in the interactions <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> and Schwann cells with DRG axons. First, the diameter <b>of</b> <b>OEC</b> generated myelin was greater than for Schwann cell myelin on DRG axons. Second, OEC but not Schwann cells myelinated DRG axons in the absence <b>of</b> vitamin C. <b>OEC</b> isolated from adult OB were also found to bundle and myelinate DRG axons but the latter occurred only after incubation times of at least 3 weeks. The results indicate that adult OEC require longer incubation times than juvenile OEC to myelinate axons and suggest that patterns <b>of</b> myelination by <b>OEC</b> and Schwann cells are distinguishable at least on axons in vitro.

40|$|Injury to {{cervical}} dorsal roots {{mimics the}} deafferentation component of brachial plexus injury in humans, with intractable neuropathic {{pain in the}} deafferented limb being a common consequence. Such lesions are generally not amenable to surgical repair. The use of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) for dorsal root repair, via acute transplantation, {{has been successful in}} several studies. From a clinical point of view, delayed transplantation <b>of</b> <b>OECs</b> would provide a more realistic timeframe for repair. In this study we investigated the effect <b>of</b> delayed <b>OEC</b> transplantation on functional recovery of skilled forepaw movements and amelioration of neuropathic pain, using a C 7 and C 8 dorsal root injury rat model previously established in our lab. We found that OEC transplantation to the dorsal horn 1 week after root injury effectively attenuated neuropathic disturbances associated with dorsal root injury, including spontaneous pain behavior, tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. The sensory controls of complex, goal-oriented skilled reaching and ladder walking, however, were not improved by delayed OEC transplantation. We did not detect any significant influence <b>of</b> transplanted <b>OECs</b> on injury-induced central reorganisation and afferent sprouting. The anti-nociceptive effect mediated by OEC transplants may therefore be explained by alternative mechanisms such as modification of inflammation and astrogliosis.
