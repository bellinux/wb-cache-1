25|$|The tramway has {{a varied}} fleet. The {{standard}} livery introduced on the Flexity 2 trams has purple fronts, with white sides and a purple <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> {{on the lower}} sides. The heritage tramcars mostly use the traditional green and cream livery of BTS in various styles from the 1930s to the 1990s, with some older cars using the older red and cream livery and teak and cream livery. Some trams carry colourful all-over advertisements.|$|E
500|$|The Voronezh and Central Fronts dug [...] and [...] of {{trenches}} respectively, {{laid out}} in <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> for ease of movement. The Soviets built more than 686 bridges and about [...] of roads in the salient. Red Army combat engineers laid 503,663 anti-tank mines and 439,348 anti-personnel mines, with the highest concentration in the first main defensive belt. The minefields at Kursk achieved densities of 1,700 anti-personnel and 1,500 anti-tank mines per kilometre, about four times the density used in the defence of Moscow. For example, the 6th Guards Army of the Voronezh Front, was spread out over nearly [...] of front and was protected by 69,688 anti-tank and 64,430 anti-personnel mines in its first defensive belt with a further 20,200 anti-tank and 9,097 anti-personnel mines in its second defensive belt. Furthermore, mobile obstacle detachments were tasked with laying more mines directly {{in the path of}} advancing enemy armoured formations. These units, consisting of two platoons of combat engineers with mines at division level and one company of combat engineers normally equipped with 500–700 mines at corps level, functioned as anti-tank reserves at every level of command.|$|E
2500|$|A popular myth {{states that}} Gurkha soldiers, {{fighting}} for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces {{of the soldiers}} they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern.</b> Criss-cross laces could therefore {{mean the difference between}} life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops. [...] Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.|$|E
50|$|Latticework is an {{openwork}} framework {{consisting of}} a <b>criss-crossed</b> <b>pattern</b> of strips of building material, typically wood or metal. The design is created by crossing the strips to form a network. Latticework can be purely ornamental, or {{can be used as}} a truss structure such as a lattice girder bridge.|$|R
50|$|Lattice pastry is {{a pastry}} {{used in a}} <b>criss-crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> of strips in the {{preparation}} of various foods. Latticed pastry is used as a type of lid on many various tarts and pies. The openings between the lattice allows fruit juices in pie fillings to evaporate during the cooking process, which can caramelize the filling.|$|R

2500|$|The General Lee {{was based}} on a 1969 Dodge Charger owned by Bo and Luke (the series used mostly 1969 Chargers in the beginning; later on, they also {{modified}} 1968 Chargers to look like 1969s by installing 1969-model taillamps, taillamp panels, and grilles). It was orange with a Confederate battle flag painted on the roof, the words [...] "GENERAL LEE" [...] over each door, and the number [...] "01" [...] on each door. In the original five Georgia-filmed episodes, a Confederate flag along with a checkered racing flag in a <b>criss-cross</b> <b>pattern</b> could be seen behind the rear window; this was removed when it was felt that this extra detail did not show up enough on-screen to warrant the already very tight time constraints of preparing and repairing each example of the car. The name refers to the American Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The television show {{was based on}} the movie Moonrunners, in turn based on actual moonshine runners who used a 1958 Chrysler named Traveler, after General Lee's horse (with a slight spelling change). Traveler was originally intended to be the name of the Duke boys' stock car too, until producers agreed that General Lee had more punch to it.|$|E

50|$|While in Baku, halva {{is likely}} to mean the Turkish style, tahini-based version, the most famous {{regional}} variant is from Sheki where Şəki halvası halva refers to a layered bakhlava style pastry filled with spiced-nut mix and topped by <b>criss-crossed</b> <b>patterns</b> of a red syrup made from saffron, dried carrot and beetroot.

50|$|Most gold lunulae have {{decorative}} patterns {{very much}} resembling beaker pottery from {{roughly the same}} period, using geometrical patterns made up of straight lines, with zig-zags and <b>criss-cross</b> <b>patterns,</b> and many different axes of symmetry. The curving edges of the lunula are generally followed by curving border-lines, often with decoration between them. The decoration is typically most dense at the tips and edges, and the broad lower central area is often undecorated between the borders. The decoration also resembles that on amber and jet spacer necklaces, which {{are thought to be}} slightly later in date.|$|R
50|$|While the mech {{starts with}} a {{standard}} Vulcan Canon, the player can equip it with two upgradable weapons: the Beam and the Laser Shots. The Beam Shot can be upgraded to fire a wide wave of strong beam shots while the Laser Shots form a large <b>criss-crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> capable of striking more nimble enemies. The Zeoth can take {{a certain amount of}} damage before being destroyed (the game has no Lives System).

40|$|This lecture {{looks at}} the <b>criss-cross</b> <b>patterns</b> of exoticizing desires felt in {{meetings}} between international tourists and Korowai of Indonesian Papua. Tourists idolize Korowai as “Stone Age” people living outside global commodity markets, while Korowai idolize tourists as living by unlimited access to commodity wealth. I suggest that these meetings are powerful and attractive for participants because of several levels of cultural process operating in {{them at the same}} time. First, the tourism meetings accrue qualities of transcendental presence from exoticizing stereotypes themselves (including from the stereotypes’ content, their modes of collective circulation, and the feeling of their concrete immanence in sensations of encounter). Second, the tourism meetings agitate participants’ relations to their own normativity. Third, participants enter into situations of working socially and practically on the others’ disparities from themselves...|$|R

40|$|In {{contemporary}} {{literature on}} changing urban systems, {{it is often}} argued that the traditional central place conceptualisation is outdated and should {{be replaced by a}} network view that emphasises the increasing <b>criss-crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> of interdependencies between spatial units.

The analysis is based on census commuting interaction data for three points in time during the past three decades (1981, 1991, and 2001). Although the empirical results indicate that the Greater South East UK can still not be characterized as a polycentric urban region or integrated urban network, there is some evidence for urban network development at the local, intra-urban, level as well as a decentralization of the system at the regional, inter-urban, level.
