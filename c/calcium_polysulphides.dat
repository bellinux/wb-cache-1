40|$|Mites are pests {{of plants}} {{from the class}} Arachnida. Mites (Polyphagotarsonemus latus and Eutetranychus banksi) {{is an example of}} the most {{dangerous}} types of mites during the vegetative to the jatropha plant. The rapid of mites can invade and disrupt plant growth and cause a decline in agriculture, especially fruit. polysulphides calcium is one example of a natural pesticide made from inorganic minerals found in earth's crust. Advantages of <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulphides</b> as a natural pesticide is a pesticide inorganic among other environmentally friendly because it is faster components decomposed by nature, relatively cheap price, making the process easy, and is selective (only turn off a particular type of plant pests and relatively safe for natural enemies). This study aims to determine the concentration of calcium solution polysulphides the most effective against pest mites egg mortality P. latus and E. banksi. type of research is real research (True experimental research). This study conducted in the laboratory entomology, Crop Research Institute for Tobacco and Fibre (BALLITAS) Malang, in the month from May to July 2010 with designs completely randomized design. Data collected by direct observation in the sample who had been given treatment. Tukey test results showed that, treatment polysulphides calcium solution at a concentration of 40 ml/l is the most effective against pest mites egg mortality P. latus and polysulphides calcium solution at a concentration of 20 ml/l is the most effective against the pest mite egg mortality E. banksi...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{established}} {{the value of}} empirical data (biological, chemical and physical) in enabling an effective prediction {{of the potential for}} biological remediation to take place. While this was calibrated with over forty genuine environmental scenarios, its application to genuine fieldscale operations was more limited. Empirical data also underpinned the assessment of a set of low cost ameliorants in complexing heavy metals enabling the protection of controlled waters. In this case the ameliorant <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> out-performed the other solid matrices investigated. The commercial sponsor of the project was Remedios Limited who have pioneered the development and environmental applications of microbial biosensors. This project served to audit the current performance of biosensors and consider their future potential. All of the empirical data and the statistically evaluated results were integrated into a tiered decision support tool. This tool: Remediation DST was developed through a series of options that were weighted to reflect the parameters that assist users in reaching and justifying decisions regarding contaminated land remediation. Tier 1 considers generic risk assessment in the context of remediation. Tier 2 is a multi-component correlation matrix that matches soils or water to the available technologies. A weighted scoring system differentiates the relative merit of the selected option. Tier 3 is a manual interface that links the bespoke needs of users to generic strategies for effective remediation. Once test driven, the tiered approach was effective at clearly justifying the best remedial option available. The output from this project makes full use of empirical data to enable end-users to reach clear and well justified decisions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The data {{of studies}} on the {{effectiveness}} of impregnation with polysulfide solutions of shell limestone used as facing and wall material, {{as well as for the}} manufacture of road products are presented. Modification of the limestone with the impregnating composition «Akvastat» created by the authors which is sulfur-containing water-based solution of calcium polysulfide containing alcohols and surfactants, can significantly reduce water absorption and increase durability of limestone. Impregnating composition on the basis of calcium polysulfide possesses density of 1. 22 – 1. 24 g/cm 3, the infiltrant penetrates into the pore structure of limestone to a depth of 4 cm or more, depending on the density and structure of the sample. While the material is drying, sulfur nanoparticles are crystallized from the polysulfide solution in its pores. They partially fill pore space and form protective durable insoluble hydrophobic coating that impedes the penetration of water into the pores of the limestone, but preserves its vapor permeability, which is important for wall and decoration materials. The evaluation of protective coatings was performed with laser particle size analyzer, scanning probe microscope and a diffractometer. It showed that the average size of the particles forming the protective coating is in the range of 20 – 25 nm, the particles shape is spherical, the particles are elemental sulfur with orthorhombic structure of the crystal lattice. The processing of shell limestone with <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulphide</b> solution provides formation of coating based on nanosized sulfur on the surface of stone pores. The coating partially fills the pore space and, as it is hydrophobic, reduces the water absorption of the samples by a factor of 5 – 8, increases their average density by 22 – 27...|$|R
