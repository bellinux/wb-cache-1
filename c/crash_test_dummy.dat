25|$|A <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and {{articulation of the}} human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The <b>Crash</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Dummy</b> is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury {{of a human being}} in an automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over US$400,000.|$|E

Using human and animal cadaver research from earlier studies, the first artificial <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> was an anthropomorphic dummy named [...] "Sierra Sam". It was invented in 1949 by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) And Sierra Engineering Co. for the United States Air Force while conducting tests on aircraft ejection seats, pilot restraint harnesses, and aviation helmets. Alderson's early dummies and those of his competitors were fairly primitive, with no pelvic structure and little spinal articulation. With American automakers interested in durable crash test dummies that could be tested and retested while yielding back {{a broad spectrum of}} data during simulated automobile crashes, the first <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> used for automative testing was again invented by Samuel Alderson in 1968. It was called the V.I.P. (Very Important Person) and it was built with dimensions of an average adult man coupled with a steel rib cage, articulated joints, a flexible neck, and a lumbar spine.|$|E
2500|$|Hybrid III, the 50th {{percentile}} male dummy {{which made}} its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> <b>dummy,</b> {{and he is now}} a family man. If he could stand upright, he would be 175cm (5'9") tall and would have a mass of 77kg (170lb). He occupies the driver's seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 65km/h (40mph) offset frontal crash tests. He is joined by a [...] "big brother", the 95th percentile Hybrid III, at 188cm (6ft 2 in) and 100kg (223lb). Ms. Hybrid III is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive 152cm (5ft) tall and 50kg (110lb). The three Hybrid III child dummies represent a ten-year-old, 21kg (47lb) six-year-old, and a 15kg (33lb) three-year-old. The child models are very recent additions to the <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> <b>dummy</b> family; because so little hard data are available on the effects of accidents on children and such data are very difficult to obtain, these models are based in large part on estimates and approximations. [...] The primary benefit provided by the Hybrid III is improved neck response in forward flexion and head rotation that better simulates the human.|$|E
