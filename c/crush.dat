5|$|Adams {{went back}} to work for the WWF in 1992 and was given a new fan {{favorite}} character of an easygoing surfing Hawaiian who wore bright neon tights and utilized a new two-handed skull vice finisher called the Cranium Crunch. <b>Crush</b> made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of Superstars, defeating Kato. <b>Crush</b> made his first pay-per-view appearance under the gimmick with a win over Repo Man at SummerSlam. <b>Crush</b> then engaged in a feud with Doink the Clown, after he was attacked with a loaded prosthetic arm while confronting the clown about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused <b>Crush</b> to miss the 1993 Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX, where <b>Crush</b> lost after a second, identical Doink appeared from underneath the ring and struck <b>Crush</b> with the prosthetic arm. At the first King of the Ring pay-per-view, <b>Crush</b> challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match after a distraction by Doink.|$|E
5|$|Antestor (then called <b>Crush</b> Evil) existed {{prior to}} the release of Hellig Usvart but their music was a death/doom style, and was not yet musically {{considered}} black metal.

5|$|<b>Crush</b> {{would become}} a hired gun for his manager Mr. Fuji, helping his new client Jeff Jarrett win a King of the Ring {{qualifying}} match against Lex Luger on the May 21 episode of Superstars by attacking Luger outside the ring, causing him to lose by count-out. In retaliation, Luger cost <b>Crush,</b> a King of the Ring qualifying lumberjack match against Tatanka on the June 6 episode of Raw. As a result, the pair began a short program. During the rivalry, <b>Crush</b> formed a tag team with Fuji's client Yokozuna, challenging The Headshrinkers for the Tag Team Championship at King of the Ring. They lost the match after Luger distracted <b>Crush.</b> Their rivalry culminated in a match on the August 21 episode of Sunday Night Slam, which Luger won after Ted DiBiase distracted <b>Crush.</b> After the loss, <b>Crush</b> left WWF.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} match featured Shawn Michaels {{defending his}} WWF Intercontinental Championship against <b>Crush.</b> <b>Crush</b> controlled the early {{portion of the}} match by performing several dropkicks on Michaels, which he followed with a military press slam and a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Michaels left the ring to recover and returned to attack Crush's head. Michaels was unable to pin <b>Crush,</b> however, and <b>Crush</b> threw Michaels out of the ring. Two wrestlers dressed as Doink the Clown, with whom <b>Crush</b> had been feuding, came to the ring to distract <b>Crush.</b> Michaels performed a superkick, his signature move, and pinned <b>Crush</b> to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match, {{which was}} not broadcast in the United Kingdom, pitted <b>Crush</b> against the Repo Man. <b>Crush</b> used his size advantage to perform a Gorilla press slam on Repo Man. Repo Man performed a back suplex, but <b>Crush</b> showed no sign that the move affected him. <b>Crush</b> continued to dominate the match with such moves as a belly to belly suplex. Repo Man eventually tried to attack <b>Crush</b> by jumping off the top rope, but <b>Crush</b> caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and <b>Crush.</b> The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack <b>Crush</b> before the bell rang, but <b>Crush</b> {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, <b>Crush</b> tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled <b>Crush</b> outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive <b>Crush,</b> which allowed <b>Crush</b> to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and <b>Crush</b> then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. <b>Crush</b> was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E

40|$|Wear in rock crushers causes great {{costs in}} the mining and {{aggregates}} industry. Change of the geometry of the <b>crusher</b> liners is {{a major reason for}} these costs. Being able to predict the geometry of a worn <b>crusher</b> will help designing the <b>crusher</b> liners for improved performance. A model for prediction of sliding wear was suggested by Archard in 1953. Tests have been conducted to determine the wear coefficient in Archard's model. Using a small jaw <b>crusher,</b> the wear of the <b>crusher</b> liners has been studied for different settings of the <b>crusher.</b> The experiments have been carried out using quartzite, known for being very abrasive. <b>Crushing</b> forces have been measured, and the motion of the <b>crusher</b> has been tracked along with the wear on the <b>crusher</b> liners. The test results show that the wear mechanisms are different for the fixed and moving liner. If there were no relative sliding distance between rock and liner, Archard's model would yield no wear. This is not true for rock <b>crushing</b> applications where wear is observed even though there is no macroscopic sliding between the rock material and the liners. For this reason, Archard's model has been modified to account for the wear induced by the local sliding of particles being <b>crushed.</b> The predicted worn geometry is similar to the real <b>crusher.</b> A cone <b>crusher</b> is a machine commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry. In a cone <b>crusher,</b> the geometry of the <b>crushing</b> chamber is crucial for performance. The objective of this work, where wear was studied in a jaw <b>crusher,</b> is to implement a model to predict the geometry of a worn cone <b>crusher...</b>|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} the World Tag Team Championship match. The Headshrinkers gained the early advantage, but Mr. Fuji helped his team by hitting Fatu with the Japanese flag. Yokozuna {{performed}} a leg drop on Fatu, but Samu {{was able to}} tag in. All four wrestlers fought in the ring before the brawl moved to the arena floor. <b>Crush</b> performed a superplex on Samu, but Lex Luger came to ringside and distracted <b>Crush.</b> This allowed Samu to attempt a roll-up. <b>Crush</b> recovered, but Fatu tagged in and pinned <b>Crush</b> to retain the belts.|$|E

5|$|<b>Crush</b> {{attacked}} Doink the Clown {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, <b>Crush</b> used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. <b>Crush</b> used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. <b>Crush</b> forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged ref bump, a second Doink the Clown (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit <b>Crush</b> with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness.|$|E

40|$|Recycling and reuse {{of waste}} {{materials}} is a topic of global concern and of great international interest. The urgent need for recycling is driven mainly by environmental considerations, due to the increase scarcity {{of natural resources and}} the increasing cost of land fill in most countries. Construction and demolition (C&D) materials are generated by regeneration of infrastructure such as demolition activities of buildings and construction activities of tunnels and roads. Recycled <b>crushed</b> brick, <b>crushed</b> concrete, <b>crushed</b> basaltic rock are viable substitute materials for natural construction materials in engineering applications such as pavement subbase and other road construction applications.
