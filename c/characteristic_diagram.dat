40|$|It is a {{well-known}} problem of milling machines, that waste heat from motors, friction effects on guides and also the milling process itself greatly affect the positioning accuracy and thus the production quality. An economic and energy-efficient method of correcting this thermo-elastic positioning error is to gather sensor data from the machine tool and the process and to use that information to predict and correct the resulting tool center point displacement using high dimensional <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The size of these <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagrams</b> depends {{on the number of}} input variables (sensors) and the fineness of the discretization of the grid. While the number of sensors can usually not be reduced without affecting the quality of the prediction, it is often possible to minimize the size of <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagrams</b> through the use of adaptive grid refinement. This ensures that the finest grid sections correspond with the load cases that have the largest local gradients.

40|$|In this paper, two control {{approaches}} are presented for exploration rovers traversing sandy-sloped terrain. One {{of the proposed}} controls is a model-based feed-forward control using a <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagram,</b> called a Thrust-cornering <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagram.</b> It consists of various characteristic curves of wheel forces for varied wheel slip conditions. An appropriate steering maneuver for slope traversal can be found using the diagram with slope traversal criteria. The other control is a sensor-based feedback control. A key approach to this feedback control is to compensate for three types of slip, namely, the vehicle sideslip and longitudinal/lateral slips of a wheel. The feedback control cal-culates both steering and driving maneuvers that can compensate for these slips and also allow the rover to successfully traverse a sandy slope. The per-formances of these two control {{approaches are}} confirmed in slope traversal experiments using a four-wheeled rover test bed. The proposed controls are verified by quantitative evaluations of distance and orientation errors. Through the experiment, {{it was found that}} the two controls have advantages and dis-advantages, and the possibility of merging the model-based control and the sensor-based control is discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a simple family of barred galaxy models with flat rotation curves. They are built by convolving the axisymmetric logarithmic {{model with a}} needle density. The density contours in the bar region are highly triaxial and elongated, but become spheroidal in the outer parts. The mass distribution differs markedly from the elliptical shape assumed in other analytical models, like Ferrers or Freeman bars. The surface density profile along the bar major axis is flattish, as befits models for bars in early-type galaxies (SB 0, SBa). The two-dimensional orbital structure of the models is analysed with surfaces of section and characteristic diagrams and it reveals qualitatively new features. For some pattern speeds, additional Lagrange points can exist along the major axis, and give rise to off-centered, trapped orbits. When the bar is weak, the orbital structure is very simple, comprising just prograde, aligned $x_ 1 $ orbits and retrograde anti-aligned $x_ 4 $ orbits. As the bar strength increases, the $x_ 1 $ family becomes unstable and vanishes, with propeller orbits dominating the <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagram.</b> Comment: MNRAS, in pres...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of different pulse ON/OFF ratio on a-SiNx:H films were studied and {{the method of}} “totally wet etch” were used to fabricate a-Si:H TFT. Six different pulse ON/OFF ratio were used to deposite a-SiNx:H film. The effective deposition rate, refractive index and bonding ratio were measured using N & K analyzer and FTIR spectrometer. With the pulse ON/OFF ratio increasing from 1 / 3 to CW, the effective deposition rate of a-SiNx:H films reduced about 1. 7 times, while the etching rate, Si-N/Si-H and N-H/Si-H of those increased about 1. 4, 4. 6, and 6. 6 times, respectively. The increasing of Si-N/Si-H and N-H/Si-H with increasing pulse ON/OFF ratio {{was caused by the}} increasing of Si-H bond with increasing pulse ON/OFF ratio. The high pulse ON/OFF ratio is corresponding to N-rich a-SiNx:H film. From the output <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagram,</b> the device made by 1 / 1 pulse ON/OFF ratio had the highest drain current. From the transfer <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagram,</b> the device made by 1 / 1 pulse ON/OFF ratio had the highest I on/Ioff ratio, which was about 1. 32 × 10 ^ 4. 本論文研究不同的脈波開關比對氫化非晶氮化矽(a-SiNx:H) 薄膜性質的影響，並利用全濕蝕刻(totally wet etch) 的方法製作氫化非晶矽薄膜電晶體(a-Si:H TFT) 。 實驗上選擇六種不同的脈波電漿開關比,即CW、 3 / 1 、 2 / 1 、 1 / 1 、 1 / 2 及 1 / 3 來沈積a-SiNx:H。薄膜的沈積速率、折射率及鍵結比分別利用N&K analyzer及FTIR進行量測與分析。a-Si:H TFT元件則利用電流電壓量測儀來做電性的分析。 實驗結果顯示，隨著脈波電漿開關由 1 / 3 增加至CW，a-SiNx:H薄膜的等效沈積速率下降 1. 7 倍，而蝕刻率、Si-N/Si-H及N-H/Si-H分別增加 1. 4 、 4. 6 及 6. 6 倍。Si-N/Si-H及N-H/Si-H隨著脈波開關比的增加而上升，主要是由於Si-H鍵結會隨著脈波開關比的增加而減少所造成。脈波開關比越高，a-SiNx:H越富氮(N-rich) 。由輸出特性圖得知， 1 / 1 的條件所製作的元件具有最大的汲極電流。由傳導特性圖得知， 1 / 1 的條件所製作的元件具有最大的Ion/Ioff比，其值約為 1. 32 × 10 ^ 4 。第一章 簡介 1 1. 1 應用於氫化非晶矽薄膜電晶體的氫化非晶氮化矽 1 1. 2 脈波式調變電漿對薄膜特性的影響 2 1. 3 氫氣稀釋對氫化非晶氮化矽薄膜特性的影響 3 1. 4 全濕蝕刻製程氫化非晶矽薄膜電晶體 3 1. 5 研究方法 4 1. 6 論文架構 5 第二章 脈波調變電漿製作氫化非晶氮化矽薄膜及其分析 7 2 - 1 氫化非晶氮化矽薄膜的成長 7 2 - 1 - 1 基材的選擇與清洗 7 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 基材的選擇 7 2 - 1 - 1 - 2 試片清洗 8 2 - 1 - 2 薄膜成長 8 2 - 2 脈波調變電漿對氫化非晶氮化矽薄膜特性的影響 8 2 - 2 - 1 膜厚及折射率 8 2 - 2 - 2 蝕刻速率 9 2 - 2 - 3 鍵結組成 10 2 - 3 氫化非晶氮化矽薄膜的選擇 13 第三章 氫化非晶矽薄膜電晶體元件製作 14 3 - 1 氫化非晶矽薄膜電晶體的操作原理 14 3 - 2 光罩設計 15 3 - 3 全濕蝕刻製程氫化非晶矽薄膜電晶體的製作 15 3 - 3 - 1 微影 15 3 - 3 - 2 蝕刻 17 3 - 3 - 3 元件製程 18 第四章 脈波調變電漿對氫化非晶矽薄膜電晶體電性的影響 21 第五章 結論 23 第六章 未來工作 24 參考資料...|$|E

Fuel pool water is cooled by means of natural convection. Forced circulation flow of closed-cooling water exists on the tube side of each heat exchanger. The penetrations of the cooling water supply lines through the fuel pool liner are all located above the pool water surface. This ensures that the fuel pool cannot lose water {{in the event of}} a pipe break. Integration of the cooling components inside the fuel pool ensures only noncontaminated piping within the reactor building. The fuel pool cooling system consists of two redundant cooling trains.

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} problem of milling machines, that waste heat from motors, friction effects on guides and most importantly the milling process itself greatly affect positioning accuracy and thus production quality. Therefore, milling machines commonly use active cooling and lead time to reach thermal stability.

Two such approaches are the <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagram</b> based and the structure model based correction algorithms.

Five new configurations are defined after considering several combinations of the following model settings: horizontal grid spacing, domain extension, initial and boundary conditions, nesting design and the BOLAM code version. Such testing configurations are inter-compared with the operational BOLAM version following a multi-method approach including Fourier spectral analysis, several categorical scores, quasi-relative operating <b>characteristic</b> <b>diagram</b> and visual inspection of the spatial distributions of the contingency table elements. Rain gauge measurements available between June and November 2007 within the international initiative ‘Demonstration of Probabilistic Hydrological and Atmospheric Simulation of flood Events in the Alpine region’ of the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP D-PHASE) are considered as observational dataset. A 6 month reforecast campaign is performed in order to produce, for each compared configuration, the corresponding forecast series. Results show that decreasing model grid spacing and simultaneously increasing model domain extension is effective in improving the QPF quality when higher-resolution initial and boundary conditions are directly applied to BOLAM, without using a coarser-resolution parent model run. Therefore, such skilful configuration has been deployed in late 2012 within the international research programme ‘HYdrological cycle in Mediterranean EXperiment’ (HyMeX).
