40|$|Interaction of [BHx] and [NHx] species {{gives rise}} of {{molecular}} hydrogen and the set-up of B-N bond. Metal amides and ammonia are the commonly used [NHx] sources. Herein, urea (CO(NH 2) (2)), an organic <b>carbonyl</b> <b>diamide,</b> {{was applied to}} react with LiBH 4. A new type of complex hydrides LiBH 4 center dot CO(NH 2) (2), was synthesized by ball milling LiBH 4 and CO(NH 2) (2) in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 in this work. Structural analyses show that this newly developed complex has a monoclinic structure (space group C 12 /c 1) with unit-cell parameters of a = 14. 629 (2) angstrom, b = 5. 8701 (11) angstrom, c = 13. 662 (3) angstrom, beta = 115. 135 (7) degrees, and V = 1062. 1 (3) angstrom(3), in which Li+ coordinates with two [BH(4) 1 (-) groups and two O atoms of two CO(NH 2) (2) molecules. The dehydrogenation properties of LiBH 4 center dot CO(NH 2) (2) were subsequently measured, and ca. 8. 13 wt% of H- 2 can be released exothermically at temperatures below 250 degrees C.

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{preparation}} and analysis of mono- and multivalent host-guest complexes mainly based on amide (pseudo) rotaxanes with Hunter/Vögtle tetralactam macrocycles (TLM). Additionally, the binding behavior of differently substituted resorcinarenes towards cationic guest molecules was examined in a combination of solution and gas-phase studies. First, the binding behavior of different monovalent guests like diamide- or diketopiperazine-axles towards the monovalent tetralactam macrocycles was analyzed. The strong binding of diketopiperazine binding stations allows an effective rotaxane formation through stoppering reaction with an azide-functionalized stopper molecule through “click” chemistry. A detailed study combining NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements with X-ray crystallography and DFT calculations was performed to investigate the influence of different substituents on diamide binding stations {{in terms of the}} binding affinity towards the TLM. While guests with alkyl or alkenyl chains attached to the <b>diamide</b> <b>carbonyl</b> groups have a significantly higher binding affinity to the macrocycle than guests with benzoyl substituents, nearly no binding could be observed when electron-withdrawing groups were attached to the benzoyl-substituent. Based on these results, di- and trivalent amide pseudorotaxanes were synthesized and a detailed thermdynamic analysis of the threading process was performed with respect to binding constants, binding enthalpies and entropies. Through double mutant cycle analysis, effective molarities and cooperative binding could be determined to provide a profound understanding of the binding situation in mono- and multivalent pseudorotaxanes. The multivalency-enhanced binding makes the syntheses of the first doubly and triply threaded amide rotaxanes through ”click” chemistry much more efficient than expected from the rather low yields of their monovalent counterparts. Furthermore, the trivalent rotaxane turned out to act as a molecular elevator, which can be controlled by the addition or removal of chloride ions. For studying the non-covalent interactions between differently substituted resorcinarenes and cationic guest molecules, a trend of the binding affinities was determined in the gas phase by ESI-MS/MS experiments. The determination of binding constants in solution by NMR titrations shows an opposed trend, which can be explained by a synergetic effect originating from the interaction of the halogenated resorcinarenes with the counter anions through hydrogen bonding...|$|R
