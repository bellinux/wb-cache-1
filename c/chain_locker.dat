500|$|One of the crew, Louie (an uncredited Lawrence Tierney), {{tells the}} captain he should pull in to port {{and take on}} new crew. The captain says [...] "You know, there are captains who might hold this against you, Louie." [...] Shortly after, the captain closes the hatch to the <b>chain</b> <b>locker</b> with Louie inside, and Louie is crushed to death by the chain. Merriam {{believes}} that Captain Stone, who is obsessed with authority, did it intentionally. When they dock at the fictional Caribbean island of [...] "San Sebastian" [...] (which had appeared in RKO's I Walked with a Zombie—another Lewton production—and later in RKO's Zombies on Broadway), Merriam attempts to expose the Captain's madness at a board of inquiry. The crew all speak favorably of the captain, including the Greek, who credits the captain with saving his life. Merriam states his intention to leave the Altair.|$|E
500|$|The set design, too, {{has been}} praised for being [...] "suitably claustrophobic." [...] Robson's {{direction}} has earned kudos for heightening the suspense by leaving certain actions and motives vague. In {{the scene in}} which Seaman Parker (Lawrence Tierney) dies, crushed by the anchor chain, Robson left it unclear whether Captain Stone committed murder by trapping Parker in the anchor <b>chain</b> <b>locker</b> or whether he merely shut the door. The vagueness leaves the audience unsure whether to believe Merriam's accusations against the Captain, and builds an atmosphere of paranoia and doubt which {{is critical to the}} picture's success. Contemporary critic Gary Giddins has pointed out that the film incorporates classic Lewton scare tactics but in new ways. [...] "His trademark scare tactic, a high point in practically all of his films, is a long, dark, nightmarish walk, where every sound is magnified and every object threatening. In The Ghost Ship, that [...] "walk" [...] is transferred to the cabin of the victimized third officer..." [...] Others have pointed out another Lewton device, the gradual stalking of a main character by a murderer, as another deft touch in the film.|$|E

5000|$|On 6 December 1948, {{while the}} ship was {{operating}} in heavy pack ice, a shifting floe sprung a leak in her port <b>chain</b> <b>locker.</b> A seam opened there, and the ship began to fill uncontrollably. In order to save the ship, her commanding officer, Lt. Cpmdr. F. E. Clark, ordered her beached. Meanwhile, Edisto, which had just completed refresher training in Narragansett Bay, was summoned to join [...] in assisting Whitewood out of her predicament. Eventually, with a patch applied to her side, Whitewood made Boston on 8 January 1949 — exactly one month after her serious accident.|$|E
40|$|Shipping is {{considered}} the single largest vector for the human-mediated movement of non-indigenous marine species (NIMS) around the world (e. g., Ruiz et al., 1997; Minchin and Gollasch, 2002).

Biofouling or hull fouling is now being acknowledged {{as one of the}} single most important dispersal mechanisms alongside ballast water (e. g., Cranfield et al., 1998; Thresher et al., 1999; Hewitt, 2002;Gollasch, 2002;Hewitt et al., 2004) ...|$|R
50|$|They {{were first}} {{detected}} in Canada in the Great Lakes in 1988, in Lake St. Clair, located east/northeast of Detroit and Windsor. It is {{believed they were}} inadvertently introduced into the lakes in the ballast water of ocean-going ships traversing the St. Lawrence Seaway. Another possible, often neglected, mode of introduction is on anchors and chains, although {{this has not been}} proven. Since adult zebra mussels can survive out of water for several days or weeks if the temperature is low and humidity is high, <b>chain</b> <b>lockers</b> provide temporary refuge for clusters of adult mussels that could easily be released when transoceanic ships drop anchor in freshwater ports. They have become an invasive species in North America, and as such they are the target of federal policy to control them, for instance in the National Invasive Species Act (1996).|$|R

The planet Miseryville is on (and Miseryville may be the entire planet) is shaped like the Miseryville logo, and it has a red sky and three suns. Its {{inhabitants}} are mostly monsters except for Jimmy and Heloise who are pretty much the only humans there. Lucius's factory overshadows the town. The town is surrounded by tall mountains, grassy meadows, forests, and volcanoes. It seems as though all of the lakes and other places that should contain water contain lava instead but the characters are able to swim in them without burning up (usually). Although it is stated that it has never snowed in Miseryville [...] "Invasion of the Weavils" [...] shows Jimmy going to two different places that have snow and ice. There are screens and cameras that Lucius (and occasionally Samy or Heloise) use to communicate to Miseryvillians all over town, some hidden in the most unlikely places, such as cakes and trees. Although the town is considered a terrible place to live it does have fun places like theaters, swimming pools, beaches etc. (although they all seem to have some horrible twist). There was once {{what appeared to be a}} school in the episode [...] "Scent of a Heinous" [...] during an ad for Heinous Perfume, complete with buses, search lights, <b>chain</b> gates, <b>lockers,</b> and a total of three girls. It was never shown again.|$|R

The tank was inadequately ventilated, and the air inside was discovered to be too foul for men to enter. After allowing the empty tank to air out, the three-man cleaning crew was ordered to commence work. A hose was run to the tank from an ammunition handling room, of which Smith was in charge, and one sailor, Ordinary Seaman Peter J. Walsh, descended into the tank to begin cleaning. Walsh was quickly overcome by fumes and fell unconscious {{to the bottom of}} the chamber. His two companions rushed to the handling room where Smith was working and shut off the hose. While one of the men tried unsuccessfully to save Walsh, Smith gathered a rope and prepared to make his own rescue attempt.|$|E

The crews are afraid of her, believing {{her to be a}} witch, and on at least one occasion her life is threatened by Hickeys faction, though Captain Crozier is able to defuse the situation. She apparently follows the men when they leave the ships behind and saves Croziers life after Hickey shoots him. She teaches Crozier how to survive in the Arctic, and they eventually become lovers. Silences aptitude for survival is frequently compared to the expedition members failure to keep warm and find sustenance in the harsh Arctic conditions.|$|E

A trip on a British merchant navy ship resulted in the paintings The Merchant Navy:The <b>Chain</b> <b>Locker</b> and Merchant Seaman Fireman. In 1943 Carr became a full-time, salaried, War Office Artist and travelled first to North Africa and then to Italy. As well as portraits of Allied soldiers and officers, he painted military actions and landscapes in Algiers, Tunis, Cassino and Sessa in Italy.

The diggers were carried out daily inside the horse, and the dirt similary removed, whilst a squad of P/W did vaulting exercises under the nose of a nearby sentry.
