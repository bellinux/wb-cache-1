The {{objective of this}} review was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>cryopreservation</b> (<b>embryo</b> freezing) when compared with human i. v. albumin infusion and with fresh embryo transfer for the prevention of OHSS. METHODS: This was based on a Cochrane Review. Randomized controlled trials in which either human i. v. albumin or <b>cryopreservation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>embryos</b> was used as a therapeutic approach to OHSS were included. The participants were women down-regulated by GnRH agonist, undergoing superovulation in IVF/ICSI cycles. The interventions compared were cryopreservation versus i. v. human albumin administration and elective <b>cryopreservation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>embryos</b> versus fresh embryo transfer. The primary outcomes were: incidence of moderate and severe OHSS versus nil/mild OHSS, and clinical pregnancies/woman. Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group guidelines. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified, two of which met our inclusion criteria. One study was included where cryopreservation was compared with i. v. human albumin administration and another where elective <b>cryopreservation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>embryos</b> was compared with fresh embryo transfer.

40|$|BACKGROUND Advances in the {{diagnosis}} and treatment of malignancies in girls and young women had significantly increased survival rates, but surgical removal of the ovaries, potentially sterilizing radiotherapy or chemotherapy often result in premature ovarian failure, infertility and premature menopause. The degree of ovarian damage depends on the gonadotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agent and radiation dose, while surgical removal of the ovaries results in irreversible loss of ovarian function. Recently, with the purpose of fertility preservation, on one side, less radical surgical procedures in early stages of cancer are performed while on the other, advances in laboratory techniques in in vitro fertilization enable <b>cryopreservation</b> <b>of</b> own genetic material. CONCLUSIONS While <b>cryopreservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> and oocytes is already an established and successful procedure, ovarian transplantation – despite reports of livebirths following the transplantation – still remains at experimental stage. The indication for fertility preservation should take into account type of cancer, prognosis of the disease, age (≤ 38 let), planned therapy, such as type of surgical procedure, gonadotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation dose, and therefore cooperation of oncologists, reproductive gynecologists and embryologists is mandatory, because each indication must be carefully taken into consideration. </p...|$|R

40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD) is gradually {{widely used in}} prevention of gene diseases and chromosomal abnormalities. Much improvement has been achieved in biopsy technique and molecular diagnosis. Blastocyst biopsy can increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce allele dropout. It is cost-effective and currently plays an important role. Whole genome amplification permits subsequent individual detection of multiple gene loci and screening all 23 pairs of chromosomes. For PGD of chromosomal translocation, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) is traditionally used, but with technical difficulty. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) can detect translocation and 23 pairs of chromosomes that may replace FISH. Single nucleotide polymorphisms array with haplotyping can further distinguish between normal chromosomes and balanced translocation. PGD may shorten time to conceive and reduce miscarriage for patients with chromosomal translocation. PGD has a potential value for mitochondrial diseases. Preimplantation genetic haplotyping has been applied for unknown mutation sites of single gene disease. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) using limited FISH probes in the cleavage-stage embryo did not increase live birth rates for patients with advanced maternal age, unexplained recurrent abortions, and repeated implantation failure. Polar body and blastocyst biopsy may circumvent the problem of mosaicism. PGS using blastocyst biopsy and array CGH is encouraging and merit further studies. <b>Cryopreservation</b> <b>of</b> biopsied blastocysts instead of fresh transfer permits sufficient time for transportation and genetic analysis. <b>Cryopreservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> may avoid ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and possible suboptimal endometrium...|$|R
