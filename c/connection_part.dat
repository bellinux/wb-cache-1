40|$|Abstract—The {{growing amount}} of {{international}} collaborations in research, education, and business fields has raised {{once again the}} demand for quality assurance of network connections, which the projects and applications are realized upon.

40|$|Abstract—The growing {{significance}} of international collaborations in research, education, and business fields {{has raised the}} demand for the assurance {{of the quality of}} the network connections which the projects and applications are realized upon. A large spectrum of examples with diverse requirements is found in areas such as GRID- and Cloud computing, eLearning, and video-conferencing. The consequences of these diverse project and application requirements culminate in the urgent necessity to provide an End-to-End (E 2 E) guarantee for any customer-specific or user-tailored combination of service-specific Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. The quality of the overall network connections provided to users obviously directly depends on the quality of the involved <b>connection</b> <b>parts.</b> This means that already during the setup negotiation process the quality of the available <b>connection</b> <b>parts</b> has to be considered. Especially for international connections it is common that multiple independent service providers (SPs) realize different connection segments. This means in turn, that during the information exchange about available <b>connection</b> <b>parts</b> not only the technical challenges have to be solved, but also preferences and restrictions of the involved provider domains must be considered. In this paper we present a novel information model for the description of such connections. In the proposed model, a multi-domain view is derived from the single-domain perspectives of each considered SP. This model serves as a pro-found basis for an end-to-end routing algorithm which considers multiple user specific QoS parameters in parallel. The proposed model also accounts for the typically very restrictive SP information policies. Keywords-network description; multi-domain information model; multi-QoS support I...|$|R

40|$|Due to its ideal {{material}} properties and very small but uniform wall thickness, ping pong balls are selected {{to study the}} plastic crushing behavior of thin-walled spheres and sphere arrays. In experiments, single spheres were compressed by point-load, rigid ball, rigid plate, rigid cap or double rigid balls. A number of bifurcation phenomena are identified and their effect on the crushing force is illustrated. It is noted that when two ping pong balls compress each other, the snap-through deformation randomly occurred {{in one of the}} balls while the other one remained undeformed or only deformed elastically. This fact allows us to conveniently employ a single ball's load-deformation relation for predicting the 1 -D or 2 -D array's load-deformation behavior. A very good agreement between the prediction and the experimental result is shown. If the ping pong balls are connected, the <b>connection</b> <b>part,</b> which can be simulated by a rigid cap, transforms the ball from a type I to a type II structure. Thus, when compressing a 1 -D array of connected balls, the deformation will be localized in a ball until the force increases to a certain value, which crushes the next ball. Such a crushing force depends {{on the size of the}} <b>connection</b> <b>part,</b> as demonstrated in the case of compression by a rigid cap. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
