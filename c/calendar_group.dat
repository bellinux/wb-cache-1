40|$|The {{evidence}} supporting the common instructional method of daily <b>calendar</b> <b>group</b> {{time to teach}} math skills to prekindergarten children has been inconclusive. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of exposure to daily <b>calendar</b> <b>group</b> time on prekindergarten children 2 ̆ 7 s math score gains in a private early-childhood program located in the suburban Southeast. Vygotsky 2 ̆ 7 s sociocultural theory guided this quantitative, causal comparative design wherein archival data from 104 prekindergarten students 2 ̆ 7 pre- and posttest numeracy skill scores on the Young Children 2 ̆ 7 s Achievement Test were analyzed. Data from 6 classrooms over 2 school years were compared using multiple linear regression. Four classrooms offered daily <b>calendar</b> <b>group</b> time (n = 72), and the other 2 did not (n = 32). Results from multiple linear regression analyses showed that when pretest scores, English language learner status, and socioeconomic status were controlled for, posttest scores of prekindergarten students who were instructed using the calendar were not significantly different from posttest scores of students with no calendar exposure. The results from this study can be used by prekindergarten administrators and teachers to inform classroom math instructional practices. This study contributes to social change by demonstrating that the instructional practice of prekindergarten daily <b>calendar</b> <b>group</b> time does not assist young children in attaining additional math skills prior to kindergarten entry; other methods of instruction may be more effective...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{assess a}} text {{messaging}} intervention to promote tuberculosis (TB) treatment adherence. Methods. A mixed-methods pilot {{study was conducted}} within a public pulmonary-specialized hospital in Argentina. Patients newly diagnosed with TB who were 18 or older, and had mobile phone access were recruited and randomized to usual care plus either medication calendar (n= 19) or text messaging intervention (n= 18) {{for the first two}} months of treatment. Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability; secondary outcomes explored initial efficacy. Results. Feasibility was evidenced by high access to mobile phones, familiarity with texting, most phones limited to basic features, a low rate of participant refusal, and many describing suboptimal TB understanding. Acceptability was evidenced by participants indicating feeling cared for, supported, responsible for their treatment, and many self-reporting adherence without a reminder. Participants in the texting group self-reported adherence on average 77 % of the days whereas only 53 % in <b>calendar</b> <b>group</b> returned diaries. Exploring initial efficacy, microscopy testing was low and treatment outcomes were similar in both groups. Conclusion. The texting intervention was well accepted and feasible with greater reporting of adherence using text messaging than the diary. Further evaluation of the texting intervention is warranted...|$|E

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 29). Now-a-days the dynamism of modern technologies & its pragmatic applications are almost inevitable for our day to day life style. Google is on a triumphant march for providing solutions to emerging needs & connecting people across the globe by creating virtually inter-connected world through Google Apps. Recently Google Bus Bangladesh has officially launched its journey {{in the country to}} encourage the students at college and university level to get involved in internet use through Google Apps to bag and maximize the benefits of ICT in their lives. Market Access Group, one of the biggest marketing agencies in Bangladesh, is event & activation partner of ‘Google Bus Bangladesh’ project campaign. This project consists of Planning team, advanced team & Trainer team for executing the entire projects to reach ultimate objectives. I have worked in the trainer team & visited various college and university campuses as an execution part of this job as well as gathering information for the internship report. The training part has been designed as an interactive session among the students & trainers starting with the audience based contents structured by the Google Bus Bangladesh team. The contents have been configured with the technical-know-how and benefits of Google apps for virtual documentations (docs, spreadsheet, and <b>calendar),</b> <b>group</b> discussions, and live video conference (Hangout), social networking (Google+), virtual data storage accessible from any device (Google drive), educative learning & entertainment through online video channel (YouTube) etc. for the students. The training session has used to be boosted up with the Quiz contest based on the contents delivered and gift for the winners. The Google Bus journey to a campus has to end up with the hands-on participation of the students in joining virtual Google plus Community. I came up with the findings that Google apps has diversified interactive virtual facilities to reduce the complexities of storing, editing and losing data or records; it has limitations due to formatting mismatch that limits data copy and paste among Google docs, Google spreadsheet & Google presentation. Moreover, Google plus community is not so popular among students like Facebook community for social networking. However, Google apps have crafted a vast window for the tech-freak emerging student community of Bangladesh. S. M. Arafatur RahmanM. Business Administratio...|$|E
