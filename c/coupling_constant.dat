25|$|When a proton is {{coupled to}} two {{different}} protons, then the coupling constants {{are likely to}} be different, and instead of a triplet, a doublet of doublets will be seen.

Note that the smaller <b>coupling</b> <b>constant</b> (smaller line spacing) {{is due to the}} three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger <b>coupling</b> <b>constant</b> (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron.

40|$|Indirect nuclear spin–spin <b>coupling</b> <b>constants</b> {{calculated}} using restricted Hartree–Fock theory are unreliable since the usually dominant Fermi-contact (FC) contribution arises from a triplet perturbation {{of the electronic}} system, poorly described in the Hartree–Fock theory – in particular, at geometries close to the onset of triplet instabilities. These problems are usually but not invariably overcome in Kohn–Sham theory, which typically provides good spin–spin <b>coupling</b> <b>constants.</b> We here examine the sensitivity of spin–spin <b>coupling</b> <b>constants</b> to triplet instabilities in Kohn–Sham and Hartree–Fock theories by correlating {{the quality of the}} spin–spin <b>coupling</b> <b>constants</b> {{and the quality of the}} lowest triplet excitation energy for a number of small molecules.
