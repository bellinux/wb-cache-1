5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and <b>communications</b> channels that send messages to one another. Some digital <b>communications</b> networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog <b>communications</b> network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
