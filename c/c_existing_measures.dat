40|$|Hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) is {{the current}} {{standard}} used in the clinical treatment of patients with diabetes. However, {{it has been shown}} that patients with similar HbA 1 c values may have widely different fluctuations in blood glucose values over the same period of time, including time spent in hyper- and/or hypo-glycemia. Hence, there exists a need for quantitative measures that can supplement HbA 1 c in managing patients with diabetes. We introduce and compare the Dynamic Stress Factor, DySF, a newly developed metric that quantifies glycemic volatility based on patient-specific glucose transition density profiles with HbA 1 c and with currently used glucose variability metrics in predicting severe hypoglycemia in children with type 1 diabetes. DySF, the daily weighted number of large monotonic glycemic transitions that occur within one hour, was calculated for 441 total subjects with type 1 diabetes (146 children, aged 8 - 14 yrs) to assess the magnitude and frequency of glucose transitions per day. Severe hypoglycemic episodes (HE) were quantified for all subjects and evaluated against HbA 1 <b>c</b> and <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of glucose variability, including SD, MAGE, MODD, and CONGA using logistic regression models. DySF was found to be a predictor of severe HE in children (p = 0. 018) with the likelihood of a child...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Many {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} acoustics, physiology, and perceptual characteristics of the voice source, but despite significant attention, it remains unclear which aspects of the source should be quantified and how measurements should be made. In this study, the authors examined the relationships {{among a number of}} <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of the glottal source spectrum, along with the association of these measures to overall spectral shapes and to glottal pulse shapes, to determine which measures of the source best capture information about the shapes of glottal pulses and glottal source spectra. METHOD: Seventy-eight different measures of source spectral shapes were made on the voices of 70 speakers. Principal components analysis was applied to measurement data, and the resulting factors were compared with factors similarly derived from oral speech spectra and glottal pulses. RESULTS: Results revealed high levels of duplication and overlap among <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of source spectral slope. Further, <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> were not well aligned with patterns of spectral variability. In particular, <b>existing</b> spectral <b>measures</b> do not appear to model the higher frequency parts of the source spectrum adequately. CONCLUSION: The failure of <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> to adequately quantify spectral variability may explain why results of studies examining the perceptual importance of spectral slope have not produced consistent results. Because variability in the speech signal is often perceptually salient, these results suggest that most <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of source spectral slope are unlikely to be good predictors of voice quality...|$|R

40|$|Several {{measures}} in social/personality literature claim to assess gender identity. However, no <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> can predict a person???s self-categorization as female or male???even though self-categorization {{is fundamental to}} self-identity. The Gender Self Overlap Index (GSOI) was developed to measure self-categorization by asking a person to judge their degree of self overlap with multiple gender categories (e. g., female and male). <b>Existing</b> <b>measures</b> rely either on endorsement of gender stereotypes or evaluations of gender in-group members. Using discriminant function analysis we demonstrated that the GSOI is the only measure to predict a person???s self-categorization as female or male in relation to <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of gender role adherence, gender in-group identification, and gender typicality. Importantly, this pattern replicated irrespective of whether respondents identified as transgender or cisgender (i. e., the same birth-assigned gender category and current gender identity). Accordingly, the GSOI measures gender selfcategorization for all experiences of female and male gender identities...|$|R

To build a measurement tool that better meets the requirements of mobile business services, we completed case studies on two mobile business services, one used in passenger transport and the other in construction sites. Based on the understanding gained from the case studies, we propose a list of dimensions and items addressing both usability and productivity aspects that work as the basis for a multidisciplinary measurement tool...|$|R

Our analysis of co-authorship networks dataset suggests significant corre-lation of our proposed new centrality measures (especially weighted networks) than traditional centrality measures with performance of the scholars.
