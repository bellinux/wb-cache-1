5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions {{due to lack of}} disk space, so those instead used an on-disk <b>copy</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hail to the Thief was {{released}} on 9 June 2003 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The CD was printed with <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> in some regions; the Belgian consumer group Test-Achats received complaints that the album could not be played on some CD players. A compilation of Hail to the Thief B-sides, remixes and live performances, COM LAG (2plus2isfive), {{was released}} in April 2004.|$|E
5|$|In previews, {{publications}} such as IGN and GameSpot {{noted that}} the graphics had been improved, {{and that there were}} many new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity to back up the simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story. Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection, in addition to the <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game until two months after release.|$|E
50|$|Earliest demos were {{typically}} made in machine code monitors, the same {{programs that were}} used by the crackers to crack <b>copy</b> <b>protections.</b> The next step was the transition from monitors to assemblers.|$|R
5000|$|Due to new <b>copy</b> <b>protections</b> {{that have}} come along since the final edition of DVD Shrink backups may need the help {{of one or more}} other {{programs}} such as DVD Decrypter, DVDFab, DVD43 or AnyDVD ...|$|R
50|$|The 1571 is not 100% {{low-level}} {{compatible with}} the 1541, however this isn't a problem except in some software that uses advanced <b>copy</b> <b>protections</b> such as the RapidLok system found on Microprose and Accolade games.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital <b>Copy</b> <b>protection</b> that tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to rip discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled A Good Day to Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS), {{developed by}} Blizzard Entertainment {{and published by}} Blizzard and Interplay Productions. The MS-DOS version was released on 23 November 1994 and the Macintosh version in early 1996. Sales were fairly high, reviewers were mostly impressed, and the game won three awards and was a finalist for three others. There was a CD re-release, namely version 1.21 (CD version), that didn't have the word-from-the-user-manual <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> of prior versions. The sequel, , became the main rival to Westwood Studios' Command & Conquer series, and this competition fostered an RTS boom {{in the mid to}} late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The initial Windows {{release was}} criticized by players for several {{perceived}} shortcomings. The game was shipped with SecuROM <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> that required activation from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported {{as the reason}} for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia. Players found that the SecuROM limited the number of times the game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase the activation count to five, and later offer a tool that allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own. Ultimately 2K Games removed the activation limit, though retail versions of the game still required the activation process. Levine admitted that their initial approach to the activation process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.|$|E
25|$|Cracks - Cracked applications: A {{modified}} executable or more (usually one) {{and/or a}} library (usually one) or more and/or a patch designed {{to turn a}} trial version of a software package into the full version and/or bypass <b>copy</b> <b>protections.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 4, 2005, Lightning UK! {{continued}} {{the development of}} the burning engine used by DVD Decrypter in his new tool, ImgBurn. However, for legal reasons, ImgBurn does not have the ability to circumvent <b>copy</b> <b>protections</b> of encrypted DVDs.|$|R
50|$|Maisy was {{released}} on VHS in the UK from 1999 until 2003, at which point it was replaced with DVD releases. Universal Studios Home Video released several Maisy VHSs in the US, most of them with the Macrovision <b>copying</b> <b>protection</b> system.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, {{which describes}} secrets {{relating to the}} game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. The package also included a translation decoder wheel. After the title screen, a <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> screen was displayed consisting of two pictures and a line. The player was required to use the decoder wheel to line up the pictures, then enter the word revealed on the decoder wheel. After three unsuccessful attempts, the game automatically shut down.|$|E
5|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum was {{released}} for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in North America on August 25, 2009, and on August 28 in Europe and Australia. It {{was released}} for Microsoft Windows in North America on September 15, 2009, and on September 18 in Europe and Australia. A Game of the Year edition {{was released on}} March 26, 2010, in Europe and on May 11 in North America. Feral Interactive developed an Mac OS X version, which was released on disc and as a download on November 3, 2011. On the Windows version of the game, the developers used an anti-duplication measure that disables Batman's glide ability and causes other bugs, preventing copied games from progressing beyond a certain point. Although not the first game to implement such countermeasures, Arkham Asylum received media coverage, as this {{was seen as a}} novel method of <b>copy</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2005 Sony BMG CD <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> scandal {{started when}} {{security}} researcher Mark Russinovich revealed on October 31, 2005 that Sony's Extended <b>Copy</b> <b>Protection</b> ("XCP") <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> software on the CD Get Right with the Man by Van Zant contained hidden files that could damage the operating system, install spyware {{and make the}} user's computer vulnerable to attack when the CD was played on a Microsoft Windows-based PC. Sony then released a software patch to remove XCP.|$|E
50|$|Trace vector decoder is {{a system}} that uses a microprocessor's trace mode to decode {{encrypted}} code just-in-time before it is executed and possibly re-encrypt it after the execution. It can be used to enforce <b>copy</b> <b>protections</b> for some computer systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{versions of}} Pirates! sported both disk and manual <b>copy</b> <b>protections.</b> Users were asked {{the time at}} which various treasure ships were arriving at the port. If the time was wrong, the game would continue, but {{at a much higher}} difficulty level that would frustrate most people.|$|R
5000|$|Under United States federal law, {{making a}} backup {{copy of a}} DVD-Video or an audio CD by a {{consumer}} is legal under fair use protection. However, this provision of United States law conflicts with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act prohibition of so-called [...] "circumvention measures" [...] of <b>copy</b> <b>protections.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} PC {{release from}} 1994 was distributed on floppy disks and requires the player to enter <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> codes from a provided booklet.

25|$|In Europe, BMG {{created a}} minor scandal in 2001 when it {{released}} Natalie Imbruglia's second album, White Lilies Island, without warning labels {{stating that the}} CD had <b>copy</b> <b>protection.</b> The CDs were eventually replaced. BMG and Sony both released copy-protected versions of certain releases in certain markets in late 2001, and a late 2002 report indicated that all BMG CDs sold in Europe would {{have some form of}} <b>copy</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sony BMG in Australia {{released}} {{a press release}} indicating that no Sony BMG titles manufactured in Australia have <b>copy</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Slysoft's AnyDVD program, which removes <b>copy</b> <b>protections</b> {{from both}} {{standard}} and hi-definition video discs, also defeats DRM on audio CDs. When active and an audio CD is inserted, AnyDVD blocks the PC from accessing any session but the audio; rendering data sessions unreadable and preventing {{the installation of}} malware such as XCP.|$|R
5000|$|On April 23, 2006 CNET {{reported}} that Smith was introducing {{a bill that}} [...] "would expand the DMCA's restrictions on software that can bypass <b>copy</b> <b>protections</b> and grant federal police more wiretapping and enforcement powers". The move sparked a negative response among technology enthusiasts {{in opposition to the}} Digital Millennium Copyright Act.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in some regions with the <b>Copy</b> Control <b>protection</b> system.|$|R
25|$|Ultima VI {{introduced}} a more systematic use of <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> {{in the form}} of in-game questions, preventing the player from progressing any further if the questions were answered incorrectly. In Ultima VII, this practice was continued, although in both games the player had an unlimited number of tries to answer the questions correctly. Answers could be obtained by consulting the manual or cloth map, although the manual released with the Ultima Collection contained all <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> answers for every game.|$|E
25|$|In addition, several SonyBMG titles whose regular editions include <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> {{programs}} (such as XCP and SunnComm) did not {{feature the}} software on the DualDisc versions.|$|E

25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called robust if it resists a designated class of transformations. Robust watermarks {{may be used}} in <b>copy</b> <b>protection</b> applications to carry copy and no access control information.|$|E
50|$|<b>Copy</b> <b>protections</b> can {{use these}} fields as a {{distinctive}} feature by purposely crafting sectors with improper EDC/ECC fields during manufacture. The protection software tries to read those sectors, awaiting read-errors. As early generations of end-user soft/hardware {{were not able}} to generate sectors with illegal structural information, this feature could not be re-generated with such soft/hardware. If the sectors forming the distinctive feature have become readable, the medium is presumed to be a copy.|$|R
