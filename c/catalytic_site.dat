25|$|Liver cells {{express the}} transmembrane enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>site</b> is {{found on the}} lumenal face of the membrane, and removes the phosphate group from glucose-6-phosphate produced during glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Free glucose is transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum via GLUT7 and released into the bloodstream via GLUT2 for uptake by other cells. Muscle cells lack this enzyme, so myofibers use glucose-6-phosphate in their own metabolic pathways such as glycolysis. Importantly, this prevents myocytes from releasing glycogen stores they have obtained into the blood.|$|E
25|$|Given that DNA and RNA polymerases both {{carry out}} template-dependent {{nucleotide}} polymerization, {{it might be}} expected that {{the two types of}} enzymes would be structurally related. However, x-ray crystallographic studies of both types of enzymes reveal that, other than containing a critical Mg2+ ion at the <b>catalytic</b> <b>site,</b> they are virtually unrelated to each other; indeed template-dependent nucleotide polymerizing enzymes seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells. One lineage led to the modern DNA Polymerases and reverse transcriptases, as well as to a few single-subunit RNA polymerases from viruses. The other lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases.|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophage T 7 DNA helicase is a {{ring-shaped}} hexamer that catalyzes duplex DNA unwinding using dTTP hydrolysis as {{an energy}} source. Of the six potential nucleotide binding {{sites on the}} hexamer, {{we have found that}} three are noncatalytic sites and three are <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites.</b> The noncatalytic sites bind nucleotides with a high affinity, but dTTPs bound to these sites do not dissociate or hydrolyze through many dTTPase turnovers at the <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites.</b> The <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> show strong cooperativity which leads to sequential binding and hydrolysis of dTTP. The elucidated dTTPase mechanism of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> of T 7 helicase is remarkably similar to the binding change mechanism of the ATP synthase. Based on the similarity, a general mechanism for hexameric helicases is proposed. In this mechanism, an F 1 -ATPase-like rotational movement around the single-stranded DNA, which is bound through the central hole of the hexamer, is proposed to lead to unidirectional translocation along single-stranded DNA and duplex DNA unwinding...|$|R
25|$|The boron atom in bortezomib binds the <b>catalytic</b> <b>site</b> of the 26S {{proteasome}} {{with high}} affinity and specificity. In normal cells, the proteasome regulates protein expression and function by degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and also cleanses the cell of abnormal or misfolded proteins. Clinical and preclinical data support {{a role in}} maintaining the immortal phenotype of myeloma cells, and cell-culture and xenograft data support a similar function in solid tumor cancers. While multiple mechanisms {{are likely to be}} involved, proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, thereby triggering programmed cell death in neoplastic cells. Recently, it was found that bortezomib caused a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides that are produced by the proteasome. Some intracellular peptides {{have been shown to be}} biologically active, and so the effect of bortezomib on the levels of intracellular peptides may contribute to the biological and/or side effects of the drug.|$|E
25|$|As {{typical for}} the CMGC kinase group, the <b>catalytic</b> <b>site</b> of MAP kinases {{has a very}} loose {{consensus}} sequence for substrates. Like all their relatives, they only require the target serine / threonine amino acids {{to be followed by}} a small amino acid, preferably proline ("proline-directed kinases"). But as SP/TP sites are extremely common in all proteins, additional substrate-recognition mechanisms have evolved to ensure signaling fidelty. Unlike their closest relatives, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), where substrates are recognized by the cyclin subunit, MAPKs associate with their substrates via auxiliary binding regions on their kinase domains. The most important such region consists of the hydrophobic docking groove and the negatively charged CD-region. Together they recognize the so-called MAPK docking or D-motifs (also called kinase interaction motif / KIM). D-motifs essentially consist of one or two positively charged amino acids, followed by alternating hydrophobic residues (mostly leucines), typically upstream of the phosphorylation site by 10–50 amino acids. Many of the known MAPK substrates contain such D-motifs that can not only bind to, but also provide specific recognition by certain MAPKs. Interestingly, D-motifs are not restricted to substrates: MAP2 kinases also contain such motifs on their N-termini that are absolutely required for MAP2K-MAPK interaction and MAPK activation. Similarly, both dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases and MAP-specific tyrosine phosphatases bind to MAP kinases through the same docking site. D-motifs can even be found in certain MAPK pathway regulators and scaffolds (e.g. in the mammalian JIP proteins).|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the regulation}} of c-Raf activity is complex. As a [...] "gatekeeper" [...] of the ERK1/2 pathway, it is kept in check by a multitude of inhibitory mechanisms, and normally cannot be activated in a single step. The most important regulatory mechanism involves the direct, physical association of the N-terminal autoinhibitory block to the kinase domain of c-Raf. It results in {{the occlusion of the}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>site</b> and full shutdown of kinase activity. This [...] "closed" [...] state can only be relieved if the autoinhibitory domain of Raf engages a partner competing with its own kinase domain, most importantly GTP-bound Ras. Activated small G-proteins can thus break up the intramolacular interactions: this results in a conformational change ("opening") of c-Raf necessary for kinase activation and substrate binding.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Structural {{genomics}} approaches, {{particularly those}} solving the 3 D structures of many proteins with unknown functions, {{have increased the}} desire for structure-based function predictions. However, prediction of enzyme function is difficult because one member of a superfamily may catalyze a different reaction than other members, whereas members of different superfamilies can catalyze the same reaction. In addition, conformational changes, mutations or {{the absence of a}} particular catalytic residue can prevent inference of the mechanism by which catalytic residues stabilize and promote the elementary reaction. A major hurdle for alignment-based methods for prediction of function is the absence (despite its importance) of a measure of similarity of the physicochemical properties of <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites.</b> To solve this problem, the physicochemical features radially distributed around <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> should be considered in addition to structural and sequence similarities. Results We showed that radial distribution functions (RDFs), which are associated with the local structural and physicochemical properties of <b>catalytic</b> active <b>sites,</b> are capable of clustering oxidoreductases and transferases by function. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> of these enzymes were also characterized using the RDFs. The RDFs provided a measure of the similarity among the <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites,</b> detecting conformational changes caused by mutation of catalytic residues. Furthermore, the RDFs reinforced the classification of enzyme functions based on conventional sequence and structural alignments. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the application of RDFs provides advantages in the functional classification of enzymes by providing information about <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Here we {{describe}} the role of charged amino acids at the <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> of Escherichia coli ATP synthase. There are four positively charged and four negatively charged residues {{in the vicinity of}} of E. coli ATP synthase <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites.</b> Positive charges are contributed by three arginine and one lysine, while negative charges are contributed by two aspartic acid and two glutamic acid residues. Replacement of arginine with a neutral amino acid has been shown to abrogate phosphate binding, while restoration of phosphate binding has been accomplished by insertion of arginine at the same or a nearby location. The number and position of positive charges plays a critical role in the proper and efficient binding of phosphate. However, a cluster of many positive charges inhibits phosphate binding. Moreover, the presence of negatively charged residues seems a requisite for the proper orientation and functioning of positively charged residues in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites.</b> This implies that electrostatic interactions between amino acids are an important constituent of initial phosphate binding in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites.</b> Significant loss of function in growth and ATPase activity assays in mutants generated through charge modulations has demonstrated that precise location and stereochemical interactions are of paramount importance...|$|R

During steady-state catalysis, the three <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> of F 1 operate in a cooperative fashion such that at every instant each site is in a different conformation corresponding to a different stage along the catalytic cycle. Notwithstanding {{a large amount of}} biochemical and, recently, structural data, we still lack an understanding of how ATP hydrolysis in F 1 is coupled to mechanical motion and how the <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> achieve cooperativity during rotatory catalysis. In this publication, we report combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations of ATP hydrolysis in the βTP and βDP <b>catalytic</b> <b>sites</b> of F 1 -ATPase. Our simulations reveal a dramatic change in the reaction energetics from strongly endothermic in βTP to approximately equienergetic in βDP. The simulations identify the responsible protein residues, the arginine finger αR 373 being the most important one. Similar to our earlier study of βTP, we find a multicenter proton relay mechanism to be the energetically most favorable hydrolysis pathway.
