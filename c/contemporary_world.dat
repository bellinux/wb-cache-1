5|$|Recent {{performances}} often set {{the play}} in the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world.</b> For example, in 1986, the Royal Shakespeare Company set the play in modern Verona. Switchblades replaced swords, feasts and balls became drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo committed suicide by hypodermic needle. In 1997, the Folger Shakespeare Theatre produced a version set in a typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt's death while in class at school.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a <b>contemporary</b> <b>world,</b> {{albeit a}} world of magic and supernatural {{conflict}} behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC Universe, in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there. However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the Endless, and Swamp Thing made appearances.|$|E
40|$|Having {{as subject}} {{the labor market}} {{in the context of}} the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems, this paper aims to make a {{theoretical}} and practical presentation of these concepts, which are relevant for the national and international literature. The first part, dealing with the state-of-the-art of the domain, aims to present these concepts from the perspective of many specialists in this field. The practical part of this article consists in a research based on the presentation of the labor market under the impact of the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems. To support our line of reasoning, in our scientific approach we used a research based on the analysis of secondary sources, and as quantitative methods, we used: the simple linear regression and the public opinion poll. Among the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> issues analyzed using the quantitative methods were: juvenile delinquency, violence against other peoples and population’s poverty rate. The hypothesis of this paper starts from the premise according to which lack of education generates intensification of the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems, especially juvenile delinquency and poverty rate, these two having an impact upon the employment rate of the labor market, because potentially active people are convicted when referring to people above 18 years old and in special educational institutions when referring to people under 18. The most relevant conclusions of the research highlight the fact that between the labor market and the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> problems there is interdependence, and not giving the appropriate importance to the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world’s</b> issues will generate irremediable difficulties in society...|$|R

5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange. Peter then states that it is no {{stranger}} than when Darth Vader from the film franchise Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in the <b>contemporary</b> <b>world</b> as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E
5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following {{the turn of the}} century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly <b>contemporary</b> <b>world.</b> These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, The Peripheral (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E
