In this work, frost growth on a cold, vertical plate in free convection has been experimentally investigated. The cold plate (height H= 95 mm) was placed in a vertical channel (2. 4 m high) open at the top and bottom in order to permit the natural circulation of ambient air. The channel depth S was varied (20, 10 and 6 mm) in order to infer the influence of channel flow area on the free <b>convection</b> <b>frost</b> formation...|$|E

In this paper, frost growth on a cold, vertical plate in free convection has been experimentally investigated. The cold plate (0. 095 m high, 0. 282 m wide) was placed in vertical channels open at the top and bottom in order to permit the natural circulation of ambient air. The channels, rectangular in shape, were 2. 395 m high and 0. 36 m wide, with the depth set equal either to 20 mm, or 10 mm, or 6 mm in order to infer the influence of channel flow area on the natural <b>convection</b> and <b>frost</b> formation.

40|$|A {{physical}} {{model for the}} effective thermal conductivity of water frost is proposed for application to {{the full range of}} frost density. The proposed model builds on the Zehner-Schlunder one-dimensional formulation for porous media appropriate for solid-to-fluid thermal conductivity ratios less than about 1000. By superposing the effects of mass diffusion and eddy convection on stagnant conduction in the fluid, the total effective thermal conductivity of frost is shown to be satisfactorily described. It is shown that the effects of vapor diffusion and eddy <b>convection</b> on the <b>frost</b> conductivity are of the same order. The results also point out that idealization of the frost structure by cylindrical inclusions offers a better representation of the effective conductivity of frost as compared to spherical inclusions. Satisfactory agreement between the theory and the measurements for the effective thermal conductivity of frost is demonstrated {{for a wide range of}} frost density and frost temperature...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. in Mechanical Engineering [...] Texas A&M UniversityAn {{experimental}} study of heat and mass transfer in free convection from a controlled environment to a plate at liquid nitrogen temperature (- 310 ?F) has been made. The temperature of the environment was varied from 36 ?F to 118 ?F and the specific humidity was varied from 15 to 476 grains of moisture per pound of dry air. Tests were conducted on both horizontal and vertical positions of the plate. The total heat transfer rate from the plate was calculated and then the heat transfer rate by <b>convection</b> was computed. <b>Frost</b> surface temperature, mass and thickness data were measured experimentally. Temperature and concentration values inside the boundary layer adjacent to the plate were also measured. Using Newton 1 s Law of convective cooling and Fourier's Law of conductive heat transfer, the values of convective coefficients and frost thermal conductivities were calculated. The heat transfer rate from the plate {{was found to be}} a function of the chamber temperature and humidity. For the range of temperature and humidity under consideration, the heat transfer rate was found to be minimum at some intermediate temperature and humidity. This was {{due to the fact that}} at lower temperatures liquid oxygen was seen to flow along the plate prohibiting normal growth of the frost. The energy was transported through the frost layer not by simple conduction but by some other mechanisms like internal diffusion of water vapor within the frost layer. The temperature boundary layer profile was in good agreement with a parabolic profile. Average Nusselt, Prandtl and Grashof numbers for heat transfer were calculated from, the experimental data for both vertical and horizontal positions of the plate. In the computation of the above mentioned dimensionless groups, the property values were determined at a mean film temperature, which was an arithmatic mean of the frost surface temperature and the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer. The correlations obtained between these dimensionless parameters were in fairly good agreement with the equations available in the literature...|$|R
