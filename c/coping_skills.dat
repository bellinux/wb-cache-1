5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor <b>coping</b> <b>skills</b> or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive <b>coping</b> <b>skills,</b> in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with <b>coping</b> <b>skills</b> through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E

By involving the mediator variable, the mechanism of treatment effect given to the output variable can be explained in more detail. This study aimed to disseminate the use of {{a mediator}} variable in experimental research which is rare used among researchers in Indonesia. Two mediation analysis procedures was applied to analyze the effect of Depression Prevention Training to reduced depression symptoms among adolescents. This study employed pretest–posttest experimental design. Participants were divided into two groups and the treatment was given to the treatment groups. The variable defined as mediator was <b>coping</b> <b>skill.</b> Firstly, Baron-Kenny procedure was employed and then followed by causal analysis procedure.

Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the <b>coping</b> <b>skills</b> most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of <b>coping</b> <b>skills</b> to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of <b>coping</b> <b>skills</b> will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These <b>coping</b> <b>skills</b> will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E

40|$|Background/Objectives: Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} {{is a common}} psychological maladaptation among adolescents after undergoing an earthquake. Knowledge about the prevalence and maintenance of post-traumatic {{stress disorder}} symptoms and the changes of its predictors over time can help medical providers assist adolescent survivors with mitigating long-term impacts. This study examined the changes in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and its relationship with <b>coping</b> <b>skill</b> and locus of control among adolescent earthquake survivors in China. Methodology/Findings: The study used an observational longitudinal design. A total of 1420 adolescents were evaluated twice after the earthquake by using the Post-traumatic stress disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, The Internality, Powerful others and Chance scale and the Coping Styles Scale. The {{results indicated that the}} mean scores of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were decreased significantly and the positive rates of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms also declined remarkably at 17 months compared to the 3 months post-earthquake. Internality locus of control and problem solving <b>coping</b> <b>skill</b> were effective resilient factors for the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, while chance locus of control was a powerful risk factor of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms as well as being female, being injured and property loss.

The present study examined the factors that influence rumination and meaning making using six hypothetical scenarios of various stressful events with specific contexts. Participants (n= 780) completed a questionnaire with one of six hypothetical scenarios. As a result, rumination frequency was high so that evaluation of event threat was high, self-rumination was high, and executive function was low. Also, evaluation of event threat inhibited making meaning, but by mediating rumination, meaning making was promoted...|$|R

Microfiche. x, 122 leaves illThis study {{investigated}} the efficacy of brief training in progressive muscle relaxation and meditation as self-control methods for coping with stress. Individual differences in neuroticism, as well as experimental manipulations of psychological stress, intensity of the stressful stimuli, and type of instruction were also involved in a Training X Neuroticism X Stress X Instruction X Cry Intensity design (4 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2) with repeated measures on the Instruction and Intensity factors. A total of 64 female college students, {{randomly assigned to one}} of four training groups, participated individually in two laboratory sessions and practiced their respective procedures daily during the week between the sessions. The subjects in one experimental group received training in progressive muscle relaxation as an active <b>coping</b> <b>skill,</b> while those in the second experimental group learned a form of meditation as an active <b>coping</b> <b>skill.</b> Subjects in the third group served as controls who were taught identical muscle exercises as the muscle relaxation subjects but without learning to use muscle tension control as a self-relaxation technique. Finally, subjects in the fourth group were controls who practiced sitting quietly for the same period of time and using the method to relax physiological functioning. Each group had equal numbers of high- and low-neuroticism scorers. Each subject experienced either a high or low psychological stress situation, followed by a total of 80 baby cries (40 loud and 40 soft) under two different instructions ("relax" during 40 cries; "pay attention" to 40 cries). The effects of the factors were then evaluated on tonic and phasic autonomic measures and several self-report measures. Although neither muscle relaxation nor meditation resulted in significantly lower autonomic levels than the controls during a relaxation period, the efficacy of brief muscle relaxation training as a <b>coping</b> <b>skill</b> was demonstrated during stressful conditions, relative to one or both of the control groups, and the Meditation group, in terms of reduced autonomic arousal. In contradiction with Eysenck's theory, subjects with low neuroticism scores had significantly higher tonic and phasic autonomic measures than high scorers; in contrast, high-neuroticism scorers had higher self-report ratings on affect states than low scorers. Various interpretations of this discrepancy were presented (e. g., response sets, perceptual differences in recognizing autonomic arousal). It was suggested that the use of more specific individual-difference variables would possible lead to better prediction of autonomic reactivity to stress than a global trait such as neuroticism. The implications of the findings for the treatment of child abusive parents were discussed. Further research involving longer training periods, cognitive variables such as motivation and expectancy of gain, and on the relative efficacy of the combined use of muscle relaxation with a cognitively-oriented approach was recommended...|$|R

25|$|OA {{has been}} an object of feminist {{criticism}} for encouraging bulimic and binge-eating women to accept powerlessness over food. Feminists assert that the perception of powerlessness adversely affects women's struggle for empowerment; teaching people they are powerless encourages passivity and prevents binge eaters and bulimics from developing <b>coping</b> <b>skills.</b> These effects would be most devastating for women who have experienced oppression, distress and self-hatred. Twelve-step programs are described as predominantly male organizations which force female members to accept self-abasement, powerlessness and external focus, and reject responsibility. Surrender is described as women passively submitting their lives to male doctors, teachers and ministers; the feminist view suggests that women focus on pride instead of humility.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas J. D'Zurilla in 1988 defined {{problem solving}} as a “cognitive-affective-behavioral {{process through which}} an {{individual}} (or group) attempts to identify, discover, or invent effective means of coping with problems encountered in every day living”. It is an evolutionary drive for living organisms and an important <b>coping</b> <b>skill</b> for dealing {{with a variety of}} concerns. Problem solving specifically in psychology refers to a state of desire for reaching a definite 'goal' from a present condition that either is not directly moving toward the goal, is far from it, or needs more complex logic for finding a missing description of conditions or steps toward the goal. In each case [...] "where you want to be" [...] is an imagined (or written) state in which you would like to be and the solutions are situation- or context-specific. This process includes problem finding or 'problem analysis', problem shaping, generating alternative strategies, implementation and verification of the selected solution. Distinguished feature of a problem {{is that there is a}} goal to be reached and how you get there depends upon problem orientation (problem-solving <b>coping</b> style and <b>skills)</b> and systematic analysis. The nature of human problem solving processes and methods is a field of study and work for mental health professionals. Methods of studying problem solving include introspection, behaviorism, simulation, computer modeling, and experiment. Social psychologists look into the person-environment relationship aspect of the problem and independent and interdependent problem-solving methods. Problem solving has been defined as a higher-order cognitive process and intellectual function that requires the modulation and control of more routine or fundamental skills.|$|R
