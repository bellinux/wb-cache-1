5|$|Most of the {{buildings}} in Depot Town are two or three stories. At the east end, the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum building is a single story. East of Rice Street, the building facing <b>Cross</b> <b>Street</b> from the north is four stories, while the freighthouse behind it is a single tall story. Toward {{the west end of}} Depot Town, on both sides of <b>Cross</b> <b>Street,</b> there are several one-story structures, which are of more-recent construction than the taller buildings.|$|E
5|$|Past the US 301 intersection, {{the route}} officially becomes MD 313A, {{but is still}} signed as MD 313. It heads west through {{farmland}} before turning north and intersecting MD 290 (Chesterville Road). The two routes continue north together into Galena, where the road becomes Main Street. It passes residences before intersecting MD 213 (Main Street) {{in the center of}} town where MD 313 ends, MD 290 turns east on <b>Cross</b> <b>Street,</b> and MD 213 goes northbound on Main Street and southbound by going west on <b>Cross</b> <b>Street.</b>|$|E
5|$|Continuing east-{{southeast}}erly along Washtenaw Avenue, M-17 {{meets the}} southeast corner of the EMU campus at Oakwood Avenue. The highway follows the southern edge of campus to <b>Cross</b> <b>Street,</b> where the highway splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets. Eastbound M-17 continues along Washtenaw Avenue while westbound traffic follows <b>Cross</b> <b>Street.</b> Eastbound traffic turns southward at Hamilton Street for two blocks before turning east along Michigan Avenue, meeting westbound Bus. US12. The two highway designations merge, running concurrently through downtown Ypsilanti. The section of Michigan Avenue between Hamilton and Huron streets is actually a wrong-way concurrency because although it is a two-way boulevard, the eastbound direction is M-17 and the westbound direction is Bus. US 12. Both directions of traffic for both highways rejoin at Huron Street, as the westbound M-17 traffic uses Huron Street north to <b>Cross</b> <b>Street</b> and westbound Bus. US 12 turns south along Huron Street. Northeast of the Huron Street intersection is Riverside Park. Michigan Avenue forms the extreme southern park boundary just before it crosses the Huron River. At Ecorse Road, M-17 turns south in Ypsilanti Township through a residential area, separating from Bus. US12. Ecorse Road turns east four blocks north of I-94/US12 and runs parallel to the freeway. Past Harris Road, US12 turns northeasterly on a separate expressway. Where it meets Ecorse Road, US12 follows Ecorse Road, replacing M-17. This junction marks the eastern terminus of M-17 west of Willow Run Airport.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plan also}} called for 155 {{orthogonal}} <b>cross</b> <b>streets.</b> The location of the <b>cross</b> <b>streets</b> was fixed at the boundaries of [...] parcels into which the land had previously been divided. The basepoint for the <b>cross</b> <b>streets</b> was First Street: this was a short and inconspicuous street, which still exists, and originally ran from the intersection of Avenue B and Houston Street to {{the intersection of the}} Bowery and Bleecker Street. Peretz Square, a small, narrow triangular park bounded by Houston Street, 1st Street, and First Avenue, is the grid's cornerstone.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{buildings}} of the village were built around the drainage sluice at the Numanspolderdijk (now called Molendijk) and from there the town spread along the Binnenhaven. The main street, Voorstraat, was expanded with several <b>crossing</b> <b>streets.</b> In 1647, {{at the end of}} one of those <b>crossing</b> <b>streets</b> called the Kerkstraat, a church was built.|$|R
5|$|The Temple of Nabu and the Roman theater {{were built}} on the colonnade's {{southern}} side. Behind the theater were a small senate building and the large Agora, with {{the remains of a}} triclinium (banquet room) and the Tariff Court. A <b>cross</b> <b>street</b> at the western end of the colonnade leads to the Camp of Diocletian, built by Sosianus Hierocles (the Roman governor of Syria). Nearby are the Temple of Al-lƒÅt and the Damascus Gate.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town's economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for fresh produce. Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to fertilise the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct. A 1777 map shows the village of <b>Cross</b> <b>Street,</b> {{on the site of}} the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed <b>Cross</b> <b>Street</b> as it expanded.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{building in}} Sale is Eyebrow Cottage. Built around 1670, {{it was originally}} a yeoman farmhouse {{and is one of}} the earliest brick buildings in the area. Its name is derived from the decorative brickwork above the windows. It was built in <b>Cross</b> <b>Street,</b> which at the time was a separate village from Sale. Of the twenty-one conservation areas in Trafford, two are in Sale: Ashton upon Mersey and Brogden Grove.|$|E

5|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of Cross and River Streets stands the Thompson Block, a historic building which was used as barracks in the Civil War. The Thompson Block suffered a bad fire early in the morning on September 23, 2009, and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets, installed shortly after the fire to stabilize the structure, blocked westbound traffic on <b>Cross</b> <b>Street</b> for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and the property owner.|$|E

5|$|Upon leaving Kennedyville, MD 213 {{continues}} {{back into}} agricultural areas. The route makes a {{turn to the}} east, with an old bypassed segment remaining as unsigned MD 855. MD 213 intersects MD 298 (Browntown Road) and resumes northeast and east again. It intersects unsigned MD 449 (Shallcross Wharf Road), which connects to MD 444 (Kentmore Park Road), which MD 213 intersects a short distance later. From here, the route continues east and northeast through more farmland before heading into a mix of farms and woods. The route enters Galena, where it becomes <b>Cross</b> <b>Street.</b> In the center of town, MD 213 meets MD 290 and MD 313 at the intersection with Main Street. Here, MD 290 and MD 313 continue south on Main Street, MD 290 continues east on <b>Cross</b> <b>Street,</b> and MD 213 makes a left turn to head north on Main Street. Main Street passes residences before leaving Galena, where the road becomes Augustine Herman Highway again. The road continues through a mix of farms and woods before reaching Georgetown, where the route passes some homes before crossing the Sassafras River on a drawbridge near a marina.|$|E
5|$|Depot Town {{was created}} after the Ypsilanti Train Depot was opened in 1838. As the {{railroad}} connected Ypsilanti, MI with Detroit, the area surrounding the depot grew. The commercial community known as Depot Town was {{built over the}} thirty years following {{the arrival of the}} railroad, and most of the buildings standing today were built from 1850 to 1880. In the early years, Depot Town included a flour mill, a large farmers' store, an iron foundry, a fire department, a clothing store, and paved streets. Ypsilanti's original city hall and jail were built just across the Huron River from Depot Town on West <b>Cross</b> <b>Street.</b> As the depot was built one mile north of the Chicago Road (now Michigan Avenue), the community of Ypsilanti was split between competing locations.|$|E
5|$|In March 1897 Charles Churchill & Co Ltd was {{put into}} {{voluntary}} liquidation to aid capital restructuring.

5|$|Just east of Bradhurst Avenue, NY141 {{connects to}} the Taconic State Parkway {{by way of a}} partial interchange. The {{junction}} has only two connections; the first links NY141 to the southbound parkway, while the second leads from the northbound direction of the parkway to NY141 via West <b>Cross</b> <b>Street.</b> Continuing eastward, the highway passes under the parkway and enters the commercial center of Hawthorne. Here, NY141 crosses over the Metro-North Railroad before turning northward onto Elwood Avenue. Over the next , NY141 closely parallels the railroad's Harlem Line, serving its Hawthorne station as the road heads north. After three blocks, the road and railroad turn to the northeast and begin to run alongside the Saw Mill River Parkway. Elwood Avenue ends shortly after the curve, giving way to Commerce Street.|$|E
5|$|Tunnels, {{originally}} {{built for}} water drainage, passed beneath the railroad and ran between the Thompson Block and the businesses on <b>Cross</b> <b>Street,</b> and {{were used as}} hiding places by escaped slaves, who hid by day and then rode boats down the Huron River by night. Leonard Chase, a known abolitionist, also operated a station on the Underground Railroad from 1841 to 1860, hiding escaped slaves in his home near the depot. Also during the American Civil War, the Norris Block {{was used as a}} barracks by two regiments: the Fourteenth Michigan Infantry Regiment in early 1862, and the Twenty-Seventh Michigan Infantry Regiment in 1863. Oliver E. Thompson bought the building in 1869, and as it passed down through several generations of the Thompson family, it eventually became known as the Thompson Block.|$|E
5|$|Depot Town is a {{commercial}} area, with some residences above storefronts, in Ypsilanti, Michigan's historic district. Depot Town proper consists of East <b>Cross</b> <b>Street</b> from the Huron River to North River Street, {{and a small}} area on the 300-block of North River Street. However, several blocks in the surrounding area are also {{commonly referred to as}} part of Depot Town. These areas include Riverside Park, Frog Island Park (both of which are on the Huron River), and River Street extending north and south for several blocks. First established in the late 1830s, most of the buildings standing today were constructed between 1850 and 1880. Over the years, Depot Town has included hotels, an Underground Railroad station, an American Civil War barracks, and a building that has housed a bar and restaurant continuously for more than 150 years, switching to soft drinks during Prohibition. Today the area is dominated by restaurants and stores. Depot Town also hosts several large summer festivals each year, as well as weekly bike nights and cruise nights.|$|E

5|$|Route161 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Clifton Avenue and Allwood Road (CR602) in Clifton. The route passes a park and large commercial building at the southern terminus. A short distance after, Route161 provides a connector to Richfield Terrace on the northbound side of the highway, the park's divider known as <b>Cross</b> <b>Street.</b> The highway continues northward, intersecting with Richland Court, which provides access to local residential homes. The next intersection is with Joan Place, which serves a similar function to Richland Court. Soon after, Route161 intersects with Saint Andrew's Boulevard, which also serves as the northern terminus of Richfield Terrace and connects the highway with CR609 (Mount Prospect Avenue). Just past Saint Andrew's Boulevard Route161 passes through a largely commercial section of Clifton with a heavy concentration of medical offices before terminating at an intersection with CR614 (Van Houten Avenue). The right-of-way of Route161 continues as CR611 (Clifton Avenue) towards downtown Clifton.|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} freeway begins, it passes under an extension to the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, {{one of four}} bridges over the Arroyo Seco that predate the parkway's construction. A southbound exit and northbound entrance at Avenue 26 complement the Figueroa Street ramps, and similar ramps connect Pasadena to both directions of I-5. SR 110 continues northeast alongside the Arroyo Seco, passing under the Gold Line light rail and Pasadena Avenue before junctioning Avenue 43 at {{the first of many}} folded diamond interchanges that feature extremely tight (right-in/right-out) curves on the exit and entrance ramps. The next interchange, at Avenue 52, is a normal diamond interchange, and soon after is Via Marisol, where the northbound side has standard diamond ramps, but on the southbound side Avenue 57 acts as a folded diamond connection. The 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge is the second original bridge, and is another folded diamond, with southbound traffic using Shults Street to connect. The 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now Gold Line) lies just beyond, and after that is a half diamond interchange at Marmion Way/Avenue 64 with access towards Los Angeles only. After the freeway passes under the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge, the pre-parkway bridge, southbound connections between the freeway and <b>cross</b> <b>street</b> can be made via Salonica Street. As the Arroyo Seco curves north to pass west of downtown Pasadena, the Arroyo Seco Parkway instead curves east, crossing the stream into South Pasadena. A single northbound offramp on the Los Angeles side of the bridge curves left under the bridge to Bridewell Street, the parkway's west-side frontage road.|$|E
