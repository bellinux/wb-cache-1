40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of bank <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios,</b> {{management}} and performance in the Nigerian commercial bank (1986 - 2006). The objectives of this paper are: to determine to what extent bank <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> impact on bank performance and also to investigate {{the extent to which}} operation expenses has impacted on the return on capital. The study captured their performance indicators and employed cross sectional and time series of bank data obtained from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Annual Report and Financial statements of the sampled banks. The formulated models were estimated using ordinary least square regression method. The overall <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> of the study shows that Shareholders Fund/Total Assets (SHF/TA) which measures <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> of banks (risk of default) have negative impact on ROA. The efficiency of management measured by operating expenses indice is negatively related to return on capital. The implication of this study, among others, is that adequate shareholders fund can serve as a veritable stimulant in strengthening the performance of Nigerian commercial banks and also heighten the confidence of customers especially in this era of global economic melt-down that has taken its toll in the Nigerian financial system.

40|$|The {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> as indicators of bank performance with major focus on determining effectiveness of these <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> in indicating performance of banks. Twelve commercial banks formed the research population with secondary dataset obtained from end of year financial statements and annual reports for the period 2009 to 2012 based on judgemental technique. An explanatory research design was {{used in conjunction with}} an econometric panel regression model to establish the relationships between <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> and bank performance as well as to empirically investigate whether non-risk based capital ratios outperform their risk-weighted counterparts in indicating performance. Panel data obtained was presented in form of tables and was analyzed using regression analysis with the aid of an econometric statistical package. The GLS method used revealed that leverage ratio is more related to commercial bank performance than the risk-weighted ratio and gross revenue ratio is statistically insignificant in indicating bank performance. This relationship brought a revelation that simple measures of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> have better indicative power and provide useful financial information that regulators can use as a starting point in assessing financial condition of banks. For the period under investigation, non-risk based CARs; particularly leverage ratio outperformed the risk-weighted ratio in indicating bank performance in Zimbabwe. Bank regulators and commercial banks themselves can therefore derive substantial benefits from the use of simple capital ratios as a supplementary requirement. Overall, <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> alone were to a lesser extent effective in indicating bank performance pointing to the need to consider other variables that explain performance of banks. Therefore, policymakers should exercise great care not to too heavily rely on a single tool, but balance the benefits and costs of any indicator to leverage other policies at regulatory disposal...|$|R

40|$|Banking {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{regulated}} industries in the world. One major part of the regulation is the <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> regulation which restricts the minimum level of capital banks are required to hold. The best known <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> regulator is the Basel committee on banking supervision which is responsible for the regulation regimes known as Basel I, Basel II and Basel III. Study by Vallascas and Hadendorff (2013) prove that the updated capital ratios in Basel II can explain better the true risk banks face. Due to improved qualities, the ratios should be more useful for investors to be used for market valuation of banks. However, only few researches have been conducted about the market valuation of banks and it is still undiscovered how the changes in <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> affect the valuation. This thesis examines the theoretical and practical value relevance of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> before and after the Basel II implementation in European banks. By value relevance this thesis means the capability to explain the level of market value, not changes in it. This thesis is unique in multiple ways. European banking sector is not widely covered as most of the studies use U. S. data. Also most of the banking valuation models use unweighted capital ratios instead of risk-weighted regulatory ratios and the studies show mixed results on the effect of capital to banks’ Market-to-Book value. Although the changes in regulation have been studied in multiple ways, the value relevance of improved regulation has not been covered. Data for the research is collected from multiple sources and the final data consist of 448 bank-year observations from 41 banks within years 2002 and 2015. In order to compare the effect of the regulatory changes the data is divided into two subsamples, the prior including observations from 2002 to 2004 and the later from 2010 to 2012. Four different methods are used to evaluate the 5 attributes of value relevant performance measure during both subsample periods. The five attributes evaluated are Persistence, Predictability, Predictability of future cash flow, Substitute for cash flow and Timeliness. The models are adjusted from the methods used by Barton et al. (2010) to suit better the <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> measures. Again, four different methods are used to evaluate the practical value relevance of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> from which three are modifications from the model created by Calomiris and Nissim (2014). Dependent variable is the three month-forward Adjusted market value of equity divided by Common equity. The results show that three from the five theoretical value relevance attributes have improved after the regulatory changes. The conclusion is that theoretical value relevance of Tier 1 Capital ratio has improved. The practical value relevance however does not show similar improvements. The correlation between Tier 1 Capital ratio and Adjusted Market-to-Book ratio has increased but the explanatory power of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> shows no improvements. Also the effect of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> to Adjusted Market-to-Book ratio has become lower – even negative – and statistically insignificant.

In the case of regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios,</b> its deterioration had a perverse impact on lending.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades many {{countries}} have liberalised their financial markets. They have attempted to eliminate government intervention in setting interest rate ceilings, erecting entry barriers, interfering in credit allocation decisions, and have begun to privatise their financial institutions (FIs). However, recent banking crises have indicated a link between liberalisation and financial fragility and the subsequent trade-off between the benefits of liberalisation and the costs of increasing financial fragility in developing markets. Recent experiences in Asia have highlighted the importance of the soundness of domestic financial systems especially the need for a prudential regulatory, supervisory, and accounting framework before undertaking financial sector liberalisation. The object of the paper is to provide a link between the relative level of an individual bank's adequacy and its effects on the fragility of the banking system.

We perform a decomposition of the changes in <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>ratios</b> into seven factors to check whether banks adjusted their capital ratio by increasing equity, by reducing loans or securities, or by reducing the riskiness of their assets’ portfolio. We employ consolidated balance sheet data of 257 European banking groups including M&A operations and state aid and covering the 2005 - 2014 period, and find that the main driver alters over time.
