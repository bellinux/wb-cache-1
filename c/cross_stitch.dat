25|$|Unlike woven carpets, {{embroidery}} carpets' are not {{formed on}} a loom. Their pattern is {{established by the}} application of stitches to a cloth (often linen) base. The tent stitch and the <b>cross</b> <b>stitch</b> {{are two of the}} most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the Bradford carpet). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the coat of arms of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. Victorian embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called Berlin wool work, were introduced in Germany in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{structural}} {{analysis of sample}} knitted fabrics and the knit geometric theory, we have built an algorithm that can make three-dimensional structure models for weft knitted fabrics such as welt <b>stitches,</b> tuck <b>stitches,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>stitches,</b> rib stitches and purl stitches. In order to reduce computational complexity, we have set the anchoring point on the diametral plane of yarn in the knitting chart. Drawing from the beginning knitting point to the finished knitting point, a smooth knit curve model can be obtained with the cardinal spline curve. Using this algorithm, we have developed the weft knit three-dimensional structure modeling software that can display the three-dimensional model of knitted fabrics including welt stitches; tuck <b>stitches,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>stitches,</b> rib stitches and purl stitches. Our work confirms 3 -D modeling of three foundation knits of weft knit (plain stitches, purl stitches, rib stitches), tuck stitches, welt <b>stitches</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>stitches</b> with a commercially available PC. This software {{can be used by}} someone with no understanding of knitting to gain an understanding of the knitting process, and determine the structure of a knitted fabric product. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

60|$|L. Well, {{the rocks}} don't {{seem to think}} that: but {{the same thing happens}} to them continually. I told you they were full of rents, or veins. Large masses of {{mountain}} are sometimes as full of veins as your hand is; and of veins nearly as fine (only you know a rock vein does not mean a tube, but a crack or cleft). Now these clefts are mended, usually, with the strongest material the rock can find; and often literally with threads; for the gradually opening rent seems to draw the substance it is filled with into fibers, which cross from one side of it to the other, and are partly crystalline; so that, when the crystals become distinct, the fissure has often exactly the look of a tear, brought together with strong <b>cross</b> <b>stitches.</b> Now when this is completely done, and all has been fastened and made firm, perhaps some new change of temperature may occur, and the rock begin to contract again. Then the old vein must open wider; or else another open elsewhere. If the old vein widen, it MAY do so at its center; but it constantly happens, with well filled veins, that the <b>cross</b> <b>stitches</b> are too strong to break; the walls of the vein, instead, are torn away by them: and another little supplementary vein--often three or four successively--will be thus formed {{at the side of the}} first.|$|R
