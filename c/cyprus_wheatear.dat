50|$|The song-perches {{utilised}} by {{this species}} are high for a wheatear, typically being 5 to 10 metres above ground. It often breeds in woodland habitats, unlike other wheatears (Oliver 1990 {{suggested that it}} occupies the ecological niche used elsewhere in the Western Palearctic by the common redstart). It is the most arboreal species of wheatear in the western palearctic and it uses often aerial sallying and perch-pounce-feeding tactics. Recent work suggest an ecological differentiation between <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wheatear</b> and migrating northern wheatears O. oenanthe and black-eared wheatears O. hispanica melanoleuca. <b>Cyprus</b> <b>wheatear</b> uses more aerial sallying and occupies more forested habitats, but needs a minimum amount of open/bare ground, and a minimum of high bush/tree vegetation (Randler et al. 2009).|$|E

40|$|Long-distance migratory flights with {{multiple}} stop-overs, multiple wintering sites, and small-scale connectivity in Afro-Palearctic migrants {{are likely to}} increase their vulnerability to environmental change and lead to declining populations. Here we present the migration tracks and wintering locations of the first six <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatears</b> to be tracked with geolocators: a species with high survival and a stable population. We therefore predicted a non-stop flight from Cyprus to sub-Saharan wintering grounds, a single wintering area for each individual and {{a wide spread of}} wintering locations representing low migratory connectivity at the population level. The sub-Saharan wintering grounds in South Sudan, Sudan and Ethiopia were likely reached by a single flight of an average straight-line distance of 2, 538 km in ca. 60 hours, with an average minimum speed of 43. 1 km h- 1. The high speed of migration probably ruled out stop-overs greater than a few hours. <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatears</b> migrated from <b>Cyprus</b> in mid-late October and most probably remained at a single location throughout winter; three out of five birds with available data may have used a second site < 100 km away during February; all returned between the 7 – 22 nd March when accurate geolocation data are not possible due to the equinox. Wintering locations were spread over at least 950 km. There were no tag effects on survival. <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatears</b> showed a migratory strategy in accordance with their observed high survival rate and demonstrated a routine flight range that allows much of the Mediterranean and the Sahara to be crossed in a rapid two and a half-day flight.

40|$|Many {{populations of}} European migrant bird species are declining {{and this may}} be driven by {{survival}} rates but there are few studies that can estimate true survival rates. <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatears</b> Oenanthe cypriaca are an endemic migrant that winter in East Africa: populations are probably not declining but are annually variable. We measured their apparent survival by recording territory occupation and reoccupation in a colour-ringed population of 45 - 69 pairs over a 4 year period (2010 - 2013) from April – August, to determine how it varied with sex, age and year. We then estimated true survival by correcting apparent survival for dispersal by recording territory shifts and how this also varied by sex, age and year. Apparent annual survival rate varied significantly by sex, age and year (males 2011, 2012, 2013 : 0. 70, 0. 50, 0. 62; females: 0. 56, 0. 34, 0. 47; chicks: 0. 35, 0. 19, 0. 28) but was not affected by the productivity of territory. An average of 1. 1 % of males and 8. 2 % of females were lost during breeding, where 5 / 7 lost females were found depredated during incubation. Adults did not usually change territories between years (87 % resident and 99 % moved less than 4 territories between years) regardless of sex, productivity or year; chicks, independent of their sex, moved on average three territories away from their natal territory. After correcting apparent survival for the probability of dispersal, males had the highest true minimum annual survival compared to females which were very similar to chicks (males 2011, 2012, 2013 : 0. 77, 0. 50, 0. 65; females: 0. 65, 0. 35, 0. 50; chicks: 0. 64, 0. 34, 0. 49). The results indicate a very high survival rate for a small passerine migrant, although they are probably sufficiently annually variable to profoundly affect annual population dynamics. If females have lower survival, sex ratio at birth may be female biased to compensate; alternatively females may have longer range dispersal than we could measure, particularly if they respond to their mates not returning by moving territories, leading to an underestimate of their true survival. High survival {{may be due to the}} rarity of sparrowhawks on <b>Cyprus</b> and the <b>wheatears</b> relatively short distance migration. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Cyprus</b> <b>{{wheatear}}</b> or Cyprus {{pied wheatear}} (Oenanthe cypriaca) is a small, 14-15 cm long passerine bird that was formerly classed {{as a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It was formerly treated as a subspecies (race) of pied wheatear but Sluys and van den Berg (1982) argued that the form deserved full species status, on the basis of differences in biometrics and especially song, and the lack of sexual plumage dimorphism in cypriaca.|$|E
40|$|Migrant birds may be {{vulnerable}} to climate change {{at different stages of}} their annual cycles especially on the breeding grounds, where changes in phenology may affect their ability to synchronise breeding with the peak of resources availability. Understanding how phenology of breeding, survival and productivity varies between and within years is therefore crucial to understand migrant population dynamics. This thesis describes this variation in the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatear</b> Oenanthe cypriaca, with particular emphasis on a colour-ringed population at Troodos, Cyprus, 2010 - 2012. Our results suggest that the phenology of breeding of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatear</b> is variable with breeding onset and number of breeding attempts probably varying with annual temperature variation. Minimum true survival rates were very high for a small passerine migrant, although they were probably sufficiently annually variable to profoundly affect annual population dynamics. For productivity, nest survival was very high and did not vary between years, or nesting attempts, or with clutch initiation date but it was significantly higher in the chick stage versus the egg stage. Post-fledging survival in the first 4 weeks was very high. Renesting probability was significantly different in all years, yet total productivity per pair was the same in each of three years. Cyprus Wheatears at Troodos showed such high productivity and survival that the population must be a major source population and this was reflected in the very high density of breeding pairs at the study site. Finally we used altitude as a proxy for variation in temperature and investigated how abundance, productivity and phenology in Cyprus Wheatears varied between and within years, from sea level to 1952 m, using transect surveys to record breeding birds across Cyprus. Cyprus Wheatears were common in all habitats and altitudes; altitudinal temperature variation probably affected the occurrence of double brooding and so the timing of chick production, but not the onset of breeding. The results suggest that Cyprus Wheatears are already very well adapted to high variation in temperature within and between seasons, changing investment accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Analysing {{companion}} {{species from}} unrelated taxa concentrated so far mainly on identifying biosurrogacy in terms ofconservation biology. No study has investigated companion bird and plant species to predict breeding and migranthabitats {{of a bird}} genus. In this study we recorded and analysed companion bird and plant species of the breeding birdCyprus Wheatear Oenanthe cypriaca and four migranting Oenanthe species on Cyprus. We found characteristic companionspecies in Cyprus Wheatear’s, Wheatear migrant’s and in control habitats where no Wheatears were present. We show that plant and bird companion species {{can be used as}} discriminating factors to predict breeding and migranthabitats of the genus Oenanthe on Cyprus. Furthermore, habitat preferences of Cyprus Wheatear’s companion speciesindicate bushy and vegetation rich habitats avoiding woodland {{on the one hand and}} managed farmland on the otherhand. In comparison, migrant Wheatear and control habitats were characterised by companion species pointing to ahigh openness. These results support former habitat descriptions of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatear</b> and migrant Wheatears. In moregeneral, this study shows that companion species from unrelated taxa can be used to predict breeding and migranthabitats of a bird genus...|$|E
40|$|Population {{dynamics}} of annually breeding bird species depend crucially on productivity, {{and so this}} variation can {{help us understand the}} causes of declines in migrant birds. We investigated variation in annual productivity 2010 – 2012 in the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Wheatear</b> Oenanthe cypriaca, a small endemic migrant passerine at the National Forest Park (NFP) of Troodos. Clutch size for first nests was usually five, although 0. 40 eggs lower in 2011. Nest survival did not vary with year, nesting attempt, or clutch initiation date, but was significantly higher in the chick (0. 96; 0. 88 – 0. 98, 95 % CI) versus the egg stage (0. 74; 0. 62 – 0. 83, 95 % CI). The number of chicks fledged from a successful nest varied with nest type—with first nests and second nests after failure being similar producing ~ 3 – 4. 5 chicks dependent on year, and with second nests after success producing ~ 2 chicks, independent of year. There were only weak positive or negative effects of clutch initiation date dependent on year, controlling for nest type, and no effects of male age on productivity. After fledging, chicks had a > 95 % chance of surviving the first month, but with a greater probability of one or rarely two chicks per brood dying if fledged later in the season. Renesting rate was significantly different in all years (26, 48, and 78 % renesting) : 2010 had a much lower renesting rate after success with very few second broods (29 versus 76 % and 73 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively). Overall productivity per territory did not vary with year with 3. 96 ± 0. 09 SE chicks alive 1 month after fledging. Cyprus Wheatears showed several unusual breeding parameters including a highly variable renesting probability, high nestling, and very high fledgling survival, resulting in exceptionally high productivity. This may be because renesting is constrained by high mid-summer temperatures and low abundance of chick predators. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
