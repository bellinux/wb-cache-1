40|$|Enterprises are now {{connected}} internally and externally {{to other}} Enterprises via the Internet {{in ways that}} are increasingly difficult to manage, especially as these interconnections become more dynamic. Current methods of coordinating the effects of change as they propagate through these networks of connections are not likely to scale. What is needed is a new paradigm for how the Internet supports such coordination. Indeed, the Internet should and could provide fundamental <b>coordination</b> <b>functions</b> that are missing today. In this paper, we describe how such a “Coordinated Internet” would work (this paper is an expanded version of [1]). The key functionality of a Coordinated Internet would be that the Internet actively watches what people do (analogous to search completion on desktops today), correlates these activities, and actively notifies people when and how their current tasks affect and are affected by the activities of other people. This would be accomplished by standard <b>coordination</b> <b>functions</b> implemented as a common Internet layer that {{can be used as a}} utility by more specialized applications. Such a Coordinated Internet would revolutionize enterprise management, for all enterprises, large and small, corporate and personal. For example, static workflows would become obsolete for all but the the most routine processes. Some solutions provide existence proofs of such a coordination substrate, such as the Redux solution in concurrent engineering, which we describe herein. However, foundational research remains to be done in the new field of Coordination Engineering in order to reach the goal of a future Internet in which <b>coordination</b> <b>functions</b> are fundamental...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} 802.11 MAC defines another <b>coordination</b> <b>function</b> {{called the}} point <b>coordination</b> <b>function</b> (PCF). This {{is available only}} in [...] "infrastructure" [...] mode, where stations {{are connected to the}} network through an Access Point (AP). This mode is optional, and only very few APs or Wi-Fi adapters actually implement it. APs send beacon frames at regular intervals (usually every 0.1024 second). Between these beacon frames, PCF defines two periods: the Contention Free Period (CFP) and the Contention Period (CP). In the CP, DCF is used. In the CFP, the AP sends Contention-Free-Poll (CF-Poll) packets to each station, one at a time, to give them the right to send a packet. The AP is the coordinator. Although this allows for a better management of QoS, PCF does not define classes of traffic as is common with other QoS systems (e.g. 802.1p and DiffServ).|$|E

50|$|Short Interframe Space (SIFS), is {{the amount}} of time in microseconds {{required}} for a wireless interface to process a received frame and to respond with a response frame. It is the difference in time between the first symbol of the response frame in the air and the last symbol of the received frame in the air. A SIFS time consists of the delay in receiver RF, PLCP delay and the MAC processing delay, which depends on the physical layer used. In IEEE 802.11 networks, SIFS is the interframe spacing prior to transmission of an acknowledgment, a Clear To Send (CTS) frame, a block ack frame that is an immediate response to either a block ack request frame or an A-MPDU, the second or subsequent MPDU of a fragment burst, a station responding to any polling a by point <b>coordination</b> <b>function</b> and during contention free periods of point <b>coordination</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
50|$|Point <b>coordination</b> <b>function</b> (PCF) is a Media Access Control (MAC) {{technique}} used in IEEE 802.11 based WLANs. It resides in a point coordinator {{also known as}} Access Point (AP), to coordinate the communication within the network. The AP waits for PIFS duration rather than DIFS duration to grasp the channel. PIFS is less than DIFS duration and hence the point coordinator always has the priority to access the channel.|$|E

We model the basic DCF (CSMA/CA) protocol, the DCF protocol with RTS/CTS (MACA), and the PCF protocol. Analyses show the fol-lowing safety results: the CSMA/CA protocol is free from deadlocks and non-executable transitions, the MACA has a potential livelock, but is free from deadlocks and non-executable transitions, and the PCF protocol is free from deadlocks and non-executable transitions.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{effective}} Medium Access Control protocol for ad hoc network {{is a highly}} challenging task due to the characteristics of such networks. The medium is shared and unreliable by definition, thus the access mechanism should be robust to channel errors and collisions. Furthermore, all the <b>coordination</b> <b>functions</b> must be totally distributed in a pure ad hoc environment. In this paper we {{address the issue of}} designing an effective MAC protocol for Inter Vehicular Communications (IVC) networks with a particular focus on broadcast services and topology control capabilities. ...|$|R
50|$|Although CSMA/CA {{has been}} used in a variety of wired {{communication}} systems, it is particularly beneficial in a wireless LAN due to a common problem of multiple stations being able to see the Access Point, but not each other. This is due to differences in transmit power, and receive sensitivity, as well as distance, and location with respect to the AP. This will cause a station to not be able to 'hear' another station's broadcast. This is the so-called 'hidden node', or 'hidden station' problem. Devices utilizing 802.11 based standards can enjoy the benefits of collision avoidance (RTS / CTS handshake, also Point <b>coordination</b> <b>function),</b> although they do not do so by default. By default they use a Carrier sensing mechanism called 'exponential backoff', or (Distributed <b>coordination</b> <b>function)</b> that relies upon a station attempting to 'listen' for another station's broadcast before sending. CA, or PCF relies upon the AP (or the 'receiver' for Ad hoc networks) granting a station the exclusive right to transmit for a given period of time after requesting it (Request to Send / Clear to Send).|$|E

We find that control provisions increase competence-based trust, but reduce goodwill-based trust, resulting in a net decrease in the likelihood of continued collaboration.
