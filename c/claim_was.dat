5|$|Sigurd Slembe: His {{mother was}} Tora Saxesdatter from Vik; his <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> not {{recognised}} (by Harald Gille).|$|E
5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest seams of silver ore in what would become Nevada, and because their <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> close to the surface, it was easily extracted without initial capital investment. The Bowers Mining Company quickly made Eilley and Sandy very wealthy.|$|E
5000|$|Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, [...] FAA {{requires}} that parallel {{state and federal}} <b>claims</b> <b>be</b> bifurcated when federal <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> non-arbitrable but state <b>claims</b> <b>are.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of 19 November 2013, 43,068 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> filed, 11,619 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> denied, 748 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> pending and 30,701 were awarded. These numbers did {{not include}} the Marshall Islands.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all these}} defences are {{available}} to all restitutionary claims. The availability of a defence may turn on: whether a restitutionary <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> legal or equitable; whether a <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> for a personal or proprietary remedy; and whether the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> brought under national or EU law.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{apparent}} {{changes in}} the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972, Peter van de Kamp proposed that an unseen companion with an orbital period of 25years was causing gravitational perturbations in its position. This <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> refuted in 1993 by Wulff-Dieter Heintz and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in the photographic plates.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{after working}} as an equity trader at Kidder Peabody, Fletcher filed a lawsuit in New York state court for {{employment}} racial discrimination. The New York Court of Appeals ruled that Fletcher's claim must be arbitrated. In a NYSE arbitration, Fletcher was awarded $1.26 million, and in a subsequent arbitration, the racial discrimination <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, American {{scientists}} at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og. These parent nuclei {{were reported to have}} successively emitted seven alpha particles to form 265Rf nuclei, but their <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> retracted in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Statistics {{released}} by the USPTO for reexaminations {{for the period of}} 1981 to 2007 showed that for ex parte reexaminations, <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> changed in average 64% of the cases. In 26% of the cases, all <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> confirmed with no changes, while in 10% of the cases, all <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> invalidated. For inter partes reexaminations, <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> changed in seven of the eight cases that had been completed by the time the statistics were released.|$|R
2500|$|In Chapters 7, 12, and 13, {{creditors}} must file a [...] "proof of claim" [...] to get paid. In a Chapter 11 case, a creditor is {{not required}} to file a proof of <b>claim</b> (that <b>is,</b> a proof of <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> [...] "deemed filed") if the creditor's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> listed on the debtor's bankruptcy schedules, unless the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> scheduled as [...] "disputed, contingent, or unliquidated." [...] If the creditor's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> not listed on the schedules in a Chapter 11 case, the creditor must file a proof of claim.|$|R
40|$|Until recently, obstetric <b>claims</b> (which <b>are</b> {{invariably}} high-value) {{used to be}} {{clustered around}} problems related to labour. However, a second group of high-value <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> emerging: those related to missed abnormaltities. The value of <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> now so high that a single individual is unable to compensate a claimant adequately, and indemnity is therefore essential. Although such <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> relatively rare, indemnity costs are high as the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> large. The high value of obstetric claims, including those for missed abnormalities, {{is reflected in the}} cost of indemnity for obstetricians and those performing antenatal ultrasound...|$|R
5|$|In March 2009, Gillan {{claimed that}} prior to the 1993 reunion of the band, Blackmore had {{requested}} $250,000 be deposited in his bank account in order for him {{to continue with the}} reunion. The other members of the band did not receive anything. This <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> subsequently denied by Blackmore's solicitor in a statement released soon after.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 Drax Group and Infinis began a {{legal action}} against the UK {{government}} due to claimed insufficient notice being given about the withdrawal of a climate related tax exemption (see Climate Change Levy) – Drax claimed the change would reduce its earnings by £30million. The <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> rejected by the High Court in February 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{counties}} final {{argument was}} that the Oneida's land <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> a nonjusticiable political question. The Court found this argument to be non-meritorious in light of similar Indian law precedents.|$|E

25|$|However, Nayachandra's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> not {{supported}} by any other literary or epigraphic evidence. Therefore, the historical accuracy of this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> doubtful.|$|R
40|$|The {{communicative}} action {{theory of}} Habermas {{has been discussed}} and used within the research community of Language Action Perspective. The concept of validity <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be an}} important contribution. In his theory, Habermas has formulated three validity <b>claims</b> to <b>be</b> universal in communication: The claims for truth, rightness and truthfulness. A theoretical inquiry into the validity claim concept and the three validity <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> performed in the paper. A critical analysis is pursued based on communication examples from Habermas. The concept of universal validity <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> transformed to general communication claims. The truth <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> rejected as universal. Besides the claims emanating from Habermas several other general communication <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> formulated: Descriptive correctness, addressee relevance, respectfulness, deliberation, dialogical adequacy and argumentativeness. ...|$|R
5|$|This was contested by RSAF Enfield, which quite firmly {{stated that}} the Enfield No. 2 Mk I was {{designed}} by Captain Boys (the Assistant Superintendent of Design, later of Boys Anti-Tank Rifle fame) with assistance from Webley & Scott, {{and not the other}} way around. Accordingly, their <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> denied.|$|E
5|$|A second {{demonstration}} ran between 15 December 2009 and February 2010 at the Waterways Visitor Centre in Dublin, and was streamed via Steorn's website. The demonstration was of {{a device}} powered by a rechargeable battery. Steorn said that the device produced more energy than it consumed and recharged the battery. No substantive details of the technology were revealed and no independent evidence of Steorn's <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> provided.|$|E
5|$|Agents of Repression (1988), co-authored by Jim Vander Wall, {{describes}} what the authors <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> a secret {{war against the}} Black Panther Party and American Indian Movement carried out during the late 1960s and '70s by the FBI under the COINTELPRO program. The COINTELPRO Papers (1990; reissued 2002), also co-authored with Jim Vander Wall, examines a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau's activities against various leftist groups, from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Pyrrhonian moral {{skepticism}} {{holds that}} the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> true or that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> false. Thus, {{in addition to being}} agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).|$|R
50|$|The <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> either {{approved}} or denied at the DDS for disability qualification. The <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> {{then returned}} to the originating SSA office to finish processing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Claims</b> <b>are</b> {{made that}} MISS has better {{outcomes}} than open surgery {{with respect to}} fewer complications and shorter hospital stays, but data supporting those <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> weak.|$|R
5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> based on {{a version of the}} late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|Asser is {{sometimes}} {{cited as a}} source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire Life is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.|$|E
5|$|Because of Kilmer's close {{identification}} with Roman Catholicism and his correspondence with many priests and theologians, a tree located near a grotto {{dedicated to the}} Virgin Mary at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, has been asserted as {{the inspiration for the}} poem. According to Dorothy Corson, the <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> first made by a priest named Henry Kemper. There are several accounts that Kilmer visited the campus of Notre Dame to lecture and to visit friends, but none of these accounts or occasions date before 1914.|$|E
2500|$|Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee echoed {{that fewer}} <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> {{expected}} through the EQC than for 2010. In the 2010 earthquake, 180,000 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> processed {{as opposed to}} the expected 130,000 claims for the 2011 aftershock. The total number of claims for the two events was expected to be 250,000, as Brownlee explained that many of the <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> [...] "overlapping".|$|R
5000|$|Finally, Noncognitivism {{holds that}} we can never know that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> true because moral <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> {{incapable}} of being true or false (they are not truth-apt). Instead, moral <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> imperatives (e.g. [...] "Don't steal babies!"), expressions of emotion (e.g. [...] "stealing babies: Boo!"), or expressions of [...] "pro-attitudes" [...] ("I {{do not believe that}} babies should be stolen.") ...|$|R

5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although the <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, {{around the}} time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to bring the charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated Press on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's allegation at the time, and Hastert denied the accusation to ABC News at the time, so the <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> not published.|$|E
5|$|Hare's {{marriage}} was not consummated, and following {{an affair with}} a French woman, Rosa du Plessis, du Plessis bore him his only child, a daughter named Henrietta Rosa Peregrina, born in France in 1745. Hare died in 1749 leaving his estates to the four-year-old Henrietta, but her <b>claim</b> <b>was</b> rejected owing to her French nationality. After many years of legal challenges, the estates, including Bruce Castle, were granted to her husband James Townsend, whom she had married at age 18.|$|E
50|$|The Southern Ocean: Australia claims an {{exclusive}} economic zone (EEZ) around its Antarctic territorial claim. Since this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> only recognised by four other countries, the EEZ <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> also disputed.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1979, the Montana Supreme Court {{ordered that}} all water rights <b>claims</b> <b>be</b> filed by April 30, 1982. This {{resulted}} in roughly 219,000 water rights claims in 85 sub-basins {{in the state}} of Montana. The legislature enacted a law in 1995 allowing approximately 4,500 additional <b>claims</b> to <b>be</b> filed, although these <b>claims</b> may <b>be</b> considered only after [...] "on time" [...] water <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> adjudicated.|$|R
5000|$|Because the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> not {{directed}} to an abstract idea under step {{one of the}} Alice analysis, {{we do not need}} to proceed to step two of that analysis[...] [...] [...] We think it is clear for the reasons stated that the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> {{not directed}} to an abstract idea, and so we stop at step one. We conclude that the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> patent-eligible.|$|R
