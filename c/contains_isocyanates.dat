30|$|Isocyanates are {{a family}} of highly {{reactive}} and relatively low molecular weight aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The family {{is defined by the}} isocyanate functional group (−N[*]=[*]C[*]=[*]O). Most commercial <b>isocyanates</b> <b>contains</b> one <b>isocyanate</b> group (mono-isocyanates) or two isocyanate groups (di-isocyanates), attached to an aliphatic or an aromatic moiety (Avar et al. 2012). Inhalation of isocyanates is the most important human exposure route and may result in respiratory sensitisation (Kimber & Dearman 2002). There is also limited evidence that dermal contact may result in human respiratory sensitisation (Pronk 2006). The high chemical reactivity of isocyanates are reflected in their toxicity, as exposure to isocyanates {{is one of the most}} common causes of occupational asthma in developed countries (Redlich & Karol 2002; Lockey et al. 2015). Additionally, low concentrations of airborne isocyanates are acutely toxic following inhalation, and the production of <b>isocyanates</b> and products <b>containing</b> <b>isocyanates</b> is therefore heavily regulated from a health and safety at work perspective (Mishra et al. 2009), particularly polyurethane (PU) based foams, fillers and coatings. However, airborne isocyanates have also been sampled in fire effluent from building materials during the early stages of fire development (Blomqvist et al. 2003).|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{end-product}} categories for isocyanates are PUF and PUR foams as well as polyisocyanurate (PIR) foams (Markets and Markets 2011). TDI is mainly used {{for the production of}} flexible foam but can also be used in lacquers. MDI is used to produce rigid foam, as a base for glues or as a binder in sand moulds for iron casting (Dahlin 2007). Isocyanates such as hexamethylene di-isocyanate (HDI) and isophorone di-isocyanate (IPDI), are used in applications such as coatings as these compounds are UV-resistant (Karlsson et al. 1998). Aromatic isocyanates like TDI and MDI oxidize when exposed to UV-light and are therefore not suitable to be used in outdoor coatings (Rogers & Long 2003).

Existing self-healing chemistries {{are limited by}} relatively weak chemical bonding between the matrix and the healing material, temperature stability, and side reactions that degrade the active components. We demonstrate {{for the first time}} a two-part system that incorporates a healing chemistry similar to the matrix curing chemistry, enabling chemical bonding between the healed material and the matrix material. Amine-containing microcapsules are synthesized by interfacial polymerization of a polyurea about a droplet of amine by means of suspension polymerization. Capsules are subsequently isolated and analyzed for content, and shown to contain reactive amine. The microcapsules containing reactive amine are employed in concert with microcapsules containing epoxy resin to recover fracture toughness in a cured epoxy. Both capsule types are dispersed in an epoxy resin and the resin is chemically cured. Mechanical load is applied to propagate a crack and rupture microcapsules contained within the cured resin. The average peak load at failure in a virgin specimen is recorded, and compared to the average peak load at failure in the same specimen after a healing period. Recovery of fracture toughness is limited to 15 % for specimens healed at temperatures of 50 oC and below, whereas healing efficiencies of up to 60 % are observed for specimens healed at temperatures above 80 oC. Control specimens where amine was not present failed to recover. Microcapsules <b>containing</b> <b>isocyanate</b> are also prepared by means of interfacial polyurea condensation.

The results from the study indicates a high occupational exposure for the two isocyanates, as eighty per cent of the samples contained concentrations above the OSHA STEL value (Reeb-Whitaker et al. 2012). As a comparison, 98  % of the samples were above the UK HSE STEL (Reeb-Whitaker et al. 2012). When analysing urine samples from workers in in vehicle repair shops, Williams et al.

HDA was not found in individuals not exposed to HDI (Williams et al. 1999). Although the metabolism of HDI and oligomers of HDI is not well understood, there is seemingly a good correlation between the amount of airborne HDI and the amount of HDA excreted via urine (Brorson & Skarping 1990). Several other studies have reported a similar correlation between TDI (Rosenberg & Savolainen 1986; Brorson et al. 1991; Persson et al. 1993) and IPDI (Tinnerberg et al. 1995) with their respective amines after human exposure and excretion via the urine.|$|R

40|$|Hempel Coatings Company have into {{products}} assortment a {{group of}} paints {{which is based on}} isocyanate pre-polymer resins which cure with moisture forming a coating based on polyurea. These paints are called 1 component polyurethanes (1 K PU) or moisture curing polyurethanes (MCU). The principal function of these paints is the protection of substrates providing durability to the assets. This project was proposed by Protective Coatings R&D Department due to two reasons: - The resins and water scavengers used for 1 K PU are used only for these products so it is really important to have as reduced raw materials stock as possible. In addition these coatings represent {{a small percentage of the}} overall Hempel’s Coatings production. - Recently REACH (Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) has included all the products <b>containing</b> MDI <b>isocyanate</b> monomer/oligomer in the risk sentence R 40, limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect, and two 1 K PU coatings existing in Hempel <b>contain</b> this <b>isocyanate.</b> Thus this project was thought to study the isocyanate resins and water scavengers available in Hempel’s raw materials stock to reformulate the existing products. When reformulating the existing products the aim is improve 1 K PU performance, reduce raw materials stock and, if possible, avoid the use of MDI isocyanates. The project planning consists of the reformulation of all the possible alternatives of the existing standard products using the raw materials available.

40|$|When {{exposed to}} them, {{isocyanates}} can induce serious {{injuries in the}} respiratory tract and irritation on the skin and in the eyes. They are therefore interesting {{from the point of}} view of occupational health. The purpose of this thesis was to collect isocyanates in air with impinger-filter samplers and solvent free samplers. Furthermore the isocyanates were to be analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The solvent free sampler consists of a polypropylene tube and filter holder fitted with glass fiber filters impregnated with derivatization reagent, coupled with a pump. The impinger-filter sampler was made out of an impinger flask, containing a derivatization solution, coupled in series with a filter holder and a pump. Di-n-butylamine was used as derivatization reagent in both samplers to stabilize the reactive isocyanates and to enable mass spectrometric detection. The solvent free sampler is highly advantageous because of its user friendliness during field measurements, as opposed to the impinger-filter method. An exposure chamber, equipped with two interior fans to ensure good circulation, was used to generate an atmosphere <b>containing</b> <b>isocyanates.</b> Analyzing the isocyanate-DBA derivates with LC-MS/MS worked very well and the method made it possible to detect isocyanate levels below 1 ng/mL. During quantification of isocyanates a standard curve with concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/mL was used. Detection of isocyanate levels as low as one fifth of the limit value of some isocyanates was found to be possible, which would indicate that the methods are sensitive. Even though the solvent free sampler worked, the impinger-filter sampler was found to be more effective in collecting isocyanates. The coefficient of variation calculated from concentrations of isocyanates from the solvent free sampler varied between 0 - 35 %. The reason for this might be due to the fact that an optimized extraction method had not been tried out within the time limit of this project. Questions, identified during this thesis work, need to be answered before being able to obtain reliable results from field measurements with the solvent free sampler...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To study {{inhalation}} and {{dermal exposure}} to hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its oligomers {{as well as}} personal protection equipment (PPE) use during task performance in conjunction with urinary hexamethylene diamine (HDA) in car body repair shop workers and industrial spray painters. Methods: Personal task based inhalation samples (n = 95) were collected from six car body repair shops and five industrial painting companies using impingers with di-n-butylamine (DBA) in toluene. In parallel, dermal exposure was assessed using nitril rubber gloves. Gloves were submerged into DBA in toluene after sampling. Analysis for HDI and its oligomers was performed by LC-MS/MS. Urine samples were collected from 55 workers (n = 291) and analysed for HDA by GC-MS. Results: Inhalation exposure was strongly associated with tasks during which aerosolisation occurs. Dermal exposure occurred during tasks that involve direct handling of paint. In car body repair shops associations were found between detectable dermal exposure and glove use (odds ratio (OR) 0. 22, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 09 to 0. 57) and inhalation exposure level (OR 1. 34, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 1. 84 for a 10 -fold increase). HDA in urine could be demonstrated in 36 % and 10 % of car body repair shop workers and industrial painting company workers respectively.

40|$|Objectives: The {{automotive}} industry represents {{the most important}} industrial sector in Czechia. The objective of this study has been to analyze the occurrence of occupational diseases (OD) in the {{automotive industry}} {{during the period from}} 2001 till 2014. Material and Methods: Data on OD cases was retrieved from the National Registry of OD. Further, we conducted a survey in automotive companies with focus on occupational health services and positions of the companies in global production networks (GPNs). An analysis of OD distribution in the automotive industry was performed (age, gender, company size and its role in GPNs, regional distribution of studied companies, and regional unemployment rate), and was accompanied by assessment of the quality and range of occupational health services. Results: Employees older than 40 years old have nearly 2. 5 times higher probability of OD occurrence as compared with employees younger than 40 years old (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 41, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 05 – 2. 85). Occupational diseases occurrence probability was 3 times higher for women than for men (OR = 3. 01, 95 % CI: 2. 55 – 3. 55). Occupational diseases incidence rates increased with the size of the company (0 OD/ 10 000 employees in micro enterprises to 57 OD/ 10 000 employees in large enterprises). A particularly steep rise in OD incidents in the automotive industry was observed in the Plzeň Region between 2001 and 2011. An association between OD incidents and the unemployment rate was not statistically confirmed. Conclusions: A statistically significant increase in OD incidents dependent on company size may be arguably attributed to a higher quality of occupational medical services in bigger companies, which ensures better detection and diagnosis of OD. In the Plzeň Region, the rapid increase in OD incidents was mainly caused by a change in the production process of automobile textiles in one factory due to the introduction of a glue <b>containing</b> <b>isocyanates,</b> which are potent allergising agents.

[...] This {{is of particular}} interest in the area of polyurethane coatings, where light stability is a critical factor and is the main reason that aliphatic isocyanates are used in making polyurethane coatings. When PU foam, which is made using aromatic isocyanates, is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown. It has been generally accepted that apart from yellowing, visible light has little effect on foam properties. This is especially the case if the yellowing happens on the outer portions of a large foam, as the deterioration of properties in the outer portion has little effect on the overall bulk properties of the foam itself.|$|R
40|$|Radiation curable {{coatings}} {{based on}} urethane acrylates offer {{a broad spectrum}} of performance providing a range from highly elastic to very hard coatings with high toughness and abrasion resistance. Furthermore, aliphatic urethane acrylates show good weather resistance. However, the application of urethane acrylates is limited due to relatively high viscosity resulting from hydrogen bridge bonding between functional urethane groups which is on the other hand responsible for superior mechanical properties. The viscosity of a given formulation can be adjusted by adding solvent or reactive thinner which influence the crosslinking density of the coating. New low viscous urethane acrylates based on a novel type of <b>isocyanate</b> <b>containing</b> acrylate functionality via allophanate are presented. Potential outdoor applications in automotive coatings providing highly scratch resistant clear coats are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Combustion of {{polyurethane}} foams releases toxic gaseous products. Therefore, {{decreasing the}} flammability of polyurethane foams is of practical significance {{to public health}} and the environment. The reported study investigated the thermal stability of urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams based on the presence of aromatic, aliphatic polyester polyol and polyether polyol moieties. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that the foam <b>containing</b> the lowest <b>isocyanate</b> index (220) and the lowest molecular mass of polyether polyol (200) was the most flammable (35 % of char residue). Furthermore, the foams which contained a high molecular mass of polyether polyol (2000) and high isocyanate index (460) experienced fire performance (45 % of char residue) similar to those foams containing aliphatic and aromatic polyester polyol (41 and 44 % of char residue respectively) ...|$|R
50|$|Union Carbide {{became a}} {{subsidiary}} of Dow Chemical in 2001. The Bhopal disaster of 1984 occurred at a pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide India Ltd., {{a subsidiary of}} Union Carbide, 17 years before Dow Chemical Co.'s acquisition. A gas cloud <b>containing</b> methyl <b>isocyanate</b> and other chemicals spread to the neighborhoods near the plant where {{more than half a}} million people were exposed to it. More than 27 years after the event, the actual number of fatalities is still unknown. The official immediate death toll was 2,259 and the government of Madhya Pradesh has confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. Others estimate 3,000 died within weeks and another 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases. There are wide variations in the estimated number of individuals permanently disabled by the event. By one independent estimate, 40,000 individuals were left permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness as a result of the disaster. A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. In 2010 eight former executives of Union Carbide India Ltd. were found guilty of death by negligence. Activists sought to have Dow Chemical held responsible for the ongoing cleanup of the site, now under the control of the state government of Madhya Pradesh.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the easy and fast patterning of {{low molecular weight}} molecules that act as binding partners for proteins on Star PEG coatings. These coatings are prepared from isocyanate terminated star shaped prepolymers and form a highly cross-linked network on the substrate in which the stars are connected via urea groups and free amino groups are present. Streptavidin has been patterned on these layers by microcontact printing (&# 0956;CP) of an amino reactive biotin derivative and consecutive binding of streptavidin to the biotin. Patterns of Ni 2 +-nitriltriacetic acid (NTA) receptors have been prepared by printing amino functional NTA molecules in freshly prepared Star PEG layers that still <b>contain</b> amino reactive <b>isocyanate</b> groups. Complexation of the NTA groups with Ni(II) ions enabled the binding of His-tag enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the desired pattern on the substrates. Since the unmodified Star PEG layers prevent unspecific protein adsorption, His-EGFP could selectively be bound to the sample by immersion into crude, nonpurified His-tag EGFP containing cell lysate...|$|R
