5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Panic on Funkotron is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away. Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling's proximity (some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them. Once all Earthlings have been found, the player <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the next level. Players can collect presents containing various bonuses, such as super jars, radar scans, and teleporting moves. Coins {{can be used with}} parking meters to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics. Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone, where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents. Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the Funkapotamus; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion.|$|E

25|$|Otonashi {{is asked}} to join the SSS by its founder and leader Yuri Nakamura. The SSS fight against Kanade Tachibana, also {{referred}} to as Angel, the student council president of the afterlife school whose responsibilities require her to suppress the team's disruptive activities. Although the SSS initially views Kanade as their enemy, Otonashi eventually befriends her and she joins the SSS. Following this, Otonashi begins helping the other SSS members overcome any regrets they had in life so they <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> In the process, Otonashi grows closer to the other characters as he learns more about them. Although the story contains romantic plot lines between Otonashi and each of the heroines, the pasts and conflicts of the characters are not meant to simply enliven the romantic elements, but also provide a significance that goes beyond romance.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the talent}} of singing has become competitive. Currently, {{there are several}} {{television}} shows that showcase these talents. American Idol {{was one of the}} prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, {{it was one of the}} first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa launched by Zee TV in the 1995..At the American Idol Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. The Voice is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to American Idol, the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include The X Factor, America's Got Talent, Rising Star and The Sing-Off.|$|E
25|$|Deep inside Hades' lair, {{an injured}} Hook awakens and notices {{a young woman}} who is also trapped with him in the chamber. As he struggles to move Hook convinces the young woman to run for help and asks for Emma. As they reach the exit, a three-headed hellhound creature, Cerberus, chases after the two. Above at the cemetery, Mary Margaret and David look at the gravestones of those who Mary Margaret felt she had failed as alluded in the flashback, But David is {{confident}} that they can protect Emma and tells Mary Margaret that she can be able to succeed. When she sees the tombstone of Hercules, David is surprised to learn that she knew the Demi-God, and believes that he has unfinished business with her, which gives them the idea to help him while seeking out Hook.

25|$|Ian is pessimistic when Lucy {{decides to}} set up her own {{property}} business and later becomes concerned about her when he discovers she is sleeping with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) and is taking cocaine. He confronts her and admits she is the child he is most proud of, but this is overheard by Peter, resulting in Lucy storming out. Ian tries to contact her when she does not return home that night, but is later informed by DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) that Lucy has been found dead. He identifies her body and then shares his devastating news with Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and finally Peter. Struggling with their grief, Ian and Jane share a passionate encounter, giving Ian hope that they might reunite. When Jane dashes his hopes, Ian takes his anger out on Bobby and Jane decides {{it would be best}} if she take Bobby away for a while. Cindy also leaves the Square to return to Devon with her aunt, Gina Williams. Increasingly alone, Ian leans on Phil for support and questions how he <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> from his daughter's death. With Peter's help, he stages an opening for the new and improved restaurant, but during opening night Summerhayes reveals that Lucy's body has been released for burial. Ian leaves early with Peter to see her, but is unable due to his grief.

The song was released on 4 October 2005, by Epic Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Shakira, Lauren Christy, Graham Edwards and Scott Spock, and was produced by Shakira. [...] "Don't Bother" [...] is a rock-influenced song in which Shakira assures her former lover {{that she does not}} need his sympathy and <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> without him.|$|E

Their skin is thick and covered in non-overlapping scales. They have conical, peg-like teeth and a powerful bite.

500|$|The {{levels are}} based on regions of the United States and other countries. In each level, certain tasks that advance the game's {{narrative}} must be completed before the player <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> These tasks include score attacks, races, item collection, and reaching one of many gaps found in a level. Each level houses one professional skateboarder, who provides a sidequest that unlocks a trick for the Special Meter. On account of the levels' large sizes and the integration of goals into the story, Underground {{has been described as}} an adventure game. Characters can level up their stats—which include jump height and speed—by completing optional goals in a level; this adds an element of role-playing gameplay. Other gameplay modes include multiplayer minigames—one, a combat mode called [...] "Firefight", can be played online in the PlayStation 2 version of the game—and a [...] "free skate" [...] mode that lets the player explore levels with no goals or story.|$|E
500|$|Before {{entering}} battle, {{players can}} choose {{a certain number}} of characters to use in the battle from a roster of up to 46 characters. [...] The roster grows as the game progresses and more characters are recruited, and the number of characters able to be used varied between battles. [...] During battle, players have access to two species: the humanoid Beorc and the shape-shifting Laguz. Beorc use weapons and magic, while Laguz use close-quarters melee attacks. Laguz have a gauge which fills up during battle, filling at varying speed depending on their status and whether they are under attack. When the gauge is full, they transform into their animal form for a set number of turns, becoming far more powerful than Beorc characters. However, they are unable to attack while in human form, and are vulnerable until they transform again. [...] The time between transformations can be shortened using special items. Playable Beorc characters are each assigned a character class. These classes affect a character's skills and how far they <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> the battlefield. [...] Some classes are exclusive to certain characters: for example, the Ranger class and its skills are exclusive to Ike. Laguz characters also have different movement speeds and strengths depending on their transformed form.|$|E

[...] Another form of locomotion (in which the surface layer is broken) is used by the basilisk lizard.|$|E

2500|$|A {{distinctly}} Irish type of brooch {{found at}} the end of the Viking period is the kite brooch, whose name derives from the almond shape called a [...] "kite" [...] in heraldry, though the shapes of the heads are actually highly variable. They were apparently worn, like the larger brooches, singly with the pin pointing upwards. Only [...] "about half a dozen" [...] exist in silver, including examples that are much larger than average, with pins up to 7.9cm long. In these, there is no ring, but the elaborate head is connected to a pin of very variable length by a short tab of metal that <b>can</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> joints at both ends; there is also usually a cord for winding round the pin to secure it. Only 14 of these brooches have been found to date in Ireland, many incomplete, and none elsewhere; five of these are from Dublin, the earliest from the 940s. [...] They appear for about a further two centuries; by around 1200, typical medieval ring brooches that have little distinctively Irish about them are found instead.|$|E
