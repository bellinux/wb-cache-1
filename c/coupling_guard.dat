With bolt heads included, the predicted <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> surface temperatures approximately matched values measured in the field. In the particular field problem addressed here, the measured temperatures were 219 to 222 ?F (104 - 106 ?C), while the CFD predicted temperature ranged from 209 - 227 ?F (98 - 108 ?C). Among the important findings are: The moving bolt heads generate much of the heat in a coupling guard; Properly placed outlet ports can use the bolt heads as a blower, increasing air flow through the <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> and lowering the temperature; Small reductions in exhaust pressure can lower the <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> surface temperature significantly. Numerous plots, graphs, and tables give insight into the flow field inside the <b>coupling</b> <b>guard.</b> These analyses can guide the design of coupling guards with lower surface temperatures...|$|E

Gear WPL becomes significant and shall not be neglected in high speed applications. The temperature on <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> needs to comply with industry standards and is influenced by windage affect. There is practical significance in predicting <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> temperature and gearbox WPL. Simulation models were built and results were obtained from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers. The simulation results were validated by experimental data from the literature. A case study was also conducted to further validate the predictability of <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> temperature. Simulation experiments were designed and data generated to obtain Multivariable Regression Formulas (MRF) for gear WPL and guard temperature prediction. A comparison between CFD prediction of gear WPL and experimental results showed a relative error less than 12 %. In the case study, the percentage difference between predicted guard temperature and test data was within 5 %. For the given ranges of input parameters, MRF gave a better prediction than the empirical formula used in industry. The proposed MRF was accurate for coupling guards and gears that {{were not included in}} the CFD modeled systems, which were used to generate the data for obtaining the MRF. The prediction expressions also helped in the product design stage to mitigate gearbox WPL and <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> temperature...|$|E
40|$|LectureHigh {{temperatures}} inside coupling guards {{can cause}} machinery down time {{and loss of}} revenue. As a result, many industries invest significant time and effort trying to reduce heat generation. Windage flanges are a standard feature on high performance couplings {{with the purpose of}} reducing heat generation within guards. However, previous testing and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation carried out by Pennington and Meck (2012) have cast doubt on the effectiveness of this feature. The forthcoming fifth edition of API 671 is expected to reduce the maximum allowable guard temperature from 160 ?F (70 ?C) to 140 ?F (60 ?C), {{to reduce the risk of}} irreversible surface contact burns. In order to comply with the API requirement, it is important to understand how features such as windage flanges and radial guard clearance affect heat generation. CFD analysis and physical testing are presented in this paper. Improvements to the test configuration setup have been made to achieve increased coupling surface speeds of 175 m/s (compared to 123 m/s in previous testing by Pennington and Meck (2012)), and simplified to isolate the effects of the windage flange. This paper investigates the effectiveness of windage flanges, as well as the effect of guard radial clearance on heat generation inside coupling guards, and resultant <b>coupling</b> <b>guard</b> temperature, at much higher speeds than in previous studies. In total, six test configurations were simulated, consisting of two test couplings (with and without windage features) tested with three different sized coupling guards, creating variable radial clearances. CFD analysis results conclude that the windage flange features are ineffective in reducing heat generation inside the guard, and coupling guards with a larger radial clearance result in lower temperatures inside the guard. However, this approach is less effective above a guard radial clearance of 40 mm, after which the windage flange has little effect on the temperature within the <b>coupling</b> <b>guard.</b> In addition, temperature results from the validated CFD model were found to be within 4 percent of the physical experimental data...|$|E

Existing features used in high performance (HP) couplings involve various methods of shrouding and covering prominent rotating parts to ensure a smooth, rounded profile.

This had lead to {{the investigation of the}} efficiency of the features. Traditional methods involve extensive test work, but due to the advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the technology is now far more accessible to mainstream industry and can be used to analyze more complex coupling assemblies. This has allowed evaluation of windage features and their effect when rotated within a guard. Various geometric features have been analyzed using CFD and verified with test work, starting with a coupling equipped with all available windage features through to all of them removed. The initial results highlight that windage features fail to make a significant impact in reducing guard temperatures, hence further investigation has been planned...|$|R

In September 1941, when the camp became an {{independent}} concentration camp under the name Niederhagen concentration camp, 480 prisoners were interned there. From 1941, more and more prisoners from outside Germany were imprisoned in the camp.The approximately 3,900 prisoners included Jehovah's Witnesses, political prisoners, Sinti and Romani people, Yeniche, homosexuals, Jews, prisoners of war and forced laborers from Poland, the Soviet Union (also prisoners of war), Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Almost {{a third of them}} did not survive their imprisonment. The deaths of 1,285 prisoners are recorded. They died of hunger, cold, disease and the consequences of ill-treatment. In 1942, a crematorium was built specifically for the camp. The Gestapo also used the camp as a place for executions. A total of 56 people from Westphalia-Lippe, including women and children, were executed there on the orders of Heinrich Himmler. In the period from 1 September 1941 to 1 May 1943, the camp was an independent concentration camp. Before, it had been a satellite camp first of the Sachsenhausen and then of the Buchenwald concentration camp. From 1943, only 50 people were imprisoned at Niederhagen, and on 2 April 1945, the prisoners were ordered to be executed, but the SS officer ordered to tell a <b>couple</b> of <b>guards</b> to kill them, said that he would do it himself and once all of the others retreated he told all of the Jehovah's Witnesses that they were free (and he is now a Jehovah's Witness himself), and they were liberated by the American army.

The measured barrier height is 0. 8 V, as expected for the Ti contact used. Overdepletion was obtained before breakdown, enabling a layer thickness of m to be deduced for the final sample.

40|$|Microelectronics {{is heading}} towards {{larger and larger}} systems {{implemented}} on a single chip. In wireless communication equipment, e. g., cellular phones, handheld computers etc., both analog and digital circuits are required. If several integrated circuits (ICs) are used in a system, {{a large amount of}} the power is consumed by the communication between the ICs. Furthermore, the communication between ICs is slow compared with on-chip communication. Therefore, it is favorable to integrate the whole system on a single chip, which is the objective in the system-on-chip (SoC) approach. In a mixed-signal SoC, analog and digital circuits share the same chip. When digital circuits are switching, they produce noise that is spread through the silicon substrate to other circuits. This noise is known as substrate noise. The performance of sensitive analog circuits is degraded by the substrate noise in terms of, e. g., lower signal-to-noise ratio and lower spurious-free dynamic range. Another problem is the design of the clock distribution net, which is challenging in terms of obtaining low power consumption, sharp clock edges, and low simultaneous switching noise. In this thesis, a noise reduction strategy that focus on reducing the amount of noise produced in digital clock buffers, is presented. The strategy is to use a clock with long rise and fall times. It is also used to relax the constraints on the clock distribution net, which also reduce the design effort. Measurements on a test chip show that the strategy can be implemented in an IC with low cost in terms of speed and power consumption. Comparisons between substrate coupling in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and conventional bulk technology are made using simple models. The objective here is to get an understanding of how the substrate coupling differs in SOI from the bulk technology.

50|$|The Billy Bowlegs Festival {{grew out}} of a Labor Day ski show celebration back in 1953, which was the brainchild of some enterprising young businessmen, the JAYCEES, eager to latch onto a project that would warrant their time and efforts, be fun, and bring more {{tourists}} into the area. The idea of a Gasparilla-type observance centered on a “pirate” theme, and they unanimously chose as their patron pirate the notorious and legendary William Augustus Bowles, a pirate of controversial authenticity whose alleged dastardly deeds were widespread throughout the area. Nathan Fleet, a downtown Fort Walton Beach retail merchant at that time, was chosen as the first Captain Billy Bowlegs to reign over the Festival and lead the pirate “raids.” (In later years, his son, Judge Erwin Fleet, reigned as Cap’n Billy XIV.)The overwhelming success and acceptance of the initial celebration sparked great enthusiasm and interest among other businessmen of the community. A small group of merchants, of which two, together with two from the JAYCEES, were secretly delegated to choose from the member list the Billy Bowlegs as reigning pirate of the three-day festival, his identity to remain unknown until the unmasking ceremonies took place on the evening of the grant ball. Due to the huge success of the festival, events were added such as treasure hunts - typically the most popular part of the entire festival, but inexplicably eliminated in 2009 - parades, gigantic fireworks displays, athletic events, a landing to include the townspeople with the “capture” of the City and the hoisting of the Jolly Roger to signify the total surrender of the City. Beards were grown, costumes made, and over the years became more elaborate. Professional floats were added to the Grand Torchlight Parade and a glittering Coronation Pageant, open to the public, at which a new Cap’n Billy, his queen, a first mate and his lady, ten honor <b>guard</b> <b>couples</b> and children of the court are unmasked each year, with a private ball and midnight breakfast for Krewe members and honored guests climaxing the now week-long festival.

Donovan says that he's surprised she'd made it that far, as few had, and said that Dr. Kane chooses his associates well. She says that the public must know of his actions, and he replies that they will, in due time, but he could do without media hype at the moment, and says that he could use her skills as a reporter to report on one [...] "X-creatures project" [...] and that he'd make her an offer she, [...] "...just cannot afford to refuse." [...] Meanwhile, Steppenwolf delves deeper into the base, looking for clues as to what happened. After smashing through a door, he finds that a white beast similar to the ape beast from before had killed and was eating all of the scientists. After trapping it and stunning it with light, he manages to tranquilize it with a tranquilizer gun one of the corpses had. Donovan then appears with Meg in tow and a <b>couple</b> of <b>guards</b> and greets Steppenwolf, discussing how the beast was Shelley Thompson, which Steppenwolf had figured out upon examining the body and finding her wedding ring on its finger. Steppenwolf asks about the plane crash thing, and Reggie explains that his father had wanted to save him the shock. Steppenwolf then brings up the missing tape, which Donovan says he has, and, while it's not pretty, it did entail an antidote to the [...] "change," [...] which Shelley had recorded before she injected herself with the mutagenic serum, but didn't have time to prepare before her brain degraded too far. He further explains how she then became violent, wrecking the whole place, including the X-creature blood samples needed for the antidote, which is her only chance at [...] "redemption." ...|$|R
40|$|In many {{consumer}} products, e. g., {{cellular phones}} and handheld computers, both digital and analog circuits are required. Nowadays, {{it is possible}} to implement a large subsystem or even a complete system, that earlier required several chips, on a single chip. A system on chip (SoC) has generally the advantages of lower power consumption and a smaller fabrication cost compared with multi-chip solutions. The switching of digital circuits generates noise that is injected into the silicon substrate. This noise is known as substrate noise and is spread through the substrate to other circuits. The substrate noise received in an analog circuit degrades the performance of the circuit. This is a major design issue in mixed-signal ICs where analog and digital circuits share the same substrate. Two new noise reduction methods are proposed in this thesis work. The first focuses n reducing the switching noise generated in digital clock buffers. The strategy is to use a clock with long rise and fall times in conjunction with a special D flip-flop. It relaxes the constraints on the clock distribution net, which also reduce the design effort. Measurements on a test chip implemented in a 0. 35 μm CMOS technology show that the method can be implemented in an IC with low cost in terms of speed and power consumption. A noise reduction up to 50 % is obtained by using the method. The measured power consumption of the digital circuit, excluding the clock buffer, increased 14 % when the rise and fall times of the clock were increased from 0. 5 ns to 10 ns. The corresponding increase in propagation delay was less than 0. 5 ns corresponding to an increase of 50 % in propagation delay of the registers. The second noise reduction method focuses on reducing simultaneous switching noise below half the clock frequency. This frequency band is assumed to be the signal band of an analog circuit. The idea is to use circuits that have as close to periodic power supply currents as possible to obtain low simultaneous switching noise below the clock in the frequency domain. For this purpose we use precharged differential cascode switch logic together with a novel D flip-flop. To evaluate the method two pipelined adders have been implemented on transistor level in a 0. 13 μm CMOS technology, where the novel circuit is implemented with our method and the reference circuit with static CMOS logic together with a TSPC D flip-flop. According to simulation results, the frequency components in the analog signal band can be attenuated from 10 dB up to 17 dB using the proposed method. The cost is mainly an increase in power consumption of almost a factor of three. Comparisons between substrate coupling in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and conventional bulk technology are made using simple models. The objective is to get an understanding of how the substrate coupling differs in SOI from the bulk technology. The results show that the SOI has less substrate <b>coupling</b> if no <b>guard</b> band is used, up to a certain frequency that is dependent of the test case. Introducing a guard band resulted in a higher attenuation of substrate noise in bulk than in SOI. An on-chip measurement circuit aiming at measuring simultaneous switching noise has been designed in a 0. 13 μm SOI CMOS technology. The measuring circuit uses a single comparator per channel where several passes are used to capture the waveform. Measurements on a fabricated testchip indicate that the measuring circuit works as intended. A small part of this thesis work has been done in the area of digit representation in digital circuits. A new approach to convert a number from two’s complement representation to a minimum signed-digit representation is proposed. Previous algorithms are working either from the LSB to the MSB (right-to-left) or from the MSB to the LSB (left-to-right). The novelty in the proposed algorithm is that the conversion is done from left-to-right and right-to-left concurrently. Using the proposed algorithm, the critical path in a conversion circuit can be nearly halved compared with the previous algorithms. The area and power consumption, of the implementation of the proposed algorithm, are somewhere between the left-to-right and right-to-left implementations.

40|$|There {{is a high}} {{motivation}} to develop smart sensor systems based on surface-engineered sensor elements for environmental and biomedical monitoring purposes. Key characteristics are that the sensors perform reliable, accurate, sensitive, and ideally selective measurements while being low-cost, portable, robust for online and on-field applications, and allowing wireless communication. Polymer-coated interdigitated electrodes (IDEs), which are able to convert {{a change in the}} properties of a dielectric material into an electrical signal, have shown promising detection performances in the gaseous phase. Within this concept, the collection of the target compounds, mostly by absorption, results in dielectric changes that can be measured capacitively. In this thesis, we pursue to study this type of sensors when brought in direct contact with an aqueous phase for the capacitive detection of organic pollutants. For this goal, planar IDE structures centred on 1 cm 2 large borosilicate glass chips were fabricated with the following electrode dimensions: 221 golden interdigitated fingers of 2 mm in length, 6 ?m in width, with a 3 ?m gap between them, and diagonally arranged leads of 6 ?m in width to the contact pads. IDE chips with and without in-plane guarding electrodes were designed. The IDE chips were wire-bonded to a printed circuit board, from where further connections to the electronic readout device were made. Measurements were performed using the LabVIEW supported universal transducer interface (UTI) by the Smartec Company in the Netherlands. The polymeric sensing layers were prepared using Sylgard® 184, a commercially available polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) product by the Dow Corning Company. The polymer layers were deposited with controlled thicknesses via a spin-coating technique. For polymer layer thicknesses larger than the spatial electrode wavelength, i. e., 18 ?m, the capacitances for IDE chips with and without in-plane guarding electrodes were in the order of ~ 19 pF and ~ 20 pF, respectively. The measurement resolution —and hence detection limit— was measured to be ~ 500 aF. PDMS has beneficial properties for both sensing and water-contact applications as the visco-elastic and hydrophobic silicone network allows quick and reversible diffusion of small molecules, and simultaneously it serves as a water sealant, protecting the electrode structure. The polymer-coated IDE chip also forms the bottom part of a flow cell chamber, which is completed by mounting a Teflon flow cell with a sealing Viton O-ring centred on top of the IDE chip. The flow cell system allows measurements under continuous flow conditions, using a syringe pump with two individual syringe drives. The polymer layer thickness with respect to the spatial electrode wavelength is an important design parameter. The electric sensing field established between the planar IDEs lies primarily out-of-plane. If the polymer layer is sufficiently thick and the electric field is restrained within the layer, only the absorption of pollutants into the layer will be detected. For thin polymer layers, for which the electric field extends beyond the polymer surface, also adsorption and swelling as induced by pollutant uptake will contribute to changes in the capacitive response. We show that the polymer layer thickness also plays a significant insulation role. The out-of-plane electric field of the planar IDEs is geometrically difficult to guard, especially when the chip is being exposed to an electrically challenging environment, such as water. This is —because in contrast to air— water is relatively conductive, especially when it contains dissolved solids, and it has a relatively high dielectric constant. For this reason, the electrical complexity for aqueous systems is enhanced and the chance for parasitic electrical coupling effects to other system parts and the surrounding increases. If the electric sensing field is parasitically coupled through the water phase, then device sensitivity to electrical changes of the aqueous solution is induced. By means of the two-port technique, the UTI is not affected by parasitic capacitances of parallel capacitors to ground, such as introduced, e. g., by the coax cables. Yet, electrical coupling events that lead to a reduction in the IDE capacitance cannot be distinguished. It was found that for the designed system and for an unguarded IDE chip with ~ 50 ?m thick PDMS coating an increase in the aqueous salt (NaCl) molarity from 0 up to 20 mM results in a capacitance decrease down to ~ 175 fF. This is attributed to enhanced parasitic coupling to the system environment for increasing solution salinity. The parasitic coupling effect further increased for lower layer thicknesses, showing its role of insulation. We demonstrated how water-enhanced electrical <b>coupling</b> to in-plane <b>guarding</b> electrodes or ideally a third electrode, which connects the water phase with the ground terminal, is a key mechanism in achieving response immunity to further parasitic coupling. This way the device sensitivity to solution conditions can be significantly decreased for reasonable layer thicknesses and without impairing the detection performance. Eventually, we investigated the capacitive response of interdigitated electrodes covered with ~ 50 ?m thick PDMS films from the moment of deposition until full evaporation of drops of pure volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including chloroform, methyl tert-butyl ether, 1 -hexanol, toluene, m-xylene, and n-hexane. Then the direct exposure to aqueous solutions of these VOCs (up to 1 mM) under continuous flow conditions was studied. It is shown that the capacitive response changes upon absorption of the VOCs into the PDMS are in line with their relative dielectric constants as compared to the one of the thin PDMS layer and that the response changes were fully reversible. The response changes were in the low fF range with a detection limit of ~ 0. 1 mM for the more water-soluble VOCs, which include chloroform, methyl tert-butyl ether, and 1 -hexanol. However, the response reproducibility decreased for the more hydrophobic organics toluene, m-xylene, and n-hexane, pointing at distribution processes such as evaporation, wetting, and phase separation within the system. Research challenges are the design of innovative polymeric sensing layers that provide both tuned chemical selectivity within an IDE multi-array and sufficient sealing properties when being directly exposed to water. This may require also the design of new surface modification techniques to achieve good adhesion with the transducer substrate. Further research on the detection and partitioning processes will demand the design of fully conditioned and calibrated measuring systems. Finally, the development of more sensitive transducer interfaces and fully integrated smart sensor systems are further requirements to achieve the goal of target detection at governmental water standards.
