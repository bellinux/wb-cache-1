40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether intrauterine growth retardation associated with normal umbilical artery blood flow is a benign condition. DESIGN [...] A prospective {{comparative study of}} growth retarded fetuses with normal and abnormal umbilical artery blood flow. SETTING [...] The fetal assessment clinic of a large maternity hospital in Ireland. PATIENTS [...] 179 Women with singleton pregnancies in which the fetal abdominal circumference, measured by ultrasonography, was below the fifth centile for gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Perinatal deaths, fetal distress requiring caesarean section, preterm delivery, <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation.</b> RESULTS [...] Of 124 fetuses with normal flow, all physically normal fetuses survived but one baby had cerebral irritation; there were six preterm deliveries and four caesarean sections for fetal distress. Among 55 women with abnormal flow there were two midtrimester abortions, three perinatal deaths, and one case of <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation</b> in physically normal fetuses. CONCLUSIONS [...] Intrauterine growth retardation associated with normal umbilical blood flow is a different entity from that associated with abnormal flow, normal flow being largely benign and abnormal flow carrying a serious risk of adverse outcome...|$|E
30|$|Symptoms usually develop when serum sodium {{concentration}} {{drops below}} 125  mmol/L. The most frequent symptoms are headache, nausea, vomiting and weakness. If further fluid intravasation occurs, {{reduction of the}} blood osmolality creates an osmotic gradient that moves water into the interstitial and intracellular space, leading to brain oedema and increased intracranial pressure. The resultant cerebral oedema may present with signs of <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation</b> such as agitation, apprehension, confusion, weakness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, blindness and headache. If significant, {{it can lead to}} brain stem herniation, coma and death [22]. A further fall of sodium below 120  mmol/L may lead to confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma, arrhythmias, bradycardia and respiratory arrest.|$|E
40|$|A case is {{described}} of <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation</b> following respiratory obstruction during anaes-thesia, caused by occlusion of an endotracheal tube by overinflation of the cuff. The patient made {{a full recovery}} after prompt dehydration therapy combined with hypothermia. The following case illustrates once again {{that the presence of}} an endotracheal tube is, in itself, no guarantee of a perfect airway. CASE REPORT A healthy female patient, aged 45 years, was admitted for repair of a right femoral hernia. Nothing abnormal was detected on pre-operative examination. Premedica-tion was atropine 0. 6 mg and morphine 10 mg, ad-ministered subcutaneously 45 minutes before opera-tion. Anaesthesia was induced with methohexitone 80 mg and, after suxamethonium 75 mg, the trachea wa...|$|E
40|$|Hyponatraemia is a well-recognised {{complication}} of neurosurgical conditions, but the incidence and implications {{have not been}} well documented. To define the incidence, pathophysiology and clinical implications of significant hyponatraemia in several neurosurgical conditions. All patients admitted to the Irish National Neurosciences Centre at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm, pituitary disorders and spinal disorders who developed significant hyponatraemia (plasma sodium < 130 mmol/l) from January 2002 to September 2003 were identified from computerised laboratory records. Data were collected by retrospective case note analysis. Hyponatraemia was more common in patients with pituitary disorders (5 / 81, 6. 25 %; p = 0. 004), traumatic brain injury (44 / 457, 9. 6 %; p< 0. 001), intracranial neoplasm (56 / 355, 15. 8 %; p< 0. 001) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (62 / 316, 19. 6 %; p< 0. 001) than in those with spinal disorders (4 / 489, 0. 81 %). The pathophysiology of hyponatraemia was: syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in 116 cases (62 %) (31 (16. 6 %) drug-associated), hypovolaemic hyponatraemia in 50 cases (26. 7 %) (which included patients with insufficient data to assign to the cerebral salt-wasting group (CSWS)), CSWS in nine cases (4. 8 %), intravenous fluids in seven cases (3. 7 %) and mixed SIADH/CSWS in five cases (2. 7 %). Hyponatraemic patients with <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation</b> had significantly lower plasma sodium concentrations (mean (SD) 124. 8 (0. 34) mmol/l) than asymptomatic patients (126. 6 (0. 29) mmol/l) (p< 0. 0001). Hyponatraemic patients had a significantly longer hospital stay (median 19 days (interquartile range (IQR) 12 - 28)) than normonatraemic patients (median 12 days (IQR 10. 5 - 15)) (p< 0. 001). Hyponatraemia is common in intracerebral disorders and {{is associated with a}} longer hospital stay. <b>Cerebral</b> <b>irritation</b> is associated with more severe hyponatraemia. SIADH is {{the most common cause of}} hyponatraemia and is often drug-associated...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal {{infection}} of the brain typically caused by Cladophialophora bantiana, Exophiala dermatitidis, and Rhinocladiella mackenziei, all of which belong to the order Chaetothyriales. The disease results in black, necrotic brain tissue, black pus, and black cerebrospinal fluid. Pathogens usually reach the brain through the bloodstream or lymphatic fluid and occasionally through direct spreading or accidental inoculation. Patients can present with hemiparesis, tonic spasm, headache, fever, sensory variation, <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation,</b> and even psychotic behavioural changes. Radiological images are characterised by ring-enhanced signs and hyperdense and hypodense lesions. Pathological features frequently include black-to-brown necrotic tissue or dark-coloured pus, granulomatous inflammation, giant cell vasculitis, and pigmented fungal elements, which are easily seen on a direct potassium hydroxide smear, a rapid method for diagnosis. Black fungi can be cultured from a biopsy specimen. Combined antifungal chemotherapy, surgical debridement, and careful immunological interventions are strongly recommended to eradicate these intractable infections...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fagara zanthoxyloides is a {{well known}} {{medicinal}} plant in Uganda. It is used extensively in malaria and other infections. However nothing is known about its toxicity. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the acute toxicity of the methanolic extract of the root-bark of F. zanthoxyloides, in mice. Methods: Methanolic extract of the root-bark of the plant was administered orally to mice at various dose levels to determine the acute toxic effects and the median lethal dose (LD 50) in mice. Results: The LD 50 of the methanolic extract was found to be 5. 0 g/Kg body weight within 95 % confidence limits. The mice showed signs of <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation</b> before dying. Histopathological examinations of the viscera showed congestion and focal necrosis of the liver and renal tubules. Conclusion: It was concluded that the extract of F. zanthoxyloides is safe, however the cerebral mechanism that lead to the death of the mice need to be investigated further...|$|E
40|$|In the lesions of {{herpes simplex}} and similar {{conditions}} due to filterable viruses, cells are present which show characteristic alterations, {{particularly in the}} nucleus. The nucleus of these cells contains a mass which stains with acid dyes. Surrounding this mass is a clear space or halo, within which there are large granules staining with basic stains. These cells are little if at all enlarged. In a few human cases, especially in infants, enlarged cells have been found which contain nuclei showing changes similar to those seen in the abnormal cells of herpes simplex. In the ducts of the submaxillary glands of guinea pigs, Jackson observed structures which she considered to be protozoan parasites. Our own studies indicate, however, that these structures are greatly swollen epithelial cells with nuclei having the same characters as the nuclei of the atypical cells in the lesions of herpes simplex. These cells are usually surrounded by a mononuclear cellular reaction. They were found in 84 per cent of the full grown guinea pigs examined but they were present in only three of forty-three young guinea pigs less than 1 month old. The resemblance of these cells, except as regards size, to the atypical cells present in lesions due to filterable viruses suggested that they also {{may be the result}} of an infection with a similar agent. That they are usually not present in guinea pigs less than 1 month old indicates that natural infection usually occurs after this period. Experiments were therefore undertaken to determine whether or not an infective agent is concerned in this condition and if so to learn something of its nature. When an emulsion of the submaxillary glands of full grown guinea pigs is injected into the brains of young guinea pigs the animals have fever and exhibit symptoms of <b>cerebral</b> <b>irritation.</b> They usually die in 5 to 7 days and in sections of the brain a diffuse subacute meningitis is found. In the exudate there are large numbers of cells having all the characteristics of the abnormal cells of herpes simplex. Similar cells are present in the lesions resulting from the injection of the same emulsion into the testicle, lung, tongue, and submaxillary glands of young guinea pigs. In none of these lesions, however, are the cells greatly enlarged as they are in the lesions in old guinea pigs. These results support the view that the lesion in the submaxillary gland of old guinea pigs is due to an infective agent. Attempts were therefore made to transmit this agent through a series of young guinea pigs. When the injections were all made into the same organ all the experiments but one gave negative results, but when the site of injection was changed at each transfer it was possible in a number of instances to reproduce the lesions through two animals in series and in one experiment through three animals in series. By modifying the technique, efforts were made to transmit the infection indefinitely but these attempts were unsuccessful. No explanation can be offered for this failure. Studies made to determine some of the properties of the infective agent have shown that it is destroyed by heating at 54 ° for 1 hour, and that it is not injured by preservation in 50 per cent glycerol for as long as 11 days. After the material had remained in 50 per cent glycerol for 28 days, however, it was found to be no longer infective. The infective agent was not held back by a Berkefeld N filter which was impermeable to bacteria. It seems probable therefore that the infective agent belongs in the group of filterable viruses, though further work will be necessary to learn more of its exact nature. These observations present additional evidence that the presence of cells with nuclear inclusions in any lesion indicates that the injury is probably due to an infective agent belonging in the group of filterable viruses...|$|E
