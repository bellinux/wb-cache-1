30|$|This locally {{important}} and cultural identity defining <b>craft</b> is at <b>risk</b> of being pushed aside {{by a more}} easily regulated construction environment using steel scaffolding. Rather than imposing alternative techniques, this research project recaptured the counter-narratives from the bamboo scaffolding tradition and integrated them in an adapted contemporary workflow. Thus, the ‘ZCB Bamboo Pavilion’ research project investigates how, through the combination of digital design technology, a culturally valuable yet imprecise local craft and an ecologically desirable yet volatile natural material can be practically applied as structural component in light-weiht, sustainable architecture.|$|R
2500|$|From 19 to 26 September 1940, sea {{and wind}} {{conditions}} on {{and over the}} Channel where the invasion was to take place were good overall, and a crossing, even using converted river barges, was feasible provided the sea state remained at less than 4, which {{for the most part}} it did. Winds {{for the remainder of the}} month were rated as [...] "moderate" [...] and would not have prevented the German invasion fleet from successfully depositing the first wave troops ashore during the ten days needed to accomplish this. From the night of 27 September, strong northerly winds prevailed, making passage more hazardous, but calm conditions returned on 11–12 October and again on 16–20 October. After that, light easterly winds prevailed which would have assisted any invasion craft travelling from the Continent towards the invasion beaches. But by the end of October, according to British Air Ministry records, very strong south-west winds (force 8) would have prohibited any non-seagoing <b>craft</b> from <b>risking</b> a Channel crossing.|$|R
40|$|This {{report shows}} that 473 people drowned in Australian {{waterways}} whilst participating in boating and watercraft activity {{over the past}} 10 years. This report shows males accounted for 92 % of all boating and watercraft related drowning deaths. This is even higher than the annual percentage of all male drowning deaths (83 %) for 2015 / 16, highlighting the importance of boating and watercraft safety for males in particular. With the summer holiday period fast approaching, {{it is vital that}} this safety message reaches men around the country. Almost one fifth of boating and watercraft drowning deaths (19 %) occurred in people over the age of 65 years, with 90 deaths recorded, and followed by 88 deaths in the 35 – 44 years age group (18 %). Drowning occurred whilst fishing (28 %) and when moving (27 %), and most often in small powered boats under 5 meters or paddle <b>craft.</b> High <b>risk</b> behaviour such as not wearing a lifejacket and consuming drugs and alcohol are key issues when participating in boating and watercraft activity across Australia. This study found that only 8 % of people were wearing a lifejacket at the time of death, 31 % had consumed drugs, of which 31 % were illegal drugs; 26 % of people had alcohol in their system, with 59 % above the legal driving limit...|$|R
40|$|An {{established}} line {{of research}} demonstrates that vague judicial opinions {{are less likely to}} be implemented than clear opinions. Vague opinions thus present a puzzle. Why would judges <b>craft</b> opinions that <b>risk</b> non-compliance? We argue that the relationships between judges and other policymakers in separation-of-powers systems are central to understanding this puzzle. Opinion vagueness reflects efforts to resolve core tradeoffs associated with judicial policy making that bear some resemblance to standard accounts of political delegation. Vagueness offers judges the ability to manage their uncertainty over policy outcomes and to hide likely defiance from public view. At the same time, vagueness removes a central source of pressure for compliance that judges can place on other policymakers. Using a game-theoretic model, we identify conditions under which judges use vagueness precisely as legislatures use statutory discretion. We also demonstrate conditions under which judges use vagueness in ways unanticipated by standard delegation accounts. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{appendix}} {{presents the}} methodology {{used to estimate}} the potential cancer risk from exposure to diesel particulate matter (PM) emissions from intrastate locomotives and harbor craft activities. This methodology was developed {{to assist in the}} development of the Proposed Regulatory Amendments Extending the California Motor Vehicle Diesel Standards to Diesel Fuel Used in Harborcraft and Intrastate Locomotives. The assumptions used to determine these risks are not based on a specific intrastate locomotive or harbor craft activity pattern. Instead, source parameters that represent possible operating scenarios were used. These estimated risks are used to provide an approximate range of potential risk levels from intrastate locomotive and harbor <b>craft</b> activities. Actual <b>risk</b> levels will vary due to site specific parameters, including the number of locomotives or harbor craft, the operation or activity, emission rates, operating schedules, site configuration, site meteorology, and distance to receptors. The methodology used in this risk assessment is consistent with the Tier- 1 analysis presented i...|$|R
60|$|As {{the vessels}} {{advanced}} north, the weather became cooler, {{as a matter}} of course, and the winds stronger. During the night of the 11th of February, the caravels made a great run on their course, gaining more than a hundred miles between sunset and sunrise. The next morning many birds were in sight, from which fact Columbus believed himself quite near the Azores, while the pilots fancied they were in the immediate vicinity of Madeira. The following day the wind was less favorable, though strong, and a heavy sea had got up. The properties of the little Niña now showed themselves to advantage, for, ere the turn of the day, she had to contend with such a struggle of the elements, as few in her had ever before witnessed. Fortunately, all that consummate seamanship could devise to render her safe and comfortable had been done, and she was in as perfect a state of preparation for a tempest, as circumstances would allow. The only essential defect was her unusual lightness, since, most of her stores as well as her water being nearly exhausted, her draught of water was materially less than it should have been. The caravel was so small, that this circumstance, which is of little consequence to the safety of large vessels, got to be one of consideration in a craft whose means of endurance did not place her above the perils of squalls. The reader will understand the distinction better when he is told that ships of size can only lose their spars by sudden gusts of wind, seldom being thrown on their beam ends, as it is termed, unless by the power of the waves; whereas, smaller <b>craft</b> incur the <b>risk</b> of being capsized, when the spread of their canvas is disproportioned to their stability. Although the seamen of the Niña perceived this defect in their caravel, which, in a great measure, proceeded from the consumption of the fresh water, they hoped so soon to gain a haven, that no means had been taken to remedy the evil.|$|R
40|$|Please {{contact the}} author {{directly}} for a DVD that accompanies the thesis In this thesis we consider how one {{may use the}} arts in narrative practise. The {{use of the word}} narrative practise as oppose to narrative therapy extends the grounding metaphor’s reach beyond its use in therapy to facilitation and all other disciplines that adopts the use of this metaphor. The arts in a contemporary perspective include dance, drama, fine arts, music and multimedia. The choice for the arts is found in the research gap, which emphasise that most conventional psychological therapies including narrative therapy has a conversational/ verbal approach. In contrast an exploration into the arts acknowledge the importance of being physically and creatively involved in the construction of meaningful realities. The exploration of the arts in light of possible interaction with narrative practise is not confined to professional voices but is inclusive of recreational skills in the arts and <b>crafts.</b> The <b>risk</b> involved in extending the scope of the narrative metaphor beyond therapy, which may render an unmanageable amount of data, is minimized by a positioning in a pastoral perspective; pastoral in this sense, the discipline of practical theology is situated in a (one) faith community. Chapter one considers questions of positioning relating to the arts and theology. These are informed by a certain epistemology. While methodological concerns and a positioning therein is all ready found in chapter one, chapter two is reserved for method and practical methodological concerns. Our research participants will be introduced here. Everything that this study says about the arts and its consideration in narrative practise is found in chapters three and four. Chapter three refers to all exposure from conferences attended to numerous individual conversations based on the highly reflective research design found in chapter two. In chapter three all the arts that this study was confronted with are included. Chapter four focuses in on story as art. I regard the differentiation between arts as therapy as opposed to arts in therapy as the most profound consideration. A distinction is advocated, drawing on narrative social constructionist epistemology, between story as tool versus story as grounding metaphor; telling narratives versus performing narratives, human story telling versus narrative identity. It is important to notice that this thesis is not presented according to themes. It is my intention that through the way in which this thesis is presented (especially so chapter three) fragments of the story of the research process will be evident. For this reason chapter five is included, giving the reader {{a better understanding of the}} ways in which the arts were found to function. Chapter six entails a personal and critical reflection on the research; it has the purpose of sayingwell, I don’t assume that this study is at the pinnacle of academic achievement nor is it the ultimate truth. I have myself wondered about the numerous addenda and I’m not sure that it is in an explorative study something one can too easily do without. Some addenda fit its conventional use while others contain highly relevant information. Since I did not want to force these into arguments I present them in addenda. What I hope the reader finds is a truthful reflection on what has to me been a meaningful research journey on the use of the arts in narrative practise; a journey accounted for in academic yet participant informed language; language about ways of being with people that at times can transcend the boundaries of the spoken word.

40|$|In Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., the U. S. Supreme Court vacated a {{state supreme}} court {{decision}} in which a justice who had received 3 million in campaign support from a litigant cast the deciding vote to relieve the litigant of a 50 million liability. The Court reached this result, one I view as compelled by common sense, through a 5 - 4 vote, with the dissenters, led by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, minimizing the danger of biased judging presented by the situation and questioning the practical feasibility of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s approach {{as well as the}} wisdom of expanding review of state court judicial disqualification pursuant to the Due Process Clause. Although its critics see Caperton as an unwise intrusion into state elections and state disqualification practice, Caperton 2 ̆ 7 s biggest problem is that it did not go far enough and make due process congruent with prevailing state and federal disqualification standards. By <b>crafting</b> an “serious <b>risk</b> of actual bias” test for due process-based constitutional disqualification that differs (albeit perhaps not greatly) from the well-established general approach to disqualification of a judge when his or her impartiality may be reasonably questioned, the Court has been unduly tentative and confusing in setting the parameters of judicial impartiality. The Court should recognize that any error in failing to recuse deprives the affected litigant of a fundamental constitutional right [...] the right to have the case heard by a neutral adjudicator. Consequently, any erroneous rejection of a request to recuse is at least technically one of constitutional dimension that should be potentially subject to U. S. Supreme Court review and correction. However, the Court need not become mired in the flood of disqualification cases predicted by the dissenting justices in Caperton. Insistence upon review of disqualification decisions by a neutral body of judges can be used to ensure that litigants receive sufficient procedural due process. The constitutional question surrounding judicial recusal is primarily one of procedural due process. If states put in place adequate procedures for deciding and reviewing disqualification motions, few Caperton-like situations compelling high court intervention are likely to ensue. Where erroneous recusal decisions occur in spite of such safeguards, U. S. Supreme Court review should be at least potentially available as necessary to vindicate the strong constitutional interest in neutral courts and fair adjudication, an interest sounding in substantive due process. The Court need exercise this potential power only in relatively egregious cases, thereby promoting judicial economy while nonetheless discouraging disqualification abuses...|$|R
