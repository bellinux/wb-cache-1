50|$|Charles Perfetti {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study called High Proficiency in a second Language is characterized by Greater Involvement of the First Language Network: Evidence from <b>Chinese</b> <b>Learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> to examine the processes of learning a second language. The first thing he does is talk about the assimilation and accommodation hypothesis that involve {{the process of learning}} a second language. The assimilation hypothesis argues that second language is learned through the brains access of networks used to process the native language. Accommodation hypothesis argues that learning of a second language depends on brain structures not involve in process of the native language. Two test these hypothesis, Perfetti and colleagues examined a group of Chinese speakers who happened to be late learners with various levels of proficiency in English. The experiment was divided into 3 groups. The (ce group), (cc group) and (ee group) consisted of Chinese speaking participants who performed an English word rhyming judgment task while fMRI was performed. Assimilation was analyzed by comparing the cc group to the ce group while accommodation was analyzed by comparing the (ee group). The study involved participants deciding whether two symbol patterns presented in sequence match or mismatched. Rhyming was seen as the same rhyme for the second character of the word while orthography was defined as having the same phonetic radical for the second character of the word.|$|E

40|$|Developing {{effectiveness}} in learning {{is the goal}} of teaching. In order to achieve this goal and {{to bridge the gap between}} teaching and learning in the EFL classroom, SLA researchers in the past decades have become increasingly interested in pedagogical conceptions, such as Learner-centredness, Communicative Language Teaching, and Task-Based Language Learning (TBL). In particular, research into TBL pedagogy has had an important influence on the field <b>of</b> <b>English</b> language teaching in recent years in the West. However, there have been few studies into TBL in the EFL classroom in Macau. Thus, this study explores whether or not task-based learning pedagogy could be beneficial to <b>Chinese</b> tertiary <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> Based on the philosophy of constructivism, the study aimed to investigate Chinese tertiary learners’ beliefs about and motivations for English learning through research carried out before, during and after the implementation of a specially designed programme <b>of</b> task-based <b>English</b> teaching. Twenty-four undergraduate learners from different regions of China were investigated by quantitative instruments (i. e., BALLI, and Motivation Questionnaire) and qualitative instruments (i. e., field-notes, ‘motivation’ graphs and notes, learner diaries, and follow-up interviews) before, during and after the 15 -week task-based EFL programme. Both quantitative and qualitative findings reflected that the learners’ self-concept beliefs and intrinsic motivation for English learning were increasingly enhanced by the task-based EFL programme, thus convincingly demonstrating that task-based learning pedagogy was beneficial to <b>Chinese</b> tertiary <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> The thesis concludes with a consideration of the implications of such task-based learning pedagogy for further research.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} use of lexical search strategies {{in the form of}} written translation from L 1 into L 2 by intermediate and advanced adult <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> as a foreign language. The purpose of the study was: (a) to identify and describe the lexical strategies employed by different proficiency levels of English-speaking learners of Chinese when they are unable to retrieve a word or phrase to express their meaning in the written translation task; (b) to investigate whether there is a relationship between {{the use of}} types of lexical strategies and the learners’ L 2 proficiency levels; (c) to explore the effectiveness of various types of strategies for different linguistic proficiency groups; (d) to demonstrate preferences of strategies between and within L 2 proficiency groups and individuals; and (e) to show the cause of the discrepancy between L 2 proficiency levels and translation competence and to reveal the characteristics of the learners’ thinking and lexical strategies when translating L 1 into L 2. Adopting think-aloud protocol and retrospective interviews as research methods to collect empirical data, all think-aloud protocols and retrospective data were recorded and transcribed in order to single out lexical strategies employed by <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> at different proficiency levels. Variations of strategies between and within proficiency groups and individuals were processed statistically and the significance of the use of various lexical strategies was testified by means of referential statistics. By analyzing the data and referring to the theoretical background of the bilingual mental lexicon (De Bot, 1993), language transfer (Odlin, 1989; Ringbom, 1987, 1991, 2001) and communication strategies (Bialystok, 1990; Kasper & Kellerman, 1997; Tarone, 1983), these findings were obtained from the study: (1) A taxonomy of lexical strategies by <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> at intermediate level and advanced level was identified; (2) Advanced <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> preferred L 2 -based strategies while intermediate <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> chose strategies which were rooted in their native language; (3) There were certain changes in the strategies used within both L 1 -based and L 2 -based categories of lexical strategies; (4) The effectiveness of lexical strategies employed by <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> depended on the ‘ease of comprehension’ (Littlemore, 2003); (5) Noun-plus-noun compound structure was used more by intermediate Chinese learners, even though advanced learners also applied the strategy to some extent because the Chinese language favors the structure of compounding; and (6) L 2 proficiency level did not correspond to translation production competence. L 2 proficiency level is not the only factor that determines the translation production quality. The findings of the study make it possible to conclude that <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> at different L 2 proficiency levels may apply a combination of lexical search strategies, but preferences of lexical strategies exist among individuals and within linguistic proficiency groups. The teaching implications elicited in the study may be helpful for searching words in the learner’s mental lexicon. Thus the teaching of lexical strategies may be worthwhile (Zimmermann, 1999). Although the findings of the study may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} L 2 acquisition and bilingualism, the scope of this study is, of course, limited, and further research is needed...|$|E

It focuses on the polysemeous nature of “wh” words, which can be usedas interrogatives, declaratives and to introduce subordinate clauses. The analysis of “wh” sentences in EFL textbooks showed that there are more prototypical examples at low proficiency levels. When teaching the interrogative, textbooks focus almost exclusively on grammatical words, particularly at the beginners’ level. The analysis of “wh” sentences elicited from <b>Chinese</b> speaking <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and Expert users <b>of</b> <b>English</b> suggested that the prototypical structure is very strong in both sets of data, although native speakers tend to use more prefabricated chunks of language.

The use of different words occurring immediately after “wh” words in the two corpora can be explained by (1) the relatively small vocabulary size of the L 2 speakers; (2) non-native speakers’ lack of awareness of restricted collocations; (3) L 1 transfer; (4) over/under-generalization of rules and (5) textbooks.

However, findings showing that basic-level words possess a superior status in human communication and vocabulary learning (Rosch et al. 1976; Kövecses 2006) so far pertained only to individuals’ L 1.

A combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses was based on class observations (two classes per type) and subsequent teacher interviews. CS behaviour was analysed in relation to the particular teaching focus of the task at hand. Interviews included a stimulated recall technique using selected CS extracts to enrich insights from the teachers' perspective. The results showed a higher student response frequency as well as a longer mean utterance length in CS classes.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{non-native}} {{language acquisition}} of the verbal and nominal functional domains in Second language (L 2) English and second/third language (L 2 /L 3) French by Chinese and Vietnamese speakers. Six experimental studies are reported. Two current competing theories {{in the field of}} theoretical second language acquisition (L 2 A), namely, the Failed Features Hypothesis (FFH) and the Full Transfer Full Access (FTFA) model are compared and their applicability to third language acquisition (L 3 A) evaluated in the light of our data. A version of the Minimalist Program is assumed in this work. Predictions based on FFH and FTFA are as follows: As far as L 2 A is concerned, both FFH and FTFA predict full transfer of L 1 in the L 2 initial state. With respect to L 3 A, FFH predicts the initial state to be L 1 while FTFA predicts either L 1 or L 2. The two models diverge regarding their predictions on the L 2 /L 3 transitional and steady states. In particular, FFH hypothesizes permanent "failure" and persistent L 1 influence in L 2 /L 3 interlanguage while FTFA hypothesizes full access and acquirability of target structures. Three L 2 /L 3 experimental studies on the verbal functional domain (i. e. tense and agreement) and another three on the nominal functional domain (i. e. the Determiner Phrase) were conducted. Subjects include <b>Chinese</b> monolingual <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> Vietnamese monolingual <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> French as well as Chinese-English bilingual <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> French. A variety of tasks were used to test the predictions made by the two models. Results demonstrate partial transfer of L 1 in the L 2 initial state and of L 2 in the L 3 initial state, and point towards full access in the L 2 /L 3 steady states. These findings {{do not seem to be}} consistent with FFH. It appears that FTFA is a more viable theory for non-native language acquisition. We also contend that L 3 A is not simply another case of L 2 A...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of second {{language}} acquisition, vocabulary researchers have long noted that fully learning a word includes not only learning its form and meaning, but also acquiring grammatical restrictions on its use (Nation, 2001; Richards, 1976). However, no prior work has sought to categorize the various restrictions and phenomena that fall under this umbrella, nor has a consistent term been adopted to refer to it. The present study named this area of linguistic knowledge the Grammatical Usage of Vocabulary (GUV) and compiled a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>English</b> {{as a second language}} (L 2) GUV errors noted in prior work and observed in corpora <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> language. The final taxonomy included errors related to word form and word class, transfer of usage restrictions cross-linguistically, transfer of restrictions intra-linguistically between zero-derived word forms and between synonyms, and argument realization errors with adjectives and verbs. The case of participial (-ing 2 ̆ 6 -ed) adjective usage was then analyzed in detail to determine what might make GUV difficult for learners to acquire, and to develop an argument for why explicit instruction may sometimes be necessary. A mixed-methods intervention study was then conducted with <b>Chinese</b> adult <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> to determine 1) what qualitative evidence could point to sources of difficulty in learning participial adjective usage, and 2) whether learners 2 ̆ 7 noticing, knowledge, and productive usage of participial adjectives could be assisted through a language-focused task-based intervention with explicit information. Qualitative think-aloud and sentence production evidence indicated that learners 2 ̆ 7 untargetlike usage patterns could be caused by confusions of word forms, low cue reliability, and cross-linguistic transfer. The quasi-experimental results indicated that interactive tasks did encourage noticing of GUV, and qualitative analysis found links between noticing and improvements from pre- to post-tests. However, while the data trended in the expected direction, no conclusive quantitative results were found regarding the efficacy of tasks for knowledge and production of participial adjectives. ...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates pragmatic {{transfer}} in persuasion strategies by <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> The {{subjects of the}} study include ten native English speakers, ten <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and ten native Chinese speakers. All of them are university students. The classification of persuasion strategies is mainly based on Hardin‘s classification of lexical and pragmatic realization of persuading speech act. The data is collected {{by means of a}} discourse complete test questionnaire The Chi-square test is used to compare frequencies of use of persuasion strategies by the Chinese learner of English group, the native English group and the native Chinese group. Results indicate that although all three groups use complaint strategy most frequently and opting out strategy least frequently, the Chinese learner of English group displays advice/suggestion/recommendation strategy more frequently than the native English group. The Chinese learner of English group also uses opinion-proving strategy less frequently than the native English group and never uses consolation/ condolence strategy. Such pragmatic transfer is transferred from Chinese culture and Chinese thinking pattern, which provides pedagogical implication for language teachers to develop Chinese students‘ English pragmatic competenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether adult Japanese and chinese learners of Engish have access to the narrow-range rules for the dative alternation in English Proposed by Pinker (1989). Speclfically, based on certain analyses of the dative constructions in Japanese and chinese and Bley-Vroman's Fundamental Difference Hypothesis. It was hypothesized that (a) adult Japanese learners of English would have access to the dative consequence of ballisticness, but not to the syntactic consequence of manner of speaking for the drtl-ve elternation in English and that (b) adult <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> would have access to the latter, but not to the former. Thirty-two native speakerg of English, thirty-two adult Japanese learners of English and thirty-two adult <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> served as subjects. A modified version of the questionnaire containing real and made-up verbs developed by Yoshinaga (1991) and Bley-Vroman and Yoshinaga (1992) was used. OnIy hypothesis (b) was supported by the results. Based on the results, the pobability of selective access to UG in second language acquisition is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{the speech}} act of refusal is {{universal}} across language, the politeness value {{and the types}} of linguistic forms used to perform it vary across language and culture. The majority of the comparative pragmatic research findings were derived from one single source of data (i. e., either production data or perception data). Few {{attempts have been made to}} collect different sources of data to triangulate the findings. This study attempts to fill this gap by examining the problems that <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> encounter when performing refusal responses through the comparison of production and perception data between an NS group and a <b>Chinese</b> <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> group. The results showed that one major problem found in Chinese EFL learners' production and perception regarding refusing in English involved their relying on the indirect L 1 communication style manifested in the less frequent use of direct refusal strategies and frequent use of excuse/reason with specific and significant details in L 2 refusals. The other major problem in Chinese EFL learners' refusal responses concerned the ungrammatical sentences and inaccurate word choice, which often caused confusion...|$|E
40|$|A {{production}} {{task and}} a cross-modal priming experiment {{were used to}} investigate the influences of accented pronunciation and linguistic experience on recognition of non-native spoken words. A masked face prime image was also shown to determine if seeing a face that matched the ethnicity and gender of {{the speaker of the}} auditory prime would facilitate accented word recognition. <b>Chinese</b> and Iranian <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> heard words containing either an /s/ or a /t/ substitution for the interdental fricative /θ/. A mixed-effects model analysis of the response time data showed that participant groups differed markedly depending on the prime condition and the speaker. Chinese participants showed significant facilitation for /s/ primes spoken by the Chinese speaker, inhibition for /s/ primes spoken by the Iranian speaker, and no priming effects for the /t/ substitution. The Iranian participants, on the other hand, appear not to have been affected by the substitutions for /θ/ but rather by the accent itself, showing a marginally significant facilitation for both /s/ and /t/ variants when they were spoken by the Iranian speaker. This study provides empirical evidence that participants with different L 1 s do not necessarily process accented words produced by speakers with different L 1 s in the same way: segmental substitution may weigh more heavily for some groups, while others may be affected by phonetic detail of the accent as a whole. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a surge of studies {{on the extent to}} which even very {{proficient}} second language (L 2) learners can become native-like in their real-time comprehension of sentences. Two areas of focus have been (1) whether proficient L 2 speakers compute syntactic structures that have the same complexity as native language (L 1) users’, and (2) whether they do so within the same time frame (e. g. [2, 4]). Filler-gap constructions have revealed much about the sentence-processing system (example 2 a). There is ample evidence that L 1 speakers quickly identify the filler and attempt to connect it to a predicate, but the picture for L 2 learners is mixed, (e. g., [2, 4]). It is likely that more proficient L 2 learners show more native-like processing of filler-gap sentences, but to our knowledge this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We used ERP to test the comprehension of filler-gap sentences in L 1 and L 2 speakers, and used an individual differences approach to examine the relationship between L 2 proficiency and N 400 effects. Participants: (1) 19 L 1 English speakers; (2) 19 native <b>Chinese</b> speakers, advanced <b>learners</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> Materials were fashioned after those in Garnsey et al. [3]. 30 sets of sentences with embedded questions were created: half plausible, half implausible; half were headed by ‘whether’, half began with ‘which’. Procedure: Participants completed 2 sessions, separated by 1 week, so that they read all 30 items from each condition. Each EEG recording session consisted of 4 blocks of 30 sentences, for a total of 240 sentences...|$|R
