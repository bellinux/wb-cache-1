5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal <b>carotid</b> <b>artery,</b> and the artery of the pterygoid canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external <b>carotid</b> <b>artery,</b> and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} is {{less common}} than <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> dissection (dissection {{of the large}} arteries {{in the front of}} the neck). The two conditions together account for 10–25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more severe disability and a very small proportion (about 2%) dying from complications. It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist C. Miller Fisher.|$|E

5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
5|$|With smaller prey, such as {{monkeys and}} hares, the tiger bites the nape, often {{breaking}} the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common <b>carotid</b> <b>artery.</b> Though rarely observed, some tigers {{have been recorded}} to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of sloth bears.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} Cheirogaleidae, fork-marked lemurs {{are the most}} phylogenetically distinct, {{although}} their placement remained uncertain until recently. One uniting characteristic (synapomorphy) among all cheirogaleids, {{to the exclusion of}} other lemurs, is the branching of the <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> along with how it enters the skull—a trait which is shared by fork-marked lemurs. Analyses based on morphology, immunology, and repetitive DNA have given contradictory placements of Phaner, while studies in 2001 and 2008 either lacked data or yielded poor resolution of their placement.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{head and}} neck cancer (HNC) patients, {{long-term}} treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT) -induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT. METHODS: MRI of the <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> In case of wall thickening (>/= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6. 8 (1. 3) years. In total 62 % were men and 60 % had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> and internal <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58 % of irradiated versus 27 % of non-irradiated common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> and 24 % of irradiated versus 6 % of non-irradiated internal <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (p < 0. 05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was 2. 5 (0. 9) and 2 (0. 7) mm (p = 0. 02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated internal <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was 1. 8 (0. 8) and 1. 5 mm (0. 3) (n. s.). Mean length of the thickened vessel wall was 48 mm versus 36 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (p = 0. 03) and 20 mm versus 15 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated internal <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (n. s.). No significant differences were observed for signal intensities of the vessel walls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed significantly more vessel wall thickening in irradiated versus non-irradiated <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> years after RT for HNC, while no differences in signal intensities were observed...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of CT {{datasets}} {{is commonly}} time consuming {{because of the}} required manual interaction. We present a novel and fast automatic initialization algorithm to detect the <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> providing a fully automated approach of the segmentation and centerline detection. First, the volume of interest (VOI) is estimated using a shoulder landmark. The <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> are subsequently detected in axial slices of the VOI by applying a circular Hough transform. To select <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> related signals in the Hough space, a 3 -D, direction dependent hierarchical clustering is used. To allow a successful detection {{for a wide range}} of vessel diameters, a feedback architecture was introduced. The algorithm was designed and optimized using a training set of 20 patients and subsequently evaluated using 31 test datasets.

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the <b>carotid</b> <b>artery,</b> which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external <b>carotid</b> <b>artery,</b> and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate whether balloon injury induces nitric oxide synthase activity in the blood vessel wall. Contractions to phenylephrine were compared in left <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> of the rat, previously injured by balloon catheterization and excised either immediately (t= 0), 6, or 24 hours after the procedure, with those in control right <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (with and without endothelium). Phenylephrine evoked comparable concentration-dependent contractions in balloon-injured (t= 0) and control <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> without endothelium, whereas those in control arteries with endothelium were depressed. In the balloon-injured <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (6 and 24 hours), the concentration-contraction curves to phenylephrine were shifted to the right compared with those observed in balloon-injured arteries (t= 0). In balloon-injured <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (6 hours), the hyporeactivity to phenylephrine was enhanced by superoxide dismutase. In balloon-injured <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (24 hours), nitro-L-arginine and methylene blue restored full contractions, whereas superoxide dismutase potentiated the hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine. The depressed contractions were associated with a concomitant increase in the basal level of cGMP; this production was abolished by nitro-L-arginine. The depression of the concentration-contraction curves to phenylephrine and the increase of the tissue level of cGMP induced by interleukin- 1 β (4 hours) were more pronounced in balloon-injured arteries (24 hours) than in control arteries without endothelium. The effects of interleukin- 1 β were inhibited by nitro- L-arginine. These observations indicate that in vivo endothelial injury of the rat <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> induces the production of nitric oxide from L- arginine in the blood vessel wall, an effect which is potentiated by interleukin- 1 β. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E
