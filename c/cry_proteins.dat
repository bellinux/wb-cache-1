5|$|In 2008 a {{meta-analysis}} of 25 independent studies assessing effects of Bt <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> on honeybee survival (mortality) showed that Bt proteins used in commercialized GE crops to control lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not negatively impact {{the survival of}} honeybee larvae or adults. Additionally, larvae consume only a small percent of their protein from pollen, {{and there is also}} a lack of geographic correlation between GM crop locations and regions where CCD occurs.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), and Cryptochrome (<b>CRY)</b> <b>proteins,</b> BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER and CRY levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER and CRY transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER and CRY gene coding sequences. The level of PER and <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER and CRY can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{currently}} available genes used to engineer insect resistance {{come from the}} Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium. Most are {{in the form of}} delta endotoxin genes known as <b>cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> while a few use the genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins. Insect resistant crops target various species of coleopteran (beetles) and lepidopteran (moths). The only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from B. thuringiensis is the Cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI was first approved for use cotton in 1999 and is currently undergoing trials in rice.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{experimental}} results, the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> represents approximately 6 % of the dry cell weight. This result is below some previously reported values (Table 3). However, {{there is not enough}} reports using SDS-PAGE for <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> quantification and therefore it is difficult to establish a comparison. The <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> concentrations reported in literature are scattered and confused. For example, while Rowe and Margaritis ([1987]) reported that after cell lysis the endospore and <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> mass were 15 % of the biomass dry weight, Agaisse and Lereclus ([1995]) reported that <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> can account for up to 25 % of the dry weight of the sporulated cells. Even some values from the literature of <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> concentration are much higher, for example: Anderson and Jayaraman ([2005]) reported 98 % of the biomass dry weight (calculated from the reported values of 15.7 g/L of <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> from 16 g/L of biomass, Table 3). Considering these data, the yields coefficient of Cry from biomass are 0.98 g Cry/g biomass (Table 3), which means that almost every cell is transformed into <b>Cry</b> <b>protein.</b> In the same way, the yield coefficient of Cry from biomass obtained by Chang et al. ([2008]) and Dang Vu et al. ([2009]) seems excessively high (Table 3).|$|R
30|$|Bacillus thuringiensis (B. thuringiensis) is a Gram-positive endospore-forming {{bacterium}} {{isolated from}} soil that synthesizes a crystalline Î´-endotoxin <b>protein,</b> named <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> (Ito et al. [2004]). The main {{application of the}} <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> is the biological control of certain insects of several orders (Ito et al. [2004]). It has been also reported that some non-toxic <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> for insects are highly cytotoxic {{to a wide range}} of mammalian cells, particularly human cancer cells (Ito et al. [2004]). <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production by B. thuringie nsis has been largely studied. Many different culture media formulations, carbon-nitrogen ratios, operating conditions and production systems have been used in order to improve the cost-productivity relation (Farrera et al. [1998]; Navarro et al. [2006]; Ozcan et al. [2010]; Zhuang et al. [2011]). Also, several mathematical models describing the growth and endospore formation kinetics of B. thuringiensis are available (Kraemer-Schafhalter and Moser [1996]; Liu and Tzeng [2000]; Popovic et al. [2001]; Rivera et al. [1999]; Starzak and Bajpai [1991]).|$|R
30|$|The {{kinetics}} of <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> during B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD- 73 cultivations {{are shown}} in Figure 2 d. From the first 10 to 12 hours of culture there is no Cry formation. Then, the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> is accumulated {{until the end of}} the culture (Figure 2 d). At the same time, cells are dying, so active biomass diminish, there is no carbon source consumption and the PHB is consumed (Figure 2).|$|R
50|$|In 1996 another {{class of}} insecticidal {{proteins}} in Bt was discovered; the vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip). Vip proteins {{do not share}} sequence homology with <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> in general do not compete for the same receptors, and some kill different insects than do <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|E
50|$|Concerns {{over the}} safety of {{consumption}} of genetically-modified plant materials that contain <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> have been addressed in extensive dietary risk assessment studies. While the target pests {{are exposed to the}} toxins primarily through leaf and stalk material, <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> are also expressed {{in other parts of the}} plant, including trace amounts in maize kernels which are ultimately consumed by both humans and animals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} combat growing pest resistance, Cry6Aa is {{implemented}} in transgenic plants because it targets pests differently, increasing susceptibility. DNA shuffling {{is the process}} of selecting genes of compatible <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> to transfer into crops. Although the binding site of Cry6Aa is unknown, several sites have been ruled out, allowing successful Cry protein stacking. Because an organism has to be resistant to both expressed <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> to survive, the chances of developing and vertically transferring resistance is lower, granting more time for pesticide research. In 2013, Cry6Aa and Cry3Aa combination transgenic plants were patented to prevent resistance in the western corn rootworm. [...] Additionally, Cry6Aa has been layered with Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1, a binary toxin. Pyramiding <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> can enhance the effect of toxins. Cry6Aa and Cry55Aa both can reduce brood size of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, but when they are combined, these two proteins are five times more effective. Synergy between <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> comes from either improved toxin docking, membrane insertion, or advanced degradation of the midgut protein matrix which increases action of the slower acting toxin.|$|E
30|$|The biodynamic model {{represents}} {{the evolution of}} the B. thuringiensis fermentation and it was used to study the dynamic of the process. The three phases of the fermentation are related between them and the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production {{is the result of the}} interaction between those phases. Therefore, the endospore formation is related with the vegetative growth and the endospore-Cry formation is related with the transition phase. This means that the bacilli disappearance is related with DPA (endospore) formation through YDPA/X. In the same way, the PHB consumption is related with DPA-Cry production through YDPA/PHB and YCry/PHB. These yields were calculated with the model (Table 2) and they show a different relationship with the glucose concentration in the media. The YCry/PHB increases and the YDPA/PHB decreases when the initial nutrient concentration increases. These results suggest that endospore formation consumes preferably the PHB and excess (if any) is used in the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> formation. There is not data available in the literature to compare these results and further experiments have to be done. Also, the biodynamic model simulation results indicate that the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production is a function of development of the three fermentation phases, and that endospore and <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production are competitive processes. Therefore, the optimization of each phase cannot be done independently. The reports in the literature usually do not take into account the transition phase neither the PHB production as important variables for Cry production. However, the biodynamic model implies that PHB is crucial for endospore and <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, genetically {{modified}} maize producing Bt <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> was approved, which killed the European corn borer and related species; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae.|$|R
50|$|Overexpression of Cry {{also affects}} {{circadian}} light responses. In Drosophila, Cry overexpression increases flies' sensitivity to low-intensity light. This light regulation of <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of other clock genes and components.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{model is}} found in mice, in which BMAL1 dimerizes with CLOCK to {{activate}} per and cryptochrome (cry) transcription. PER and <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> form a heterodimer which acts on the CLOCK-BMAL heterodimer to repress the transcription of per and cry. The heterodimer CLOCK:BMAL1 functions similarly to other transcriptional activator complexes; CLOCK:BMAL1 interacts with the E-box regulatory elements. PER and <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulate and dimerize during subjective night, and translocate into the nucleus {{to interact with the}} CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, directly inhibiting their own expression. This research has been conducted and validated through chrystallographic analysis.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), and Cryptochrome (<b>CRY)</b> <b>proteins,</b> BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER and CRY levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER and CRY transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER and CRY gene coding sequences. The level of PER and <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER and CRY can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|E
5000|$|The monarch {{clockwork}} model, {{which has}} both Drosophila-like and mammal-like aspects, is unique because it employs two distinct <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins.</b> As {{presented in a}} 2010 review paper, the clock mechanism, on a gene/protein level, operates as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Cryptochrome, {{like many}} genes {{involved}} in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in mRNA and protein levels. In Drosophila, Cry mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), {{with high levels}} in light and low levels in the dark. This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude. The transcription of the Cry gene also cycles with a similar trend. <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> levels, however, cycle in a different manner than Cry transcription and mRNA levels. In LD, <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> has low levels in light and high levels in dark, and, in DD, CRY levels increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night. Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock {{at the transcriptional level}} and by light at the translational and posttranslational level.|$|R
30|$|Stage I {{starts at}} the {{beginning}} of the sporulation process (t 0); stage II, the first hour; stage III, 1 h after t 0; stage IV, 2 h after t 0; stage V, 4 h after t 0; stage VI, 5 h after t 0; and stage VII, more than 5 h after t 0. Figure 2 c shows that, in general, the DPA is detected two hours earlier than endospore. This would be expected because during stage V, DPA synthetase is encoded by spoVF (Paidhungat et al. [2000]), and after stage VII, mature endospores are released (Bechtel and Bulla [1976]). During sporulation process, cells are dying, viable cells decrease, the PHB is consumed, but there is no carbon source consumption (Figure 2). Therefore, the PHB becomes the carbon and energy source for <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production as it have been suggested by Benoit et al. ([1990]), Kraemer-Schafhalter and Moser ([1996]), Navarro et al. ([2006]) and Rowe and Margaritis ([1987]). Figures 2 c and d show that, in general, the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> is detected before than endospore. This would be expected because the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> is first observed during stage III and the crystal protein is almost full-sized during stage IV of sporulation (Bechtel and Bulla [1976]).|$|R
30|$|As show in Figure 1 b the biodynamic {{model has}} three {{principal}} modules interconnected, {{one for each}} phase. Module 1 represents the vegetative growth, module 2 represents the transition and module 3 represents the sporulation phase. In general terms, during vegetative growth the substrate is used to generate new cells and carbon dioxide. The CO 2 is released due to the respiration process. During transition the substrate is accumulated as PHB. While during sporulation: there is no substrate consumption; PHB is consumed; the vegetative cell is transformed into endospore; {{and in the same}} period of time the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> is produced from protein turnover (Anderson et al. [2002]). The PHB is the energy source for endospore and <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> formation processes. Thus, module 1 and module 2 are related with module 3.|$|R
50|$|The closest {{homologue}} to Fbxl3 is Fbxl21 as it also binds to the CRY1 and CRY2 proteins. Predominantly localized to the cytosol, Fbxl21 antagonizes {{the action}} of Fbxl3 through ubiquitination and stabilization of <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> instead of leading it to degradation.|$|E
50|$|Cry6Aa has pore-forming {{action that}} destroys insect {{intestinal}} epithelial cells. Most <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> have 3 domains, but Cry6Aa is composed largely of alpha helices, which indicates different membrane insertion methods. Cry6Aa has catalytic head domains regulated by hydrophobic residues. When Cry6Aa is first ingested, {{it remains a}} pro-toxin until intestinal proteases cleave the protein into active particles. After activation, the beta tongue head domain binds with the target membranes on brush border membrane cells similar to Haemolysin E. Typical <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> are enhanced by interactions with cadherin, but Cry6Aa receptors remain unknown. Experimental data suggests the proteins embed in the membrane and form oligomeric pores, but the complete mechanism has not been deduced in 2016.|$|E

30|$|Major {{contemporary}} Bt corn events {{targeting the}} ECB synthesize {{nearly as much}} or more insecticidal <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> per hectare than the weighted-average rate of conventional insecticides applied on a hectare planted to Bt corn for ECB control (about 0.15 kgs insecticide per ha; 0.13 pounds/acre in 2010 [Additional file 1 : Table S 11]). MON 810, the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> in Monsantoâs original Yieldgard corn, expresses 0.2 kgs/ha of endotoxin, whereas Syngentaâs Bt 11 synthesizes 0.28 kgs/ha [Additional file 1 : Table S 22]. Newer events for ECB control like Monsantoâs Genuity VT Double PRO (MON 89034) produce Cry 1 A. 105 and Cry 2 Ab 2 endotoxins totaling 0.62 kgs/ha. The Dow AgroSciences-Pioneer Hi-Bred Herculex I (TC 1507) event expresses the least endotoxin â 0.1 [*]kg Bt endotoxin per hectare â just below the rate of insecticides applied.|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the test}} with sera from patients, {{potential}} allergenicity in parental plants {{was assessed by}} applying a pepsin digestion assay. As a result, the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> is thought to degrade rapidly in the gastrointestinal tract {{and the risk of}} triggering immune system responses was regarded as being low. However, Chowdhury et al. [66] and Walsh et al. [47] have found <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>proteins</b> in {{the lower part of the}} gastrointestinal tract of pigs fed with a diet containing Bt maize. This directly challenges the above-mentioned view of rapid degradation of <b>Cry</b> 1 A <b>proteins</b> in the stomach. It appears that the <b>Cry</b> 1 A <b>proteins</b> can show a much higher stability in monogastric species than predicted by current in vitro digestion experiments. Further, and more specifically in regard to Intacta soybeans, it has to be taken into account that the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> expressed in the soybeans might be much more resistant to degradation than that expressed in maize, due to the occurrence of a higher level of proteinase inhibitors. Thus, Bt toxins are not likely to be degraded rapidly in the gut and can persist in larger amounts until digestion is complete and there is enough time for interaction between various food compounds. The need for further investigations was also confirmed by Guimaraes et al. [67], who showed that <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>proteins</b> were stable and conserved their immunoreactivity by using a physiologically more relevant digestion model. In addition, a study commissioned by EFSA [68] shows that the in vitro pepsin tests used to date are not likely to provide reliable results.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{claim that}} Bt {{proteins}} could target predatory and other beneficial or harmless insects {{as well as}} the targeted pest. These proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with no ill effects on the environment reported. While cyt proteins are toxic towards the insect order Diptera (flies), certain <b>cry</b> <b>proteins</b> selectively target lepidopterans (moths and butterflies), while other cyt selectively target Coleoptera.

50|$|Cry6Aa is a toxic {{crystal protein}} {{generated}} by the bacterial family Bacillus thuringiensis during sporulation. This protein {{is a member of}} the alpha pore forming toxins family, which gives it insecticidal qualities advantageous in agricultural pest control. Each Cry protein has some level of target specificity; Cry6Aa has specific toxic action against coleopteran insects and nematodes. The corresponding B. thuringiensis gene, cry6aa, is located on bacterial plasmids. Along with several other Cry protein genes, cry6aa can be genetically recombined in Bt corn and Bt cotton so the plants produce specific toxins. Insects are developing resistance to the most commonly inserted proteins like Cry1Ac. Since Cry6Aa proteins function differently than other <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> they are combined with other proteins to decrease the development of pest resistance. Recent studies suggest this protein functions better in combination with other virulence factors such as other <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> and metalloproteinases.|$|E
50|$|These genetically {{modified}} plants with Bt toxin are grown {{on a large}} scale around the world. Monsantoâs corn line MON810 is produced by ballistically transforming another corn line with a plasmid, PV-ZMCT01. This plasmid has a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and hsp70 maize intron sequences which drive the expression of the Cry1Ab gene. The gene then codes for delta endotoxins (<b>Cry</b> <b>proteins)</b> which are toxins that are very potent and provoke lesions in the cell membrane causing cell death These produced Bt toxins bind to certain localized sites on the epithelium of the midgut of insects. Proteins need specific receptors on cells in order to form the <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> and become toxic, which is why the toxins are specific for the order Lepidoptera. The receptors are important for binding the toxic protein and starting the signal cascade, but the exact mechanism of these toxins is not well understood.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the fate of Bt toxins that are ingested in foods.

30|$|Mathematical {{models have}} been used from growth kinetic {{simulation}} to gen regulatory networks prediction for B. thuringiensis culture. However, this culture is a time dependent dynamic process where cells physiology suffers several changes depending on {{the changes in the}} cell environment. Therefore, through its culture, B. thuringiensis presents three phases related with the predominance of three major metabolic pathways: vegetative growth (Embded-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway), transition (Î³-aminobutiric cycle) and sporulation (tricarboxylic acid cycle). There is not available a mathematical model that relates the different stages of cultivation with the metabolic pathway active on each one of them. Therefore, in the present study, and based on published data, a biodynamic model was generated to describe the dynamic of the three different phases based on their major metabolic pathways. The biodynamic model is used to study the interrelation between the different culture phases and their relationship with the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production. The model consists of three interconnected modules where each module represents one culture phase and its principal metabolic pathway. For model validation four new fermentations were done showing that the model constructed describes reasonably well the dynamic of the three phases. The main results of this model imply that poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate is crucial for endospore and <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production. According to the yields of dipicolinic acid and Cry from poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate, calculated with the model, the endospore and <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> production are not just simultaneous and parallel processes they are also competitive processes.|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} the insecticidal effect of the delta-endotoxin crystal protein CryIC on the relatively Cry-insensitive larvae of Spodoptera littoralis, a combination of CryIC and endochitinase was used.

The endochitinase on its own, even at very low concentrations (0. 1 microgram/ml), perforated the larval midgut peritrophic membrane. When applied together with low concentrations of CryIC, a synergistic toxic effect was obtained. In the absence of chitinase, about 20 micrograms of CryIC per ml was required to obtain maximal reduction in larval weight, while only 3. 0 micrograms of CryIC per ml caused a similar toxic effect {{in the presence of}} endochitinase.
