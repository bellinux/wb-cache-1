This procedure ensured the permanent presence {{of at least two}} men on the lighthouse, which was essential not only to service but to ensure accurate recordkeeping.|$|E

25|$|Between 1764 and 1767, Mende was {{the witness}} the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> of the wolf-hunters of the king, {{who came to}} seek rest in the city before {{returning}} to hunt the beast which was terrorising {{the north of the}} country. It was seen close to Mende, once at Pailhou and between Rieutort-de-Randon and Chastel-Nouvel but remained primarily in Margeride. At this time the quarrel between the consul and the bishop was brought up to date by the edict on municipal organizations. The burghers and nobles opposed, but the bishop finally retained power in 1771.|$|E

Fans and relatives gathered for the unveiling in Camden's Stable Market, {{where it will be}} a permanent memorial to her. London-based Eaton, who sculpted the piece after being introduced to Winehouse's father Mitch, said the statue was meant to capture her [...] "attitude and strength, but also give subtle hints of insecurity." [...] Her father Mitch said of the statue: [...] "Now Amy will oversee the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> of her home town forever... Amy was in love with Camden and it is the place her fans {{from all over the world}} associate her with." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{traditional}} Ainsworth et al.

Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviors led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively 'loose' terminology for these subgroups. B1's have {{been referred to as}} 'secure-reserved', B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as 'secure-balanced', and B4's as 'secure-reactive'. In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply [...] "B1" [...] or [...] "B2" [...] although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.|$|E

500|$|Khrushchev {{was granted}} a pension of 500 rubles per month and was assured that his house and dacha were his for life. Following his removal from power, he fell into deep depression. He {{received}} few visitors, especially since his security guards kept track of all guests and reported their <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings.</b> In the fall of 1965, {{he and his wife}} were ordered to leave their house and dacha to move to an apartment and to a smaller dacha. His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards. The depression continued, and his doctor prescribed sleeping pills and tranquilizers. [...] One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, [...] "Grandfather cries." [...] He was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume Great Soviet Encyclopedia omitted his name from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.|$|E
500|$|As a {{condition}} of his release at Leipzig, he agreed {{not to participate in}} combat against France. [...] Subsequent to his release, Merveldt was appointed commanding general of Moravia, and lived in Brno, where he received in January 1814 the instructions to proceed to London as an envoy extraordinaire to the Court of St. James's, replacing Baron Wessembourg. He arrived in London in early March, and met the Prince Regent at Carlton House on 7March 1814, where he ceremoniously presented his ambassadorial credentials. He was well-received in Britain, and became a notable personage, invited to many social events; he told good stories about the wars and the various people he had encountered, which made him popular in social circles. [...] His <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> were widely reported in the society columns: For example, on 4July 1814, he attended a lecture by the Abbé Secard, and was listed among the distinguished persons present. When he died in 1815, the British government proposed to bury him at Westminster Abbey. However, his widow took into account his last wishes and had the remains sent to Germany. He was buried in the crypt of the Michaelis chappel in Lembeck Castle where his grave still exists.|$|E

[...] "They wanted us to act 'like a rock band' and we just told them to fuck themselves," [...] remembered Trucks. For their part, {{the members of the}} band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. [...] "Everyone told us we'd fall by the wayside down there," [...] said Gregg Allman, but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records [...] "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers". The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> at which reminded them of New York City's Idlewild Airport. Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was [...] "where the brotherhood came to pass," [...] according to roadie Kim Payne; [...] "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [...] 100 percent." [...] Much of the material presented on the band's second album, Idlewild South, originated at the cabin. Oakley's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed [...] "the Big House" [...] in March 1970.|$|E

500|$|The site of Köllnischer Park {{was just}} outside Cölln in the Middle Ages. Until the mid-17th century, it was undeveloped low-lying, swampy land prone to {{flooding}} by the Spree. Following the decision by Frederick William, the 'Great Elector' to encircle Berlin with fortifications, this became the location of Bastion VII, which was known {{at the time as}} [...] "the bulwerk in the morass'. The work required the creation of large embankments and lasted until 1683; the swampland around the bastion was not fully drained until 1687. After such lengthy construction, the works were already out of date militarily, and after 1700 served only to control the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> of visitors and residents, prevent desertion, and enable the collection of tolls on those entering the city. By 1700, Mulberry trees had been planted on the walls, but only 'persons of rank' were permitted to promenade along them. After Berlin had grown considerably and the Customs Wall had been built around it, King Frederick William I (16881740) ordered the defensive walls to be demolished. Civilian buildings had already grown up on the bastions; a windmill and a house for the miller were built on Bastion VII, and these caused the eastern portion to be left standing longer than other parts of the fortifications. Some of the rubble from the demolished fortifications was used to build up Wilhelmstraße; the rest was thrown into the defensive ditch outside the walls.|$|E

Macmillan had opposed Eden's trip to Jamaica and told Butler (15 December, the day after Eden's return) that younger members of the Cabinet wanted Eden out. Macmillan argued at Cabinet on 4 January that Suez {{should be regarded as}} a [...] "strategic retreat" [...] like Mons or Dunkirk. This did not meet with Eden's approval at Cabinet on 7 January.|$|E
2500|$|After World War I, Henry Ford began {{a program}} of decentralizing his {{manufacturing}} efforts away from Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan, establishing plants {{in other areas of}} Michigan and across the country. [...] Ford felt that decentralization held many advantages, in particular that managing the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> {{of a large number of}} employees at any one site became problematic. [...] One part of this plan was the establishment of small rural manufacturing plants knows as [...] "village industries." [...] The village industries reflected Ford's vision of decentralization: not merely locating factories in different cities or regions of the country, but taking specific production tasks out of the larger factories and moving them to small rural factories.|$|E

2500|$|Hội An, {{located a}} short {{distance}} from Da Nang, was the largest port in early modern Vietnam. The Japanese community there was quite small, consisting of only a few tens of households, in contrast both to the Japanese community of other cities such as Ayutthaya, and to the Chinese population of Hội An, which numbered in the thousands. Even so, the Japanese in the Nihonmachi of Hội An exerted a powerful influence upon the affairs of the trading port, the Japanese demand for silk being so great that the <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> of Japanese merchant ships every year caused dramatic cyclical shifts in market prices. On average, more than ten Japanese ships visited the port every year during the period of the [...] "red seal ships", that is, between roughly 1590 and 1635; this represented fully a quarter of all Japanese maritime economic activity, more than that of any other individual port.|$|E
2500|$|Andrews makes note of {{the fact}} that power {{struggle}} in the Casina is evident in the verbal <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings.</b> The words of action and the way that they are said are important to stagecraft. [...] The words denoting direction or action such as abeo ("I go off"), transeo ("I go over"), fores crepuerunt ("the doors creak"), or intus ("inside"), which signal any character's departure or entrance, are standard in the dialogue of Plautus' plays. These verbs of motion or phrases can be taken as Plautine stage directions since no overt stage directions are apparent. Often, though, in these interchanges of characters, there occurs the need {{to move on to the}} next act. Plautus then might use what is known as a [...] "cover monologue". About this S.M. Goldberg notes that, [...] "it marks the passage of time less by its length than by its direct and immediate address to the audience and by its switch from senarii in the dialogue to iambic septenarii. The resulting shift of mood distracts and distorts our sense of passing time." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the ongoing}} Phoney War life at GQG was dull and monotonous, {{occasionally}} broken by social and leisure events, and some officers requested a {{transfer to the}} combat units {{in the hope of}} getting more exciting work. [...] Security was tight with all <b>comings</b> <b>and</b> <b>goings</b> from the buildings monitored and a 9pm curfew implemented for all enlisted personnel. [...] Visitors noted a marked difference between the two sections of GQG with Gamelin's staff described as unfriendly and cold and Georges as more welcoming and cheerful. [...] A climate of mutual distrust existed between the two sections. [...] This has been compared to a cold war between Gamelin and Georges. [...] Georges said of Gamelin's reforms that [...] "he takes the GQG and leaves me with [...] ". [...] The reorganisation was also ill-received by the British staff with General John Swayne, attached to Georges' headquarters, saying [...] "however illogical the original organisation may have been it had settled down and it was generally felt that it was not the time to break up the organisation and create difficulties of working".|$|E
