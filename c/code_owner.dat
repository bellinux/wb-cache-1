40|$|The Development {{of the new}} Cloud Computing {{paradigm}} as lead to a reorganisation in {{the order}} of the priorities of security issues. When running a private code on a Public Cloud or on any remote machine, its owner have no guarantees that the code cannot be reverse engineered, understood and modified. One of the solution for the <b>code</b> <b>owner</b> in order to protect his intellectual property is to obfuscate his algorithms. The Obfuscation of source code is a mechanism to modify a source code to make unintelligible by humans even with the help of computing resources. More precisely, the objective is to conceal the purpose of a program or its logic without altering its functionality, thus preventing the tampering or the reverse engineering of the program Obfuscation is usually performed by applying transformations to the initial source code, but it reveals many open questions: what transformation should be chosen? In which order should the obfuscator apply them? How can we quantify the obfuscation capacity of a given program? In order to answer these questions, we propose here SHADOBF, an obfuscation framework based on evolutionary heuristics designed to optimize for a given input C program, the sequence of transformations that should be applied to the source code to improve its obfuscation capacity. This last measure involves the combination of well known metrics, coming from the Software Engineering area, which are optimized simultaneously thanks to Multi Objective Evo- lutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). We have validated our approach over a classical matrix multiplication program – experiments on other applications is still in progress. Some experiments, presented here, has been performed on some basic but representative examples to valid the feasibility of the method...|$|E
40|$|This master's {{thesis is}} about code {{ownership}} in software projects {{and creating a}} tool that would improve cooperation by identifying <b>code</b> <b>owners.</b> The theoretical foundation for code ownership starts from Extreme Programming, explaining models of code ownership {{and the impact of}} code ownership on cooperation among teams and team members. The concept is demonstrated on a concrete software firm, where a potential for improvement is identified. The potential is exploited by a software tool, which is designed in the this thesis. The tool is capable of identifying <b>code</b> <b>owners</b> and experts for specific areas in the code based on data gathered from a version control system. The resulting information is made easily accessible. The tool is used to conduct a code ownership research in several projects, which allows me to confirm accuracy of the results.

Instead of deploying a traditional middleware into the cloud or adapting existing applications to cloud computing, we looked for an alternative that would fit into the philosophy of ELVIRA of building virtual private research environments, of providing simple solutions by leveraging the affordances of cloud computing technologies and of reusing and adapting existing code where possible.

The study demonstrated that adopting these simple techniques leads to significant improvement in the over-all performance of the structure in terms of strength and stiffness.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the central}} tasks of EUFORIA is to port, parallelise, and {{optimise}} fusion simulation codes, developed at individual research institutes in Europe.

For some of the fusion codes simply porting them to one of the supercomputers represents a major advancement {{in the use of the}} codes, as they until now have mainly been used by a small user community, or even exclusively by the author of the code. Also, where codes currently can only use one processor (i. e. are serial) providing any parallel functionality can be of major benefit to the code and the <b>code</b> <b>owner(s).</b> Many of the simulation codes for edge and core transport modelling of fusion plasma using high performance computing are estimated to currently require weeks or months of execution time to simulate science at a scale required to model the new fusion reactor ITER, and therefore these codes have to be optimised to run as fast as possible and parallelised in such a way that computer resources are used as effectively as possible. During the first fifteen month of the project, we have successfully ported eleven fusion codes to the supercomputers in Barcelona, Edinburgh and Helsinki. The installation procedure, library requirements and runtime scripts have been documented for each code, and deposited in the EUFORIA software repository and code revision system. Following this a number of these codes have been chosen for code optimisation and improvements in parallelisation and this paper outlines the experience that we have had with some of these codes, the performance improvements achieved, and the techniques used...|$|R

40|$|The Internal Revenue <b>Code</b> {{encourages}} <b>owners</b> {{of buildings}} {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places to protect them by donating façade easements to charities dedicated {{to the preservation of}} our built environment.

A façade easement is an agreement between the building owner and the charity restricting the ability of the building owner to make changes to the building’s façade. Additionally, the façade easement may require the building owner to maintain the building in a specified condition. This article discusses the impact of that agreement on the tax consequences of the building owner’s maintenance costs. Because the general rule imposes the obligation to repair property subject to an easement on the easement holder, this article concludes that current law supports the allowance of additional charitable contribution deductions as maintenance costs are incurred...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} ownership structure on the financial performance of listed insurance firms in Nigeria. The study uses panel data for seventeen (17) firms for the period 2001 – 2010 (10 years). There are several aspects and dimensions of corporate governance, which may influence a firm’s performance but this study focuses on two aspects of ownership structure: namely managerial and institutional shareholding. Firm’s performance has been measured through Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). Findings indicate {{that there is a}} positive significant relationship between ownership structure and firm’s performance as measured by ROA and ROE. This paper recommends that the <b>code</b> on <b>owner's</b> equity of listed insurance companies should be sustained and encouraged so that the firms can have a perpetual life, because the stake of this owners could serve as a check and balance mechanism to further strengthen the corporate governance of the insurance firms in order to give room for enhanced financial performance of the listed insurance companies in Nigeria...|$|R

Code siblings can only occur when the source <b>code</b> copyright <b>owner</b> allows it and when the conditions imposed by such license are not incompatible with the license of the destination system. In some situations copying of source code fragments are allowed—legally—in one direction, but not in the other. In this paper, we use clone detection, license mining and classification, and change history techniques to understand how code siblings—under different licenses—flow in one direction or the other between Linux and two BSD Unixes, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Our results show that, in most cases, this migration appears to happen according to the terms of the license of the original code being copied, favoring always copying from less restrictive licenses towards more restrictive ones. We also discovered that sometimes code is inserted to the kernels from an outside source. Keywords: detection...|$|R
