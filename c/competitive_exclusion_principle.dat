5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, fungi may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of species diversity {{is a central}} focus in ecology. It is not rare to observe more species {{than the number of}} limiting resources, especially in plankton communities. However, such high species diversity is hard to achieve in theory under the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principles,</b> known as the plankton paradox. Previous studies often focus on the coexistence of predefined species and ignore the fact that species can evolve. We model multi-resource competitions using evolutionary games, where the number of species fluctuates under extinction and the appearance of new species. The interspecific and intraspecific competitions are captured by a dynamical payoff matrix, which has a size of the number of species. The competition strength (payoff entries) is obtained from comparing the capability of species in consuming resources, which can change over time. This allows for the robust coexistence {{of a large number of}} species, providing a possible solution to the plankton paradox...|$|R
40|$|<b>Competitive</b> <b>exclusion,</b> a key <b>principle</b> of ecology, can be {{generalized}} to understand many other complex systems. Individuals under surviving pressure tend {{to be different from}} others, and correlations among them change correspondingly to the updating of their states. We show with numerical simulation that these aptitudes can contribute to group formation or speciation in social fields. Moreover, they can lead to power-law topological correlations of complex networks. By coupling updating states of nodes with variation of connections in a network, structural properties with power-laws and functions like multifractality, spontaneous ranking and evolutionary branching of node states can emerge out simultaneously from the present self-organized model of coevolutionary process.

40|$|Figure 3 The {{timescale}} of <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> for a {{range of}} nutrient source timescales, varying from half a day to one year. The timescale of <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> is the amount of time it takes for one species to account for 90 % of the total biomass. At short (days) and long (annual) nutrient source timescales, species coexist for a long time. For long timescales of <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion,</b> other processes (e. g., transport, climate change, speciation, extinction, mutation) may be signicant. At seasonal timescales, <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> occurs quickly and diversity is low. TIMESCALES OF VARIABILITY Environmental variability occurs on a range of timescales in the ocean. We use the idealized model to examine how the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> timescale de-pends on the period of environmental variation.

25|$|Character {{displacement}} is {{the phenomenon}} where differences among similar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur, but are minimized or lost where the species’ distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change driven by biological competition among species {{for a limited}} resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other through competition.|$|E
500|$|The role of {{extinction}} in evolution {{is not very}} well understood and may depend on which type {{of extinction}} is considered. The causes of the continuous [...] "low-level" [...] extinction events, which form the majority of extinctions, {{may be the result}} of competition between species for limited resources (the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle).</b> If one species can out-compete another, this could produce species selection, with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction. The intermittent mass extinctions are also important, but instead of acting as a selective force, they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> {{also called}} [...] "Gause's law" [...] which arose from {{mathematical}} analysis and simple competition models states that two species {{that use the}} same limiting resource {{in the same way}} in the same space and time cannot coexist and must diverge from each other over time in order for the two species to coexist. One species will often exhibit an advantage in resource use. This superior competitor will out-compete the other with more efficient use of the limiting resource. As a result, the inferior competitor will suffer a decline in population over time. It will be excluded from the area and replaced by the superior competitor.|$|E
2500|$|The term niche {{differentiation}} (synonymous with niche segregation, niche {{separation and}} niche partitioning), {{as it applies}} to the field of ecology, refers to the process by which competing species use the environment differently in a way that helps them to coexist. The <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle</b> states that if two species with identical niches (i.e., ecological roles) compete, then one will inevitably drive the other to extinction. When two species differentiate their niches, they tend to compete less strongly, and are thus more likely to coexist. [...] Species can differentiate their niches in many ways, such as by consuming different foods, or using different parts of the environment.|$|E
2500|$|Another way {{by which}} niche {{differentiation}} can arise is via the previous elimination of species without realized niches. [...] This asserts {{that at some}} point in the past, several species inhabited an area, and all of these species had overlapping fundamental niches. [...] However, through competitive exclusion, the less competitive species were eliminated, leaving only the species that were able to coexist (i.e. the most competitive species whose realized niches did not overlap). [...] Again, this process does not include any evolutionary change of individual species, but it is merely the product of the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle.</b> [...] Also, because no species is out-competing any other species in the final community, the presence of niche differentiation will be difficult or impossible to detect.|$|E

50|$|Gause {{formulated}} his <b>Competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>principle,</b> through experiments involving paramecia. The principle {{holds that}} no two species can co-exist for long {{if they have}} to compete for highly similar resources. This outcome has two preconditions: 1) panmixis of individuals of competing species, 2) the environment is homogeneous in time and space. These conditions may be met by aquatic microorganisms grown under laboratory conditions. However, in most real-world biotic communities, both conditions are likely to be violated from moderately to strongly.

40|$|Ecology {{has been}} {{characterized}} by a central controversy for decades: namely, whether the distribution and abundance of organisms are determined by species interactions, such as <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion,</b> or by environmental conditions. In part, this is because <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> has not been convincingly demonstrated in open, natural systems. In addition, traditional theoretical models cannot predict the outcome of competitive interactions {{in the presence of}} environmental variability. In this paper we document the limiting influence of strong interspecific competition on population dynamics and nestling mortality in a mixed population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and collared flycatchers (F. albicollis in a narrow zone of sympatry.

The analysis suggests a march towards <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the pied flycatcher during warm periods.
