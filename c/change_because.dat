5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the <b>change</b> <b>because</b> voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary writings in India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, {{were in the}} Sanskrit language. Prominent {{works of}} this Sanskrit literature include epics such as the Mahābhārata and the Ramayana, the dramas of Kālidāsa such as the Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā), and poetry such as the Mahākāvya. Kamasutra, the famous book about sexual intercourse also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the Sangam literature, consisting of 2,381 poems, {{is regarded as a}} predecessor of Tamil literature. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic <b>change</b> <b>because</b> of the emergence of devotional poets such as Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore, who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E

25|$|Head hair {{may change}} {{slightly}} in texture, curl, and color. This is especially likely with hair growth from previously bald areas. Eyebrows do not <b>change</b> <b>because</b> {{they are not}} androgenic.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{techniques}} {{had used}} aerial photography and digital elevation modelling (DEM), but were deemed {{not to be}} sufficiently accurate to monitor <b>change</b> <b>because</b> of the vertical viewpoint and shadowing effects, plus the general coarse nature of their results.|$|E
25|$|The ohmic {{losses of}} ceramic {{capacitors}} are frequency, temperature and voltage dependent. Additionally, class 2 capacitor measurements <b>change</b> <b>because</b> of aging. Different ceramic materials have differing losses over the temperature range and the operating frequency. The changes in class 1 capacitors {{are in the}} single-digit range while class 2 capacitors have much higher changes.|$|E

25|$|The Lienchiang name {{is derived}} from the {{original}} Lianjiang County of Fujian province in Mainland China. In April 2003, the county government started considering changing the name to Matsu County to avoid confusion with the county of the same name on the mainland. Some local people opposed the name <b>change</b> <b>because</b> they felt it reflected the pro-independence viewpoint of the Democratic Progressive Party.|$|E
25|$|Other {{thermodynamic}} potentials {{may be used}} {{to replace}} internal energy so long as proper care is taken in recognizing which natural variables correspond to which potential. For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001). Equation (2) is useful for processes where system volume, entropy, and number of moles of various components <b>change</b> <b>because</b> internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial and}} still {{most widely used}} name of the castle was Landskron ("Land's Crown"). Legend tells that the name was frowned upon by the Pomeranian duke, who {{pressured}} Ulrich to rename it Lanzkron ("Lance's Crown"), which is also in use as an alternative name. Some locals believe that the duke advocated for this name <b>change</b> <b>because</b> of the birth last name of Eli the Prophet, which was Lanzkron.|$|E

25|$|The Volcanic Aviation Colour Code was <b>changed</b> <b>because</b> a {{sustained}} period of high water {{temperatures in the}} Crater Lake (approximately 38 - 39°C) was observed and <b>because</b> <b>changes</b> were observed in volcanic gas output, seismic activity and Crater Lake water chemistry.|$|R
25|$|In an aqueous {{solution}} the color change exhibited {{can be used}} to test for distinguishing aldehydes from ketones. Aldehydes reduce dichromate from the +6 to the +3 oxidation state, changing color from orange to green. This color change arises because the aldehyde can be oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. A ketone will show no such <b>change</b> <b>because</b> it cannot be oxidized further, and so the solution will remain orange.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 2009, {{the iconic}} Largo Clock Tower, which was {{constructed}} shortly {{after completion of}} Largo Central Park, was demolished. City officials made the <b>change</b> <b>because</b> of the tower's decay and because a deteriorating landmark at a busy intersection is not an uplifting and memorable sight. The area surrounding the clock tower was replaced with a small garden area, in order to incorporate the area into Largo Central Park.|$|E
25|$|At the Solvay conference, the {{question}} of quantizing other motions was raised, and Lorentz pointed out a problem. If you consider a quantum pendulum whose string is shortened very slowly, the quantum number of the pendulum cannot <b>change</b> <b>because</b> at no point is there a high enough frequency to cause a transition between the states. But {{the frequency of the}} pendulum changes when the string is shorter, so the quantum states change energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{name for}} James was Jacob. This was <b>changed</b> <b>because</b> a student {{by that name}} committed suicide near {{the completion of the}} script.|$|R

25|$|The strongest {{increase}} {{in the percentage of}} homeowners {{in the first half of}} the decade of the 2000s was among non-white minorities. The homeownership rate for minorities approached the sixty percent mark in 2006, which was a significant <b>change</b> <b>because</b> less than half of all minority households owned homes as recently as 1994. The ownership rate for minorities increased by 25.6%, from 47.7% in 1993 to 59.9% in 2006. This rate fell after the 2006 peak, consistent with overall homeownership rates.|$|E
25|$|The NCAA {{would no}} longer {{automatically}} treat entry into the draft as forfeiture of remaining college eligibility. Instead, it would allow underclassmen {{to withdraw from the}} draft in late May, about five weeks after the then-current deadline, and retain their remaining eligibility (as long as they do not sign with an agent or a professional basketball team in the meantime). The NBA's early-entry and withdrawal deadlines, respectively 60days and 10days before the draft, would not <b>change</b> <b>because</b> they are written into the league's collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
25|$|South Fremont is a {{primarily}} industrial district, east of Interstate 880 {{and west}} of Interstate 680, south of Auto Mall Parkway and north of Brown Rd. The area overlaps with Warm Springs, with which it shares the eponymous BART station. The composition of the area will <b>change,</b> <b>because</b> thousands of residential units were under construction as of 2016. It is sandwiched between the Irvington and Warm Springs community plan areas. It is noted {{as the site of}} the Tesla Factory as well as the site of the Warm Springs / South Fremont BART station.|$|E

25|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on October 20, alongside the music video to Arctica, {{but at the same}} time they announced a line-up <b>change.</b> <b>Because</b> of time issues, founding member and bassist Tommi Kuri, drummer Joonas Pykälä-Aho and guitarist Emil Pohjalainen would no longer be part of Amberian Dawn. They were instead replaced with Jukka Koskinen (Norther, Wintersun), Heikki Saari (Norther, Naildown) and Kimmo Korhonen (Waltari, Helion), respectively. The new drummer, Heikki Saari, also used to play with Amberian Dawn in their earliest days, and contributed with drums on two tracks on their River of Tuoni album.|$|E
25|$|Dentition, or {{the study}} of teeth, is an {{important}} area of study for archaeologists, especially those specializing in {{the study of}} older remains. Dentition affords many advantages over studying the rest of the skeleton itself (osteometry). The structure and arrangement of teeth is constant and, although it is inherited, does not undergo extensive change during environmental change, dietary specializations, or alterations in use patterns. The rest of the skeleton is much more likely to exhibit <b>change</b> <b>because</b> of adaptation. Teeth also preserve better than bone, and so the sample of teeth available to archaeologists is much more extensive and therefore more representative.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory has}} {{implications}} for understanding {{the different types of}} litter reduction interventions that will most effectively reduce littering in a given environment. The theory states that, all things being equal, passive littering will be more resistant to <b>change</b> <b>because</b> of two psychological processes: 1. diffusion of responsibility that increases as the latency between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory, and 2. forgetting, which is also more likely to occur at longer delays between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory.|$|E
