40|$|EN) In {{the first}} part of this work, {{analytical}} methods for determination of impurities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in combined pharmaceutical dosage forms were developed and validated. Development of the methods covered both the optimization of sample preparation procedure and chromatographic conditions. The methods were validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guideline and both of them were confirmed to be able to analyze stability samples. Impurities in paracetamol, <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>hemihydrate</b> and pitophenone hydrochloride in the presence of fourth API fenpiverinium bromide were separated by using ion-pair reversed phase chromatography with gradient elution. Symmetry C 18, 250 x 4, 6 mm, 5 µm heated to 35 řC was used as a separation column. A diode array detector was used. The detection wavelengths were set as follows: 220 nm for paracetamol impurity K, 245 nm for paracetamol and its other impurities and 285 nm for codeine, pitophenone and their impurities. Impurities in valsartan, amlodipine besylate and hydrochlorothiazide were separated by reversed phase UHPLC method with gradient elution.

40|$|PURPOSE: Development of an {{improved}} animal model for studying skin burns in rats. METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar rats {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups (n= 6) : G 1 -Control, G 2 - T 100 °C, G 3 -T 150 °C and G 4 -T 200 °C. Two 10 x 10 mm squares were outlined with a sterile surgical marker on each side and along the vertebral column using a prepared template positioned between the anterior and posterior limbs. G 2 -G 4 rats were subjected to 100 °C, 150 °C and 200 ºC thermal burns, respectively. G 1 rats served as controls. Burns were inflicted by applying a copper plate connected to an electronic temperature controlling device to the dorsal skin of anesthetized rats. Four burns were produced on each animal (total area: 4 cm²/animal) leaving about 1 cm of undamaged skin between burn areas. Analgesia was administered during 24 h after burn injury by adding 30 mg <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>hemihydrate</b> to 500 ml tap water. RESULTS: The application of 100 °C and 150 ºC resulted in partial thickness skin burns with central reepithelialization of the burned area only at 100 °C. In G 4 group the whole thickness of the skin was injured without central reepithelialization. However, there was marginal reepithelialization in all groups. CONCLUSION: The model studied is inexpensive and easily reproducible, enabling the achievement of controlled burns with partial or total impairment of the skin in experimental animals...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} quick stability indicating RP-HPLC method for the simultaneous estimation of <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> and chlorpheniramine maleate {{in the presence of}} its degradation products, generated from forced degradation studies.

40|$|AbstractMidazolam {{is widely}} used as a {{sedative}} agent to produce amnesia in patients undergoing fibre-optic bronchoscopy. However, if a patient does not receive sufficient local anaesthesia, continuous severe cough and physical movement may interrupt the procedure and reduce its safety. We therefore examined whether <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> is a useful premedication for bronchoscopy. The study design was a randomized comparison between <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> and a placebo in patients undergoing light local anaesthesia and midazolam sedation. We used low dose local anaesthesia (5 ml of nebulized 2 % xylocaine) on the assumption of insufficient local anaesthesia. Patients were allocated to receive <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> 0 · 4 mgkg− 1 or a saline placebo 60 min before they were sedated with i. v. midazolam. If the patients exhibited severe cough during bronchoscopy, intrabronchial supplemental local anaesthesia (2 % xylocaine solution in 1 ml increments) was instilled via a bronchoscope to the trachea and segmental bronchi to suppress the cough. The dose of supplemental xylocaine was assessed and the requirements were significantly lower in the codeine group compared to the placebo group: 36 · 4 ± 10 · 2 mg vs. 95 · 1 ± 24 · 6 mg, respectively. After bronchoscopy, patients were interviewed by a doctor to assess their willingness to undergo a repeat procedure if one was clinically indicated, but no significant difference was observed between the two groups. If local anaesthesia is insufficient, midazolam together with <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> premedication is useful for both {{the patient and the}} bronchoscopist...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect on}} {{ileostomy}} function of <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate,</b> Lomotil, or Isogel was tested in 20 subjects at home living a normal life, studied over two three-day periods {{on and off}} treatment. <b>Codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> 60 mg three times daily {{was associated with a}} reduction in the mean total weight of ileostomy output and the ileostomy outputs of water, sodium, and potassium (p < 0 · 05). The proportion of faecal solids increased on codeine and the effluent appeared thicker but the output of faecal solids remained unchanged. Mean faecal fat increased on codeine. The transit rate from mouth to stoma was slower in four of the five subjects on codeine and a further two subjects withdrew from the trial with temporary intestinal obstruction while on the drug. Lomotil two tablets three times daily was associated with a small and statistically not quite significant fall in the mean total weight of ileostomy output and the ileostomy output of water. Sodium and potassium outputs in the effluent fell on Lomotil (p < 0 · 05) but the other parameters remained unchanged. Isogel 15 ml three times daily was associated with an increase in the mean total weight of ileostomy output and the ileostomy outputs of water, sodium, potassium, and faecal solids (p < 0 · 01). Although the effluent looked more viscid on Isogel, the proportion of faecal solids was unchanged. These results suggest that <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> has a beneficial effect on ileostomy function, reducing the loss of water and electrolytes, while Lomotil has a similar but less effective action in the dosage tested. By contrast, Isogel increases the ileostomy loss of water and electrolytes and will aggravate their depletion in patients with excessive fluid effluents. The increase in faecal fat associated with taking <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> suggests that it should be stopped before collecting specimens for faecal fat estimations...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the skin reactivity and the mast cell releasibility in the {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS), 24 patients with AIDS were skin tested with histamine (1 mg/ml) and <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> (0. 9, 0. 09, and 0. 009 mg/ml), a mast cell degranulating agent. They were compared to 12 HIV-negative healthy volunteers and 16 urticaria-prone subjects. Reactivity to <b>codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> was lower in patients with AIDS than in HIV-negative subjects. This difference in skin reactivity was the more significant when the AIDS group was compared to the urticaria-prone group. There was no correlation between the reactivity to codeine and the IgE levels. Possible explanations to the decreased skin reacting to codeine in patients with AIDS include a decrease of local mast cell density or releasibility.

Orocaecal transit was consistently faster in these patients than a group of controls and was associated with malabsorption of glucose. <b>Codeine</b> <b>phosphate</b> 60 mg significantly delayed transit in patients and controls and {{was associated with a}} reduction in glucose malabsorption and improvement in symptoms. Loperamide also delayed transit and improved symptoms, but the doses required for this effect (12 - 24 mg) were higher than usually considered necessary in secretory diarrhoea.
