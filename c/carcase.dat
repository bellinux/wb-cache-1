40|$|Chlamydiae are obligate {{intracellular}} {{bacteria that}} infect {{a broad range}} of host species, including sheep. Two species of Chlamydia infect sheep, C. abortus, which is a major cause of abortion in both sheep and goats, and C. pecorum, which causes pneumonia, arthritis/polyarthritis, encephalomyelitis, conjunctivitis, enteritis, abortion and metritis and infertility in domestic ruminants and pigs. The prevalence of faecal shedding of C. pecorum is relatively common amongst lambs in Australia. The aim of the work presented here was to use qPCR to determine the prevalence of C. pecorum in synovial samples obtained from abnormal joints trimmed from lamb <b>carcases</b> at one abattoir in southern Australia. The study included 53, 131 <b>carcases</b> screened for arthritis, of which 369 had at least one abnormal joint trimmed. One hundred and forty eight trimmed joints were undamaged and suitable for PCR testing. The prevalence of C. pecorum in synovial tissue collected from the abnormal joints was 6. 1 % and the bacterial concentration ranged from 6 × 103 to 7. 6 × 105 /g of synovial tissue. Five of the positive joint samples were from <b>carcases</b> that had one joint trimmed for arthritis and four were from <b>carcases</b> from which two joints had been trimmed. None of the <b>carcases</b> from which the positive joint samples originated were condemned. The average arthritis trim weight of the <b>carcases</b> from which synovial tissue tested positive for C. pecorum was 1. 112 kg (95 % confidence interval 0. 637 - 1. 586 kg) and this did not differ from the <b>carcases</b> from which synovial tissue was not positive for C. pecorum. (mean 0. 997 kg, 95 % confidence interval 0. 840 - 1. 154 kg). Further research is required to determine the on-farm production losses associated with C. pecorum infection in Australian lambs...|$|R

5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of <b>carcase</b> to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to <b>carcase),</b> high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} not immediate. In 1862, cattle sold at La Souterraine weighed about 600kg. The decline of Anglomania {{in favour of}} {{economic}} pragmatism, and the criticism {{and fall of the}} aristocracy aided the development of Limousin cattle. The Limousin breed became renowned for the quality of its meat and the exceptional performance of its <b>carcase,</b> and was voted best European breed in 1857, 1858 and 1859 during the food animal competitions held in Poissy. The crowning moment was the honour received by the bull Achilles Caillaud to open the competition in Paris for all breeds in 1886 (the year the Limousin Herd Book was created), and the grand champion prize of all breeds won three years later by Charles Léobardy for his team.|$|E
5|$|The {{two major}} Limousin hybrids are Brahmousin (a cross between Brahman and Limousin cattle)) and Lim-Flex (a cross between Angus and Limousin cattle), which were both {{developed}} before {{the significance of}} the F94L myostatin variant had been quantified. When Limousins homozygous for the F94L myostatin mutation are used in crossbreeding, only one of the mutations will be inherited (that is, progeny will be heterozygous for the mutation), and a high level of phenotypic uniformity and hybrid vigour would be expected in the progeny. However, breeding using heterozygous animals as parents, which could include purebred Limousins of low percentage Full French content, and Lim-Flex and Brahmousin hybrids that have not been bred to a uniform (homozygous) standard over several generations, would produce progeny with inconsistent <b>carcase</b> characteristics and production value depending upon whether or not the F94L mutation was inherited.|$|E

5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the <b>carcase</b> occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 523 chilled beef and lamb <b>carcases</b> were sampled from four abattoirs and 13 very small plants (VSPs) in South Australia during March 2002 {{in order to}} develop a {{microbiological}} profile of meat produced for domestic consumption within the State.

On beef <b>carcases</b> (n = 159) mean log AVC/cm 2 was 1. 82 and E. coli was detected on 18. 8 % of <b>carcases</b> (area sampled 200 cm 2) for which the mean log of the positives was 0. 34; for lamb <b>carcases,</b> on which 75 cm 2 was sampled (n = 364), corresponding values were 2. 59, 36. 2 % and log 10 0. 27, respectively. There was little difference in mean log AVC/cm 2 of <b>carcases</b> produced at abattoirs and VSPs, 1. 72 versus 1. 81, respectively, for beef, and 2. 80 versus 2. 44, respectively, for sheep.

500|$|Since their domestication, a {{large number}} of breeds of {{chickens}} have been established, but {{with the exception of the}} white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed <b>carcase.</b> Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. [...] The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.|$|E
500|$|It {{is widely}} {{agreed that the}} mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the {{ancestor}} of all breeds of domestic duck (with {{the exception of the}} Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), which is not closely related to other ducks).

In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.|$|E
