5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of <b>civil</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in diurnal temperature variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Air Force withdrew in 1994, {{at which}} point the English Electric Lightning acting as a gate {{guardian}} was scrapped; only the nose section was retained and sent to the Malta Aviation Museum. Air traffic control services remained, although the section responsible for airspace outside London moved to Swanwick in Hampshire in 2002. The remaining operation was named the London Terminal Control Centre. RAF personnel remained on the site, as military air traffic control functions for the eastern side of England remained. In November 2007, the remaining <b>civil</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control services moved to Swanwick, and in January 2008 the military operation also left the site.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{describe}} {{the development of a}} prototypical <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control system for civilian tower controllers working in the Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). This system, consisting of two main subsystems namely, Virtual Assistants and Persistent Sentinels (VAPS) and One-Glance, was designed with the intention of aiding civilian tower controllers in their visual work environment, through exploring the concepts of Augmented Cognition and Rapid Cognition in its implementation. Augmented Cognition is about circumventing human cognitive limitations by engineering work environments that aid people’s abilities to process, store and retrieve information presented to them. The VAPS subsystem attempts to provide some degree of augmented cognition for tower controllers by designing software assistants for them. Rapid Cognition aims to encourage rapid information ingestion and assimilation through the use of visualization techniques. The One-Glance subsystem, consisting of a smart large-screen display and interactive panels, was designed to enable “intuitive ” display of information for controllers. The paper posits that the use of the Augmented Cognition and Rapid Cognition design goals in system design can empower <b>civil</b> tower <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controller...|$|R
40|$|Diverse {{activities}} of civilized societies such as <b>civil</b> defense, <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> safety and control, police, ambulance, communication and internet commerce {{are becoming increasingly}} dependent on advances in computer and electronic systems. While this dependence results in enhanced quality of service, it comes {{at the price of}} increased vulnerability {{to a wide variety of}} threats to the society’s infrastructure. One of the ways of ordering potential intentional electromagnetic environments (IEME) is based on frequency of coverage of the threat environment. In this paper, we will outline this classification, which is also consistent with current and emerging technologies in HPEM generation. Many examples of HPEM generators (from wall socket to radiated waves) are described here.
