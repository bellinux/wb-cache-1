Reitzel on 16December 1835 in Copenhagen, Denmark, with [...] "The Naughty Boy" [...] and [...] "The Traveling Companion" [...] {{in the second}} installment of Fairy Tales Told for Children.

500|$|The western jackdaw {{tends to}} feed on small {{invertebrates}} up to [...] in length that are found above ground, including various species of beetle (particularly <b>cockchafers</b> of the genus Melolontha, and weevil larvae and pupae.), Diptera, and Lepidoptera species, as well as snails and spiders. Also eaten are small rodents, bats, the eggs and chicks of birds, and carrion such as roadkill. Vegetable items consumed include farm grains (barley, wheat and oats), weed seeds, elderberries, acorns, and various cultivated fruits. Examination of the gizzards of western jackdaws shot in Cyprus in spring and summer revealed a diet of cereals (predominantly wheat) and insects (notably cicadas and beetles). The diet averages 84% plant material except when breeding, when the main food source is insects. A study in southern Spain examining western jackdaw pellets found that they contained significant amounts of silicaceous and calcareous grit to aid digestion of vegetable food and supply dietary calcium.|$|E
2500|$|To {{understand}} why Quirey says [...] "The {{advent of the}} Waltz in polite society was quite simply the greatest change in dance form and dancing manners {{that has happened in}} our history" [...] we need to realize that all European social dances before the waltz were communal sequence dances. Communal, because all the dancers on the floor took part in a pre-set pattern (often chosen by a Master of Ceremony). Dancers separately, and as couples, faced outwards to the spectators as much as they faced inwards. Thus all present took part as dancers or as onlookers. This was the way with the country dance and all previous popular dances. With the waltz, couples were independent of each other, and were turned towards each other (though not in close contact). Lord Byron wrote a furious letter, which precedes his poem The Waltz, in which he decries the anti-social nature of the dance, with the couple [...] "like two <b>cockchafers</b> spitted on the same bodkin." ...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, a {{regression}} model for predicting the {{spatial distribution of}} forest <b>cockchafer</b> larvae in the Hessian Ried region (Germany) is presented. The forest <b>cockchafer,</b> a native biotic pest, is {{a major cause of}} damage in forests in this region particularly during the regeneration phase. The model developed in this study is based on a systematic sample inventory of forest <b>cockchafer</b> larvae by excavation across the Hessian Ried. These forest <b>cockchafer</b> larvae data were characterized by excess zeros and overdispersion.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{regional}} biotic risks, especially in the forest regeneration phase, is the forest <b>cockchafer</b> (Melolontha hippocastani). The northern Upper Rhine region is populated by different tribes of the forest <b>cockchafer</b> each of which has a specific quadrennial life cycle and swarming year. The forest <b>cockchafer</b> population in the Hessian Ried belongs to the South Hessian tribe. Since the early 1980 s a massive outbreak of this tribe has been observed {{in some parts of the}} Hessian Ried. The area of forest populated by the forest <b>cockchafer</b> has increased constantly and this trend is expected to continue. An area covering 13 000 hectares of the total forest area of 30 000 hectares is assumed to be populated by this species. Of this area, 4 000 hectares are assumed to be infested by extremely high larva densities.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} information on control measures used to prevent damages due to <b>cockchafer</b> Melolontha spp. grubs in European countries including Poland. There are described the methods used at times when mechanical and chemical treatments were applied {{as well as those}} under advanced research. In the past, <b>cockchafer</b> grubs were manually removed from plowed soils. Later on, chemical pest control commenced in plant protection practice, and a range of insecticides were either spotted directly onto plants or applied into planting rows, otherwise an entire planting area was treated. In that case, powder or granular insecticide formulations were mixed with upper soil layers, but liquid insecticides were poured into the soil around seedlings. The active substance of initial plant protection products used in Poland to control <b>cockchafer</b> grubs was lindane (organochlorine neurotoxin), which showed pretty high efficacy. Nevertheless, organochlorine products must have been withdrawn from the market and less damaging to the environment pesticides (organophosphates and carbamates) were recommended for use in forest protection against <b>cockchafer</b> grubs. As a result of progressive restrictions concerning application of chemicals into forest environment, alternate solutions have been sought, e. g. biological methods of <b>cockchafer</b> grub control have been tested. Up to date studies showed insecticidal properties of bacteria, fungi and nematodes. However, even though the knowledge and awareness of practitioners have raised with time, the problem of <b>cockchafer</b> grub populations damaging forest crops has not yet been solved and seems to be more and more difficult to overcome.
