50|$|In {{a presidential}} {{election}} set in an alternate 2008, Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner) is a lovable loser from Texico, New Mexico, who is coasting through life and {{has not had a}} single political thought in his head, while being coaxed by his eight-year-old daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) to take more of a serious approach to life. Molly runs the household and sees an opportunity on election day to energize her father: frustrated with her father's apathy toward voting, she sneaks into her local polling place and tries to vote on behalf of Bud. However, due to the voting machines being unplugged, the ballot is registered, but no decision is indicated on which candidate gets the vote. The entire election <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> one man and, namely, Bud's vote. Neither candidate has a majority in the electoral college without New Mexico's electoral votes. The popular vote is tied for the two major candidates in New Mexico, leaving Bud to decide the next President of the United States. Bud gets wooed by candidates from both sides: the incumbent Republican, Andrew Carington Boone (Kelsey Grammer), and his campaign manager, Martin Fox (Stanley Tucci); and the opposing Democrat, Vermont Senator Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) and his campaign manager Art Crumb (Nathan Lane).|$|E

If you both choose to split, {{the two of you}} will share the jackpot equally and take home £ 50, 000 each. If you choose to split while your opponent chooses to steal, you will get nothing and your opponent takes it all. If you steal while your opponent splits, you will receive the entire £ 100, 000 jackpot. If you both opt to steal, both of you go home empty-handed. Mil-lions of viewers will watch your choice on TV. What is your choice? Split or steal? The final of the UK TV game show ‘Golden Balls ’ all <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> decision.
