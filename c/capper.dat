5|$|John <b>Capper</b> {{was born}} in Lucknow, India to civil servant William Copeland <b>Capper</b> and his wife Sarah in December 1861. Returning to England {{at an early age}} for education, <b>Capper</b> {{attended}} Wellington College and upon leaving in 1880 enrolled in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich from where he went on to study at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, before subsequently being commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a lieutenant. A capable engineering officer, <b>Capper</b> served in India and Burma for most of the first 17 years of his career, principally employed on military and public construction projects. He performed well in this position, being promoted to captain in 1889.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{he settled}} {{with his family}} at Bramdean House in Alresford, and was {{appointed}} Commander of the Balloon Sections, based at Aldershot {{under the command of}} Col James Templer. In 1906, having briefly become the Balloon Companies, the organisation became the School of Ballooning with <b>Capper</b> as its Commandant. At about the same time the Balloon Factory was split off and moved to a new site nearby at Farnborough and, on Templer's retirement, <b>Capper</b> also became its Superintendent and was given the brevet rank of full colonel. Templer was retained at the factory under <b>Capper</b> to complete the development Britain's first military airship, the Nulli Secundus ("second to none") in a purpose-built airship shed.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 <b>Capper</b> was {{transferred}} to command of the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham, marking {{the end of his}} aeronautical career.|$|E

5|$|In July 1918, <b>Capper</b> {{left the}} War Office and {{commanded}} the 64th Division in England until May 1919, {{when he took}} over command of Number 1 Area in France and Flanders. In September 1919, <b>Capper</b> became Lieutenant-Governor of Guernsey and took over command of the island's military installations. He held the post for five years and during that time was made Colonel-Commandant of the Royal Tank Corps. On 11 July 1921, he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. Retiring in 1925, <b>Capper</b> remained associated with the Tank Corps and also became a governor of Wellington College, associations he retained until 1946.|$|E
5|$|<b>Capper</b> {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with <b>Capper</b> {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E

5|$|In 1897, <b>Capper</b> was {{attached}} to the force dispatched to the Tirah Campaign on the North-West Frontier of British India. One of his tasks there was to supervise the construction of the first road for wheeled vehicles across the Khyber pass. At the campaign's successful conclusion, he was promoted to major and transferred to South Africa while his wife Edith Mary (neé Beausire) and their son John Beausire Copeland <b>Capper</b> returned to England. Arriving in South Africa at the outbreak of the Second Boer War, <b>Capper</b> became deputy assistant director of railways, a vital job given the lengthy and dangerous supply routes along which the war was fought. In 1900, he received the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel and commanded several locally raised units, eventually becoming the commandant at Johannesburg. He returned to England in June 1902, following the end of hostilities the previous month, and on 31 October 1902 was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).|$|E
5|$|Soon {{afterwards}} the Balloon Factory {{was removed}} from the command of the Army and a new civilian superintendent, Mervyn O'Gorman, appointed. <b>Capper</b> remained in command of the Army Balloon School.|$|E
5|$|He was {{employed}} on home {{service for the}} next ten years and whilst serving as regimental adjutant was promoted to captain on 22 April 1891, attending Staff College before being transferred with his unit to India. It was in India that <b>Capper</b> saw his first action, when in 1895 his regiment was attached to a force sent to the Indian-Afghan border to relieve a trapped British force in Chitral. Three years later he was again in action as an advisor to an Egyptian unit of the Anglo-Egyptian army under Horatio Kitchener which travelled down the Nile in the final campaign of the Mahdist War. During these operations, <b>Capper</b> participated in the battle of Atbara and was with the force which fought in the culminating Battle of Omdurman. He received a brevet promotion as major on 16 November 1898.|$|E

5|$|In 1906 he was {{promoted}} to temporary Brigadier–General and in 1908 he married Winifride Mary, with whom he would have one son. In 1910 his work at the staff college was recognised with the award of the Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the King's Birthday Honours. In 1911, after a brief period of half-pay in his permanent rank of Colonel, <b>Capper</b> was transferred from India to Ireland, where he commanded the 13th Infantry Brigade until 1913. He returned to Ireland briefly a year later {{in the aftermath of the}} Curragh Incident, to support his friend Hubert Gough. During early 1914, <b>Capper</b> was briefly the Inspector of Infantry but in the emergency of the summer of 1914 he {{was promoted}} to substantive Major-General and posted to the regular 7th Division, which was sent to the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, <b>Capper</b> {{joined the}} Hampshire Home Guard and {{remained}} on duty with the unit until 1943. Post-War he retired fully to Bramdean House and remained there until {{shortly before his}} death. He was widowed in 1953 and died at Esperance Nursing Home in Eastbourne in May 1955, leaving a daughter. In 1971, his collected papers, and those of his brother Thompson, who had been an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, were donated to the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King's College London where they are still available to researchers.|$|E

5|$|Following his death, a rumour abounded that he {{had been}} killed {{charging}} the German lines on horseback. This story has persisted despite eye-witness accounts to the contrary. <b>Capper</b> was buried in Lillers Communal Cemetery behind British lines and his grave is surmounted by a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone. He is also commemorated on the War Memorial in Rayne, Essex, where he spent much of his boyhood with his uncle, the Rector of Rayne, Rev W S Hemming. His collected papers were donated to King's College in 1971, where they are still available to researchers and contain a wide selection of primary materials concerning the warfare of the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|That Autumn the {{government}} conducted a formal inquiry into military aviation. <b>Capper</b> {{had to return}} early from Blair Atholl in order to present his evidence. He argued strongly for a promising future {{of all forms of}} aeronautics and especially the aeroplane. However his Army superiors on the committee were against aeronautics in any form. It was decided that only small-scale airship experiments should continue and that aeroplane work should be stopped. It formally ceased when Dunne and Cody's contracts ran {{out at the end of}} March 1909.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{participated in}} the French and Indian War and {{is best known for}} having purportedly defended himself from a band of Native American fighters on Caudy's Castle—a {{sandstone}} outcrop that now bears his name. According to tradition, Caudy used his long rifle barrel to push his Native American attackers off the rock into the Cacapon River below. In his later life, Caudy became involved in a land dispute with John <b>Capper</b> that was resolved by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in November 1762. Caudy died in 1784 and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him, while another tradition says Caudy was buried with his horse.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{extent and}} {{dynamics}} of actin polymerization in solution are calculated as {{functions of the}} filament severing rate, using a simple model of in vitro polymerization. The model is solved by both analytic theory and stochastic-growth simulation. The results show that severing essentially always enhances actin polymerization by freeing up barbed ends, if barbed-end <b>cappers</b> are present. Severing has much weaker effects if only pointed-end <b>cappers</b> are present. In {{the early stages of}} polymerization, the polymerized-actin concentration grows exponentially as a function of time. The exponential growth rate is given in terms of the severing rate, and the latter is given in terms of the maximum slope in a polymerization time course. Severing and branching are found to act synergistically...|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, the Morris Communications Corporation {{purchased}} Stauffer Communications, giving Morris a {{total of}} 32 daily newspapers in 13 states when it added Stauffers 20 daily papers, including the Stauffer flagship, the Topeka Capital-Journal. Morris president Paul S. Simon said he intended to sell Stauffers broadcast division, including 11 stations and several radio networks, and Stauffer Magazine Group, which included Grit, <b>Cappers</b> (a rural tabloid with a 120-year history, formerly the <b>Cappers</b> Weekly referred to above) and Best Recipes magazine. Later that year, Grit and <b>Cappers</b> were acquired by Ogden Publications. Grit, which had until this time been biweekly, was then edited by Kathryn Compton as a monthly with the subtitle [...] "Stories of American Life & Tradition." [...] Other Ogden Publications include American Life & Traditions, Farm Collector, Mother Earth News and Utne Reader. Beginning with the September 2006 issue, Grit converted to an all-glossy, perfect bound magazine format and a bi-monthly schedule. The revamped editorial policy encompasses more of a contemporary rural emphasis on content, rather than the nostalgic themes of the previous decade. With a print run of 150,000 and Time Warner as the national newsstand distributor, Grit was displayed and sold at general newsstand outlets, bookstores and specialty farm feed and supply stores, including Tractor Supply Company.|$|R
5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle <b>capper</b> began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E
