5|$|As Balch {{finished}} his formal education early, he compensated through self-improvement, even cycling to London to buy books. He {{is known for}} discovering new <b>caving</b> techniques and carefully recording his finds. Balch would spend his free time on Saturdays and after work on <b>caving</b> expeditions, although he would not do any <b>caving</b> on Sundays, for religious reasons. He would set out for some expeditions directly after work, <b>caving</b> overnight and coming home in time to wash before returning to work.|$|E
5|$|Large {{areas of}} {{limestone}} on the Mendips have been worn away by water, making the hills a national centre for <b>caving.</b> Some of the caves {{have been known}} about since {{the establishment of the}} Mendip lead mining industry in Roman times. However, many have been discovered or explored only in the 20th century. Specialist equipment and knowledge is required to visit {{the vast majority of the}} caves, but Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole Caves are two show caves which are easily accessible to the public. The active Mendip <b>Caving</b> Group and other local <b>caving</b> organisations organise trips and continue to discover new caverns.|$|E
5|$|The Mendips {{are home}} {{to a wide range}} of outdoor sports and leisure activities, {{including}} hunting, <b>caving,</b> climbing, and abseiling. The rich variety of fauna and flora also makes it attractive for hillwalking and those interested in natural history.|$|E

5|$|Balch was {{a member}} of <b>caving</b> clubs such as the Wessex Cave Club. He was a serious speleologist and often made ten-hour trips wearing cloth cap, old suit and tie. Balch Cave near Stoke St Michael is named after him. As an {{authority}} on the caves under the Mendip Hills, Balch was consulted by water companies who were looking for new water supplies.|$|E
5|$|Balch {{was awarded}} an honorary Master of Arts by Bristol University in July 1927 for devoting his leisure time to {{exploring}} and recording the caves of the Mendip Hills, becoming {{an authority on}} the subject. He retired as postmaster on 31 March 1931, whilst continuing his <b>caving,</b> working as the curator at the museum and giving lectures on archaeology.|$|E
2500|$|Several others <b>caves</b> {{were also}} built in Western India {{around the same}} period under royal sponsorship. It is thought that the {{chronology}} of these early Chaitya <b>Caves</b> is as follows: first <b>Cave</b> 9 at Kondivite <b>Caves</b> and then <b>Cave</b> 12 at the Bhaja <b>Caves,</b> which both predate <b>Cave</b> 10 of Ajanta. Then, after <b>Cave</b> 10 of Ajanta, in chronological order: <b>Cave</b> 3 at Pitalkhora, <b>Cave</b> 1 at Kondana <b>Caves,</b> <b>Cave</b> 9 at Ajanta, which, with its more ornate designs, may have been built about a century later, <b>Cave</b> 18 at Nasik <b>Caves,</b> and <b>Cave</b> 7 at Bedse <b>Caves,</b> to finally culminate with the [...] "final perfection" [...] of the Great Chaitya at Karla <b>Caves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Karst {{is famous}} for its <b>caves.</b> In Slovenia, they include Vilenica <b>Cave</b> (the oldest show <b>cave</b> in Europe), Lipica <b>Cave,</b> Divača <b>Cave,</b> Kačna <b>Cave,</b> Postojna <b>Cave,</b> and Škocjan <b>Caves</b> (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and Grotta Gigante in Italy (the largest show <b>cave</b> in the world).|$|R
50|$|<b>Caves</b> {{are also}} {{scattered}} throughout the province. The Bathala <b>Cave</b> houses bats and pythons, as well as beautiful stalagmites and stalactites.

5|$|Troops may plan outings and {{activities}} outside the troop meeting. These may involve camping, backpacking, hiking, canoeing, rafting, climbing, <b>caving,</b> rappelling, and other activities. These outings {{are an important}} place for Scouts to work on skills and rank advancement, have fun, and engage in productive outdoor activities.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} {{a highlight of}} the year for Scouts is spending at least a week in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, <b>caving,</b> and fishing.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of <b>caving</b> in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E

25|$|Slovakia has {{hundreds}} of <b>caves</b> and caverns under its mountains, of which 30 {{are open to}} the public. Most of the <b>caves</b> have stalagmites rising from the ground and stalactites hanging from above. There are currently five Slovak <b>caves</b> under UNESCO's World Heritage Site status. They are Dobšinská Ice <b>Cave,</b> Domica, Gombasek <b>Cave,</b> Jasovská <b>Cave</b> and Ochtinská Aragonite <b>Cave.</b> Other <b>caves</b> open to the public include Belianska <b>Cave,</b> Demänovská <b>Cave</b> of Liberty, Demänovská Ice <b>Cave</b> or Bystrianska <b>Cave.</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{are still}} several {{quarries}} on the Mendip Hills. Some {{of the stone}} is still carried by Mendip Rail; the other railways in the area closed in the 1960s. Although the Roman Fosse Way crossed the hills, the main roads generally avoid the higher areas and run {{along the bottom of}} the scarp slope on the north and south of the hills. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39. A wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities take place in the Mendips, many based on the particular geology of the area. The hills are recognised as a national centre for <b>caving</b> and cave diving, as well as being popular with climbers, hillwalkers and natural historians. Wookey Hole Caves and some of the caves in Cheddar Gorge are open as show caves; however, many of the caves of the Mendip Hills are only accessible to members of <b>caving</b> clubs. Long distance footpaths include the Mendip Way and Limestone Link.|$|E
5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A <b>caving</b> {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built {{up the side of the}} gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Tittle {{became the}} first {{professional}} football player featured {{on the cover of}} Sports Illustrated when he appeared on its fifteenth issue dated November 22, 1954, donning his 49ers uniform and helmet featuring an acrylic face mask distinct to the time period. The cover photo also shows a metal bracket on the side of Tittle's helmet which served to protect his face by preventing the helmet from <b>caving</b> in. The 1954 cover was the first of four Sports Illustrated covers he graced during his career.|$|E
50|$|Belum {{is part of}} {{a larger}} complex of <b>caves</b> carved out of the {{limestone}} deposits in the Erramalai region.

Abrázna <b>cave</b> is a 10 {{meters long}} karst <b>cave.</b> Abrázna <b>cave</b> was {{created as a}} result of coastal {{modelling}} by a prehistoric Cenozoic sea and like all of the others, it is inaccessible to the public. It is supposedly the westernmost <b>cave</b> in Slovakia, although actually it is rather the J06041401 <b>cave.</b> None of the <b>caves</b> are open to the public.|$|R
5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that <b>caving</b> to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|It was {{purchased}} by T. E. Davies in the 1940s, who sold the house and estate on 17 October 1947. In the 1950s, the house was converted to a school. It became an outdoor education centre in 1971. It continues today as a residential centre, operated since 1996 by Gwent Outdoor Education Service, a joint service supported by the four local authorities of Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen. It caters mainly for school and college students on organised visits, and hosts activities such as orienteering and archery, with other activities such as canoeing and <b>caving</b> at nearby sites.|$|E
5|$|The spur {{proposal}} would open land to development between the downtown {{areas of the}} two cities. If jurisdiction is transferred, and M-28 is routed over CR480 as proposed, M-28 would leave the concurrency with US41 near Teal Lake in Negaunee, and cross the <b>caving</b> grounds west of downtown to connect to Rail Street. Rail Street would serve as the connector to CR480, which ends {{at the intersection of}} Rail and Ann streets and Healey Avenue. Proposals indicate two routing options for the east end of CR480. One would route M-28 back along US41 from Beaver Grove north of the CR480 eastern terminus to the existing M-28 in Harvey. A second would route it along CR551/Cherry Creek Road from CR480 to M-28 in Harvey.|$|E

5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from <b>caving</b> in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mercer {{had arrived}} in the trenches, a massive German {{artillery}} bombardment began, heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and <b>caving</b> in dugouts, killing many Canadian soldiers. Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most of his staff and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In the confused situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was broken by a bullet.|$|E
