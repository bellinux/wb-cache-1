The last wild crested ibis in Japan died in October 2003, with the remaining wild population found only in Shaanxi province of China until reintroduction of <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> back into Japan in 2008.

50|$|The {{voice of}} the thick-billed parrot resembles a high-pitched macaw and {{includes}} a variety of harsh, rolling calls described as similar to human laughter. Although readily becoming hand-tame, the species is nervous and difficult to breed in captivity, with very low reproduction rates. Captive birds are fair voice mimics and can learn a few phrases and words. However, their piercing calls and comparatively duller coloration has prevented them from becoming popular pet trade birds, and currently there is little demand for them as illegally wild-caught or <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|E
50|$|The salmon-crested {{cockatoo}} is a vulnerable species, {{and has been}} listed on appendix I of CITES since 1989, which makes trade in wild-caught birds illegal. Trade in <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> is legal only with appropriate CITES certification. Numbers have declined due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade and habitat loss. During {{the height of the}} trapping of this species over 6,000 birds were being removed from the wild per year. It has a stronghold in Manusela National Park on Seram, although even today some illegal trapping continues.|$|E
5000|$|Usually called Jardine's parrots, the red-fronted parrot is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular pet, owing to increased availability and a growing following. They are particularly playful, intelligent, and affectionate. Some speak very clearly, and imitate other birds expertly. Their size, temperament, and voice makes them good candidates for apartment dwellers, when compared to larger, louder birds. <b>Captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> have an endearing nature, bonding well, usually imperceptibly or only slightly favouring {{one member of the}} family more than others.

50|$|The Mauritius kestrel, F. punctatus, is more distantly {{related to}} the {{preceding}} two, having diverged from ancestral Madagascar region kestrels {{some time in the}} Gelasian (Groombridge et al. 2002). It is found only on Mauritius. It usually snatches arboreal prey, typically geckos or small birds. Habitat loss and DDT poisoning pushed this species to the brink of extinction, down to possibly as few as six individuals (and an even smaller effective population size) in the mid 1970s. The conservation effort was initially unsuccessful but results improved when new approaches were tried by Carl Jones in 1979. Chicks hatched at a sanctuary run by Gerald Durrell were released to new areas, and the population has now almost reached the carrying capacity of the island; intensive conservation activity has ceased for some time, with the last <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> released in 1994.|$|E
50|$|In September 1982 Mexico {{banned the}} {{commercial}} export of Psittacines, but because demand still {{existed in the}} United States, trade across the border continued illegally. Throughout the 1980s the majority of birds captured in Mexico were smuggled across the U.S. border to be sold as exotic pets. Beginning in the 1990s two major factors prompted the decrease {{of the flow of}} these birds into the U.S. First, the passage of the Wild Bird Conservation Act in the United States in 1992 led to a dramatic increase in the regulation of exotic birds entering the United States, naturally followed by a decrease in trade. Second, the Wild Bird Conservation Act authorized the creation of captive breeding centers in the United States. Although <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> are usually more expensive due to the costs of being raised in captivity, Americans looking for exotic pets are generally able to afford these higher prices. The sale of captive bred parrots has largely overtaken that of illegal exotics in the U.S. A common misconception is that animal trafficking in Mexico today is fueled by demand from the United States {{similar to that of the}} drug trade. However, it has been determined that internal trade of Psittacines within Mexico is now actually far more detrimental and widespread than international smuggling.|$|E
40|$|Given that human-wildlife {{conflicts}} are an everyday issue, we propose {{the use of}} <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> {{to determine the effects}} that environmental acoustic disturbance may have on small passerines. We used greenfinches and located them at three rural and one urban site and collected faeces to measure corticosterone metabolites using enzyme immunoassays.

40|$|Campbell Island Teal (Anas nesiotis) are a {{critically}} endangered species. The wild population {{in its natural}} range may be less than 30, although a captive breeding programme {{has raised more than}} 60 birds and the species is safe from extinction in the short to medium term. Due to the isolation of, and the difficulty of access to, Dent Island in the Campbell Group, the sole surviving natural habitat, no detailed study of the behaviour and ecology of Campbell Island Teal in the wild has been undertaken. Although observations have been made of captive birds, the release of Campbell Island Teal onto Codfish Island (Whenua Hou Nature Reserve) provided the first opportunity to carry out a detailed ecological study of this species in the wild. Aspects of the ecology of Campbell Island Teal (Anas nesiotis) were studied following two releases onto Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000, in order to assess the success of the releases in establishing a new population. A programme was designed to monitor the attempt to establish a self sustaining population of teal on Codfish Island, and to record how <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> adapted to life in the wild by observing characteristics and behaviours of the teal that allowed them to establish a successful population. This information will be used to increase the chances of any future release of this species onto Campbell Island succeeding. Birds were released at two sites on Codfish Island, with different sex and age ratios released in April 1999 and May 2000. The survival and dispersal of these birds was monitored using radio transmitters, with direct observations made on their behaviour and ecology. In these respects, Campbell Island teal were found to be most similar to the Auckland Island Teal (Anas aucklandica). During the three years of this study 24 birds were released, with individuals being monitored from one to three years. Forty two eggs were laid in 13 nesting attempts by eight different females, resulting in 36 ducklings hatched and 17 fledged. Only four adults are known to have died during this period although 11 other birds could not be located {{at the end of the}} study. The dispersal of the birds from their release sites varied greatly, probably influenced by habitat quality, although this was not quantified. While the inability to track some individuals may mean that dispersal was greater than recorded, of those birds which could be tracked, juvenile males dispersed the farthest with three individuals moving more than 3 km after fledging. Hatching and fledging success were influenced by the age of the females and it appears that environmental factors, especially availability of suitable damp feeding areas for ducklings, were the main factors affecting fledging success. The dispersal of the teal, their habitat preferences and breeding success provide guidelines on where birds should be released on Campbell Island and the optimum age of birds to be released. The high adult survival rate and productivity of the <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> indicates that, providing sufficient are released, the teal should establish rapidly on Campbell Island...|$|E
40|$|The Cape Vulture, Gyps coprotheres, is {{currently}} classified as â€˜endangeredâ€™. Endemic to southern Africa, its population has declined continuously {{over the past}} 40 years. The species is facing multiple anthropogenic threats. Notably, birds frequently collide with power lines and some cannot be released after treatment. This {{has led to the}} establishment of a captive breeding population with the hope that captive bred young can supplement wild populations and re-establish a now- abandoned breeding colony in the Magaliesberg Mountains, South Africa. This study aimed to follow the breeding behaviours of the captive colony and assess the appropriateness of chick rearing conditions. The study also aimed to monitor the behaviour, physical condition and dispersal of ten captive bred vultures after release in relation to their age. Behavioural observations of captive adult breeding and parental behaviours were conducted to establish whether chicks developed under comparable conditions to wild chicks. A high percentage of total colony copulation attempts (22 %) were extra-pair copulations. Four paired males formed ephemeral extra-pair relationships, two of which were homosexual. Chicks fledged earlier than wild chicks, on average at 128 days old. Wild and <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> <b>birds</b> were observed at carcasses to compare competitive and feeding behaviours. Older birds, both wild and captive, fed the most efficiently. Preliminary evidence suggests females are more dominant and have higher display rates than males. Captive bred juvenile and four year old birdsâ€™ competitive and feeding behaviours (interaction rate, feeding rate, display rate, dominance, aggressiveness, and feeding efficiency) were the closest to, but still generally below, average values for same-aged wild birds. An index of body condition, body mass, and the prevalence of fault bars on the rectrices were used to assess their physical condition. After eight months, none of the ten birds had moved more than 8 km from the release site, nor had they foraged away from the vulture restaurant on site. Although altitude records of > 3100 m were recorded, their flight skills seemed inadequate. Future management considerations include the initiation of a pre-release exercise regime, the establishment of an acclimatization enclosure removed from the breeding site, and a varied or reduced post-release feeding schedule. Fledglings should be relocated and housed at the release enclosure until they are four years old...|$|E

40|$|The African lion, Panthera leo, is a {{powerful}} symbol in Africa but the lion numbers are declining rapidly. Once, the African lion lived across the entire continent, except for the Sahara Desert and rainforests. Nowadays they occur {{in less than a}} quarter of their historic range (Nowell et al., 2012). Conservation programs are necessary to keep the African lion from further declining. One of the ways of conservation is releasing <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> animals into the wild. Before releasing <b>captive</b> <b>bred</b> lions it is necessary to assess their capability to survive in the wild. One of the skills for survival is the ability to successfully defend a prideâ€™s territory against intruders and competitors for food.
