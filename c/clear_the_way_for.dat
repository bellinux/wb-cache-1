5|$|Rastignac, {{who moved}} to Paris from the south of France, becomes {{attracted}} to the upper class. He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, {{in the ways of}} high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Rastignac by having the brother killed in a duel.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1918, Rane {{served in}} the British Indian Army during the Second World War. He {{remained}} in the military during the post-war period and was commissioned in the Bombay Sappers Regiment of the Indian Army's Corps of Engineers on 15 December 1947. In April 1948, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, Rane {{played a key role}} in the capture of Rajauri by Indian forces by being instrumental in clearing several roadblocks and minefields. His actions helped <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> advancing Indian tanks. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra on 8 April 1948 for his gallantry. He retired as a major from the Indian Army in 1968. During his 28 years' service with the army, he was mentioned in despatches five times. He died in 1994 at the age of 76.|$|E
5|$|One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing {{purposes}} at the Royal Mint, {{and intended}} for melting, but recovered from circulation. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the demonetisation of the farthing at the end of 1960 helped <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that there was a need for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.|$|E

5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, the Viet Cong massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As the Viet Cong closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when the Viet Cong overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all tactical air support was called off in order to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent the Viet Cong from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, the Viet Cong were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E
5|$|Group Two, {{under the}} command of Captain Burn, would land at the old {{entrance}} to the St Nazaire basin. Their objectives were to destroy the anti-aircraft positions in the area and the German headquarters, to blow up the locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counter-attack from the submarine base. Group Three was {{under the command}} of Major William 'Bill' Copland, who was also the Commandos' second in command. They were to secure the immediate area around Campbeltown, destroy the dock's water-pumping and gate-opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks. All three groups were subdivided into assault, demolition and protection teams. The assault teams would <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the other two. The demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self-defence; the protection teams, armed with Thompson submachine guns, were to defend them while they completed their tasks.|$|E

5|$|James VI was crowned King of Scots {{at the age}} of 13 {{months on}} 29 July 1567. He was brought up as a Protestant, while the country was run by a series of regents. In 1579 the Frenchman Esmé Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny, first cousin of James' father Lord Darnley, arrived in Scotland and quickly {{established}} himself as the closest of the then 13-year-old James's powerful male favourites; he was created Earl of Lennox by the king in 1580, and Duke of Lennox in 1581. Lennox was distrusted by Scottish Calvinists and in August 1582, in {{what became known as the}} Ruthven Raid, the Protestant earls of Gowrie and Angus imprisoned James and forced Lennox to leave Scotland. After James was liberated in June 1583, he assumed increasing control of his kingdom. Between 1584 and 1603, he established effective royal government and relative peace among the lords, assisted by John Maitland of Thirlestane, who led the government until 1592. In 1586, James signed the Treaty of Berwick with England, which, with the execution of his mother in 1587, helped <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> his succession to the childless Queen Elizabeth I of England. He married Anne of Denmark in 1590, daughter of Frederick II, the king of Denmark; she bore him two sons and a daughter.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans now {{attempted}} a breakthrough of the Engineer position. After daylight, {{they were unable}} to get reinforcements into the fight since D Company commanded the town and its approaches. In this fight, which raged until 11:00, the engineers had neither artillery nor mortar support. D Company remedied this by using its new 3.5-inch and old 2.36-inch rocket launchers against the North Korean infantry. The fire of the 18 bazookas plus that from machine guns and the small arms of the company inflicted very heavy casualties on the North Koreans, who desperately tried to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> a push eastward to Miryang. Tanks of A and B Companies, 72nd Tank Battalion, at the southern and eastern edge of Yongsan shared equally with the engineers in the intensity of this battle. The company commander was the only officer of D Company not killed or wounded in this melee, which cost the company 12 men killed and 18 wounded. The edge of Yongsan and the slopes of the hill south of the town became covered with North Korean dead and destroyed equipment.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed {{ordered his}} general, Suleiman Pasha, {{to end the}} siege of Venetian-controlled Shkodër (now in Albania), to {{assemble}} his troops in Sofia, {{and from there to}} advance with additional troops towards Moldavia. For these already exhausted Ottoman troops, who had besieged the city from 17 May to 15 August, the transit from Shkodër to Moldavia was a month's journey through bad weather and difficult terrain. According to Długosz, Suleiman was also ordered that after inflicting defeat on Stephen, he was to advance towards Poland, set camp for the winter, then invade Hungary in spring, and unite his forces with the army of the Sultan. The Ottoman army consisted of Janissaries and heavy infantry, which were supported by the heavy cavalry sipahis and by the light cavalry (akinci), who would scout ahead. There were also Tatar cavalry and other troops (such as the Timariots) from vassal states. Twenty thousand Bulgarian peasants were also included in the army; their main tasks were to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the army by building bridges over waters and removing snow from the roads, and to drive supply wagons. In total, the Ottoman cavalry numbered 30,000. In September 1474, the Ottoman army gathered in Sofia, and from there, Suleiman marched towards Moldavia by crossing the frozen Danube on foot. His first stop was Wallachia, which he entered via Vidin and Nicopolis. His army rested in Wallachia for two weeks, and was later met by a Wallachian contingent of 17,000 under Basarab Laiotă, who had changed sides to join the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s the {{neighborhood}} had changed. Another Register-listed property nearby, the Abrams Building, had been demolished to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> a new arena, {{now known as}} the Times Union Center. In 1988 plans for two large office towers at the corner of South Pearl and Hudson were approved by the city. While the two garages did not overlap the new buildings' footprint, it was necessary to demolish them anyway to provide enough parking. That was accomplished in early 1989; they were delisted a month later.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of France the High Command (OKW) felt they had won the war, and some more {{pressure}} would persuade Britain. On 30 June the OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl issued his paper setting out options: the first was to increase attacks on shipping, economic targets and the RAF: air attacks and food shortages were expected to break morale and lead to capitulation. Destruction of the RAF was the first priority, and invasion would be a last resort. Hermann Göring's operational directive issued the same day ordered destruction of the RAF to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> attacks cutting off seaborne supplies to Britain.
