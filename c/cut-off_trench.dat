At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a <b>cut-off</b> <b>trench</b> was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
5000|$|In 1876, {{with the}} {{reservoir}} partially filled, water was found percolating through fissures in rock to downstream of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>trench.</b> The supervising engineer, Thomas Hawksley, initially extended the cut-off with brickwork and concrete, but the leakage continued. Faced with few methods to treat such an unsafe condition, Hawksley then adopted the novel technique of pouring or pumping cement grout into holes bored in rock below the trench alignment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was created}} for the Weardale and Shildon District Waterworks Company, with construction of the dam between 1873 and 1879. The earth embankment dam was built across the valley of Waskerley Beck, and measures 1020 feet long and 82 feet high. It was constructed with a puddle clay core, which extended upward from the <b>cut-off</b> <b>trench</b> excavated into the rock foundation on the hillsides. A seven foot diameter draw-off tunnel in one abutment controls reservoir elevation.|$|E

BMC{trademark} system can {{function as a}} permeable or impermeable reaction wall, a <b>cut-off</b> wall, interceptor <b>trenches,</b> a barrier with collection and/or monitoring system, and a pass-through in a funnel and gate configuration.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} soil–bentonite slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cut-off</b> walls is {{highly dependent on}} the hydraulic conductivity of the soil–bentonite backfill, which according to laboratory tests can decrease significantly as consolidation pressure increases due to corresponding reductions in void ratio. Consequently a reliable estimate of the hydraulic conductivity of backfill in the field requires proper calculation of effective stresses. A model is proposed to predict the steady-state horizontal and vertical effective stresses in the backfill after consolidation. The arching effect is considered by way of force equilibrium, and the lateral squeezing effect of inward displacement of the trench side walls is considered by assuming the cut-off wall is surrounded by soil, which is represented by a Winkler idealisation. The proposed model is applied to consider a soil–bentonite slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cut-off</b> wall in New South Wales, Australia, and the predicted stress profile is in good agreement with that calculated from cone penetration test data. Compared to those predicted by geostatics and other alternative models, the proposed method offers a significant improvement in the prediction of stress in soil–bentonite slurry trench walls. The obtained stresses are then used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in the backfill. It is found that the hydraulic conductivity is relatively high in the shallow region owing to the low state of effective stresses, which requires consideration in cut-off wall design, and decreases slightly with the depth in the deeper region. Finally a parametric study identifies the side wall friction and the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction of surrounding soil as having the most {{significant impact on the}} estimated stresses...|$|R
40|$|Tailings are {{the waste}} {{products}} produced during {{extraction of minerals}} from the ore. The particle size of tailings varies from medium sand to silt or clay size. Tailings are used as a construction material for raising of embankments called tailings dams. During spigotting, the coarse particles (sands) lie close to the embankment, while the fine particles (slimes) move downwards to the impoundment. The rate of failure in tailings dams is higher than that for the conventional water dams. In the past, tailings dams have failed due to various causes such as meteorological incidents, slope instability, piping/seepage, weak foundations, and seismic liquefaction etc. The statistics shows that the tailings dams are not safe even in their construction stages. The closure and reclamation measures require that the tailings dams and impoundments should be stable {{for a long time}} (more than 1000 years). Hence, the proper understanding of the mechanical properties (i. e., permeability, stiffness and strength) of tailings is essential in order to make reliable predictions for the long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments. The purpose of the literature survey carried out is: (a) to understand the mechanical properties of tailings material regarding anisotropy, cyclic loading, particle crushing and creep effects; (b) to know the current design practice and identify the factors that may have strong influence on the long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments, and (c) to find from literature, an appropriate constitutive model that can predict realistic behaviour of tailings material. There is similarity in properties of coarse tailings and loose to medium dense natural sands. Slimes are complex material and may show resemblance to natural sands, clays, or a combination of both. The hydraulic conductivity of tailings varies from point to point in a deposit. Tailings are more compressible than the natural soils. The coefficient of consolidation of slimes is in the range shown by natural clays. Due to high particle angularity, the sands and slimes show higher drained shear strength than that for similar natural soils. Undrained strength of sands is important in evaluation of liquefaction behaviour. The embankments can be raised with upstream, downstream or centreline construction methods. The upstream method is susceptible to liquefaction, whereas the downstream and centreline methods are relatively seismic resistant. The stability of the tailings embankments can be enhanced by keeping the phreatic surface low within the embankment body. The phreatic surface can be lowered with the application of cores, drainage zones, and the use of sand tailings in the embankment construction. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>trenches,</b> slurry walls, grout curtains, and liners can control seepage in tailings dams. The pore water pressures develop during construction of tailings embankments. These pore pressures are described as initial static pore pressure, initial excess pore pressure, and pore pressure due to shearing. The stability analyses conditions for conventional water dams (such as end of construction, staged construction, and long term) are also applicable to the tailings dams. The end of construction condition, and staged construction condition of a tailings dam can be analysed with undrained strength analysis. The drained analysis can be used for the long-term condition of a tailings dam (when an embankment attains maximum height and is constructed slowly). The aim of reclamation measures for tailings dams and impoundments is to achieve long time mass stability, environmental safety, and productive land use. Tailings impoundments can be stabilized with ripraps, chemicals, vegetation, and dry/wet covers etc. Most natural soils show anisotropy in strength due to their depositional history. Due to low density and high degree of saturation, tailings show large cyclic strains in a few cycles of stress reversal. The cyclic strength of tailings can increase with decreasing void ratio. Creep occurs in all soils. Clays show more creep than sands. Loose sands creep more than dense sands. The loads due to high tailings embankments may cause particle crushing and creep. The long time stability of tailings dams and impoundments can be predicted with finite element analysis with suitable constitutive models. The numerical analysis needs to be carried out for severe conditions of rainfalls, floods, and earthquakes. Godkänd; 2010; 20100609 (muhauc...|$|R

50|$|Ladybower {{was built}} between 1935 and 1943 by the Derwent Valley Water Board to {{supplement}} the other two reservoirs in supplying the water needs of the East Midlands. It took a further two years to fill (1945). The dam differs from the Howden Reservoir and Derwent Reservoir {{in that it is}} a clay-cored earth embankment, and not a solid masonry dam. Below the dam is a <b>cut-off</b> <b>trench</b> 180 ft deep and 6 ft wide filled with concrete, stretching 500 ft into the hills each side, to stop water leaking round the dam. The dam wall was built by Richard Baillie and Sons, a Scottish company. The two viaducts, Ashopton and Ladybower, needed to carry the trunk roads over the reservoir were built by the London firm of Holloways, using a steel frame clad in concrete. The project was delayed when the Second World War broke out in 1939, making labour and raw materials scarce. But construction was continued due to the strategic importance of maintaining supplies. King George VI, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth, formally opened the reservoir on 25 September 1945.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{element of}} {{construction}} at Fontenelle Dam was {{the building of}} the Fortenelle community, the base camp for construction, with work starting in 1961 to build prefabricated relocatable houses for dam workers. The contract for the base camp was awarded to and completed by the D.H. Butcher & Co. construction company. The construction contract for the dam was awarded on June 13, 1961 to Foley Brothers, Inc. and the Holland Construction Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, with construction starting on June 30, at a cost of $7.9 million. The surface of the bedrock at the dam's base was found to be fragmented, so the <b>cut-off</b> <b>trench</b> intended to preclude water infiltrating under the dam, was deepened by 6 ft. The exposed rock was not prepared or smoothed with concrete. The foundation grouting required an unusually large amount of material to fill cracks in the upper 65 ft, with additional grouting required at the right abutment and outlet works. [...] Work on the dam was completed by the end on 1963, with final completion on April 24, 1964. Work on the powerplant started in 1963, with completion in 1965.|$|E
30|$|Clay {{minerals}} and organoclays {{are widely used}} as adsorbents due to their textural and physical–chemical characteristics, such as: high specific area, pore size diameter, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and hydrophilic particles that can be formed their reactive surfaces. As a petrographical definition, bentonite is a geological material composed from volcanic ashes altered in shallow sea and lagoons areas and generally formed by phyllosilicates, such as smectite types, which is a 2 : 1 mineral, consists of two tetrahedral sheets (silicon/oxygen) separated by an octahedral sheet (aluminum/oxygen/hydroxyl) (Meunier 2005; Bulut et al. 2009). The ions with positive charges on the clay surface can be adsorbed onto the structure bentonite owing to {{the interaction between the}} negative and positive charge, in addition, bentonite clay is used in chemical and ceramic industries for fabrication of several ceramic products owing to the rheological properties, this phyllosilicate types are recommended to the fabrication of beds for utilization as desiccators or as dehydrator of various gases. The industrial and environmental applications of bentonite have showed an upsurge of interest in recent years; various abundant {{minerals and}} clay minerals have been utilized in manufacturing process of cement, and they included: kaolinite, goethite, dolomite, cristobalite, and palykorskite (Bojumueller et al. 2001; Taylor-Lange et al. 2012). The utilization of bentonite/cement slurry <b>trench</b> <b>cut-off</b> walls, peculiarly in the highly attackable environments, raises concerns over durability, The durability and physical–chemical interactions of the bentonite clay type and cement, blend used as cut-off walls are important factors in determining their potential service life and how long they will function properly in the soils (Plee et al. 1990; Garvin and Hayles 1999; Shannag 2000). There is limited data available as partial replacements of cement in concrete using Brazilian bentonite samples.|$|R
40|$|When mining {{activities}} {{in some parts}} of the Witwatersrand were discontinued in 2000, the defunct workings started to flood. In September 2002 the mine water started to decant from the West Rand Mine Basin (WRB) next to the Tweelopie East Stream. Treated water is currently used in the mine's metallurgical plants and 15 Ml per day of treated water is disposed firstly into the Cooke Attenuation Dam and then discharged into the Wonderfonteinspruit. The aim of this study was to find and provide remediation measures as a result of acid mine drainage and other impacting factors on the water quality and volume in the Wonderfonteinspruit. Conductivity and total dissolved solids (TDS) were highest at the point where the tailings dam leached into the Wonderfonteinspruit. Sulphate was very high as was expected due to acid mine drainage. The best way to treat the high sulphate levels is with sulphate-reducing bacteria. To avoid the fatal flaw of many other constructed wetlands, a continuous carbon source is provided to the bacteria in the form of activated sewage from the Flip Human sewage treatment plant. Iron and other heavy metals are being precipitated through oxidation reactions to form oxides and hydroxides from the aerobic cell in the wetland. The wetlands are also known for their ability to reduce nitrate and microbial values with great success. In the remediation, four elements that currently do not comply with the SABS criteria for class 0 water, were chosen for improvement: conductivity, dissolved solids, sulphate and iron. Conductivity falls within class 1 and has a maximum of 178 mS/m @ 25 ºC that should be reduced to under 70 mS/m. Total dissolved solids have a value of 1585 mg/l, which is much higher than the prescribed 450 ml/l, making it class 2 water. The last two problematic elements are both considered as class 2 water: sulphate peaks at 592 mg/l where the preferred value is 200 mg/l, and iron should be 0. 01 mg/l, not the staggering 0. 3 mg/l. iv Alternative mitigation methods were identified and analysed for the impacts of the five major contaminators and ultimately the solution comes down to constructed wetlands. This is not a straightforward solution, however, and a specific design to accommodate all the different pollutants and water quality ranges was proposed. The other mitigation methods include a <b>cut-off</b> <b>trench</b> and pump-back system for the tailings dam, as well as the implementation of a monitoring programme. The sewage works should be optimised and better managed. Both the settlement and agricultural sector need to be educated on their representative impacts on the environment and government assistance should be available.
