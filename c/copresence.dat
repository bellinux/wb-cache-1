6000|$|I shall now {{proceed to}} the nature and genesis of the Imagination; but I must first take leave to notice, that after a more {{accurate}} perusal of Mr. Wordsworth's remarks on the Imagination, in his preface to the new edition of his poems, I find that my conclusions are not so consentient with his as, I confess, I had taken for granted. In an article contributed by me to Mr. Southey's Omniana, On the soul and its organs of sense, are the following sentences. [...] "These (the human faculties) I would arrange under the different senses and powers: as the eye, the ear, the touch, etc.; the imitative power, voluntary and automatic; the imagination, or shaping and modifying power; the fancy, or the aggregative and associative power; the understanding, or the regulative, substantiating and realizing power; the speculative reason, vis theoretica et scientifica, or the power by which we produce or aim to produce unity, necessity, and universality in all our knowledge by means of principles a priori [56]; the will, or practical reason; the faculty of choice (Germanice, Willkuehr) and (distinct both from the moral will and the choice,) the sensation of volition, which I have found reason to include under the head of single and double touch." [...] To this, {{as far as it}} relates to the subject in question, namely the words (the aggregative and associative power) Mr. Wordsworth's [...] "objection is only that the definition is too general. To aggregate and to associate, to evoke and to combine, belong as well to the Imagination as to the Fancy." [...] I reply, that if, by the power of evoking and combining, Mr. Wordsworth means the same as, and no more than, I meant by the aggregative and associative, I continue to deny, that it belongs at all to the Imagination; and I am disposed to conjecture, that he has mistaken the <b>copresence</b> of Fancy with Imagination for the operation of the latter singly. A man may work with two very different tools at the same moment; each has its share in the work, but the work effected by each is distinct and different. But it will probably appear in the next chapter, that deeming it necessary to go back much further than Mr. Wordsworth's subject required or permitted, I have attached a meaning to both Fancy and Imagination, which he had not in view, at least while he was writing that preface. He will judge. Would to Heaven, I might meet with many such readers! I will conclude with the words of Bishop Jeremy Taylor: [...] "He to whom all things are one, who draweth all things to one, and seeth all things in one, may enjoy true peace and rest of spirit."

50|$|Theory 2.0 {{suggests}} {{that the use of}} digital technologies changes the underlying processes of advocacy. In particular, the theory holds that collective action can exist without <b>copresence,</b> or with limited <b>copresence</b> (127). In the past, the collective understanding of advocacy was limited by institutional and contextual questions. Today, advocacy may mean finding patterns in data—perhaps, a new conception of framing in which words {{take a back seat to}} data to tell a story, or algorithms define the patterns of things that exist in the world. As Bimber noted, digital technology has changed the entire structure and understanding of information. However, like the information revolutions past, these changes may not completely overcome the institutions of the past. The collective action theories of Olson, Tarrow, and Keck and Sikkink retain important conceptual principles to guide the understanding of advocacy networks. Technology has simply thrown off the constraints posed by collaboration and information costs, raising broader, deeper, complex questions about what advocacy means, how it can be achieved, and from whence it stems.|$|E

Neutrons, which are electrically neutral, stabilize the nucleus in two ways. Their <b>copresence</b> pushes protons slightly apart, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, and they exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on protons. For this reason, one or more neutrons are necessary for two or more protons to be bound into a nucleus. As the number of protons increases, so does the ratio of neutrons to protons necessary to ensure a stable nucleus (see graph at right). For example, although the neutron-proton ratio of [...] is 1:2, the neutron-proton ratio of [...] is greater than 3:2. A number of lighter elements have stable nuclides with the ratio 1:1 (Z = N).

40|$|Recent work [1, 2, 3] {{has argued}} that {{subjective}} questionnaires may be ineffective at measuring <b>copresence</b> towards agents and avatars in immersive virtual environments (IVEs).

40|$|As {{collaborative}} {{computer systems}} are evolving, {{the use of}} spatial, three-dimensional interfaces for multiplayer games, groupware systems, and multi-user chat systems, for example, is increasing rapidly. This paper provides a theoretical underpinning for understanding the relevance of user embodiments and <b>copresence</b> within such three-dimensional collaborative computer interfaces. Firstly, the issue of embodiment is traced back through its origins in philosophy and psychology literature, and theories are identified, potentially helpful in understanding key issues concerning user embodiments in collaborative virtual environments. A hybrid avatar/agent model to achieve permanent user embodiments in such environments is discussed. Since <b>copresence</b> of other users within such environments {{has been shown to}} be an important factor for the experience of presence, a prototype embodied conversational agent has been designed to simulate <b>copresence.</b> A series of controlled experiments involving the prototype agent is discussed, highlighting the effects of simulated <b>copresence</b> on users experience of presence. Results suggest that, despite its shortcomings, the prototype agent does seem to have increased participants experience of presence. Evidence was found that even limited <b>copresence</b> as provided by the current prototype agent is sufficient to help users feel presence in the environment. The results seem to confirm that <b>copresence</b> simulated by agents can complement avatar technology and therefore that a hybrid avatar/agent model can potentially achieve permanent virtual presence of all participants...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} shared virtual environments (SVEs) has {{centered}} on presence and <b>copresence</b> and this has yielded important insights.

We explored the 1) interaction between low LDL cholesterol and albuminuria and 2) interaction between <b>copresence</b> of these two risk factors and statin use for cancer in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We analyzed prospective data for 3, 793 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients who remained naive for statin treatment and 1, 483 patients in whom statin treatment was initiated during a median follow-up period of 5. 24 years.

Biological interactions were estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and synergy index (S).

Preliminary results suggest that the metric behaves as expected. Keywords: <b>Copresence,</b> Face-to-face interaction. Face-to-face interaction evolved between humans present in the same physical space (cospatial) and time (cotemporal; not discussed further here). This <b>copresence</b> is essential for face-to-face interaction. Cospatiality concerns interaction between people and ECAs as well, and a potential design goal for ECAs is that they be perceived by persons interacting with them as cospatial. In some ECA implementations, the virtual and physical spaces are implicitly connected via a conduit such as a monitor, which acts as a window onto virtual space. In others, designers attempt to blend virtual and physical space to create a mixed reality. In immersive virtual realities the viewer is pulled from physical space into the virtual reality, and in the holographic projections of science fiction (e. g. the holodeck of Star Trek), virtual characters and objects are moved from virtual to physical space.

This paper proposes a model for the different modalities of connected presence whereby research on shared virtual environments can be integrated with research on other new media- and vice versa.
