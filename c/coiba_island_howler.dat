50|$|Coiba {{separated}} from continental Panama about 12,000 to 18,000 {{years ago when}} sea levels rose. Plants and animals on the new island became isolated from mainland populations and over the millennia most animals have diverged in appearance and behavior from their mainland counterparts. The island is home to many endemic subspecies, including the <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> <b>howler</b> monkey, the Coiba agouti and the Coiba spinetail.|$|E
50|$|Its unique {{location}} protects it {{from the}} damaging winds and other effects of El Niño, allowing it to sustain the uninterrupted evolution of new marine species including whale and tiger sharks, sperm whales, sea turtles, angel rays and giant schools of fish.

5000|$|The Coiba spinetail, Cranioleuca dissita, is a Furnariid {{endemic to}} <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island,</b> Panama. This {{primarily}} arboreal species is fairly common within its range. Despite this, {{it may be}} considered vulnerable due to its small range. It is not rated by IUCN.|$|R
50|$|Today, the {{productive}} reef areas in Piñas Bay, fished by boats from the famous Tropic Star Lodge, {{and the many}} other reefs and islands along the Pacific coast of Panama, particularly <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> in the Gulf of Chiriqui, still have probably the best fishing for black marlin in the Western Hemisphere. Black marlin averaging 200 to 500 lb hunt schools of rainbow runners, black skipjack, and other prey over these structures along with large Pacific sailfish and dorado. Occasional specimens will reach well over 600 lb. Slow trolling with bridle-rigged live skipjack is the predominant technique used to target black marlin by the Tropic Star fleet.

40|$|The Coiba {{howler monkey}} (Alouatta coibensis coibensis), and the {{capuchin}} monkey (Cebus capucinus imitator), are both living at <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island,</b> southwestern Panama, Central America. They are considered Vulnerable and Least Concern respectively by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). I carried out population {{surveys of the}} two subspecies from May to July 2009 and revisited on May to September 2010. The study covered potential habitats for these primates in the four points of the island. Surveys determined their occurrence and densities in each area. In all, 850 hrs were spent in survey activities. I used two methods: 1) triangulations based on vocalizations; 2) strip-transect censuses. One hundred and nine Coiba howler monkey groups were detected and counted, totaling 472 individuals remaining in the wild {{with a mean of}} 4. 3 individuals/group (range: 2 – 5). For the capuchin monkey, 626 individuals in 58 groups with a mean of 10. 75 individuals/group (range: 5 – 16) were detected. Factors related to small group size for <b>howler</b> monkeys on <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> are not known, but could be related to dietary resources throughout the year or seasonally, particularly ripe fruits. For capuchins monkeys, survivorship could be better than for Alouatta due to the wide range diet these monkeys could reach, this include arthropods, coconut and seeds of tea mangrove Pelliciera rhizophora. The primates of Coiba are not exposed directly to hunting activities but their population needs to be monitored and studied in-depth to better understand their dynamics and behavioral adaptations to this island habitat...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{this species}} is common and {{widespread}} {{throughout most of}} its range. Consequently, it considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN. In the Amazon, this species is primarily associated with relatively open habitats (e.g. Várzea Forest), resulting in it being rather local.

The Marañón gnatcatcher remains common, but is restricted to a small region with extensive habitat destruction. Three other taxa with highly restricted distributions may be threatened, these being anteocularis of the Magdalena Valley (Colombia), daguae of the Cauca Valley (Colombia), and cinericia of <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> (Panama).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Santa Cruz and El Gambute, two {{mangrove}} {{systems with}} associated tidal flats, were sampled in Coiba National Park, <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island,</b> Pacific of Panama.

40|$|The endemic stingless honey-making bee Melipona (Melikerria) insularissp. n. on <b>Coiba</b> and Rancheria <b>Islands</b> in Pacific Panama is described, {{together}} with the proposed sister species, M. ambigua sp. n. from northeast Colombia. The <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> group and Panama mainland were surveyed, yielding one meliponine endemic (M. insularissp. n.) and six meliponine genera and species. The poor Coiba fauna of amphibians and birds corresponds to the poor social bee fauna and suggests habitat barriers generally precluded recolonization from the mainland during glacial periods. Many animals became extinct, yet some remain as relicts. Melipona insularissp. n. was isolated on accreted terranes of Coiba rainforest in the Panama microplate. Morphology suggests that M. insularissp. n. is not a direct descendant of the San Blas-E. Panama endemic Melikerria, M. triplaridis. A phylogenetic hypothesis corroborates disjunct distributions. Rainforest endemics such as Peltogyne purpurea (Fabaceae) and Ptilotrigona occidentalis (Apidae, Meliponini) also occur as relictual, disjunct populations in Central and South America. These may have been isolated before accelerated biotic exchange began 2. 4 Ma. Our work supports the geological findings of both a volcanic arc and the San Blas massif providing a substantial bridge for Melikerria from Colombia and Panama in Eocene to Miocene times. We suggest there have been taxon cycles permitting recolonization during glaciations, whereby colonies of M. insularissp. n. were able to recolonize Rancheria, a 250 ha island, 2 km from Coiba. However, rafting colonies nesting in trees, carried on vegetation mats, may have produced founding populations of Melipona in Central America and on oceanic <b>islands</b> such as <b>Coiba...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since tarpon are not commercially {{valuable}} {{as a food}} fish, very little has been documented concerning their geographical distribution and migrations. They inhabit {{both sides of the}} Atlantic Ocean, and their range in the eastern Atlantic has been reliably established from Senegal to the Congo. Tarpon inhabiting the western Atlantic are principally found to populate warmer coastal waters primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and the West Indies. Nonetheless, tarpon are regularly caught by anglers at Cape Hatteras and as far as Nova Scotia, Bermuda, and south to Argentina. Scientific studies indicate schools of tarpon have routinely migrated through the Panama Canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific and back for over 70 years. However, they have not been found to breed in the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence by tarpon fishing guides and anglers would tend to validate this notion, as over the last 60 years, many small juvenile tarpon, as well as mature giants, have been caught and documented principally on the Pacific side of Panama at the Bayano River, the Gulf of San Miguel and its tributaries, <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> in the Gulf of Chiriquí, and Piñas Bay in the Gulf of Panama. Since tarpon tolerate wide ranges in salinity throughout their lives and will eat almost anything dead or alive, their migrations seemingly are only limited by water temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|Coral reefs usually {{exist in}} the {{euphotic}} zone (shallow areas of the sea where light can penetrate) along coastal or island areas, and require clear, oligotrophic (low nutrient) water in a narrow temperature and salinity range. Littoral areas located along the Southern Isthmus of Panamá demonstrate highly complex ecological interactions and distributions of endemic and migratory marine species {{due in part to}} the overlap of continental ecotones, tropical weather patterns and the convergence of powerful sea currents. In the Republic of Panamá, there is estimated 290 km2 of reefs along both Caribbean and Pacific coasts, however much higher diversity (about 68 hard coral species) occurs in the Caribbean, compared to 33 known species from 11 genera living along the Pacific coast. [...] The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is a biotope known for intrinsically low coral species diversity which unfortunately enhances the potential threats to these coral reef systems. Besides the direct effects of overfishing, anchor damage, and coral mining, terrestrial land use affects coral reef habitats in more indirect ways. Panamá experiences high seasonal rainfall (3000 mm/yr.) and reefs can be severely impacted if corals are chronically exposed to the runoff of nutrients originating from deforestation and soil erosion, fertilizers, pesticides or untreated sewage. In addition to being a primary area for cattle ranching and agriculture, unregulated construction, septic waste increase and local coastal population expansion poses a tangible threat to the biological integrity of coral reefs [...] surrounding the <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> Marine Protected Area (MPA). [...] Mangrove areas of Bahia Honda, Pixvae, and Puerto Mutis are important for the health of the local reefs, because mangroves not only filter the nutrients emptying onto reefs, but are important nurseries for juvenile fish, epibionts, crustaceans (i.e. shrimp), and other invertebrates that serve as critical food sources and spawning grounds for the offshore marine systems (i.e. <b>Coiba</b> and Cebaco <b>islands).</b> Scientists from around the world use the Liquid Jungle Lab facilities to study these reef systems in greater detail in order to establish ecologic baselines and understand natural and human impacts to the fish and marine life that rely on these habitats.|$|R

40|$|We used {{comparative}} studies to investigate {{how and why}} floral and bee fragrances evolve, including courtship odors collected by male Euglossa mixta to form their tibial bouquet, on <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island</b> and other Panama forests. Fragrances of four orchid genera, two used extensively by E. mixta - Coryanthes and Mormodes - and two never used, Clowesia and Catasetum - were also analyzed. From among 636 chemicals in 93 male tibiae, 66 were also found in 30 floral head-space samples of orchids, in which 315 total volatile compounds were detected. Geographic variation was noteworthy in E. mixta, but no {{significant difference was found}} between mainland and island populations. The aromatic benzenoids methyl salicylate, 2 -hydroxy- 6 -nona- 1, 3 -dienylbenzaldehyde (HNDB), and the monoterpene 1, 8 cineole, nearly always occurred. Coryanthes or other orchids produce two of the chemicals, but no source of HNDB is known. No statistical evidence was found of bee preference for orchids with bouquets like those formed in bee hindlegs, yet Coryanthes and Mormodes produced the most monoterpenes and more resembled the bees, when compared to Catasetum and Clowesia. Coiba bee tibial bouquets averaged 56 % as diverse as on mainland and Coiba has < 50 % the euglossine species of nearby mainland, but lacks those most similar to E. mixta, both in phylogeny and tibial bouquet. Coiba's diverse rain forest should contain many volatiles the bees seek. Because odor collection and production are costly, our findings strengthen hypotheses that odors are used to avoid interspecific reproductive interference. Despite finding large differences in the same orchid species, we do not know whether isolation of between 107 and 104 years produced differentiation. Fragrances seem analogous among orchids and bees, thus may lessen interspecific interference or competition, and promote outcrossing or favor embellishments, via female choice. Such adaptive reasons for fragrance variation within bee or orchid populations remain largely untested...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{of large}} predators {{has long been}} a {{challenge}} for biologists due to the limited information we have about their ecology, generally low numbers in the wild, large home ranges and the continuous expansion of human settlements. The American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is a typical apex predator, that has suffered from all of these characteristic problems, especially the latter one. Humans have had a major impact on the recovery of this species throughout its range, even though most of the countries it inhabits have banned hunting. The last decade {{has made it clear that}} in order to implement sound conservation and management programs, we must increase our understanding of crocodile spatial ecology. However, in only two countries where American crocodiles have telemetry studies even been published. Herein we have characterized the spatial ecology of C. acutus on <b>Coiba</b> <b>Island,</b> Panama, by radio-tracking (VHF transmitters) 24 individuals between 2010 and 2013, to determine movement patterns, home range, and habitat use. We have then compared our findings with those of previous studies to develop the most comprehensive assessment of American crocodile spatial ecology to date. Females showed a higher average movement distance (AMD) than males; similarly, adults showed a higher AMD than sub-adults and juveniles. However, males exhibited larger home ranges than females, and concomitantly sub-adults had larger home ranges than juveniles, hatchlings, and adults. There was an obvious relationship between seasonal precipitation and AMD, with increased AMD in the dry and "low-wet" seasons, and reduced AMD during the "true" wet season. We found disaggregate distributions according to age groups throughout the 9 habitat types in the study area; adults and hatchlings inhabited fewer habitat types than juveniles and sub-adults. These sex- and age-group discrepancies in movement and habitat choice are likely due to the influences of reproductive biology and Coiba's precipitation cycle. Juveniles also showed distinct movement patterns and home ranges; however, with sexual maturation and development, these behaviors became more characteristic of adults and sub-adults. Ours is one of a very small number of studies that will allow future management and conservation planning to be based on the comprehensive integration of the spatial ecology of a Neotropical crocodylian apex predator...|$|R
