Jean-Paul Wiest recorded that “Fr Krumplemann went on a mission trip 50 miles up the road and the barber of the town said to him, ‘My son has gone crazy, he is only 15 years old. We have got him tied up.’ So Fr Krumpelmann gave the kid one grain of santonin with one grain of calomel which was a purgative. In three or four days the child was all cured. Of course the father was delighted and the story went around the village and the neighbourhood, and the promotion of that accidental cure was worth hundreds of hours of preaching.” ...|$|E
40|$|Summary Although {{the concept}} of aid for trade has quickly gained {{prominence}} among aid donors as well as aid recipients, relatively {{little is known about}} its impact on trade-related performance. We use data on a large subset of developing countries for recent years to examine the extent to which various types of aid for trade have helped recipient countries' trade performance. We find that aid for trade facilitation reduces the costs of trading. Moreover aid for trade has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for trade, aid to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports. Its strong positive association with exports at the sectoral level is due to an allocation skewed toward already well performing sectors. aid for trade aid effectiveness trade cost of trading exports...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – South Asia {{has been}} an {{important}} destination of foreign aid over the past decades. Since a large part of aid is disbursed for social and economic infrastructure development in South Asian countries, and the volume of aid has tremendously increased in recent years, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate how far various categories of foreign aid affects economic growth rate in these countries. In addition, as the trend of each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> transfer appears to have been volatile, this study also investigates whether the volatilities inhibit growth rate in these countries. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, South Asia refers to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Random effects approach is employed incorporating panel data for the period of 1995 - 2008. The aggregate foreign aid is classified into various categories to have a comprehensive investigation. Findings – Foreign aid positively associated with growth whereas the volatility of aid hurts it. Long-impact aid promotes growth more than short-impact aid does. The volatility of short-impact aid hurts growth, whereas the volatility of long-impact aid has no effect on it. Pure aid and its volatility have no effect on growth. Originality/value – This study has identified the structure of foreign aid disbursed in these countries, and explored how far each category and respective volatility affects growth. These findings would be useful to the scholars and policy makers in the recipient countries as well as donors, to make foreign aid much more effective in future.

40|$|Fragile and conflict-affected states’ (FCAS) {{constitute}} {{an increasingly important}} <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> policy and action. But the category comprises a large and heterogeneous set of countries, problematizing coherent policy response which is often awkwardly split between boilerplate strategy and case-by-case approach. In both respects, efficiency of aid allocations is questionable. There {{is a need to}} disaggregate the category into smaller groups of countries, understood according to a more nuanced interpretation of the nature of their fragility. Disaggregation, however, is challenging insofar as it is hard to find a stable reference point internal to the category by which states’ relative performance – and causes of performance – can be determined. An alternative approach is to seek a reference point external to the entire FCAS category – for example a multilateral initiative – which allows us to explore systematic differences between those who sign up and those who do not. This research took the UN’s Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) initiative as such a mechanism. Splitting FCAS into two groups – those who had joined SUN within its initial two-year phase and those who had not – we reviewed a range of social, economic, political, institutional and conflict/instability indicators to identify areas of significant difference. An unexpected finding was that while SUN-joiners performed statistically better on governance, {{there was no difference between}} joiners and non-joiners on the level of instability and violence they suffered, suggesting that some countries, even at high levels of conflict disruption, can achieve areas of relatively good governance...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the state aid {{rules of the}} European Union {{and the application of}} these rules on banks. The primary problem that is addressed is what conditions should be fulfilled in order for state aid to banks to be declared compatible with the Common Market according to article 107 3 FEUF. The thesis addresses all kinds of state aid to banks and these have been divided into the following groups; (i) aid to banks (which are not in financial difficulties), (ii) aid to banks in financial difficulties, and (iii) aid to banks during a system crisis. The application of the state aid rules by the Commission has typically been very formal and there has been incufficient analysis of the actual consequences of aid granted to banks. This thesis is intended to contribute to a more systematic application by the Commission of the state aid rules on banks. Certain conditions must be identified and scrutinized in the application of the state aid rules on banks. Aid measures granted must, in order to be approved, be of public and common interest and the positive effects must be balanced against any negative effects. In order to achieve public and common interest in every individual case, the aid measures granted must be well balanced, necessary and have a stimulative effect. This thesis {{examines the}}se conditions within each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> to banks. Finally, I identify compensatory measures that may be well suited for banks. My thesis presents a systematic approach for the application of state aid to banks. In order to this this, I have found it important to describe the meaning of different concepts and conditions.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{administration}} of aid by bilateral, multilateral and non-government organisations in Zambia during the period 1990 to 2000. The particular {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the aid programs administered by the above organisations to the primary education sector using a case study approach. The study critically analyses how the performance of these organisation is or is not influenced by setting clear objectives, by elaborating planning processes and implementation arrangements. The study uses a matrix table developed through a NUD*IST retrieval reports generated from the data collected from each organisation’s documentation and in-depth interviews with key personnel. The study responds to five key research questions. These are: (a) what are the dominant objectives for each program: (b) how these objectives are structured: (c) what is the nature of the planning process: (d) what are the main channels for executing the programs: and what are the outcomes of the programs. The findings show that the aid organisations in the study have played a major role administering primary education sector programs through the provision of finance and technical assistance, however, most of these organisations, especially the bilateral and multilateral organisations, have not been very effective in delivering value to Zambia’s primary educations sector. Even though bilateral and multilateral aid organisations may have clearly defined objectives and elaborate planning processes, they normally use other agencies to implement their programs. The research shows that this causes loss of focus and control which consequently affects the performance of the programs. Non-government organisations, the third <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> organisations, on the other hand, are directly involved in the implementation of the programs even though they may have no set objectives or elaborate planning processes. Their approach is to involve the members of the local communities in the selection and planning of specific projects based on local need. These organisations, therefore, register better performance as they maintain more control and are unable to ensure more successful outcomes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Many {{reports have}} {{established}} that hearing-impaired children using the Nucleus 22 -channel cochlear implant may show both significant benefits to lipreading and significant scores on open-set words and sentences using electrical stimulation only. These findings have {{raised questions about}} whether severely or severely-to-profoundly deaf children should be candidates for cochlear implants. To study this question, postoperative results for implanted children with different levels of preoperative residual hearing were evaluated in terms of speech perception benefits. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective study of the first 117 children, sequentially, to undergo implantation in the Melbourne and Sydney Cochlear Implant Clinics was undertaken. All children had been assessed by and received their implants in a tertiary referral centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess aided residual hearing, the children were grouped into four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> hearing on the basis <b>of</b> their <b>aided</b> residual hearing thresholds measured preoperatively. To assess benefits, the scores of children on standard speech perception tests were reviewed. As different tests were used for children with different ages and language skills, children were grouped into categories according {{to the level of}} postoperative speech perception benefit. RESULTS: The results showed that children in the higher <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aided</b> preoperative residual hearing showed significant scores on open-set word and sentence perception tests using the implant alone. For children in lower <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aided</b> residual hearing, results were variable within the groups. More than 90 % of children with implants with aided residual hearing thresholds in the speech range above 1 kHz achieved open-set understanding of words and sentences. CONCLUSION: While the results of this preliminary study confirm previous findings of differential outcomes for children with different levels of preoperative residual hearing, they suggest that children with severe to profound hearing impairments should be considered for cochlear implantation.

40|$|Excerpt] A {{recurring}} {{issue in}} constitutional law concerns {{the extent to}} which the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment imposes constraints on the provision <b>of</b> public <b>aid</b> to private sectarian schools. The U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s past jurisprudence construed the clause to impose severe restrictions on aid given directly to sectarian elementary and secondary schools but to be less restrictive when given to colleges or indirectly in the form of tax benefits or vouchers. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s later decisions loosened the constitutional limitations on both direct and indirect aid. This report gives a brief overview of the evolution of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the Establishment Clause in this area and analyzes the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> that have been addressed by the Court. The report explains which categories have been held to be constitutionally permissible or impermissible, both at the elementary and secondary school level and at the postsecondary level. The report also briefly addresses a set of cases (Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn; Garriott v.

As the years march onward, conditions in Palestine continue to degrade. Palestinians face many problems with respect to humanitarian and developmental aid. Conditions are harsh, both because of the extreme weather and continued conflict with the Israeli military and diplomatic policies. Lack of communication and travel abilities between Gaza and the West Bank, and even between neighboring villages in each region, continue to lead to wider disparity between the two geographic regions creating dramatically different levels of need depending upon location. The policy proposed by this project includes a scale developed to provide flexibility in assessing the needs of communities {{on a case by}} case basis. This project focuses on the current issues faced in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in regards to education, food, and water security, as well as a proposed plan of action that involves the assistance of the United Nations and partner non-governmental organizations that are already active in the region. The scale developed herein is targeted specifically at these issues in this region; however, it can easily be broadened to address needs in other <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> as well as in other states in need <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> as the global political and geological climate alters over time. The overarching goal of the scale is to provide a ground for assessment that can lead each region through the stages <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>aid,</b> to developmental aid, and onward to stability...|$|R
