The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization. Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours. This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. <b>Collection</b> <b>technique</b> varies slightly by species, but the general methods for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each ovarian follicle and pulled out via vacuum.

Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.|$|E
2500|$|Freezing semen is a {{commonly}} used technique {{in the modern}} animal agriculture industry, which is well researched with established methods Semen is often collected using an artificial vagina, electroejaculation, gloved-hand technique, abdominal stroking, or epididymal sperm collection. Preferred collection techniques vary based on species and available tools. [...] Patience and technique are keys to successful collection of semen. There are several styles and types of artificial vaginas {{that can be used}} depending on the breed and species of the male. During this process the penis enters a tube that is the approximate pressure and temperature of the female's vagina. There is a disposable bag inside the tube that collects the semen. During this process it may be beneficial to have a teaser animal—an animal used to sexually tease but not impregnate the animal—to increase the arousal of the male. Electroejaculation is a method of semen collection in the cattle industry because it yields high quality semen. However, this process requires the animal to be trained and securely held, thus it is not ideal when working with wild or feral animals. When performing this process the electroejaculator is inserted into the rectum of the male. The electroejaculator stimulates the male causing an ejaculation, after which the semen is collected. The glove hand <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> is used mainly in the swine industry. During this process, the boar mounts a dummy, while the handler grasps the penis of the boar between the ridges of his fingers and collects the semen. Abdominal stroking is exclusively used in the poultry industry. During the technique, one technician will hold the bird, while a second technician massages the bird's cloaca. However, feces and semen both exit the male bird's body through the cloaca, so the semen quality is often low.|$|E

I {{remember one time}} when {{it looked as if}} I would have to leave behind several plants of a bulky variety because they and the machetecould not be handled at the same time. The under-growth was not so dense for a foot or two (approximately 30-60 cm) above ground. I got down on hands and knees and crawled for half a mile (roughly 800 m) but I brought home the orchids. [...] Up in Chiriquí, in the northwestern corner of Panama, orchids are found in abundance at an altitude of [...] to [...] Likewise abundant are barrancas, steep gullies like those in the Rockies, maybe hundreds of yards (meters) long and deep. One day about 6 years ago [...] - [...] I was 66 then [...] - [...] I saw a fine plant growing on a half-dead limb that grew out almost horizontally over one of those barrancas. 'I never saw you before,' I thought, and 'I won't let you get away, barranca or no barranca.' My man shinned out a few feet (roughly a meter) on that dying branch and then scurried back, scared at the prospect of a 500-foot (150 m) fall. That made me mad. I threw off my hat, coat, and shoes and went after that orchid. Just as I reached out for it the branch cracked. My heart stopped. But I never let loose my grip on that plant and scurried back to earth like a scared chipmunk. And that - {{that was the first time}} I ever saw the Odontoglossum Powellia. [...] A colony of vicious ants always is found in the roots of the bucket orchid. I am beginning to believe the eggs and waste nourish the orchid. As the branch falls the ground the Indian scrambles down treeand dives in the nearest water. You make a noose in a long rope, drop it over the branch and jerk it into the water. In a half hour or so the ants have drowned or floated away. Then you can pick up your rare find, but not before. George Harry Pring (see below) elaborated on collecting bucket orchids: [...] "Removing a clump of these plants may be compared with disturbing a hornet's nest, but, according to Mr. Powell, who had experienced both adventures, the hornets are easier to combat than the thousands of small stinging ants." [...] Pring then told of a fourth <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> used by Powell and Hunter; one Pring himself used. [...] "In many instances, to dislodge the epiphyte [...] "air plant", growing non-parasitically, without climbing the tree, it is necessary to cut a sapling with a forked-top as long as the distance up to where it clings. Its roots in some cases are three to four feet long, and great dexterity is required to dislodge it as to not cause injury. During this operation, clouds of dust, granulated bark and moss which rain down from above almost blind the collector." [...] "These men got many fine specimens through this method." ...|$|E

Umbilical {{cord blood}} (UCB) cells {{are a new}} {{alternative}} to bone marrow source for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and their use has increased in the last decade. Thus efforts are being made to improve the umbilical cord blood unit's quality. Besides compatibility, other factors, such as the total nucleated cell (TNC) count {{and the percentage of}} CD 34 (+) cells in the product, are very important for a successful transplant outcome. Our aim was to describe our donor population and assess the best cord blood <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein's cord blood bank (São Paulo, Brazil). Methods. This was a retrospective study in which all analyses were performed simultaneously. A Student's t-test was used for qualitative variables for non-matched samples. for qualitative analyses, we used either the chi-square test or the exact Fisher's test. Results. the stratification of the population characteristics allowed us to determine which ones had an impact on unit volume, TNC count and percentage of CD 34 (+) cells. A significant correlation was observed between donor characteristics and the quality of UCB units as related to maternal and gestational age, type of pregnancy, route of delivery, cord blood <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> and birth weight. Conclusions. We found that cord blood <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> and newborn weight were significantly correlated with the TNC content. the <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> used at our institution significantly improved the UCB unit volume and consequently the TNC count.

40|$|Abstract Background Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT) provides an appealing alternative {{for the preservation}} of genetic material in non-domestic and endangered species. An important prerequisite for successful SCNT is the availability of good quality donor cells, as normal embryo development is dependent upon proper reprogramming of the donor genome so that embryonic genes can be appropriately expressed. The characteristics of donor cell lines and their ability to produce embryos by SCNT were evaluated by testing the effects of tissue sample collection (DART biopsy, PUNCH biopsy, post-mortem EAR sample) and culture initiation (explant, collagenase digestion) techniques. Results Differences in initial sample size based on sample <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> had an effect on the amount of time necessary for achieving primary confluence and the number of population doublings (PDL) produced. Thus, DART and PUNCH biopsies resulted in cultures with decreased lifespans (50 PDL) and chromosomally stable (> 70 % normal cells at 20 PDL) cultures produced by post-mortem EAR samples. Chromosome stability was influenced by sample <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> and was dependent upon the culture's initial telomere length and its rate of shortening over cell passages. Following SCNT, short-lived cultures resulted in significantly lower blastocyst development (≤ 0. 9 %) compared to highly proliferative cultures (11. 8 %). Chromosome stability and sample <b>collection</b> <b>technique</b> were significant factors in determining blastocyst development outcome. Conclusion These data demonstrate the influence of culture establishment techniques on cell culture characteristics, including the viability, longevity and normality of cells. The identification of a quantifiable marker associated with SCNT embryo developmental potential, chromosome stability, provides a means by which cell culture conditions can be monitored and improved. </p...|$|E
