40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsDaniel M. O'BrienThe Chicago wheat futures {{contract}} has received attention {{in recent years}} regarding non-convergence with SRW wheat cash prices. In 2009 the CME Group announced their decision to implement a market based mechanism to set daily storage rates at registered delivery locations for the Chicago wheat contract. The new market based mechanism is a variable storage rate (VSR) that monitors Chicago wheat futures spreads relative to financial full carry. The running average of the futures spread {{at the end of}} the contract observation period determines future changes to existing storage rates. The objective of this study is to determine whether or not the adoption of VSR mechanisms has had an impact on SRW wheat basis convergence in the Toledo, OH switching district. The Chicago wheat <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> that were studied using OLS regression models include July 2010, September 2010, December 2010, and March 2011. A final OLS regression model examining the cumulative data collected from these four <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> concludes the research. The explanatory variables used to study SRW wheat basis convergence in Toledo includes days to delivery, all wheat ending stocks as a percentage of use for the United States, and VSR. In two of the regression models for the <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> studied VSR found to have a statistically significant impact, i. e., the December 2010 and March 2011 models. In the cumulative regression model covering all four wheat <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> VSR was also found to have a statistically significant impact on SRW wheat basis convergence. The regression models in this analysis appear to contain some degree of multicollinearity, a statistical condition in which the explanatory variables tend to move collinearly or “together” with each other. Multicollinearity oftentimes can result in deceptively high and inconsistent statistical results in econometric models...|$|R

40|$|The short- and long-run {{daily price}} {{relationships}} between cash and futures markets for live hogs were examined over the 1975 - 89 period. Price discovery generally originates in the futures market with about 65 % {{of new information}} being passed from the futures to the cash market. However, at times, especially during large price moves that are not necessarily anticipated in the futures market, the cash market price relies less on the futures market. The very short-term basis for hogs is fairly stable, with approximately 85 % of yesterday's nearby-basis persisting today. Generally, little can be gained by speculating on basis from day to day. The farther from futures contract delivery they are, the more the futures and cash price diverge from each other, reflecting {{the fact that they}} represent different markets.

40|$|This NebGuide {{provides}} {{strategies for}} using the futures market to obtain higher prices for soybeans. Soybean producers who decide to use the futures market to price their crop are immediately faced {{with a number of}} decisions. Should a futures contract be used as a hedge to 2 ̆ 2 lock in 2 ̆ 2 a price, or should an options contract be used to establish a floor price? When should the position be established? Which futures <b>contract</b> <b>month</b> is most appropriate? The many decisions facing those using the futures market may be a reason some have decided not to use it at all. The University of Nebraska completed a study analyzing various preharvest marketing strategies from 1988 to 1997. The study used daily futures and options prices and weekly decisions to identify basic strategies that consistently result in higher prices received than simply selling soybeans at harvest. The study calculated prices obtained by using hedges, put options, and 2 ̆ 2 fences 2 ̆ 2, a more complex strategy using put and call options. It compared the November and January contracts and various entry and exit strategies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to give a new {{approach}} in calculating the probability of returning a loan. A lot of factors affect the value of the probability. In this article by using statistical and econometric models some influencing factors are proved. The main approach is concerned with applying probit and logit models in loan management institutions. A new aspect of the credit risk analysis is given. Calculating the probability of returning a loan is a difficult task. We assume that specific data fields concerning the <b>contract</b> (<b>month</b> of signing, year of signing, given sum) and data fields concerning the borrower of the loan (month of birth, year of birth (age), gender, region, where he/she lives) may be independent variables in a binary logistics model with a dependent variable “the probability of returning a loan”. It is proved that the month of signing a contract, the year of signing a contract, the gender and the age of the loan owner do not affect the probability of returning a loan. It is proved that the probability of returning a loan depends on the sum of contract, the remoteness of the loan owner and the month of birth. The probability of returning a loan increases with the increase of the given sum, decreases with the proximity of the customer, increases for people born in the beginning of the year and decreases for people born at the end of the year...|$|E

Multiple regres-sion {{was used to determine}} the optimal corn futures <b>contract</b> <b>month</b> to cross hedge each spot monthly hay price.

A routine cross hedge was simulated and showed that cross hedging hay using corn futures increases gross returns per ton of hay. The marketing alternatives used by the alfalfa hay industry typically include sale at harvest, storage throughout the year and forward contracting. Outside of forward contracting, no mechanism exists for al-falfa hay producers and handlers to shift risks of unfavorable price changes. This paper examines the cross hedging possibilities for hay as a means of shifting price risk. This was examined using monthly New Mexico alfalfa hay prices, monthly U. S. average prices for all hay at the farm level and the Chicago Board of Trade corn futures prices. There is little in the literature about cross hedging. Anderson and Danthine provide a theoretical description of hedg-ing in futures markets that attempts to ac-count for the behavior of a broad class of agents. They derive optimal decision rules for agents concerned with the mean and variance of profit, and use these rules to evaluate how optimal cash and futures po-sitions are related to price expectations, the production possibilities and the num-ber of futures markets available.
