The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol <b>carboxylate</b> reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group).

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{utilization of}} synthetic plastics over last decades {{has led to}} environmental problems {{due to lack of}} degradability of plastics. The degradability issue has resulted in development of degradable plastics which degrade faster. This study deals with utilization of manganese <b>carboxylates</b> (i. e. manganese laurate,manganese palmitate and manganese stearate) on enhancing degradation of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Initially, manganese <b>carboxylates</b> were synthesized through two-steps reactions:(i) sodium <b>carboxylates</b> synthesis by reacting sodium hydroxide and carboxylic acids,(ii) manganese <b>carboxylates</b> synthesis by reacting manganese chloride and sodium <b>carboxylates.</b> Characterization of manganese <b>carboxylates</b> was then carried out. Incorporation of manganese <b>carboxylates</b> up to 1 % (w/w) into HDPE resin was carried out using twin screw extruder followed by injection molding to produce specimens. Thermal treatment was performed at 70 °C for maximum duration of 1000 hours to examine the degradation of pure HDPE and HDPE containing manganese <b>carboxylates.</b> Accelerated weathering was conducted up to 1000 hours combining thermal and UV exposure. Natural weathering was carried out for 24 weeks under weather conditions of Gambang,Malaysia. Analyses of tensile strength,elongation at break, FTIR spectra,average molecular weight,melt flow index (MFI),thermogravimetry (TG),differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),X-ray diffraction (XRD),and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out to asses the changes during treatments. Results have revealed that all manganese <b>carboxylates</b> have demonstrated adequate thermal stability. Their melting temperatures are in range of 108 - 117 °C. Manganese stearate has shown the highest thermal stability and melting point among manganese <b>carboxylates</b> synthesized. Thermal treatment has led to thermo-oxidative degradation of HDPE. Manganese <b>carboxylates</b> have significantly played a role in enhancing degradation of HDPE. The degradation increased by increasing amount of manganese <b>carboxylates.</b> During accelerated weathering,the degradation took place more rapidly than during thermal treatment,particularly for HDPE containing manganese <b>carboxylates.</b> Photo-degradation and thermo-oxidative degradation took place simultaneously during accelerated weathering and allowed dramatic reductions of essential properties. Natural weathering has given similar effects with accelerated weathering. Manganese <b>carboxylates</b> has also shown the capabilities on enhancing degradation of HDPE in natural environment. Manganese stearate has shown a slightly greater effect in enhancing degradation of HDPE than manganese laurate and manganese palmitate during all treatments. Pure HDPE lost its elongation at break about 16 %; 65 % and 64 %,whereas HDPE containing 1 % manganese stearate lost its elongation at break about 62 %; 96 % and 95 % for thermal treatment;accelerated weathering and natural weathering respectively. Tensile strength and tensile modulus also decreased proportionally with the decrease of elongation at break. Other properties have also been found to decrease including average molecular weight,thermal stability,and melting point. The MFI,carbonyl index and crystallinity were found to increase after all treatments. Generally,manganese <b>carboxylates</b> have demonstrated the capabilities on enhancing degradation of HDPE under all modes of treatments...|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for MMP-3 is {{a variation on}} a larger theme seen in all matrix metalloproteinases. In the active site, a water molecule is coordinated to a glutamate residue (Glu202) {{and one of the}} zinc ions present in the catalytic domain. First, the coordinated water molecule performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide substrate's scissile carbon while the glutamate simultaneously abstracts a proton from the water molecule. The abstracted proton is then removed from the glutamate by the nitrogen of the scissile amide. This forms a tetrahedral gem-diolate intermediate that is coordinated to the zinc atom. In order for the amide product to be released from the active site, the scissile amide must abstract a second proton from the coordinated water molecule. Alternatively, it has been shown for thermolysin (another metalloproteinase) that the amide product can be released in its neutral (R-NH2) form. The <b>carboxylate</b> product is released after a water molecule attacks the zinc ion and displaces the <b>carboxylate</b> product. The release of the <b>carboxylate</b> product is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction.|$|E

A 			number of organotin compounds {{have been shown}} to be toxic, and there 			is increasing concern regarding their widespread use in 			environmental and biological systems. Among organotin compounds, 			organotin <b>carboxylates</b> are highly important; these contain Sn 			bond formed through COO¯ group and have a number of interesting 			structural features and biological applications. 			Three groups of novel organotin(IV) <b>carboxylates</b> including mono-, di- 			and triderivatives of ligands: 3, 4 -methylenedioxy 			 6 -nitrophenylpropenoic acid (L 1), 3, 4 - methylenedioxyphenylpropenoic 			acid (L 2) and 2, 3 -methylenedioxybenzoic acid (L 3) were examined for 			their different biological activities. 			In vitro antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined 			against six pathogenic bacterial strains (antibacterial assay) and 			six pathogenic fungal strains (antifungal assay). Determined by the 			antimicrobial studies organotin(IV) <b>carboxylates</b> demonstrated a 			higher level of activity towards all tested bacterial and fungal 			strains than the respective free ligands. As a whole, antibacterial 			activities decreased in order of; diorganotin <b>carboxylates</b> tri-organotin 			<b>carboxylates</b> mono-organotin <b>carboxylates</b> ligand acids. However, 			tri-organotin compounds were the best towards antifungal activities. 			Since the organotin(IV) <b>carboxylates</b> inhibited the growth of 			micro-organisms, it has been assumed that the production of an 			enzyme has been affected, hence the micro-organisms were less able 			to metabolize nutrients and consequently, growth ceased. 			All the compounds were also investigated for their antitumor 			activities and cytotoxicity by crown gall tumor inhibition (potato 			disc) assay and brine-shrimp lethality bioassay, respectively. As 			determined by crown gall tumor inhibition assay and brineshrimp 			lethality assay; the antitumor or cytotoxic activities of these 			compounds fall in the order of; tri-organotin <b>carboxylates</b> 			di-organotin <b>carboxylates</b> mono-organotin <b>carboxylates,</b> a similar 			pattern is reported in literature. Such compounds may yield new 			leads for the development of antitumor drugs, which can display a 			different spectrum of antitumor activity. 			A panel of different mono-, di- and tri-organotin(IV) <b>carboxylates</b> 			that have higher biological activities in previous assays were 			selected to investigate their effect on MCF- 7 cells. Determined by 			the clonogenic assay, organotin(IV) compounds (0. 1 µg/ml, 1. 0 µg/ml 			or 10. 0 µg/ml) were markedly cytotoxic following treatment of MCF- 7 			cells with 1. 0 µg/ml particularly tri-organotin <b>carboxylates.</b> 			Further investigation was aimed to determine genotoxic effect and 			biochemicalcell fingerprint of MCF- 7 cells following treatment with 			selected panel of mono-, di- and tri-organotin(IV) <b>carboxylates</b> 			(0. 01 µg/ml, 0. 1 µg/ml or 1. 0 µg/ml) that were used in clonogenic 			assay. Induction of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) were measured by 			using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay and 			their relative micronucleus-forming activities using the cytokinesis-block 			micronucleus (CBMN) assay as well as alterations in biochemical-cell 			signatures was ascertained using attenuated total reflection fourier 			transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. 			In comet analysis, although there were marked fluctuations in the 			background levels of DNA SSBs measurable in control MCF- 7 cell 			populations, a remarkable consistency in the ability of all the 			organotin(IV) <b>carboxylates</b> to be comet-forming was noted. However, 			with the alkaline comet assay it was more difficult to distinguish 			between the relative abilities of tri-organotin <b>carboxylates,</b> 			di-organotin <b>carboxylates</b> or mono-organotin <b>carboxylates</b> to induce 			elevations in DNA SSBs. Probably as a consequence of their lower 			relative cytotoxicities, higher levels of micronucleus-forming 			activities were observed following treatment with either mono- or 			di-organotins as compared to tri-organotins. Following interrogation 			of treated-cell populations compared to control using ATR-FTIR 			spectroscopy, infrared spectra (900 1800 cm- 1) derived from 			organotin-treated MCF- 7 cells exhibited clear alterations in their 			biochemical-cell fingerprint following exposures as low as 0. 0001 			µg/ml; this was especially evident in the DNA/RNA spectral region (			 1490 1000 cm- 1).
