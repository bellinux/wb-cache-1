25|$|Around 1870 many European {{immigrants}} from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. Icelanders also arrived from Canada. Pembina was {{a town of}} many Norwegians when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran churches and schools, greatly outnumbering other denominations in the area. This group has unique foods such as lefse and lutefisk. The continent's largest Scandinavian event, Norsk Høstfest, is celebrated each September in Minot. The Icelandic State Park in Pembina County and an annual Icelandic festival reflect {{immigrants from}} that <b>country,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> also descended from Scandinavians.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt to}} {{describe}} the model of care used quickly becomes complex.

For the balance, the model much more closely resembles the Anglo-American model, with EMTs making their own treatment decisions based upon local guidelines, albeit at a basic life support level, or at best, with the limited skill set of an EMT-I.|$|E

The Hitchin British Schools Trust was formed and by 1994 were successful in purchasing the buildings. The Trust, mainly through the efforts of volunteers, has restored the schoolrooms to reflect their original condition, and work continues to improve them. The museum is visited by adults and groups of children from all over the <b>country</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> interested in seeing how their ancestors were taught.|$|E

25|$|From the {{research}} that has been conducted on TCKs, {{it has been found}} that subjects are generally more tolerant of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home <b>country</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments. Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either fluent in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.|$|E

25|$|Sterilization {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Brazil since it became legal and free for women over 25 in 1996, and is regulated by the Health Ministry. It had already been a popular practice among poor communities before the legalization of sterilization, and was practiced in private clinics. In 1994, over sixty percent of women in Goiás, and over seventy percent of women in Maranhão and Mato Grosso were sterilized. After the 1996 law, sterilization {{became part of the}} population control policy of the Brazilian government. Though some view sterilization as an inexpensive form of birth control and a useful tool in population control, others see the mass use of sterilization in Brazil as contrary to promoting women's choices in contraceptive use. Sterilization is most common among Afro-Brazilians in the Northeast of the <b>country</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> too poor to afford other types of contraception and uneducated on the long term consequences of sterilization. Scholars such as Andre Caetano and Joseph E. Potter claim that sterilization {{has been used as a}} political means of garnering votes while controlling population growth among poor, minority populations.|$|E

500|$|Loham is {{the fifth}} film {{directed}} by Ranjith in which Mohanlal was cast in the lead role. Ajmal Ameer and Andrea Jeremiah were confirmed during the pre-production period. Gauri Nanda received boxing lessons to help her prepare for her role. Niranjana Anoop, a daughter of one of Ranjith's family friends, made her acting debut in the film as Mythri, a badly behaved youngster. Loham is the second collaboration between Ameer and Mohanlal, following Madampi (2008).

In March 2015, {{it was confirmed that}} Aju Varghese would play a guest role. Also Deepak Parambol who came to see Mohanlal in the filming location ended up in a guest role. In April, Srinda Ashab, Manikuttan and Parvathi Menon were also signed for guest appearances in a musical performance. The Hindu wedding song was shot in Kozhikode. Several media outlets reported Pearle Maaney was to perform an item number in the film but the report was determined to be incorrect after a selfie of Maaney dressed in a wedding outfit was leaked online. She appeared in a cameo role. Maaney's scenes were filmed in three days. Salim grew a beard and shaved his head for his role.
