50|$|By the 1930s {{there was}} an {{increase}} in traffic through Honiton, which lay on the main route to Cornwall, which became a serous hazard to the school, with premises {{on both sides of the}} main road. The headmaster of the day, George Shallow, found a new site in the shape of a large Victorian country house with over 350 acres of land on the coast at Rousdon, a few miles to the West of Lyme Regis. This stood on the cliffs of what was later called the Jurassic Coast, now a World Heritage Site. The house had been built in the 1870s for Sir Henry Peek, 1st Baronet, by the architect Sir Ernest George, who also built Southwark Bridge in London. (Among Sir Ernest's pupils was the even more famous architect Sir Edwin Lutyens). In 1870 Sir Henry purchased the village of Rousdon, rebuilt the church and built the village school. He then commissioned Ernest George to design a mansion to take advantage of the superb position 152.4m/500 feet above the sea. Being a distance from the nearest town, the house had to be self-sufficient with laundry, <b>coach</b> houses, <b>harness</b> rooms, wine cellars, bowling alley, rifle range, china stores, bake houses, larders, museum, observatory, walled garden, tennis courts, farm buildings and numerous cottages to house the estate population, which at the end of the 19th Century extended to about 600.|$|R

50|$|Later it was San Felipe Station, a major stage {{stop on the}} Butterfield Overland Mail, {{being the}} {{headquarters}} for the Mail Agent {{in charge of the}} twelve stage stations between Warner's Ranch and Fort Yuma. San Felipe Station was located 10 miles southeast of Warner's Ranch and 18 miles northeast of Vallecito Station. The station served as a storage depot for up to 48 tons of barley and 36 tons of hay for the desert relay or swing stations.

5000|$|William Thompson Casson {{was born}} at Aspatria, Cumberland in 1844. After losing his parents in early {{childhood}} he became ward to his grandparents, local weavers, Robert and Isabella Burnett. After receiving an elementary education at the local school, he became an apprentice to John Ferguson, an Aspatria coach-builder of some repute. At work he had a meteoric rise; he trained as a wheelwright, developed into a draughtsman, and became Works Manager, {{before the age of}} twenty-five. Casson was also a small-time bicycle manufacturer in his own right, building his first bike simply because none of the ones on the market fitted his requirements. According to contemporary reports the finished design was not too dissimilar to the modern cycle. A close friend and fellow Aspatrian, Thomas Walker, founder of the Cockermouth monumental masons firm of Walker Brothers, bought one. Walker was apprenticed to Henry Graves, quarry owner and mason, who in his capacity of foreman supervised the building of Aspatria vicarage, and the churches of Bridekirk and Silloth. According to Walker, the sight of Casson speeding along the streets of Aspatria with his feet resting on the handlebars brought terror to the entire neighbourhood. He also enrolled for part-time education at the newly established Aspatria Agricultural College and became one of the institutions earliest successes. In 1875, the court of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and <b>Coach</b> <b>Harness</b> Makers of London bestowed a number of honours. He obtained a First Class prize for plane, practical and solid geometry; a Second Class prize for theoretical mechanics; a Bronze Medal and a technology prize of two guineas. [...] While at the 'Technology of Carriage Making' examination, held on behalf of the Royal Society of Arts he gained an additional First Class Certificate and a prize of £5. In 1876, he won a further Silver Medal and also a Certificate of Merit for the best treatise on carriage construction.|$|E
