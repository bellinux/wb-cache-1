5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including <b>cradle-to-cradle</b> laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

25|$|The various {{environmental}} {{features are}} expected to cost $30 million per ship, of which the WHR is to cost $10 million. Carbon dioxide emissions, per container, {{are expected to}} be 50% lower than emissions by typical ships on the Asia-Europe route and 20% lower than Emma Maersk. These are the most efficient container ships per TEU in the world. A <b>cradle-to-cradle</b> design principle was used to improve scrapping when the ships end their life.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cradle-to-cradle</b> is a {{specific}} kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a recycling process. It is a method used to minimize {{the environmental impact of}} products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development. From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles).|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, KLM {{introduced}} a new World Business Class seat to the long-haul fleet. Dutch designer Hella Jongerius designed the new cabin. The diamond-type seat is manufactured by B/E Aerospace and is installed on all Boeing 747-400s and Boeing 777s. The new seats are fully flat and offer -high definition personal entertainment systems. When fully flat, the bed is about [...] long.

2500|$|In 2003 Shaw Industries {{selected}} {{a combination of}} polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks, superior adhesion properties, dimensional stability, {{and its ability to}} be recycled. The EcoWorx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber. Although EcoWorx may be recovered from any fiber type, nylon-6 provides a significant advantage. Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon-6 depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon-6 chemistry is well-known and not addressed in first-generation production. From its inception, EcoWorx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance, health, and environmental standpoint. [...] Research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through elutriation, grinding, and air separation proved to {{be the best way to}} recover the face and backing components, but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer EcoWorx to the elutriation process was necessary. Research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life. EcoWorx is recognized by MBDC as a certified <b>cradle-to-cradle</b> design.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cradle-to-cradle</b> {{focuses on}} {{designing}} industrial systems so that materials flow in closed loop cycles which mean that waste is minimized, and waste products can be recycled and reused. <b>Cradle-to-cradle</b> simply goes beyond dealing {{with issues of}} waste {{after it has been}} created, by addressing problems at the source and by re-defining problems by focusing on design. [...] The <b>cradle-to-cradle</b> model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations.|$|E

5000|$|The Dictionary of Sustainable Management defines <b>Cradle-to-Cradle</b> as [...] "A phrase {{invented by}} Walter R.

This {{framework}} seeks to create production techniques that are not just efficient but are essentially waste free. In <b>cradle-to-cradle</b> production, all material inputs and outputs are seen either as technical or biological nutrients. Technical nutrients can be recycled or reused with no loss of quality and biological nutrients composted or consumed. By contrast cradle-to-grave refers to a company taking responsibility for the disposal of goods it has produced, but not necessarily putting products’ constituent components back into service." ...|$|E

50|$|Currently, the SPI resin {{identification}} code 7 ("others") is applicable for PLA. In Belgium, Galactic started the first pilot unit to chemically recycle PLA (Loopla).

50|$|As {{a higher}} goal, reverse {{logistics}} may {{also contribute to}} lower producers’ dependency on scarce or non-renewable resources by remanufacturing and reusing recycled materials {{for the production of}} new goods.
