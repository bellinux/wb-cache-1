The fuel cell stacks show good CO tolerance even though 140 ppm CO was present in the reformate stream during transients. The auto-thermal reforming (ATR) fuel cell processor could adiabatically produce a suitable reformate without external energy consumption. The output of hydrogen-rich reformate was approximately 120 N m(3) h(- 1) with a H- 2 content near 53 % and the CO concentrations generally were under 30 ppm. The fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> was integrated with the methanol reforming fuel processor and the peak power output of the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> exceeded 75 kW in testing.

40|$|Proton Exchange Membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most attractive candidates for transportation applications due to its inherently high efficiency and high power density. However, the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> efficiency can suffer because of the need for forced air supply and water-cooling systems. Hence the operating strategy of the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> can have a significant impact on the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> efficiency and thus vehicle fuel economy. The key issues are how the fuel cell back pressure and air flow through the fuel cell are controlled. One approach is fixed back pressure control. The other is optimum varying back pressure control. In both cases, the air flow stoichiometry is optimized. In this paper, a dynamic forward-looking vehicle model with a dynamic fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> model is employed. The effects of different fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> operation modes and different power split strategies on fuel economy of fuel cell hybrid vehicles are simulated. The simulation results of light duty vehicles on various driving cycles indicate a significant improvement in fuel economy for optimum varying back pressure operation compared to high fixed back pressure operation. For various fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> operation modes, the load leveling control can significantly improve fuel economy on some aggressive driving cycles such as US 06.

25|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) fuel <b>cell</b> <b>systems,</b> {{including}} Micro {{combined heat and power}} (MicroCHP) systems {{are used to}} generate both electricity and heat for homes (see home fuel cell), office building and factories.

As the result CHP systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems. A typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 1–3kWel / 4–8kWth. CHP systems linked to absorption chillers use their waste heat for refrigeration.|$|E

Several pivotal innovations, such as low platinum catalyst loading and thin film electrodes, drove the cost of fuel cells down, making development of PEMFC systems more realistic. However, there is significant debate as to whether hydrogen fuel cells will be a realistic technology for use in automobiles or other vehicles. (See hydrogen economy.) A large part of PEMFC production is for the Toyota Mirai. The US Department of Energy estimates a 2016 price at $53/kW if 500,000 units per year were made.|$|E

In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.|$|E

40|$|A {{bidirectional}} pressure-regulator {{system has}} been devised {{for use in a}} regenerative fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system.</b> The bidirectional pressure-regulator acts as a back-pressure regulator as gas flows through the bidirectional pressure-regulator in one direction. Later, the flow of gas goes through the regulator in the opposite direction and the bidirectional pressure-regulator operates as a pressure- reducing pressure regulator. In the regenerative fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system,</b> there are two such bidirectional regulators, one for the hydrogen gas and another for the oxygen gas. The flow of gases goes from the regenerative fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> to the gas storage tanks when energy is being stored, and reverses direction, flowing from the storage tanks to the regenerative fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> when the stored energy is being withdrawn from the regenerative fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system.</b> Having a single bidirectional regulator replaces two unidirectional regulators, plumbing, and multiple valves needed to reverse the flow direction.

In less than 10 years, {{fuel cell vehicles}} have gone from mere research novelties to operating prototypes and demonstration models. At the same time, government and industry in development countries have teamed up to invest {{billions of dollars in}} partnerships intended to commercialize fuel cell vehicles within {{the early years of the}} 21 st century. The purpose of this study is evaluation of model and performance of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle in different drive cycles. A fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> model developed in this work is a semi-experimental model that allows users to use the theory and experimental relationships in a fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system.</b> The model can be used as part of a complex fuel cell vehicle model in advanced vehicle simulator (ADVI-SOR).

In addition, energy losses in drive cycle relates to fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> power request.

2500|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an [...] "External Recycle Mechanism" [...] or [...] "ERM" [...] box separate to the flotation cell. Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage <b>Cell</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has revolutionized genetic research. In terms of human health, it has applications to both specific diseases as well as stem <b>cell</b> <b>systems</b> that model these same diseases. In stem cell research, the CRISPR system has been successfully applied to {{a wide spectrum of}} diseases. Mutations in transcriptional repressor CTCF from cultured intestinal stem cells of cystic fibrosis patients were corrected using CRISPR/Cas. Subsequent applications built upon simple sequence corrections and successfully repaired a chromosomal inversion abnormality in Hemophilia A. Both applications demonstrate the utility of pairing CRISPR/Cas with stem cell models in the study and treatment of genetic disease. With the advent of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the applicability of CRISPR/Cas is further strengthened. To date, CRISPR methods have successfully repaired disease-associated genetic mutations in 1) metabolic disorders such as β-thalassemia, 2) immunological deficiencies such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) [...] and 3) neuromuscular diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The corrections of these genetic mutations, more importantly, are potential future vehicles for cell and gene therapies where the patient’s own repaired stem cells can be re-implanted. The no-SCAR method, as an improvement of the CRISPR/Cas system, will {{play an important role in}} modeling human disease using iPS cells and in the future treating these same diseases.|$|E
