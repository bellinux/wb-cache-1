5|$|Ronald Scott Stevens (born April 1, 1964) is a {{professional}} ice hockey coach and former player. As a defenceman, Stevens played 22 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Washington Capitals, St. Louis Blues, and the New Jersey Devils, serving as captain of the Devils from 1992 to 2004. Although offensively capable, Stevens was largely known for his defensive play and his heavy body <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> opponents.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{reached the}} Stalingrad Front in August 1942, {{soon after the}} start of the battle for the city. His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city's defense, {{mentions}} Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but {{to the end of his}} life, he was proud of his role. Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before Uranus was launched, Khrushchev spent much time <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.|$|E
5|$|The {{final round}} {{occurred}} on the September 9 episode of Impact!, with Sabin and Shocker versus Shelley and Waltman. This contest lasted 7 minutes and 20 seconds. Sabin and Shelley started off the match, with Shelley dominating Sabin with mat submission holds. The wrestling left the ring as Waltman performed a somersault splash to the ringside area onto Shocker and Sabin. Later, Sabin ascended to the top-rope to perform a dropkick onto Shelley, to only have Shelley dodge out of the way, resulting in Sabin hitting his partner Shocker instead. After <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> Shocker, Sabin turned around and was met with a kick to the jaw from Shelley. Sabin left the ring after this due to a legitimate injury. With Shocker left and the referee attending to other matters, Waltman hit Shocker in the groin and followed by performing his X-Factor maneuver to gain the pinfall victory and to win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the typhoon was {{forecast}} {{to strike}} areas {{affected by the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Officials prepared by installing a cover to prevent rain contamination. Ultimately, there still was rain contamination, and Ma-on's passage produced 2,000tons of radioactive water. Before the storm struck Japan, officials in Miyakonojō, Miyazaki advised the evacuation of about 900people in areas prone to mudslides. At least 300airline flights were canceled due to the storm. The typhoon also caused delays in the nation's rail system. Nippon Oil stopped shipping oil during the storm. As Ma-on moved across Japan, it produced winds of 108km/h (68mph), along with heavy rainfall of up to 1200mm (48in). Rainfall in a 24‑hour period reached 860mm (38.5in) in Umaji, Kōchi, which set a 24‑hour rainfall record and exceeded the average July precipitation by 265.5mm (10.6in). The rains flooded houses and roads in the region. High rains closed several expressways, and in Shizuoka Prefecture, a blocked road stranded 96mountain climbers. Strong winds left about 11,000people without power on Shikoku Island. The combination of winds and rain damaged the 385‑year‑old Nijō Castle in Kyoto. The typhoon injured 60people, and killed five people. One of the deaths was {{from a man who}} drowned while <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> his boat during the storm. Damage was estimated at ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E

5|$|The {{vanguard of}} the Crusader army {{consisted}} of the Knights Templar under Robert de Sablé. They were followed by three units composed of Richard's own subjects, the Angevins and Bretons, then the Poitevins including Guy of Lusignan, titular King of Jerusalem, and lastly the English and Normans who had charge of the great standard mounted on its waggon. The next seven corps were {{made up of the}} French, the Flemmings, the barons of Outremer and small contingents of crusaders from other lands. Forming the rearguard were the Knights Hospitaller led by Garnier de Nablus. The twelve corps were organised into five larger formations, though their precise distribution is unknown. Additionally, a small troop, under the leadership of Henry II of Champagne, was detached to scout towards the hills, and a squadron of picked knights under King Richard and Hugh of Burgundy, the leader of the French contingent, was detailed to ride up and down the column <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> Saladin's movements and ensuring that their own ranks were kept in order.|$|E

25|$|Glossop had {{orders to}} {{ascertain}} {{the status of the}} transmission station, and left with Sydney to do so, after sending a boat with Buresks crew to Emden with some medical supplies and a message that they would return the next day. In addition to <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> Direction Island, there was also the potential that Emden and Königsberg had been operating together and that the second ship would approach to recover the attack party from the island, or go after the troop convoy; consequently, Sydney could not render assistance to Emdens survivors until such threats had passed. It was too late to make a landing on Direction Island, so the cruiser spent the night patrolling the islands, and approached the wireless station the next morning. On arrival, the Australians learned that the Germans had escaped the previous evening in a commandeered schooner. Sydney embarked the island's doctor and two assistants, then headed for North Keeling Island.|$|E
25|$|The League {{concerned}} {{itself with}} the issue of active believers who had infiltrated its own membership and who were trying to prove their loyalty to the regime or even undermine the antireligious work of the League. League members who suspected each other of harbouring religious beliefs secretly discussed their concerns in the early years. The League also had {{to address the issue of}} atheists in its membership who may have sympathized with the religious believers and who may have had doubts about what they were doing. In answer to these, the League adopted a policy that any League member who entered a church (to conduct antireligious work by <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> the strength of believers or numbering them) had to first receive local branch approval beforehand in order so that he did not give the impression that he was going to the church to pray. In contrast the League in Tashkent actually tried to translate the Quran into Uzbek so that more Muslims could read it, in hope that when Muslims were able to read what the Quran actually said, they would reject its content as fallacious.|$|E
