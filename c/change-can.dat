50|$|Finding Religion in the Media, 2010 - PresentThe Center for Media, Religion and Culture is {{currently}} undertaking a study {{funded by the}} Ford Foundation on the ways religion is represented, experienced, and understood through the media today. The project, entitled “Finding Religion in the Media,” explores {{the extent to which}} religious belief, practice, and action—particularly that directed at social reform and social <b>change—can</b> be generated in and through the media sphere.|$|E
5000|$|Touch {{patterns}} enable robots {{to interpret}} human emotions in interactive applications. Four measurable features—force, contact time, repetition, and contact area <b>change—can</b> effectively categorize touch patterns through the temporal decision tree classifier {{to account for}} the time delay and associate them to human emotions with up to 83% accuracy. The Consistency Index is applied at the end to evaluate the level of confidence of the system to prevent inconsistent reactions.|$|E
40|$|W hen {{the first}} <b>change-can</b> double {{planetary}} mixer {{was introduced in}} the early 1940 s by Charles Ross and Son Company, it quickly became a popular machine for batching heavy paste paints. It had two sets of prong-like stirrers that rotated on individual axes while revolving around the vessel interior. All the gearing and other moving parts were enclosed in cast-iron housings and operated in a continuous oil bath. The vessel was fully covered during mixing, but the operator could see the internals from a lamp-lit inspection window. When the batch was complete, a hydraulic lift raised the driving components and stirrers from the mix can. As the finished product was discharged...|$|E
40|$|Some scientifically {{well-established}} results—such as {{the fact}} that emission of greenhouse gases produces global warming—are rejected by sizable proportions of the population in the United States and other countries. Rejection of scientific findings is mostly driven by motivated cognition: People tend to reject findings that threaten their core beliefs or worldview. At present, rejection of scientific findings by the U. S. public is more prevalent on the political right than the left. Yet the cognitive mechanisms driving rejection of science, such as the superficial processing of evidence toward the desired interpretation, are found regardless of political orientation. General education and scientific literacy do not mitigate rejection of science but, rather, increase the polarization of opinions along partisan lines. In contrast, specific knowledge about the mechanisms underlying a scientific result—such as human-made climate <b>change—can</b> increase the acceptance of that result...|$|E
40|$|Although {{most people}} {{understand}} {{the threat of}} climate change, they do little to modify their own energy conservation behavior. One reason for this gap between belief and behavior may be that individual actions seem un-impactful and therefore are not morally relevant. This research investigates how climate change helplessness—belief that one’s actions cannot affect climate <b>change—can</b> undermine the moralization of climate change and personal energy conservation. In Study 1, climate change efficacy predicted both moralization of energy use and energy conservation intentions beyond individual belief in climate change. In Studies 2 and 3, participants read information about climate change that varied in efficacy message, that is, whether individual actions (e. g., using less water, turning down heat) {{make a difference in}} the environment. Participants who read that their behavior made a meaningful impact reported stronger moralization and intentions (Study 2), and reported less energy consumption one week later (Study 3). Moreover, effects on intentions and actions were mediated by changes in moralization. We discuss ways to improve climate change messages to foster environmental efficacy and moralization of personal energy use...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the science-of-science-communication measurement problem. In its simplest form, the problem reflects {{the use of}} externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more fundamental level, the sci-ence-of-science-communication measurement problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The “beliefs ” individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: {{to gain access to}} the collective knowledge furnished by science, and to enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined by particular cultural commitments. The paper shows how appropriately designed “science comprehension” tests—one general, and one specific to climate <b>change—can</b> be used to measure individuals ’ rea-soning proficiency as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there is in fact little disagreement among cul-turally diverse citizens on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes is the contamination of education and politics with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason a...|$|E
40|$|Policies {{that reduce}} {{emissions}} {{of greenhouse gases}} can simultaneously alter emissions of conventional pollutants that have deleterious effects on human health and the environment. This paper first describes how these "ancillary" benefits—benefits in addition to reduced risks of climate <b>change—can</b> result from greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation efforts. It then discusses methodologies for assessing ancillary benefits and provides a critical review of estimates associated with reductions of criteria air pollutants. We find that these benefits in the U. S. may be significant, indicating a higher level of "no regrets" greenhouse gas abatement than might be expected based on simple economic calculations of abatement cost. However, the magnitude of ancillary benefits realized by any program of GHG mitigation is highly dependent on the location, pollutant, degree of exposure, and the economic behavior of individuals in response to the program. It is also highly dependent on the interaction of GHG abatement policies with the policies used for regulating conventional pollutants. We identify a rule of thumb to suggest ancillary benefits could be on the order of 30 percent of the incremental cost of GHG mitigation. For modest carbon reduction that do not result in changes in emissions of sulfur dioxide by electric utilities, ancillary benefits may be as high as $ 7 per ton. Greater benefits could be obtained with larger GHG reductions, although the costs of abatement would also be much greater. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Infectious {{disease can}} be a concern for several aspects of {{conservation}} biology, such as determining threats to species, estimating population viability, and designing reserves, captive breeding, and recovery programs. Several measures are useful for describing infectious diseases in host populations, {{but it is not}} straightforward to determine {{the degree to which a}} particular disease may affect a host population. The most basic epidemiological theory suggests that populations should be least subject to host-specific infectious disease when they are at low abundance (paradoxically, the state at which they are in most need of conservation action). There are important exceptions, however, such as when a reservoir host exists or when Allee or stochastic effects occur. Several of the key threats to biodiversity—habitat alteration, introduced species, pollution, resource exploitation, and climate <b>change—can</b> facilitate and/or impair transmission of infectious disease. Common management tools such as population viability analysis rarely address infectious disease explicitly. We suggest that such an inclusion is both possible and warranted. Considerations of infectious disease may influence the way we determine whether a species is in need of protection and how we might design reserves and captive breeding programs. Examples from the literature suggest that (1) introduced pathogens can make abundant species rare and (2) diseases of domestic animals can dramatically affect rare species. For both scenarios, conditions that cause stress or reduce genetic variation may increase susceptibility to disease...|$|E
40|$|Thunderstorm-related {{normalized}} {{economic and}} insured {{losses in the}} United States east of the Rockies from the period 1970 – 2009 (March–September) exhibit higher peaks and greater variability {{in the last two}} decades than in the preceding two decades. To remove the bias from increasingly detected losses over time due to newly built-up locations, only large events that incurred normalized losses of at least $ 250 million (U. S. dollars) economically ($ 150 million insured) were selected. These are multistate damage events that are unlikely to have been missed at any time within the analysis period, thus providing for homogeneity of the events covered. Those losses, if aggregated, account for the major proportion (~ 80 %) of all thunderstorm-related losses in the period 1970 – 2009. This study demonstrates that the pattern of variability in the time series of these losses can be seen as a reflection (‘‘fingerprint’’) of the temporal variability in severe thunderstorm forcing. The meteorological information on forcing is inferred from NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data. No final attribution of the climatic variability identified in thunderstorm forcing and losses—either to natural climate variability or to anthropogenic climate <b>change—can</b> be conclusively arrived at in this study because of the chosen methodology. Nevertheless, the expected impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the forcing of convective storms appear consistent with these findings...|$|E
