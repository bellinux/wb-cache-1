5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully become <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> greater evil may be lurking in the community when a teenager is suspected of murdering his father.|$|E
5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Frederick, {{the heir to}} the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused {{constitutional}} chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, as Regent (since the heir apparent, George III, was only a child), while the public favoured the child's mother Princess Augusta. In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with a council of others, and that George would become the heir when he reached maturity. Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was not <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> council was necessary.|$|E

50|$|From 1935 onward, he {{explored}} {{the use of}} electronics for telephone exchanges. By 1939, he was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> all-electronic system was possible. This background in switching electronics would prove crucial for his computer design in World War II.|$|R
5000|$|Mardana {{also wrote}} poetry. One of his {{compositions}} {{appears in the}} Guru Granth Sahib in Bihagadre ki Var [...] along with two others of Guru Nanak's addressed to Mardana. As per the composition Mardana is <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> evil body may be cleansed of sin in sangat (SGGS, 553).|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Isaac Luria (Harrison Coe), a Jewish man, is killed {{by a group of}} {{teenagers}} working for a racist shop owner. One of the assailants, however, is soon strangled to death and the fingerprints on his neck are Isaac's. Despite other factors, Mulder becomes <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Golem is attempting to avenge Isaac's murder.|$|E
5|$|Both {{women are}} {{reported}} to have had many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure. In one of them, Moberly claimed to {{have seen in the}} Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine, a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga; he was not observed by anybody else. During the First World War, Jourdain, the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh's, became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> German spy was hiding in the college. After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour, she died suddenly in 1924 {{in the middle of an}} academic scandal over her leadership of the college, her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff. Moberly died in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland, Shaw was accused of defeatism when, in a New Statesman article, he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless, when he became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> negotiated peace was impossible, he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The London blitz of 1940–41 led the Shaws, both in their mid-eighties, to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. Even there they were not immune from enemy air raids, and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house, Cliveden. In 1943, {{the worst of the}} London bombing over, the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court, where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged. Her condition deteriorated, and she died in September.|$|E
50|$|Professor Lee Jung-hoon from Yonsei University is not <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{organization}} such as North Korean People's Liberation Front is able {{to truly}} destabilize the North Korean regime, whatever methods they used, {{as they would have}} challenges trying to infiltrate North Korean society and posing {{as an alternative to the}} regime.|$|R
5000|$|Director Shawn Levy {{credited}} Ben Stiller for {{the ensemble}} cast: [...] "When actors hear that Ben Stiller is {{in a movie}} they {{want to work with}} him. It's a high-water mark and it absolutely draws actors in and I'm <b>convinced</b> <b>that's</b> <b>a</b> big part of why we got this cast." ...|$|R
60|$|As Joe {{stood in}} the pool there came a sudden rumble of thunder to his ears. He listened, and by the sounds became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> opening into the outer air {{could not be a}} great way off. Then came an {{unexpected}} flash of reflected light on the rocks by his side.|$|R
5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At {{the same time that the}} British became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report {{made no mention}} of using plutonium, but after {{discussing}} the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, which was codenamed X-10. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he concentrated the work at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago.|$|E

2500|$|In early 20th century, leading theosophists became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{appearance}} of the Maitreya as a so-called [...] "World Teacher" [...] was imminent. A South Indian boy, Jiddu Krishnamurti, {{was thought to be}} destined as the [...] "vehicle" [...] of the soon-to-manifest Maitreya; however the manifestation did not happen as predicted, and did not fulfil theosophists' expectations.|$|R
5|$|When Metternich {{returned}} to Vienna in October 1810, {{he was no}} longer as popular. His influence was limited to foreign affairs, and his attempts to get a full Council of State reintroduced had failed. <b>Convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> much weakened Austria should avoid another invasion by France, he rejected the advances of Tsar Alexander and instead concluded an alliance with Napoleon on 14 March 1812. He also supported a period of moderate censorship, aimed at preventing provocation of the French. Requiring that only 30,000 Austrian troops fight alongside the French, the alliance treaty was more generous than the one Prussia had signed a month earlier; this allowed Metternich to give both Britain and Russia assurances that Austria remained committed to curbing Napoleonic ambitions. He accompanied his sovereign for a final meeting with Napoleon at Dresden in May 1812 before Napoleon embarked upon the French invasion of Russia.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the leaders}} were of socialist or anarchist leanings, few of their {{supporters}} were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were eager for social justice and <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new world {{was about to be}} born. A crucifix hung beside the red flag in {{many of the}}ir meeting-places, and portraits of the King beside those of the revolutionaries Garibaldi, Mazzini and Marx. Cheers for the King were often heard in their marches that almost resembled quasi-religious processions. Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party) that had been founded at a conference in Genoa on August 14, 1892.|$|E
5|$|Anwar Sadat was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{regiment}} {{reinforced with}} aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but {{within three months}} of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and {{had no sense of}} loyalty or nationhood. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E
50|$|Born to a lower-class {{household}} in Monmouthshire, Wales, he {{trained as a}} doctor in London, England before returning to Wales, becoming interested in the Chartists' ideas regarding equal democratic rights for all men. Following their failed 1839 uprising, he escaped government persecution by fleeing to France, where he became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> ancient prophecy predicted that he would liberate his country from English rule.|$|R
50|$|Although {{they were}} members of La Liga which espoused the {{peaceful}} reform of the Spanish colonial government, Diwa, Bonifacio and Plata were apparently <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> armed uprising {{was the only way}} to attain independence from Spain. After hearing of Rizal's deportation, they founded a secret society and called it Katipunan in Tondo on July 7, 1892. The meeting was also attended by Deodato Arellano, Valentin Díaz and José Dizon.|$|R
5000|$|Simultaneously, his {{interest}} in traditional performing arts and their narrative peculiarities continued to enrich his own understanding of the elements that the Indian film narrative form had borrowed from each. He was increasingly <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> awareness of popular Indian cinema among Bollywood's writers and directors could lead to much more imaginative, engaging and entertaining forms that could also allow serious issues and themes to be tackled in the screenplay.|$|R
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Maritimes were <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> wider union {{including}} the Province of Canada {{would also be}} beneficial to them; Prince Edward Island was unsure, however, and very much against confederation. The delegates also believed that union could be achieved within a few years, rather than in an undefined period {{in the future as}} they had originally planned.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Hellena's sister Florinda {{attempts}} {{to marry her}} true love, Colonel Belvile, rather than the man that her brother has selected for her. The third major plot of the play deals with the provincial Blunt, who becomes <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> girl has {{fallen in love with}} him, but is humiliated when she {{turns out to be a}} prostitute and a thief.|$|E
60|$|For {{years back}} {{many of the}} people had been <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{occasional}} witch had appeared among them, getting into the churns and preventing the butter from coming, breaking the legs of sheep in jumping over the fence, causing their horses to become suddenly mysteriously sick, and making themselves obnoxious in various ways. But {{it was not until the}} year 1788 that New Jersey ghosts determined to go regularly into business at this place.|$|R
50|$|Massoud was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> only <b>a</b> {{democratic}} system could ensure a lasting peace in Afghanistan. He wanted {{to convince the}} Taliban to join a political process leading towards democratic elections in a foreseeable future.|$|R

25|$|Although the Germans claimed {{victory at}} Jutland, the British Grand Fleet {{remained}} in control at sea. It {{was necessary to}} return to effective anticommerce warfare by U-boats. Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, Commander in Chief of the High Seas Fleet, pressed for all-out U-boat war, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> high rate of shipping losses would force Britain to seek an early peace before the United States could react effectively.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, Judah {{was chief}} {{engineer}} {{for the newly}} formed Sacramento Valley Railroad, the first railroad built west of the Mississippi River. Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around Placerville, California were depleted, Judah was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> properly financed railroad could pass from Sacramento through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the Great Basin and hook up with rail lines coming from the East.|$|E
25|$|The new government's {{strategic}} {{thinking was}} sharply divided. Pitt {{had been a}} long-term advocate of Britain playing as small a role on the European continent while concentrating their resources and naval power to strike against vulnerable French colonies. Newcastle remained an old-school continentalist—who believed that the war would be decided in Europe, and was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> strong British presence there was essential. He was supported in this view by George II.|$|E
5000|$|Dall became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> [...] "evil" [...] global conspiracy, {{which he}} {{traced back to}} the Illuminati, {{secretly}} controlled history for its own enrichment. He wrote: I have depicted the [...] "Goliath," [...] here, and I have fashioned [...] "A Stone for Goliath," [...] as it were...Behold it: the Federal Reserve Board with its shadowy new international counterparts, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), Prince Bernhard's farflung Bilderberg Group and lastly their discredited stooge, the self-described United Nations.|$|R
25|$|Victor Amadeus II was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{efficient}} university controlled {{directly by}} the State {{was the only way}} to form a faithful and well-trained ruling class that could support him in the process of modernizing the Nation. While the War of Spanish Succession was still being fought, the Duke had entrusted his officials to gather information concerning the structure of the major Italian and foreign universities, and charged the Sicilian jurist Francesco D'Aguirre with the task of drawing up a reorganization project.|$|R
50|$|David McCord created {{one of the}} {{earliest}} and most important collections of objects, images and manuscripts associated with the history of Canada. <b>Convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> understanding of the past strengthens national identity, he devoted most of his life and personal fortune to gathering and documenting some 15,000 items related to Aboriginal, French and British history in North America. This man of vision bequeathed his outstanding collection to McGill University, which fulfilled his dream of founding a museum for the benefit of all Canadians.|$|R
