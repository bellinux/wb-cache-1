5|$|Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable {{characters}} {{after the}} player rescues them. Each {{of the five}} characters begin with basic abilities and receive additional, unique abilities as the game progresses, including abilities needed to solve some puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can smash dirt for banana coins, Chunky Kong <b>can</b> <b>lift</b> rocks, Tiny Kong can crawl through holes, Diddy Kong can fly, and Lanky Kong can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities.|$|E

In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and slides into the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and <b>can</b> <b>lift</b> several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't {{wait for the next}} time she babysits.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, <b>can</b> <b>lift</b> light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E

5|$|Shikamaru {{first major}} {{appearance}} in the series is during the Chunin Exams, Every four years genin take part to advance in rank. He is part of Team 10 alongside Choji Akimichi and Ino Yamanaka. He is a highly unenthusiastic person, and he attempts to go through life with minimum effort. Contrary to his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent; his teacher, Asuma Sarutobi, determined that Shikamaru's IQ was over 200. Shikamaru's abilities {{are based on the}} , the signature technique of his clan, with which he merges his shadow with an opponent's shadow, making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru's movements. As the series progresses, Shikamaru becomes able to manipulate his shadow in new ways. By Part II of the series, Shikamaru is capable of utilizing multiple shadow-based techniques at once and <b>can</b> <b>lift</b> his shadow from the ground in order to interact with physical objects; for instance, he can pierce enemies with the shadow tendrils or use them to throw weapons.|$|E

25|$|Buckling is also {{a failure}} mode in {{pavement}} materials, primarily with concrete, since asphalt is more flexible. Radiant heat from the sun is absorbed in the road surface, causing it to expand, forcing adjacent pieces to push against each other.

Going over a buckled section can be very jarring to automobile drivers, described as running over a speed hump at highway speeds.|$|E

25|$|Burn piles can {{and have}} spread {{uncontrolled}} fires, {{for example if}} wind blows burning material off the pile into surrounding combustible grasses or onto buildings.

Burn piles often do not result in full combustion of waste and therefore produce particulate pollution.|$|E

25|$|Installation {{and service}} / {{maintenance}} of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic {{operation of a}} wind farm. , there are 20 jackup vessels for lifting components, but few <b>can</b> <b>lift</b> sizes above 5MW. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) {{as well as for}} maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.|$|E
25|$|Season of the Witch is a 2011 American {{historical}} fantasy adventure film starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman {{and directed}} by Dominic Sena with extensive uncredited reshoots by Brett Ratner. Cage and Perlman star as Teutonic Knights, who return from the Crusades to find their fatherland ruined by the Black Death. Two church elders accuse a girl (Claire Foy) of being a witch responsible for the destruction; they command the two knights to transport the girl to a monastery so the monks <b>can</b> <b>lift</b> her curse from the land. The film draws inspiration from the 1957 film The Seventh Seal. It reunited Sena and Cage who had previously worked together on Gone in 60 Seconds.|$|E
25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the left hand can each be used {{in at least two}} {{different}} positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player <b>can</b> <b>lift</b> the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on the centre hole on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4.|$|E
