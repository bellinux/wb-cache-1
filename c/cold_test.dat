During the initial <b>cold</b> pressor <b>test,</b> heart rate and coronary pressures increased in all patients; total and regional coronary resistance usually increased in patients with severe coronary artery disease and usually decreased in patients with a normal coronary angiogram. Sublingual nitroglycerin induced important systemic effects, but intracoronary nitroglycerin did not; both induced dilation of coronary arteries viewed angiographically. Regardless of the route of nitroglycerin administration, coronary hemodynamic responses were directionally similar during the repeat <b>cold</b> pressor <b>test</b> compared with the initial one. These data support the concept that changes in tone of the large coronary arteries are not important in producing the cardiac responses observed during the <b>cold</b> pressor <b>test...</b>|$|R
