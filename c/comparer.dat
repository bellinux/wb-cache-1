60|$|The {{first thing}} that struck me in Mr. Searle's {{appearance}} was his very limited stature, which was less by half a head than that of his sister. The second was the preternatural redness of his hair and beard. They intermingled over his ears and surrounded {{his head like a}} huge lurid nimbus. His face was pale and attenuated, the face of a scholar, a dilettante, a <b>comparer</b> of points and texts, a man who lives in a library bending over books and prints and medals. At a distance it might have passed for smooth and rather blankly composed; but on a nearer view it revealed a number of wrinkles, sharply etched and scratched, of a singularly aged and refined effect. It was the complexion of a man of sixty. His nose was arched and delicate, identical almost with the nose of my friend. His eyes, large and deep-set, had a kind of auburn glow, the suggestion of a keen metal red-hot--or, more plainly, were full of temper and spirit. Imagine this physiognomy--grave and solemn, grotesquely solemn, in spite of the bushy brightness which made a sort of frame for it--set in motion by a queer, quick, defiant, perfunctory, preoccupied smile, and you will have an imperfect notion of the remarkable presence of our host; something better worth seeing and knowing, I perceived as I quite breathlessly took him in, than anything we had yet encountered. How thoroughly I had entered into sympathy with my poor picked-up friend, and how effectually I had associated my sensibilities with his own, I had not suspected till, within the short five minutes before the signal for dinner, I became aware, without his giving me the least hint, of his placing himself on the defensive. To neither of us was Mr. Searle sympathetic. I might have guessed from her attitude that his sister entered into our thoughts. A marked change had been wrought in her since the morning; during the hour, indeed--as I read {{in the light of the}} wondering glance he cast at her--that had elapsed since her parting with her cousin. She had not yet recovered from some great agitation. Her face was pale and she had clearly been crying. These notes of trouble gave her a new and quite perverse dignity, which was further enhanced by something complimentary and commemorative in her dress.|$|E

Et il avait coutume de gagner de l'argent avec cette bête, quoi-qu'elle fût poussive, cornarde, toujours prise d'asthme, de coliques ou de consomption, ou de {{quelque chose}} d'approchant. On lui donnait 2 ou 300 'yards' au départ, puis on la dépassait sans peine; mais jamais à la fin elle ne manquait de s'échauffer, de s'exaspérer et elle arrivait, s'écartant, se défendant, ses jambes grêles en l'air devant les obstacles, quelquefois les évitant et faisant avec cela plus de poussière qu'aucun cheval, plus de bruit surtout avec ses éternumens et reniflemens.---crac! elle arrivait donc toujours première d'une tête, aussi juste qu'on peut le mesurer. Et il avait un petit bouledogue qui, à le voir, ne valait pas un sou; on aurait cru que parier contre lui c'était voler, tant il était ordinaire; mais aussitôt les enjeux faits, il devenait un autre chien. Sa mâchoire inférieure commencait à ressortir comme un {{gaillard}} d'avant, ses dents se découvcraient brillantes commes des fournaises, et un chien pouvait le taquiner, l'exciter, le mordre, le jeter deux ou trois fois par-dessus son épaule, André Jackson, c'était le nom du chien, André Jackson prenait cela tranquillement, comme s'il ne se fût jamais attendu à autre chose, et quand les paris étaient doublés et redoublés contre lui, il vous saisissait l'autre chien juste à l'articulation de la jambe de derrière, et il ne la lâchait plus, non pas qu'il la mâchât, vous concevez, mais il s'y serait tenu pendu jusqu'à ce qu'on jetât l'éponge en l'air, fallût-il attendre un an. Smiley gagnait toujours avec cette bête-là; malheureusement ils ont fini par dresser un chien qui n'avait pas de pattes de derrière, parce qu'on les avait sciées, et quand les choses furent au point qu'il voulait, et qu'il en vint à se jeter sur son morceau favori, le pauvre chien comprit en un instant qu'on s'était moqué de lui, et que l'autre le tenait. Vous n'avez jamais vu personne avoir l'air plus penaud et plus découragé; il ne fit aucun effort pour gagner le combat et fut rudement secoué, de sorte que, regardant Smiley comme pour lui dire:--Mon coeur est brisé, c'est ta faute; pourquoi m'avoir livré à un chien qui n'a pas de pattes de derrière, puisque c'est par là que je les bats?--il s'en alla en clopinant, et se coucha pour mourir. Ah! c'était un bon chien, cet André Jackson, et il se serait fait un nom, s'il avait vécu, car il y avait de l'etoffe en lui, il avait du génie, je la sais, bien que de grandes occasions lui aient manqué; mais il est impossible de supposer qu'un chien capable de se battre comme lui, certaines circonstances étant données, ait manqué de talent. Je me sens triste toutes les fois que je pense à son dernier combat et au dénoûment qu'il a eu. Eh bien! ce Smiley nourrissait des terriers à rats, et des coqs combat, et des chats, et toute sorte de choses, au point qu'il était toujours en mesure de vous tenir tête, et qu'avec sa rage de paris on n'avait plus de repos. Il attrapa un jour une grenouille et l'emporta chez lui, disant qu'il prétendait faire son éducation; vous me croirez si vous voulez, mais pendant trois mois il n'a rien fait que lui apprendre à sauter dans une cour retirée de sa maison. Et je vous réponds qu'il avait reussi. Il lui donnait un petit coup par derrière, et l'instant d'après vous voyiez la grenouille tourner en l'air comme un beignet au-dessus de la poêle, faire une culbute, quelquefois deux, lorsqu'elle était bien partie, et retomber sur ses pattes comme un chat. Il l'avait dressée dans l'art de gober des mouches, er l'y exercait continuellement, si bien qu'une mouche, du plus loin qu'elle apparaissait, était une mouche perdue. Smiley avait coutume de dire que tout ce qui manquait à une grenouille, c'était l'éducation, qu'avec l'éducation elle pouvait faire presque tout, et je le crois. Tenez, je l'ai vu poser Daniel Webster là sur se plancher,--Daniel Webster était le nom de la grenouille,--et lui chanter: Des mouches! Daniel, des mouches!--En un clin d'oeil, Daniel avait bondi et saisi une mouche ici sur le comptoir, puis sauté de nouveau par terre, où il restait vraiment à se gratter la tête avec sa patte de derrière, comme s'il n'avait pas eu la moindre idée de sa superiorité. Jamais vous n'avez grenouille vu de aussi modeste, aussi naturelle, douee comme elle l'était! Et quand il s'agissait de sauter purement et simplement sur terrain plat, elle faisait plus de chemin en un saut qu'aucune bete de son espèce que vous puissiez connaître. Sauter à plat, c'était son fort! Quand il s'agissait de cela, Smiley entassait les enjeux sur elle tant qu'il lui, restait un rouge liard. Il faut le reconnaitre, Smiley était monstrueusement fier de sa grenouille, et il en avait le droit, car des gens qui avaient voyagé, qui avaient tout vu, disaient qu'on lui ferait injure de la <b>comparer</b> à une autre; de facon que Smiley gardait Daniel dans une petite boîte a claire-voie qu'il emportait parfois à la Ville pour quelque pari.|$|E
40|$|As the {{tendency}} to compare oneself with others {{may be associated with}} {{the tendency}} to focus on similarities, we hypothesized that individual differences in social comparison orientation (SCO) may moderate the consequences of upward and downward comparisons. In Study 1, high <b>comparers</b> were found to focus more on similarities than low <b>comparers,</b> suggesting that high <b>comparers</b> are more likely to assimilate in general. In Study 2, SCO was found to be positively associated with mood following exposure to an attractive target, and negatively associated with mood following exposure to a less attractive target. In Studies 2 and 3, SCO was found to be positively associated with self-evaluations of attractiveness following exposure to an attractive target and negatively associated with self-evaluations of attractiveness following exposure to a less attractive target. These results indicate that research on the consequences of social comparison must attend to individual differences in SCO. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Imagine {{that the}} product data of every online shop would be machinereadable and you could find the best product offers in an instant. Many {{e-business}} scenarios, such as price <b>comparers,</b> electronic markets, product search engines, and shop directories require integration of distributed heterogeneous information systems. Information extraction from heterogeneous Web sites has been a research topic for a long time. A frequently used approach for automatic information aggregation is to parse and extract information directly from Web pages. The main problem of these software routines is to find appropriate methods for parsing HTML pages. Web services {{on the other hand}} enable software routines to directly communicate with distributed information systems, therefore {{there is no need for}} parsing Web pages anymore. This paper examines new opportunities and challenges related to real-time product information transmission using Web services. The minimal characteristics that are common to all Web services and their application to a collaborative scenario between price <b>comparers</b> and online shops will be presented. In order to automate the information system integration we suggest that it is necessary to standardize the Web service interface for accessing product information from online shops. This is demonstrated by an example implementation. The main contribution of this paper is the practical aspect of using Web service semantics and technologies for real-time product information transmission. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} comparison of derogation effects of using successful versus attractive male spokesperson in advertising on male consumers in two culturally different countries -Netherlands and Brazil. According to the results, when a male consumer compares himself to attractive male spokespersons, the attitude towards the ad is significantly positive; when he compares himself to successful male spokespersons, the attitude toward the ad is significantly negative. Thus, men who compare themselves with a successful spokesperson do show a similar derogation effect as women who compare themselves with an attractive model. This {{is not the case}} for men who compare themselves with an attractive spokesperson. Brazilians showed more negative attitude towards the ad than the Dutch did if they compare themselves to a spokesperson. However, among non-comparers, Brazilians were more positive towards all ads than the Netherlanders were.

40|$|In principle, {{comparing}} {{a target}} (e. g. the self) to a referent (e. g. others) implies exploring similarities and differences. Yet {{people do not}} necessarily seek and report both in a balanced manner. Consistent with classic social comparison theory that postulated a strong drive towards uniformity, the mainstream view in social comparison research is that <b>comparers</b> primarily focus on similarities. Yet this assumption has remained largely untested. We examined whether similarities truly dominate comparisons by asking participants to compare the self or a friend to their circle of acquaintances. Participants responded by listing 10 traits. Two raters blind to conditions rated their responses as comparatively vs. non-comparatively worded and focusing on similarities or differences. Contrary to the postulated drive towards uniformity participants listed about eight times more differences than similarities. If they listed similarities, they did not particularly do so among the first of their responses. Revealing at least some awareness on participants’ side of social judgment being basically comparative, participants sometimes attributed traits to the target in non-comparative wordings (thus implicitly communicating differences between the target and the referent). These non-comparatively worded responses occurred despite instructions stressing that their answers should clearly reflect comparisons and they occurred more frequently in the friend condition than in the self condition, suggesting that participants found the comparative basis of their judgments more self-evident {{in the case of}} other-descriptions than in the case of self-descriptions.

40|$|The {{current study}} is an {{extension}} of an ongoing program of research, based on the Prototype/Willingness Model (Gibbons, Gerrard, 2 ̆ 6 Lane, 2003), which suggests that peer-based prevention messages may reinforce absent-exempt thinking, rather than reduce it (Stock et al., 2007). Absent-exempt thinking is the belief that if one has not experienced negative health consequences, in spite of having engaged in risky behavior, then one is unlikely {{to do so in the}} future (Weinstein, 1984, 1987). The present study provided an experimental demonstration of how social comparison prompted by a health message influences health cognitions (endorsement of absent-exempt thinking, willingness to engage in risky sex, prevalence estimates of risky sex on campus, favorability of risky sex prototypes, and perceptions of vulnerability to STDs). College students (N = 222) at either high or low risk of contracting STDs were randomly assigned to: (a) listen to a social comparison target who was a STD-positive student, despite engaging in low-risk sexual behavior (i. e., sex with one partner only a few times without a condom); (b) to hear a Public Service Announcement (PSA) that emphasized 2 ̆ 2 it only takes one time 2 ̆ 2 or (c) to hear no information about STDs. Participants then completed a questionnaire that assessed their risk-promoting cognitions and were then given the opportunity to read information on an STD.;It was predicted that high-risk participants in the social comparison group would report the highest levels of risk cognitions, whereas high-risk participants in the control condition would report lower levels of the risk promoting cognitions. High-risk participants in the PSA group would report moderate levels of these cognitions. The opposite pattern was predicted for low-risk participants: they would report the lowest levels of risk cognitions when they compared with the social comparison target and highest levels in the control condition. Because high <b>comparers</b> are more affected by comparison information it was hypothesized that the predicted interaction between information mode and participant sexual risk level would be stronger among those who engage in social comparison more often. It was also predicted that participant risk level and information mode would interact to produce differences in exposure time to the written information on STDs. Evidence of more heuristic-based processing that was expected for the health-risk cognition measures, but was not expected to be evident on intentions to get tested for STDs.;Initial analyses indicated that the overall pattern was such that the high-risk participants in the comparison condition tended to report the highest levels on all risk-promoting cognitions, whereas the low-risk participants in this condition reported the lowest levels. Additionally, the comparison group was significantly different from the PSA and control conditions, which were similar to each other. Due to these findings, the control and PSA conditions were collapsed together to form a non-comparison information condition.;As predicted, low-risk participants who heard from the low-risk, but infected, comparison target reported the lowest levels of absent-exempt endorsement, willingness, estimated prevalence, and the highest levels of perceived vulnerability. The high-risk participants in the comparison target condition reported the highest levels of absent-exempt endorsement, willingness, estimated prevalence, and the lowest levels of perceived vulnerability. These high-risk participants also spent the least amount of time reading information on genital herpes. Additionally, the impact of comparison information on the risk-promoting cognitions among low- and high-risk participants was greater for those who frequently engage in social comparison. Furthermore, although the high-risk participants in the comparison group reported the highest levels of heuristic-based responding, they also reported the greatest increase, from baseline to post-manipulation, in intentions to get tested for an STD, providing further support for the dual-processing nature of adolescent decision-making. This study highlighted the importance of social comparison in both the development of absent-exempt thinking and in reactions to health messages, especially those that are peer-based. This study also demonstrated the need to consider the risk status of both the audience and potential comparison targets employed in preventive health messages, and suggests that high social <b>comparers</b> and those who are at a greater risk may be more affected by comparison targets than are others...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the relationship between teacher discourse around social norms, student mathematical roles, and student mathematical explanations in the classroom. Mathematical explanations are important for learning mathematics and professional organizations encourage their use in the classroom. This study sought to understand aspects of the social environment that support explanations in the classroom. Using a mixed-methods approach, the researcher attempted to make sense of how student roles, explanations, and teacher discourse practices were related in four elementary classrooms. One-hour videos of one to two lessons per classroom were coded for the enactment of student roles, mathematical talk (explanations and non-explanations), student participation structures, and teacher follow-up. Quantitative analyses using chi-square tests examined student patterns of explanations and roles across different participation structures in the classroom. Results indicated Classroom A had significantly more explanations than Classrooms B, C, and D because students enacted the role of Sharer of Details of Problem-Solving Strategy more often; this role was always associated with students giving explanations. In addition, students in Classrooms B, C, and D enacted the roles of Agreer/Disagreer and <b>Comparer</b> which were not associated with explanations. Qualitative analyses indicated that the teachers used seven different discourse practices across the classrooms in different ways. All teachers used Directives and General Announcements, but in some classrooms these practices elicited the role of Sharer of Details of Problem-Solving Strategy, while in other classrooms, they elicited the roles of <b>Comparer</b> or Agreer/Disagreer. Teachers used Voting Exercises and Modeling of Comparing Behavior to elicit the <b>Comparer</b> role; teacher practices for the Agreer/Disagreer role included Voting Exercises as well as Validation Statements to students who enacted this role. Finally, the Classroom A teacher used Modeling Behavior to model Sharer of Details of Problem-Solving Strategy. This study corroborates previous work findings that teacher follow-up is important to elicit explanations in the classroom; without it, certain discourse practices did not result in the explanations that would have occurred otherwise. This study extended previous work by looking at how students enacted mathematical roles across multiple classroom settings, and how these roles were supported...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} {{that one of the}} main issues of hypersonic flight is the thermal management of the overall vehicle and more specifically the cooling of the engine, since even composite materials can't withstand the large heat load found in a Scramjet combustion chamber. Another critical point is that mixing and combustion should be sufficiently fast in order to avoid long combustion chamber caused by supersonic internal flow and short residence time. Cryogenic fuels are a logical choice but their lack of storability and low density make them second choice compared to liquid hydrocarbons for small vehicle application. Researches are currently conducted in order to optimize the cooling by the endothermic thermal decomposition of the fuel itself circulating trough the engine. The other benefit of this decomposition is the expected shift in the fuel mole fraction, from heavy hydrocarbons (with long induction delays), to light species (mainly H 2, CH 4 and C 2 H 4). MBDA-F launched with Orleans University a collaborative project named <b>COMPARER,</b> focusing on system analysis to identify one or two characteristic parameters (able to be measured) needed to understand and control the complex phenomena involved in the presented cooling technology and to evaluate some associated sensors. <b>COMPARER</b> is the French acronym for "COntrol and Measure of PArameters in a REacting stReam". The aim of this project is to identify one or two characteristic parameters (able to b...|$|E
