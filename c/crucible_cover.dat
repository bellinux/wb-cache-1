40|$|A <b>crucible</b> <b>cover</b> was {{designed}} as gas guidance to control the gas flow in an industrial directional solidification furnace for producing high purity multicrystalline silicon. Three cover designs were compared to investigate their effect on impurity transport in the furnace and contamination of the silicon melt. Global simulations of coupled oxygen (O) and carbon (C) transport were carried out to predict the SiO and CO gases in the furnace {{as well as the}} O and C distributions in the silicon melt. Cases with and without chemical reaction on the cover surfaces were investigated. It was found that the cover design has little effect on the O concentration in the silicon melt; however, it significantly influences CO gas transport in the furnace chamber and C contamination in the melt. For covers made of metal or with a coating on their surfaces, an optimal cover design can produce a silicon melt free of C contamination. Even for a graphite cover without a coating, the carbon concentration in the silicon melt can be reduced by one order of magnitude. The simulation results demonstrate a method to control the contamination of C impurities in an industrial directional solidification furnace by <b>crucible</b> <b>cover</b> design...|$|E

Later, they were weighed, {{transferred to a}} clean <b>crucible,</b> <b>covered</b> with a lid and kept in a sealed container for further processing. A muffle furnace (Carbolite RHF 1500, England) was used for semi-carbonized and activation process. Before inserting samples into muffle furnace, {{the temperature of the}} muffle furnace was set to maintain at 200  °C. Then, each of the cattail samples undergone semi-carbonized for 15  min and the furnace temperature was adjusted to the desired activation temperature at 500  °C and the sample was activated for 45  min.|$|R
30|$|In general {{activated}} carbon is prepared in an inert media (nitrogen or argon). However {{the preparation of}} inner environment for {{activated carbon}} is little bit inaccessible in general at local condition. Then an alternative method was applied in this study called double crucible method. In this method the char {{was placed in a}} smaller silicon <b>crucible</b> <b>covered</b> with ground silicon lid (Tatlok brand). The small crucible containing rice husk char is put in a bigger porcelain crucible. The gap inside the bigger crucible is filled up by raw husk to make reduce oxygen environment inside the crucible and finally the bigger <b>crucible</b> was <b>covered</b> with lid. In this method, the bulk volume of air inside the bigger crucible is replaced by raw char, again when the crucible is heated up; firstly the volume of air inside the crucible is expanded and a portion of the air comes out from both the small and bigger crucible; secondly the volatile part of rice husk is reacted with oxygen and it is assumed that the entire amount of oxygen is exhausted from the crucible during the heating process. Since there is no inert media is used in this study it will be cost effective process.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{growth of}} {{photovoltaic}} silicon ingots from the Melt is Currently performed in silica <b>crucibles</b> <b>covered</b> by a silicon nitride powder coating which prevents from sticking. The {{purpose of this}} study is to propose a comprehensive description of interactions in the Si/porous Si 3 N 4 -coating/SiO 2 system responsible for the non-sticking behaviour. The interpretations are based on wetting experiments performed by the sessile drop technique and on microstructure characterizations carried out by optical and scanning electron microscopies. We show that the Si 3 N 4 porous Coating constitutes a barrier to wetting and infiltration due to the presence of a non-wettable SiO 2 layer on nitride particles, and acts as a mechanical fuse due to its weak resistance resulting from its porous microstructure. The consequences of the study findings on the crucible used ill solidification of photovoltaic silicon are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a {{directional}} solidification furnace, ingots of silicon {{are contained in}} a silica <b>crucible</b> <b>covered</b> with a silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) powder layer. During the crystallization of the ingot, the layer may suffer various behaviors. When properly applied, it can efficiently act as a mechanical shunt between the Si and the silica wall. However, filling of the crucible with silicon pieces can also scratch locally the layer, resulting in deleterious adhesion between ingot and crucible. The layer can also be too thin, or insufficiently pyrolyzed, so that the Si interacts with the silica crucible. An extended simulation is carried out; {{taking into account the}} thermo-elastic stresses induced by the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the crucible and ingot materials that are attached On small areas. The model compares the remaining elastic energy to the adhesion energy between the silicon and the crucible, in order to predict the temperature at which the Si detaches from the crucible in case of sticking. Two configurations are compared in terms of amount or stresses and extent of the ingot volume likely to be impacted by dislocation generation. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

30|$|Rice husk is washed {{thoroughly}} with {{tap water}} initially to remove mud and other water soluble impurities {{and then the}} materials are washed with distilled water to remove other impurities. After washing the materials are dried in an oven at 105  °C for 24  h. The samples are preserved in desiccators to avoid further absorption of moisture. Dried rice husk sample is taken in a porcelain <b>crucible</b> and <b>covered</b> with lid {{and placed in a}} proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control muffle furnace at 650  °C for an hour. The carbonized husk samples are cooled and preserved for using for the next step of the procedure.|$|R
50|$|Commonly the {{reacting}} {{composition is}} five parts {{iron oxide red}} (rust) powder and three parts aluminium powder by weight, ignited at high temperatures. A strongly exothermic (heat-generating) reaction occurs that via reduction and oxidation produces a white hot mass of molten iron and a slag of refractory aluminium oxide. The molten iron is the actual welding material; the aluminium oxide is much less dense than the liquid iron and so floats {{to the top of}} the reaction, so the set-up for welding must take into account that the actual molten metal is at the bottom of the <b>crucible</b> and <b>covered</b> by floating slag.|$|R
30|$|The g-C 3 N 4 was {{prepared}} by direct heating of 5  g melamine powder and {{was put into}} an alumina <b>crucible</b> with a <b>cover</b> [35]. The sample was heated at 580 °C for 2  h with a heat rate of 10 °C/min. After heating, a yellow powder of bulk g-C 3 N 4 was obtained.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crucibles</b> {{and their}} <b>covers</b> {{are made of}} high temperature-resistant materials, usually porcelain, alumina or an inert metal. One of the {{earliest}} uses of platinum was to make crucibles. Ceramics such as alumina, zirconia, and especially magnesia will tolerate the highest temperatures. More recently, metals such as nickel and zirconium have been used. The lids are typically loose-fitting to allow gases to escape during heating of a sample inside. Crucibles and their lids can come in high form and low form shapes and in various sizes, but rather small 10-15 ml size porcelain crucibles are commonly used for gravimetric chemical analysis. These small size <b>crucibles</b> and their <b>covers</b> made of porcelain are quite cheap when sold in quantity to laboratories, and the crucibles are sometimes disposed of after use in precise quantitative chemical analysis. There is usually a large mark-up when they are sold individually in hobby shops.|$|R

It is prepared as conch shell ash, known in Sanskrit as shankha bhasma, which is prepared by soaking the shell in lime juice and calcinating in <b>covered</b> <b>crucibles,</b> 10 to 12 times, and finally reducing it to powder ash. Shankha bhasma contains calcium, iron and magnesium and is considered to possess antacid and digestive properties.|$|R

All experiments {{were carried out}} with the heating rate of 2.5  °C/min in corundum <b>crucible</b> with perforated <b>cover</b> in a temperature range of 45 – 600  °C. When the sample (~[*] 7  mg) was loaded into the analyzer an air (60  mL/min) was passed through the system. All experiments were carried out under atmospheric pressure.|$|R

In brief, 5  g of melamine {{was placed in}} an alumina <b>crucible</b> with a <b>cover</b> that was firstly heated to 80  °C, followed by calcining at 550  °C for 4  h in a muffle furnace. After natural cooling to room temperature, the obtained sample was milled into powder. Then, g-C 3 N 4 powder was ultrasonicated in water and centrifuged to remove the unexfoliated g-C 3 N 4.|$|R
40|$|After a {{decay of}} 4 days, 5 days, 7 days, and 8 days, samples were remeasured on a {{high-resolution}} Ge detector system (resolution of 1. 61 KeV for the Co 60, 1332 KeV photopeak). The same sample material used above was then fused {{with a combination}} of lithium metaborate/tetraborate and lithium carbon-ate in high-purity graphite <b>crucibles</b> <b>covered</b> with graphite lids in an induction furnace. The molten mixture was transferred to a 5 % (by volume) nitric acid (with Cd internal standard) solution. The molten bead immediately shattered and was shaken until totally dissolved (; 15 min). Masses of 0. 05 -g ali-quots in duplicate were analyzed by combustion-IR techniques using an ELTRA simultaneous carbon/sul-fur analyzer, Model 800. A sequence of 0. 1 -g aliquots were digested with aqua regia at 90 ¡C for 2 hours. Finally, a 0. 1 -g aliquot was subjected to an 18 -hour ramped digestion in Teßon test tubes using hydro-chloric, nitric, perchloric, and hydroßuoric acids. Sam-ples were analyzed by ICPÐoptical emission spec-trometry (OES) on a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 3000 ICP-OES and a Perkin-Elmer SCIEX ELAN 6000 and 6100. We noted systematically higher values in all cases for degraded (immersed in lake water) as com-pared to pristine meteorite abundances, except for H, Na, and Cl, which were much lower in the degraded specimens than in the pristine material. The H anom-aly is probably due to excess removal of indigenous water in the degraded sample; it is very common for CI chondrites to contain large amounts (in excess of 10 wt %) of primordial water [L. Baker et al., Lunar Planet. Sci. XXIX, 1740 (1998) ]. The large difference in Na and Cl between pristine and water-soaked samples might be interpreted as removal of water-soluble halite from Tagish Lake. Halite has been previously reported in H chondrites [M. E. Zolensky et al., Science 285, 1377 (1999) ]. This indirect indica-tion of halite in a carbonaceous chondrite would therefore be unsurprising...|$|R
25|$|The {{final stage}} was to melt the fritted {{material}} in <b>crucibles</b> in a <b>covered</b> furnace to give molten glass. The furnace needed {{to operate at}} as high a temperature as possible since quick melting {{and the need for}} less flux improved the quality of glass. The change from natron to potash required an increase in melting temperature of about 200°C to around 1350°C, necessitating a fundamental change in furnace technology and the development of high-temperature ceramics. At this higher temperature, normal clay would react chemically with the glass.|$|R
30|$|A {{simultaneous}} {{study of}} thermogravimetric and differential thermal properties (TG-DTA) {{of the surface}} structures was performed in a static air atmosphere by the derivatigraph Q- 1500 D (Hungary). The record was made using computer data registration. The parameters of the pattern recording were the following: the samples 35.2 – 102.6  mg were heated {{at the rate of}} 10  °С/min from 20 to 1000 °С; the sensitivity was 20  mg; and TG— 500, DTG— 500, and DTA— 250. The samples were placed into a corundum <b>crucible</b> and <b>covered</b> by a quartz beaker to create an equal temperature field. A SEM using JOEL- 6700 microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive and cathode-luminescence attachment was chosen as the main method of the research.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that if certain trace elements {{are present in}} cast iron melts the morphology of the graphite precipitates can be altered. In {{order to understand the}} effect of doping elements on primary growth of graphite, pure Fe–Sb alloys were prepared by induction melting. They were then placed in graphite crucibles and heated to a temperature above the Fe–C eutectic so that the charge became saturated in carbon and melted. To obtain Fe–Ce alloys, metallic Ce was added {{at the bottom of a}} graphite <b>crucible</b> and <b>covered</b> with iron, and then heated as for the Fe–Sb charge. In both cases, the melt was then cooled and held slightly above the eutectic temperature so that primary graphite crystals, which had nucleated on the crucible walls and then detached from it, could grow freely in the melt. The influence of the added elements on graphite growth was revealed by the change in the shape and distribution of the crystals compared to those obtained in similar experiments carried out with pure Fe. The experiments were made in air and vacuum so as to point out possible interactions between the elements present in the melt and oxygen...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} steps in processing sodium potassium niobate (KNN) ceramics is sintering. At temperatures close to the solidus line, the high volatility of the alkaline becomes an issue of major concern for the sintering process. While alkaline evaporation is frequently related to difficulties in densification, few work on the effects of alkaline vapor pressure on microstructure have been reported. KNN materials with alkaline/niobium ratios ranging from 1. 02 to 0. 98 were sintered at 1105 °C. Two different sintering setups were used. An alkaline rich sintering atmosphere was provided when sintering the materials embedded in (K 0. 5 Na 0. 5) 1. 02 NbO 3 powder, while reference ceramics were sintered in loosely <b>covered</b> <b>crucibles.</b> Resulting from the alkaline content in the sintering atmosphere a shift toward microstructures considered typical for batch compositions with higher alkaline content was detected.
