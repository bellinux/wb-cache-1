5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
5|$|It is {{only with}} the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> annals. One of his first {{significant}} acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of Bohemia Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.|$|E
5|$|The Chalukya era {{may be seen}} as the {{beginning}} in the fusion of cultures of northern and southern India, making way for the transmission of ideas between the two regions. This is seen <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of architecture. The Chalukyas spawned the Vesara style of architecture which includes elements of the northern nagara and southern dravida styles. During this period, the expanding Sanskritic culture mingled with local Dravidian vernaculars which were already popular. Dravidian languages maintain these influences even today. This influence helped to enrich literature in these languages. The Hindu legal system owes much to the Sanskrit work Mitakshara by Vijnaneshwara in the court of Western Chalukya King VikramadityaVI. Perhaps the greatest work in legal literature, Mitakshara is a commentary on Yajnavalkya and is a treatise on law based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of India. Englishman Henry Thomas Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance, giving it currency in the British Indian court system. It was during the Western Chalukya rule that the Bhakti movement gained momentum in South India, in the form of Ramanujacharya and Basavanna, later spreading into northern India.|$|E

5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. <b>Clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} urban {{planning}} dates {{to some of}} the earliest known cities, especially in the Indus Valley and Mesoamerican civilizations, which built their cities on grids and apparently zoned different areas for different purposes. The effects of planning, ubiquitous in today's world, can be seen most <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> layout of planned communities, fully designed prior to construction, often with consideration for interlocking physical, economic, and cultural systems.|$|E

25|$|The Pisani Dossi Ms. was {{published}} in facsimile by Francesco Novati in 1902, including the only reproductions of {{a copy of the}} Flower of Battle that are <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public domain. However, it is unclear how accurate this facsimile is as evidence suggests that Novati may have hired an artist to create a tracing of the original manuscript rather than reproducing it directly. This would have provided ample opportunity for errors to creep into the images, and might also account for the significant divergences from the artistic style of the Getty and the Morgan.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, it's <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{interest}} of Africa {{to play one}} side against the other, and to avoid alliances between China and the West, which might work to decrease raw material prices. Legal power remains {{in the hands of}} local African elites, {{who may or may not}} decide to enforce laws which would tighten control of resources, or further exploit them. Pursuing democracy and transparency is no longer the sole model; development is, for sure, and as long as African leaders can provide it, their power will be that much assured.|$|E
25|$|This idea of {{a romantic}} {{universal}} poesy can be seen <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> romantic triad. This theoretical structure always shows its recipient that the described moment is exactly the moment (kairos) in which the future is decided. These frequently mentioned critical points correspond with the artist’s feeling for the present, which Novalis shares with many other contemporaries of his time. Thus a triadic structure {{can be found in}} most of his works. This means that there are three corresponding structural elements which are written differently concerning the content and the form.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{this term}} also {{refers to the}} doctrines and {{practices}} of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader. Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated {{in a number of}} ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism, though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things—in salvation but also in all of life. This concept is seen <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doctrines of predestination and total depravity.|$|E
25|$|A small core of men, {{mostly in}} Companies A and E, were {{veterans}} of General N. B. Pearce's Brigade of Arkansas State Troops and had fought at Wilson's Creek in 1861, mostly in Captain Larkin Bunch's {{company of the}} 4th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops. These men were mostly pro-Southern in attitude; but by far {{the majority of the}} men conscripted into the other companies in the regiment were either pro-Union or decidedly neutral and wanted {{absolutely nothing to do with}} the war. They were conscripted to fight for a cause they did not believe in. This attitude is expressed very <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autobiography of Pleasant Houston Spears.|$|E

Its walls, columns and arches should bear the trophies won in athletic and scholastic contests, there to be preserved and handed down as part of the glorious history of the school.|$|E

25|$|Rural women, {{although}} poor, are independent, better organised, socially outspoken. According {{to another}} local custom, women {{can choose to}} terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called chudi pahanana, if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines here are related to 'women power' (e.g., Shabari, Mahamaya, Danteshwari) {{and the existence of}} these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On the contrary, the male authority and dominance is seen quite <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social and cultural life.|$|E
25|$|L'Engle's young heroines are {{sometimes}} {{compared to the}} author herself as a teenager, {{with some of the}} protagonists experiencing fictionalized versions of settings and incidents from L'Engle's youth. For example, Flip Hunter and Katherine Forrester both attend a Swiss boarding school, as did L'Engle. However, in a 1963 article, L'Engle's husband, Hugh Franklin, professed to see the adult version of the author more <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protagonists' mothers, Mrs. Murry (Dr. Kate Murry) and Mrs. Austin. The only characters acknowledged by L'Engle as being directly based on a real person were Rob Austin, who was based in her son, Bion Franklin; Canon Tallis, who was based on her spiritual advisor, Episcopal Canon Edward Nason West; and Bishop Nason Colubra, based on David Somerville, a retired archbishop of Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|Randel Helms {{argues that}} the books of the Bible were written for and against {{different}} points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write {{because they wanted to}} challenge or correct those who had written before them. So, for example, Paul said that he opposed Peter because he felt that Peter was <b>clearly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong (Galatians 1 and 2). Helms notes that Jeremiah condemned the entire religious establishment, that the prophets and priests were frauds, every one of them (Jeremiah 8:10). Luke felt the need to write another gospel even though other writers had already drawn up their own account of events (Luke 1:1). Luke felt that Mark's gospel was filled with errors and edited it freely, even the words of the dying Christ were not left unaltered.|$|E
