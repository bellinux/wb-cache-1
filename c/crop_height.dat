50|$|Post-emergent {{pesticide}} application {{requires the}} use of specific chemicals chosen minimize harm to the desirable target organism. An example is 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which will injure broadleaf weeds (dicots) but leave behind grasses (monocots). Such a chemical has been used extensively on wheat crops, for example. A number of companies have also created genetically modified organisms that are resistant to various pesticides. Examples include glyphosate-resistant soybeans and Bt maize, which change the types of formulations involved in addressing post-emergent pesticide pressure. It is important to also note that even given appropriate chemical choices, high ambient temperatures or other environmental influences, can allow the non-targeted desirable organism to be damaged during application. As plants have already germinated, post-emergent pesticide application necessitates limited field contact in order to minimize losses due to crop and soil damage. Typical industrial application equipment will utilize very tall and narrow tires and combine this with a sprayer body which can be raised and lowered depending on <b>crop</b> <b>height.</b> These sprayers usually carry the label ‘high-clearance’ as they can rise over growing crops, although usually not much more than 1 or 2 meters high. In addition, these sprayers often have very wide booms in order to minimize the number of passes required over a field, again designed to limit crop damage and maximize efficiency. In industrial agriculture, spray booms 120 feet (40 meters) wide are not uncommon, especially in prairie agriculture with large, flat fields. Related to this, aerial pesticide application is a method of top dressing a pesticide to an emerged crop which eliminates physical contact with soil and crops.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{retrieval}} of agricultural <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> from space by using multipolarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Coherent and incoherent <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> estimation methods are discussed {{for the first time}} with a unique TanDEM-X dataset acquired over rice cultivation areas. Indeed, with its polarimetric and interferometric capabilities, the TanDEM-X mission enables the tracking of <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> through interferometric SAR (InSAR), polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) and the inversion of radiative transfer-based backscattering model. The paper evaluates the three aforementioned techniques simultaneously with a data set acquired in September 2014 and 2015 over rice fields in Turkey during their reproductive stage. The assessment of the absolute height accuracy and the limitations of the approaches are provided. In-situ measurements conducted in the same cultivation periods are used for validation purposes. The PolInSAR and morphological backscattering model results showed better performance with low RMSEs (12 and 13 cm) compared to the differential InSAR result having RMSE of 18 cm. The spatial baseline, i. e. the distance between satellites, is a key parameter for coherent methods such as InSAR and PolInSAR. Its effect on the absolute height accuracy is discussed using TanDEM-X pairs separated by a baseline of 101. 7 m and 932 m. Although the InSAR based approach is demonstrated to provide sufficient <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> accuracy, the availability of a precise vegetation-free digital elevation model and a structurally dense crop are basic requirements for achieving high accuracy. The PolInSAR approach provides reliable <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> estimation if the spatial baseline is large enough for the inversion. The impact of increasing spatial baseline on the absolute accuracy of the <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> estimation is evident for both methods. However, PolInSAR is more cost-efficient, e. g. there is no need for phase unwrapping and any external vegetation free surface elevation data. Instead, the usage of radiative transfer based backscattering models provides not only <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> but also other biophysical properties of the crops with consistent accuracy. The efficient retrieval of <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> with backscattering model is achieved by metamodelling, which makes the computational cost of backscattering inversion comparable to the ones of the coherent methods. However, effectiveness depends on not only the backscattering model, but also the integration of agronomic crop growth rules. Motivated by these results, a combination of backscattering and PolInSAR inversion models would provide a successful method of future precision farming studies.

40|$|Background: In agriculture, {{information}} about the spatial distribution of <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> is valuable for applications such as biomass and yield estimation, or increasing field work efficiency in terms of fertilizing, applying pesticides, irrigation, etc. Established methods for capturing <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> often comprise restrictions in terms of cost and time efficiency, flexibility, and temporal and spatial resolution of measurements. Furthermore, <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> is mostly derived from a measurement of the bare terrain prior to plant growth and measurements of the crop surface when plants are growing, resulting in the need of multiple field campaigns. In our study, we examine a method to derive crop heights directly from data of a plot of full grown maize plants captured in a single field campaign. We assess continuous raster <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> models (CHMs) and individual plant heights derived from data collected with the low-cost 3 D camera Microsoft® Kinect® for Xbox One™ based on a comprehensive comparison to terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) reference data. Results: We examine single measurements captured with the 3 D camera and {{a combination of the}} single measurements, i. e. a combination of multiple perspectives. The quality of both CHMs, and individual plant heights is improved by combining the measurements. R 2 of CHMs derived from single measurements range from 0. 48 to 0. 88, combining all measurements leads to an R 2 of 0. 89. In case of individual plant heights, an R 2 of 0. 98 is achieved for the combined measures (with R 2  =  0. 44 for the single measurements). The crop heights derived from the 3 D camera measurements comprise an average underestimation of 0. 06  m compared to TLS reference values.

The assessment is made during the rice cultivation period, from transplanting to harvesting time (May to October) for fields around Gala lake (Turkey), {{one of the largest}} and most productive paddy rice planting area in the country. Detailed ground truth measurements describing biophysical parameters are collected in a dedicated campaign. A stack of 16 dual-pol TanDEMX images is used for the generation of 32 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) over the studied area. The quality of the data allows the use of the interferometric phase as a state variable capable to estimate <b>crop</b> <b>heights</b> for almost all the growing stages. The early vegetative rice stage, characterized by flooded fields, cannot be represented by the interferometric phase due to a low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) but can be easily detected by amplitude and interferometric coherence thresholding.

An analysis of the differences between HH and VV DEMs shows the varying signal penetration for the two polarizations at different growing stages. The validation with reference data demonstrates the capability to establish a direct relationship between interferometric phase and rice growth.

Both minimum- and zero- tillage were associated with reduced grain yields allied to reduced harvest index, biomass accumulation, interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and plant populations. Grain yields were optimized at mature <b>crop</b> <b>heights</b> of around 740 mm because this provided the best compromise between harvest index which declined with height, and above ground biomass which increased with height. Improving biomass with height was due to improvements in both PAR interception and radiation-use efficiency. Optimum height for grain yield was unaffected by tillage system or GA-sensitivity. After accounting for effects of height, GA insensitivity was associated with increased grain yields due to increased grains per spike, which {{was more than enough}} to compensate for poorer plant establishment and lower mean grain weights compared to the GA-sensitive lines. Although better establishment was possible with GA-sensitive lines, {{there was no evidence that}} this effect interacted with tillage method.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using wastewater grown barley plants {{as a component}} of fish feed was evaluated. The barley plants were grown in a hydroponics system on wastewater from a recirculating aquaculture facility. The effects of wastewater application rate on plant growth and pollution potential reduction were investigated. At the end of the experiment, the average <b>crop</b> <b>heights</b> and yields were 31. 0 and 36. 0 cm and 59 and 83 t ha - 1 at wastewater application rates of 690 and 1380 mL compartment - 1 day - 1, respectively. The hydroponics system reduced the TS, COD, NH 4 + -N, NO 2 - -N, NO 3 - -N and PO 4 - 3 -P of the aquaculture wastewater by 51. 5 - 52. 9, 72. 3 - 72. 3, 81. 8 - 82. 3, 97. 9 - 98. 2, 78. 9 - 79. 7 and 84. 7 - 86. 3 %, respectively. The aquaculture wastewater grown barley met the energy, fat, Ca, Mg, P, Na, S and Mn dietary requirements of aquatic animals. It exceeded the carbohydrate, crude fiber, Cl, K, Cu, Fe, Se and Zn dietary requirements of fish and shellfish. It did not contain sufficient amounts of protein. The aquaculture wastewater grown barley could potential be used as a component in fish feed, but will require supplementation with a high protein source that contains low concentrations of carbohydrate, crude fiber, Cl, K, Cu, Fe, Se and Zn.

40|$|Abstract: Hydroponically grown wheat, barley and oats were {{examined}} {{for their ability}} to remove nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Wheat, barley and oats seeds were germinated in water in a hydroponics system. The seedlings then received wastewater from an aquaculture system stocked with Arctic charr. During the experiment, the crops grew rapidly and fairly uniformly and showed no signs of mineral deficiency although fungal growth was evident. The average <b>crop</b> <b>heights</b> and yields at harvest were 19. 0, 25. 5 and 25. 2 cm and 64, 59 and 42 t haG 1 for wheat, barley and oats, respectively. The hydroponically grown wheat, barley and oats were able to significantly reduce the pollution load of the aquaculture wastewater. The TS, COD, NH 4 +-N, NO 2 G-N, NO 3 G-N and PO 43 G-P reductions ranged from 53. 3 to 57. 7 %, from 55. 7 to 78. 7 %, from 76. 0 to 80. 0 % from 85. 1 to 92. 9 %, from 62. 1 to 79. 3 % and from 74. 1 to 93. 0 %, respectively. The compartments containing barley produced the highest quality effluent, which was suitable for reuse in aquaculture operations. The average TS, COD, NH 4 +-N, NO 2 G-N, NO 3 G-N and PO 43 G-P concentrations and pH of the final effluent from the compartments containing barley were 442, 64, 0. 50, 0. 02, 5. 89 and 0. 61 mg LG 1 and 6. 65, respectively. The nutritive value of the three wastewater grown crops was assessed to determine the suitability of using the plants as a component in fish feed. The three terrestrial crops meet the energy...|$|R
40|$|Airport {{properties}} {{often include}} agricultural land cover that can attract wildlife species hazardous to aircraft, despite recommendations against row crops near air operations areas. However, {{few studies have}} directly quantified bird use of corn, wheat, and soybean fields relative to bird-aircraft collision (strike) hazard levels to support land cover recommendations. Therefore, we compared bird use among corn, wheat and soybean fields and predicted that corn and wheat would attract bird species recognized as hazardous to aviation. We also anticipated that soybeans would pose minimal attraction to such birds. Here, hazard ranking (low to extremely high) reflects the percentage of strikes involving a species that resulted in damage to aircraft. We investigated bird use among 22 corn, wheat, and soybean fields near Oak Harbor, OH, using approximately weekly point transects from 2013 to 2014. We used generalized distance sampling models and analysis of variance using distance matrices to determine bird abundance and community responses to row crop land coverages and <b>crop</b> <b>height.</b> We observed 4331 birds of 40 species, with most birds observed in wheat fields (n = 2555 birds) and standing stubble (n= 2409 birds). Large flocks occurred more in corn and wheat fields than soybean fields, but soybean fields harbored greater cumulative hazard scores than corn, likely due to consistent detections of small, non-flocking birds in soybean fields. Crop type and height had greater influence on medium- and high-hazard level bird species than other hazard levels. Density of medium- and high-hazard level birds increased with increasing <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> in soybean and wheat fields with wheat fields having slightly greater densities than soybeans. Corn fields also had the greatest bird densities in the tallest <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> categories. Categories of very and extremely high-hazard level bird species were rarely detected, but their abundance peaked in crops 0 – 15 cm, similar to low-hazard level bird species. However, model selection results included null models for very and extremely high-hazard level bird species suggesting minimal effects. Overall, our results suggest that all three crop types can harbor birds hazardous to aircraft, and <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> can enhance bird use. Although not directly tested in our study, land management surrounding airports may benefit most from alternative land covers (e. g., biofuel crops), but additional research is necessary...|$|E

40|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>height</b> {{measured}} from UAVs fitted with commercially available RGB cameras provide an affordable alternative to retrieve field scale high resolution estimates. The study presents {{an assessment of}} between flight reproducibility of Crop Surface Maps (CSM) extracted from Digital Surface Maps (DSM) generated by Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms. Flights were conducted over a centre pivot irrigation system covered with an alfalfa crop. An important step in calculating the absolute <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> from the UAV derived DSM is determining {{the height of the}} underlying terrain. Here we use automatic thresholding techniques applied to RGB vegetation index maps to classify vegetated and soil pixels. From interpolation of classified soil pixels, a terrain map is calculated and subtracted from the DSM. The influence of three different thresholding techniques on CSMs are investigated. Median Alfalfa crop heights determined with the different thresholding methods varied from 18 cm for K means thresholding to 13 cm for Otsu thresholding methods. Otsu thresholding also gave the smallest range of crop heights and K means thresholding the largest. Reproducibility of median crop heights between flight surveys was 4 - 6 cm for all thresholding techniques. For the flight conducted later in the afternoon shadowing caused soil pixels to be classified as vegetation in key locations around the domain, leading to lower <b>crop</b> <b>height</b> estimates. The range of crop heights was similar for both flights using K means thresholding (35 - 36 cm), local minimum thresholding depended on whether raw or normalised RGB intensities were used to calculate vegetation indices (30 - 35 cm), while Otsu thresholding had a smaller range of heights and varied most between flights (26 - 30 cm). This study showed that crop heights from multiple survey flights are comparable, however, they were dependent on the thresholding method applied to classify soil pixels and the time of day the flight was conducted...|$|E
