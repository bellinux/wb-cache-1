5|$|Before the 19th century, <b>cobalt</b> was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered <b>cobalt</b> green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered <b>cobalt</b> blue. <b>Cobalt</b> pigments such as <b>cobalt</b> blue (<b>cobalt</b> aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of <b>cobalt</b> green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and <b>cobalt</b> violet (<b>cobalt</b> phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (<b>cobalt</b> yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{physical}} and chemical properties of <b>cobalt</b> and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated <b>cobalt</b> in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range). Several defects related to isolated <b>cobalt</b> have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence, but their structure is yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> {{has been}} used to color glass since the Bronze Age. The {{excavation}} of the Uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue glass, cast during the 14th century BC. Blue glass items from Egypt are colored with copper, iron, or <b>cobalt.</b> The oldest cobalt-colored glass is from the Eighteenth dynasty in Egypt (1550–1292 BC). The source of that <b>cobalt</b> is unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of <b>cobalt</b> as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert <b>cobalt</b> salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of <b>cobalt</b> in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds, <b>cobalt</b> silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, <b>cobalt</b> blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. <b>Cobalt</b> occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of <b>cobalt</b> blue (a dye made with <b>cobalt</b> compounds and alumina) and smalt (<b>cobalt</b> glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of <b>cobalt</b> ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of <b>cobalt</b> in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world <b>cobalt</b> economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: <b>cobalt</b> is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling <b>cobalt</b> materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Free <b>cobalt</b> (the native metal) is {{not found}} on Earth because of {{oxygen in the}} {{atmosphere}} and chlorine in the ocean. Oxygen and chlorine are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent the formation of native metal <b>cobalt.</b> Except as recently delivered in meteoric iron, pure <b>cobalt</b> in native metal form is unknown on Earth (see below). Though the element is of medium abundance, natural compounds of <b>cobalt</b> are numerous. Small amounts of <b>cobalt</b> compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.|$|E
5|$|In nature, <b>cobalt</b> is {{frequently}} associated with nickel, {{and both are}} characteristic components of meteoric iron, though <b>cobalt</b> is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, <b>cobalt</b> in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of <b>cobalt</b> from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of <b>cobalt</b> and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of <b>cobalt</b> ores. Subsequent roasting converts the ores to the <b>cobalt</b> sulfate, whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of copper sulfate. <b>Cobalt</b> can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|E
5|$|The Mukondo Mountain project, {{operated}} by the Central African Mining and Exploration Company in Katanga, may be the richest <b>cobalt</b> reserve in the world. It is estimated able to produce about one third of total global production of <b>cobalt</b> in 2008. In July 2009 CAMEC announced a long term agreement under which CAMEC would deliver its entire annual production of <b>cobalt</b> in concentrate from Mukondo Mountain to Zhejiang Galico <b>Cobalt</b> & Nickel Materials of China.|$|E
5|$|The main ores of <b>cobalt</b> are cobaltite, erythrite, glaucodot and skutterudite (see above), {{but most}} <b>cobalt</b> is {{obtained}} {{by reducing the}} <b>cobalt</b> by-products of nickel and copper mining and smelting.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of <b>cobalt</b> ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for <b>cobalt</b> within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near Blackbird canyon {{in the side of}} a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.|$|E
5|$|After {{nickel and}} chromium, <b>cobalt</b> {{is a major}} cause of contact dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds <b>cobalt</b> directly. Another non-corrin <b>cobalt</b> enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|As for all metals, {{molecular}} {{compounds and}} polyatomic ions of <b>cobalt</b> {{are classified as}} coordination complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain <b>cobalt</b> linked to several ligands. The principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness {{of a series of}} ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of <b>cobalt.</b> For example, Co+3 complexes tend to have ammine ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C6H5)3)3CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+ derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs2CoF6) and potassium percobaltate (K3CoO4).|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> {{compounds}} {{have been}} used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to glass, glazes, and ceramics. <b>Cobalt</b> has been detected in Egyptian sculpture and Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in 79 AD), and in China dating from the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) and the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD).|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> green, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Rinman's green or zinc green, is a translucent green pigment made by heating {{a mixture of}} <b>cobalt</b> (II) oxide and zinc oxide. Sven Rinman, a Swedish chemist, discovered this compound in 1780.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Co and atomic number 27. Like nickel, <b>cobalt</b> {{is found in}} the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> is a {{constituent}} of tobacco smoke. The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as <b>Cobalt</b> {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves. These are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> is {{the active}} center of coenzymes called cobalamins, {{the most common}} example of which is vitamin B. As such, it is an {{essential}} trace dietary mineral for all animals. <b>Cobalt</b> in inorganic form is also a micronutrient for bacteria, algae and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced <b>cobalt.</b> The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant <b>cobalt</b> alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). <b>Cobalt</b> alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain <b>cobalt</b> for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, <b>cobalt</b> and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and <b>cobalt</b> (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E
5|$|However, chronic <b>cobalt</b> {{ingestion}} {{has caused}} {{serious health problems}} at doses {{far less than the}} lethal dose. In 1966, the addition of <b>cobalt</b> compounds to stabilize beer foam in Canada led to a peculiar form of toxin-induced cardiomyopathy, which {{came to be known as}} beer drinker's cardiomyopathy.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights activists}} had {{previously}} alleged, and on February 28, 2017 investigative journalism reported confirmation, that child labor {{is used in}} {{a portion of the}} worldwide supply of <b>cobalt</b> sourced from African artisanal mines. This revelation prompted cell phone maker Apple Inc., on March 3, 2017, to stop buying the ore from suppliers such as Zhejiang Huayou <b>Cobalt</b> who source from artisanal mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and only using suppliers that are verified to meet its workplace standards. In 2017, some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and <b>cobalt</b> mines in the area of <b>Cobalt,</b> Ontario where significant deposits are believed to lie.|$|E
5|$|In a {{borax bead}} flame test, <b>cobalt</b> shows deep blue in both {{oxidizing}} and reducing flames.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{due to the}} {{shortage}} of ethically-sourced <b>cobalt,</b> mined {{without the use of}} child workers as is common in the Congo, the price of <b>cobalt</b> metal had reached a nine-year high in October 2017, at above US$30 a pound, versus US$10 in late 2015.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium-promoted <b>cobalt</b> {{catalysts}} {{are used}} in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Such oxidations require metal catalyst, {{such as the}} {{naphthenate}} salts of manganese, <b>cobalt,</b> and chromium.|$|E
5|$|The SS Empire Miniver was a British steam {{merchant}} ship. She {{was originally}} an American merchant, launched in 1918 as SS West <b>Cobalt.</b> During a brief {{stint in the}} United States Navy in 1919, she was known as USS West <b>Cobalt</b> (ID-3836).|$|E
5|$|The main {{application}} of <b>cobalt</b> is {{the production of}} high performance alloys.|$|E
5|$|Today, some <b>cobalt</b> is {{produced}} specifically from various metallic-lustered ores, for example cobaltite (CoAsS), {{but the main}} source of the element is as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Zambia yields most of the <b>cobalt</b> mined worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} {{potassium}} cobaltinitrite, , {{which is used}} as artist's pigment {{under the name of}} Aureolin or <b>Cobalt</b> Yellow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> can be {{effectively}} absorbed by charred pigs' bones; however, {{this process is}} inhibited by copper and zinc, which have greater affinities to bone char.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> is an {{essential}} element for life in minute amounts. The LD50 value for soluble <b>cobalt</b> salts has been estimated to be between 150 and 500mg/kg. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.05mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 20mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cobalt</b> {{is used in}} {{electroplating}} for its attractive appearance, hardness, {{resistance to}} oxidation; it {{is used as a}} base primer coat for porcelain enamels.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-60 has a {{radioactive}} half-life of 5.27years. The loss of potency requires periodic {{replacement of the}} source in radiotherapy and {{is one reason why}} <b>cobalt</b> machines have been largely replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Szilard was {{diagnosed}} with bladder cancer. He underwent <b>cobalt</b> therapy at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital using a <b>cobalt</b> 60 treatment regimen that he designed himself. A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The doctors tried {{to tell him that}} the increased radiation dose would kill him, but he said it wouldn't, and that anyway he would die without it. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E
