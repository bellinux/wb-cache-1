Weakness of the subgrade and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} punching {{failure at}} edge columns of reinforced concrete flat slabs without shear reinforcement and unbalanced moments about an axis {{parallel to the}} slab edge. Edge column punching shear tests {{have been carried out}} on a variety of isolated and continuous specimens. The influence of eccentricity and continuity on punching resistance is assessed using existing experimental data, nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) and the Critical Shear Crack Theory (CSCT) as implemented in fib Model Code 2010 (MC 2010). Relating punching resistance to the elastic unbalanced moment as done in MC 2010 Levels I to III is shown to be overly conservative for <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs.</b> The ACI 318 and Eurocode 2 (EC 2) practice of making the design punching resistance independent of the unbalanced moment is reviewed and shown to be reasonable particularly for <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Environmental Engineers {{generalized}} {{a proposal}} of effectively utilizing the tensile zone of RCC Beams / Slabs to create sandwiched members {{that not only}} sufficiently resist bending moments and shear to vertical loading, but also provide sound proofing and thermal insulation to homes {{in which they are}} casted [1]. This also ensures reduced utilization of concrete and proved theoretically cost effective. At the end of the paper, few points regarding the proposal’s drawbacks were mentioned. One major practical concern is that vertical loads seldom act on slabs directly. They form components of inclined loading by means of wind for instance. Another prominent concern is that although the slab was designed and analyzed as a simply supported one, existing slabs in buildings are either one – way or two – way <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs.</b> Thus, the most important feature one needs to analyze on sandwich RCC slabs is the effect of loading on <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs.</b> This paper proposes t...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} reinforcement ductility on the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete slabs. An extensive experimental program examining the ultimate strength, ductility and failure mode of one-way and two-way reinforced concrete slabs is described {{and the results are}} presented and analysed. A numerical finite element model is developed and calibrated using the experimental data. The model is described and shown to accurately simulate the collapse load behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs containing reinforcement of any ductility class, including Class L welded wire fabric. Parametric studies using the numerical model to assess the effects of reinforcement ductility on structural behaviour are also presented and recommendations are made on the minimum reinforcement ductility levels appropriate for use in suspended slabs. The experimental and numerical tests investigated slabs with different types of boundary conditions (simply supported and <b>continuous</b> one-way <b>slabs,</b> corner-supported single panel two slabs and edge-supported two-way slabs), support settlement, steel reinforcement ratio, steel uniform elongation (&# 61541;su), steel ultimate to yield stress ratio (fsu/fsy) and rectangularity aspect ratio in the two-way slabs. In total, thirty one slabs were tested. The one-way slabs included four simply supported <b>slabs,</b> seven <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs,</b> and five <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs</b> with support settlement. The two-way slabs included eleven square and rectangular corner-supported slabs and four rectangular edge-supported slabs. The one-way simply-supported slabs were 850 mm in width, 100 mm in depth and 2, 500 mm in length. The <b>continuous</b> one-way <b>slabs</b> were 850 mm in width, 100 mm in depth and 4, 350 mm in length. The <b>continuous</b> one-way <b>slabs</b> and subjected to support settlement were 850 mm in width, 120 mm in depth and 6, 300 mm in length. The square two-way slabs had an edge length of 2, 400 mm and a depth of 100 mm and the rectangular two-way slabs had width of 2, 400 mm, a length of 3, 600 mm and a depth of 100 mm...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{on the application}} of basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars as longitudinal reinforcement for simple and <b>continuous</b> concrete <b>slabs</b> is presented. Eight continuously and four simply concrete slabs were constructed and tested to failure. Two continuously supported steel reinforced concrete slabs were also tested for comparison purposes. The slabs were classified into two groups according {{to the type of}} FRP bars. All slabs tested were 500 mm in width and 150 mm in depth. The simply supported slabs had a span of 2000 mm, whereas the <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs</b> had two equal spans, each of 2000 mm. Different combinations of under and over FRP (BFRP/CFRP) reinforcement at the top and bottom layers of slabs were investigated. The continuously supported BFRP and CFRP reinforced concrete slabs exhibited larger deflections and wider cracks than the counterpart reinforced with steel. The experimental results showed that increasing the bottom mid-span FRP reinforcement of <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs</b> is more effective than the top over middle support FRP reinforcement in improving the load capacity and reducing mid-span deflections. Design guidelines have been validated against experimental results of FRP reinforced concrete slabs tested. ISIS¿M 03 ¿ 07 and CSA S 806 - 06 equations reasonably predicted the deflections of the slabs tested. However, ACI 440 ¿ 1 R- 06 underestimated the deflections, overestimated the moment capacities at mid-span and over support sections, and reasonably predicted the load capacity of the <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs</b> tested. On the analytical side, a numerical technique consisting of sectional and longitudinal analyses has been developed to predict the moment¿curvature relationship, moment capacity and load-deflection of FRP reinforced concrete members. The numerical technique has been validated against the experimental test results obtained from the current research and those reported in the literature. A parametric study using the numerical technique developed has also been conducted to examine the influence of FRP reinforcement ratio, concrete compressive strength and type of reinforcement on the performance of continuous FRP reinforced concrete slabs. Increasing the concrete compressive strength decreased the curvature of the reinforced section with FRP bars. Moreover, in the simple and continuous FRP reinforced concrete slabs, increasing the FRP reinforcement at the bottom layer fairly reduced and controlled deflections...|$|R

40|$|<b>Continuous</b> steel-reinforced {{concrete}} <b>slabs</b> {{are vulnerable}} to corrosion damage and cracking. Non-metallic basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars have a great potential to overcome corrosion problems. In this paper, test results of six <b>continuous</b> concrete <b>slabs</b> internally-reinforced with BFRP bars are reported. The specimens {{were divided into two}} groups based on the BFRP reinforcement ratio in the sagging regions (2. 5 Pfb and 0. 8 Pfb), where Pfb is the balanced reinforcement ratio of BFRP reinforcement. In each group, the hogging-to-sagging BFRP reinforcement ratio was 0. 5, 0. 72, or 1. Increasing the hogging-to-sagging BFRP reinforcement ratio increased the ultimate load but had almost no effect on the cracking load. The flexural response of <b>continuous</b> <b>slabs</b> that failed by rupture of BFRP bars was more sensitive to the hogging-to-sagging BFRP reinforcement ratio than that of the slabs that failed by concrete crushing. The moment redistribution ratio in the sagging region at failure of the later specimens was in the range of + 40 % to + 48 % compared to + 10 % to + 26 % for the former specimens...|$|R

40|$|In slabs {{subjected}} to concentrated loads, the shear strength checks are conducted for two limit states: 1) shear over an effective width, and 2) punching shear on a perimeter around the point load. In current practice, the shear strength at the supports is determined with models {{that do not}} consider the transverse redistribution of load that occurs in slabs, which results in underpredictions for the actual slab shear capacity.
