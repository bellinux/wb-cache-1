5|$|<b>Curcumin</b> as of 2010 has {{not shown}} benefit in people {{even though there}} is {{tentative}} evidence in animals. There is inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that ginkgo has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia. As of 2008 there is no concrete evidence that cannabinoids are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia; however, some research looks promising.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including <b>curcumin,</b> epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from not}} smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and <b>curcumin</b> reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Curcumin</b> (turmeric) therapy, in {{conjunction}} with taking the medications mesalamine or sulfasalazine, may be effective and safe for maintaining remission in people with quiescent ulcerative colitis. The effect of <b>curcumin</b> therapy alone on quiescent ulcerative colitis is unknown.|$|E
25|$|In Phase I {{clinical}} trials, <b>curcumin</b> had poor bioavailability, {{was rapidly}} metabolized, retained low levels in plasma and tissues, and was extensively and rapidly excreted, factors that make its in vivo bioactivity unlikely {{and difficult to}} accurately assess. <b>Curcumin</b> appears to reduce circulating C-reactive protein in human subjects, although no dose-response relationship was established. Factors that limit the bioactivity of <b>curcumin</b> or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, extensive metabolism, and potential for toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{studies using}} <b>curcumin</b> {{conducted}} by Bharat Aggarwal, formerly {{a researcher at}} the MD Anderson Cancer Center, were deemed fraudulent and subsequently retracted by the publisher.

25|$|The biosynthetic {{route of}} <b>curcumin</b> is uncertain. In 1973, Roughly and Whiting {{proposed}} two mechanisms for <b>curcumin</b> biosynthesis. The first mechanism involves a chain extension reaction by cinnamic acid and 5 malonyl-CoA molecules that eventually arylized into a curcuminoid. The second mechanism involves two cinnamate units coupled together by malonyl-CoA. Both use cinnamic acid as their starting point, which {{is derived from}} the amino acid phenylalanine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Curcumin</b> {{has been}} shown to impart neuroprotection against Japanese Encephalitis {{infection}} in an in vitro study. <b>Curcumin</b> possibly acts by decreasing cellular reactive oxygen species level, restoration of cellular membrane integrity, decreasing pro-apoptotic signaling molecules, and modulating cellular levels of stress-related proteins. It has also been shown that the production of infective viral particles from previously infected neuroblastoma cells are reduced, which is achieved by the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system.|$|E

25|$|A 2013 review {{found the}} data {{too weak to}} support use of Chinese herbal {{medicine}} (CHM) for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A 2013 review found the research on the benefit and safety of CHM for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is of poor quality and cannot be relied upon to support their use. A 2013 Cochrane review found inconclusive evidence that CHM reduces the severity of eczema. The traditional medicine ginger, which has shown anti-inflammatory properties in laboratory experiments, {{has been used to}} treat rheumatism, headache and digestive and respiratory issues, though there is no firm evidence supporting these uses. A 2012 Cochrane review found no difference in decreased mortality when Chinese herbs were used alongside Western medicine versus Western medicine exclusively. A 2012 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of TCM for people with adhesive small bowel obstruction. A 2011 review found low quality evidence that suggests CHM improves the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome. A 2010 review found TCM seems to be effective for the treatment of fibromyalgia but the findings were of insufficient methodological rigor. A 2009 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of TCM for the treatment of epilepsy. A 2008 Cochrane review found promising evidence for the use of Chinese herbal medicine in relieving painful menstruation, but the trials assessed were of such low methodological quality that no conclusion could be drawn about the remedies' suitability as a recommendable treatment option. Turmeric has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat various conditions. This includes jaundice and hepatic disorders, rheumatism, anorexia, diabetic wounds, and menstrual complications. Most of its effects have been attributed to <b>curcumin.</b> Research that <b>curcumin</b> shows strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have instigated mechanism of action studies on the possibility for cancer and inflammatory diseases prevention and treatment. It also exhibits immunomodulatory effects. A 2005 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for the use of CHM in HIV-infected people and people with AIDS. A 2010 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of Traditional Chinese Herbal Products (THCP) in the treatment of angina. A 2010 Cochrane review found no evidence supporting the use of TCHM for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. There was some weak evidence of pain relief.|$|E

500|$|In ancient Sumeria, {{hundreds}} of medicinal plants including myrrh and opium are listed on clay tablets. The ancient Egyptian Ebers Papyrus lists over 800 plant medicines such as aloe, cannabis, castor bean, garlic, juniper, [...] and mandrake. From ancient {{times to the}} present, Ayurvedic medicine as documented in the Atharva Veda, the Rig Veda and the Sushruta Samhita has used {{hundreds of}} pharmacologically active herbs and spices such as turmeric, which contains <b>curcumin.</b> The Chinese pharmacopoeia, the Shennong Ben Cao Jing records plant medicines such as chaulmoogra for leprosy, ephedra, and hemp. This was expanded in the Tang Dynasty Yaoxing Lun. In the fourth century BC, Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus wrote the first systematic botany text, Historia plantarum. In the first century AD, the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica; it remained the authoritative reference on herbalism for over 1500 years, into the seventeenth century.|$|E
2500|$|In vitro, <b>curcumin</b> {{exhibits}} numerous interference properties {{which may}} lead to misinterpretation of results. Although <b>curcumin</b> has been assessed in numerous laboratory and clinical studies, it has no medical uses established by well-designed clinical research. According to a 2017 review of over 120 studies, <b>curcumin</b> has not been successful in any clinical trial, leading the authors to conclude that [...] "curcumin is an unstable, reactive, non-bioavailable compound and, therefore, a highly improbable lead".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1815 when Vogel and Pierre Joseph Pelletier reported {{the isolation of}} a [...] "yellow coloring-matter" [...] from the rhizomes of turmeric and named it <b>curcumin.</b> Although <b>curcumin</b> has been used historically in Ayurvedic medicine, its potential for medicinal properties remains unproven and is questionable as a therapy when used orally.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Curcumin,</b> {{which shows}} {{positive}} results in most drug discovery assays, {{is regarded as}} a false lead that medicinal chemists include among [...] "pan-assay interference compounds" [...] attracting undue experimental attention while failing to advance as viable therapeutic or drug leads.

2500|$|Chemically, <b>curcumin</b> is a diarylheptanoid, {{belonging}} {{to the group of}} curcuminoids, which are natural phenols responsible for turmeric's yellow color. It is a tautomeric compound existing in enolic form in organic solvents, and as a keto form in water. Although thoroughly studied in laboratory and clinical studies, <b>curcumin</b> has no confirmed medical uses, and has proved frustrating to scientists who state that it is unstable, not bioavailable, and unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development.|$|E

Antioxidants {{can be used to}} extend the shelf life for food and maintain their safety, nutritional quality, [...] and palatability. Pure chemicals of <b>curcumin</b> and its derivatives are not available in the open market. Commercially available <b>curcumin</b> contains 77% <b>curcumin,</b> 17% demethoxycurcumin and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin from the herb Curcuma longa. <b>Curcumin</b> is mainly produced in industry as pigment by using turmeric oleoresin as the starting material which curcuminoids can be isolated from. After the isolation of the curcuminoids, the extract which is about 75% liquor mainly contains oil, resin and more curcuminoids which can be isolated further. This isolation method was used to demonstrate the antioxidant activities of curcuminoids, where they isolated pure curcuminoids from the main liquor. One research reported that <b>curcumin</b> was the strongest antioxidant, demethoxycurcumin the second strongest and bisdemethoxycurcumin the least effective. Curcuminoids nevertheless showed activity against oxidation. Curcuminoids act as a superoxide radical scavenger as well as singlet oxygen quencher and gives the antioxidant its effectiveness. Tetrahydrocurcumin, one of the main metabolites of <b>curcumin,</b> is the most potent antioxidant among the naturally occurring curcuminoids. The curcuminoids are capable of inhibiting damage to super coiled plasmid DNA by hydroxyl radicals.
