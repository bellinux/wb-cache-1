25|$|GEFS+ type 1 is a subtype of GEFS+ {{in which}} there are {{mutations}} in SCN1B, a gene encoding a sodium channel β subunit. The β subunit is required for proper channel inactivation. There are two known mutations in SCN1B that lead to GEFS+ (Figure 1). The first and best characterized of these mutations is C121W. This mutation alters a cysteine involved in a disulfide bond in the extracellular N-terminus of the protein. This extracellular region is similar to the cell adhesion molecule contactin and other cell adhesion molecules. It is believed that the disulfide bond disrupted by the C121W mutation is required for the proper folding of this N-terminus motif. Coexpression of SCN1B with sodium channel α subunits in oocytes and other cells results in channels that inactivate more slowly. Expression of C121W mutant along with wild-type α subunits produces current indistinguishable from that through α subunits alone. Further investigation of this mutation has indicated that it results in decreased frequency dependent rundown and, thus, likely hyperexcitability when compared to cells expressing the wild-type subunit. Interestingly, this mutation also disrupts the subunit's ability to induce cellular aggregation. The importance of this last fact is unclear, though it is presumed that proper <b>channel</b> <b>aggregation</b> within cells and cell-cell contact are required for normal neuronal function.|$|E

40|$|The radio {{frequency}} spectrum {{is not being}} efficiently utilized {{partly due to the}} current policy of allocating the frequency bands to specific services and users. In opportunistic spectrum access (OSA), the “white spaces ” that are not occupied by primary users (a. k. a. incumbent users) can be opportunistically utilized by secondary users. To achieve this, we need to solve two problems: (i) primary-secondary incumbent protection, i. e., prevention of harmful interference from secondary users to primary users; (ii) secondary-secondary network coexistence, i. e., mitigation of mutual interference among secondary users. The first problem has been addressed by spectrum sensing techniques in cognitive radio (CR) networks and geolocation database services in database-driven spectrum sharing. The second problem is the main focus of this dissertation. To obtain a clear picture of coexistence issues, we propose a taxonomy of heterogeneous coexistence mechanisms for shared spectrum access.

40|$|The {{appearance}} in spring of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus in continental shelf {{waters of the}} northeastern Atlantic has been hypothesized to be mainly attributable to invasion from across the continental slope rather than in situ overwintering. This paper describes {{the application of a}} hydrodynamic circulation model and a particle-tracking model to Northeast Atlantic waters in order to assess the influence of the flow field and ascent migration parameters on the spring invasion of C. finmarchicus. For hydrodynamic modelling, the Hamburg Shelf-Ocean Model (HAMSOM) was applied to the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas and forced with daily mean atmospheric data. Simulated flow fields from HAMSOM serve as forcing functions for a particle-tracking model of the same region. The robustness of the simulated shelf invasion in three target boxes of the Northeast Atlantic Shelf was assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis with respect to variations in four key migration parameters: overwintering depth, ascent rate, ascent timing, and depth during residence in upper layers. The invasion of the northern North Sea and Norwegian Shelf waters is more sensitive to ascent migration parameters than invasion of the Faroese Shelf. The main reason for enhanced sensitivity of the North Sea invasion is the time and space-dependent flow structure in the Faroe-Shetland <b>Channel.</b> Dense <b>aggregations</b> of overwintering C. finmarchicus are found in the Channel, but because of the complex flow field only a proportion of the overwintering stock has the capacity to reach the North Sea...|$|R
