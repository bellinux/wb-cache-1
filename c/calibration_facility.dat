40|$|The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) radiometers were {{designed}} to make absolute measurements of the incoming solar, Earth-reflected solar, and Earth-emitted fluxes for investigations of the Earth's climate system. Thermistor bolometers were the sensors used for the ERBE scanning radiometric package. Each thermistor bolometer package consisted of three narrow field of view (FOV) broadband radiometric channels measuring shortwave (0. 2 to 5. 0 jim), longwave (5. 0 to 50 jim), and total (0. 2 to 50 pin) radiation. The in-flight <b>calibration</b> <b>facilities</b> include Mirror Attenuator Mosaics (MAM), shortwave internal calibration source (SWICS), and internal blackbody sources to monitor the long-term responsivity of the radiometers. The MAM and SWICS <b>calibration</b> <b>facilities</b> were {{used to evaluate the}} long-term stability of the shortwave channels. The MAM is a solar diffuser which reflected approximately 20 percent of the solar radiation into the scanning bolometer's FOV. Using a tungsten lamp, the SWICS generated a repeatable shortwave signal which was directed into the scanning bolometer's FOV. This paper describes the in-flight <b>calibration</b> <b>facilities,</b> the <b>calibration</b> data reduction techniques, and the results from the in-flight shortwave channel calibrations. The results indicate that the ERBE shortwave detectors were stable to within 1 percent for up to five years of flight operation. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The Subscale Beryllium Model Demonstrator (SBMD) was {{fabricated}} {{and tested}} by 2001 and demonstrated enabling technologies {{for what was}} soon Christened the James Webb Space Telescope, previously the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). The SBMD was a half-meter diameter mirror made from powered beryllium. The weight of the mirror was then reduced through a mirror-making process called [...] "light-weighting", where material is removed without disrupting its reflecting ability, {{and in this case}} 90% of the SBMD mass was removed. Its was then mounted to a rigidly with titanium and underwent various tests. This included freezing it down to the low temperatures required and seeing how it behaved optically and physically. The tests were conducted with the Optical Testing System (aka the OTS) which was created specifically to test the SBMD. The SBMD had to meet the requirements for a space-based mirror, and these lessons were important {{to the development of the}} JWST.

40|$|When {{investigating}} the interference effects of engine, wing and fuselage of an aircraft, wind tunnel tests with engine simulation are {{a powerful tool}} to gain valuable information. However, the value of such tests depends on accurate knowledge of the engine's thrust. Thus, calibration of the engine simulator in a special <b>calibration</b> <b>facility</b> must precede wind tunnel tests. Considering the fundamental differences between the test set-up of the <b>calibration</b> <b>facility</b> and the wind tunnel application, the question arises {{as to whether the}} calibration provides any transferable results. This report addresses this question. In the experimental investigations, performed in this context, an engine simulator was operated both in the <b>calibration</b> <b>facility</b> and in the wind tunnel. Special attention was directed towards characterizing the thrust and performance of the simulator and to the behaviour of the exhaust jet. Final comparison of the thrust measurements from the <b>calibration</b> <b>facility</b> and the Wind tunnel showed agreement within the measurement accuracy. This is illustrated by the nearly identical performance of the simulator in both facilities. It was thus concluded, that the calibration procedure yields meaningful and transferable results. (orig.)

40|$|Keywords: system <b>calibration</b> <b>facility,</b> digital levels, rod calibration, spirit leveling] Digital levels {{replaced}} spirit {{levels in}} most fields of precise height measurements {{because of the}} automation of the height readings. Three manufacturers offer digital levels with a single reading resolution of 10 µm, {{and for all of}} them systematic effects are known. In Europe several facilities for system calibration of digital levels using vertical comparators were established within the last decade.

Growth of research facilities, projects in progress, and more stringent Department of Energy (DOE) orders which involve exposure to nuclear radiation have placed substantial burdens on the existing radiation <b>calibration</b> <b>facility.</b> The facility currently {{does not meet the}} requirements of DOE Order 5480. 4 or American National Standards Institute (ANSI) N 323 - 1978, which establish calibration methods for portable radiation protection instruments used in the detection and measurement of levels of ionizing radiation fields or levels of radioactive surface contaminations. Failure to comply with this standard could mean instrumentation is not being calibrated to necessary levels of sensitivity. The Laboratory has also recently obtained a new neutron source and gamma beam irradiator which can not be made operational at existing facilities because of geometry and shielding inadequacies.
