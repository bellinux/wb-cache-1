The resulting findings of the investigation resolve the contradiction between the two opposing theories, millennium and special relativity, on velocity composition.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{first order}} gradient methods for effectively optimizing a composite objective {{in the form}} of a sum of smooth and, potentially, non-smooth functions. We present accelerated and adaptive gradient methods, called FLAG and FLARE, which can offer the best of both worlds. They can achieve the optimal convergence rate by attaining the optimal first-order oracle complexity for smooth convex optimization. Additionally, they can adaptively and non-uniformly re-scale the gradient direction to adapt to the limited curvature available and conform to the geometry of the domain. We show theoretically and empirically that, through the <b>compounding</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> and adaptivity, FLAG and FLARE can be highly effective for many data fitting and machine learning applications...|$|R
60|$|Assuming now, {{what must}} be {{admitted}} to be doubtful, that {{the whole of the}} past has proceeded according to invariable laws, what can we say as to the nature of these laws? They will not be of the simple type which asserts that the same cause always produces the same effect. We may take the law of gravitation as a sample of the kind of law that appears to be verified without exception. In order to state this law in a form which observation can confirm, we will confine it to the solar system. It then states that the motions of planets and their satellites have at every instant an <b>acceleration</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>of</b> <b>accelerations</b> towards all the other bodies in the solar system, proportional to the masses of those bodies and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances. In virtue of this law, given the state of the solar system throughout any finite time, however short, its state at all earlier and later times is determinate except in so far as other forces than gravitation or other bodies than those in the solar system have to be taken into consideration. But other forces, so far as science can discover, appear to be equally regular, and equally capable of being summed up in single causal laws. If the mechanical account of matter were complete, the whole physical history of the universe, past and future, could be inferred from a sufficient number of data concerning an assigned finite time, however short.|$|R

Non-thermal processing technologies, such as pulsed electric fields (PEF) have been improved to achieve inhibition of deleterious effects on quality-related compounds. The working principle of PEF is based on the application of pulses of high voltage (typically above 20 [*]kV/cm up to 70 [*]kV/cm) to liquid foods placed between two electrodes. Pulsed electric fields technique has also been studied in winemaking process. Certain positive influences of PEF on vinification have been reported as elimination of pathogenic microorganisms, reduction of maceration time, increase in phenolic <b>compounds</b> extraction, <b>acceleration</b> <b>of</b> wine aging and inactivation of oxidative enzymes.

40|$|Abstract—The {{velocity}} of a moving {{point in a}} general path is the vector quantity, which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude or {{the direction of the}} velocity vector can change over time as a result <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> that the time rate <b>of</b> velocity changes. <b>Acceleration</b> analysis is important because inertial forces and inertial torques are proportional to rectilinear and angular accelerations accordingly. The loads must be determined in advance to ensure that a machine is adequately designed to handle these dynamic loads. For planar motion, the vector direction <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> is commonly separated into two elements: tangential and centripetal or radial components of a point on a rotating body. All textbooks in physics, kinematics and dynamics of machinery consider the magnitude <b>of</b> a radial <b>acceleration</b> at condition when a point rotates with a constant angular velocity and it means without <b>acceleration.</b> The magnitude <b>of</b> the tangential <b>acceleration</b> considered on a basis <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> for a rotating point. Such condition of presentation of magnitudes for two components <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> logically and mathematically is not correct and may cause further confusion in calculation. This paper presents new analytical expressions of the radial and absolute <b>accelerations</b> <b>of</b> a rotating point with acceleration and covers the gap in theoretical study <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> analysis.

To serve {{the gifted and}} talented student, it needs the whole learning management service. In particular, this research aims to describe the English learning management for acceleration program at SMA Negeri 1 Purworejo. It consists of characteristic of English learning planning, characteristic of English learning processing and characteristic of English learning evaluating. Besides that, this research also aims to describe the superiority of English learning management for acceleration program. This research uses a qualitative approach. The data source informants of this research are English teacher of regular program, English teacher <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> program, chairman <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> program, vice principle of curriculum, and principle at SMA Negeri 1 Purworejo. The data collection techniques of this research are document study, observation and interview. The data analysis technique that is taken in this research, namely the data comparison of regular program and acceleration program, the combination of comparison result data with interview result, and the data interpretation. This research has shown that English learning planning for acceleration program at SMA Negeri 1 Purworejo has characteristic <b>of</b> time allotment <b>acceleration</b> and enrichment <b>of</b> wide and deep indicator. The time allotment acceleration that is in syllabus and lesson plan <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> program seems clearly if two kinds of learning planning are compared with learning planning or regular program. The regular program planning of one semester has time allocation in six months, meanwhile <b>acceleration</b> program planning <b>of</b> one semester has time four months. The enrichment of learning planning for acceleration program appears in wide and deep indicator. The indicator of learning planning for acceleration program is diversified until language application level.
