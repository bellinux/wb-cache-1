5000|$|The British press showed {{considerable}} {{interest in}} the lace used in the wedding dress, but their published reports are at variance with available documentation, and suggest that they were briefed with common incorrect or misleading information. The facts about the lace are as follows. The effect achieved by {{the design of the}} bodice {{is similar to that of}} the decorated nets that were popular in the late 19th century, typified by the Limerick and Carrickmacross laces of Ireland. For the latter, machine-made net is used as a basis on which floral and other designs are created by various hand-needlework techniques. The press release from the Royal School of Needlework [...] states that the technique used in Kate’s wedding dress “was influenced by” traditional Carrickmacross lace technique. However, the technique itself was a completely different and modern device: floral motifs were cut out of lengths of lace produced on large 19th-century machines and stitched to machine net. Three companies are known to have produced lace for the dress: Sophie Hallette [...] and Solstiss [...] in France, and the <b>Cluny</b> <b>Lace</b> Company in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The majority of the dress is made using the Solstiss lace, specifically the skirt and train. The styles of machine lace go by the names [...] "English Cluny" [...] and [...] "Chantilly", but should not be confused with the older hand-made bobbin laces of the same names. The lace was not specially commissioned for the dress, but chosen from stock patterns (what was formerly known only as Sophie Hallette’s [...] "950264" [...] is now known as [...] "Kate’s lace", however, this lace was only used for the bodice of the dress, the skirt and train are made of the Solstiss lace. Grace Kelly's wedding dress was also made from lace by Solstiss, a French company. All the companies involved are known to produce the highest quality of couture lace. [...] ) and hence the floral motifs available were those present in the patterns. Although roses and perhaps shamrocks may be discerned on the bodice, the much quoted daffodils and thistles needed to complete a British quartet seem to be embroidery of the truth rather than of the dress.|$|E
40|$|This article {{inspects}} {{a set of}} paradoxes {{that appeared}} in an investigation of contemporary industrial craft in the last remaining factory making machine lace in the United Kingdom. Its focus on a single site, set against a now global industry, means it can build on work in cultural and economic geography to understand this setting as a heterogeneous space, with links {{to a range of}} material and immaterial lineages, practices and networks. Ethnographic fieldwork on the factory floor at <b>Cluny</b> <b>Lace</b> threw up three paradoxes inherent in the firm’s continued survival in a context of industrial decline. The first of these paradoxes is the reconcentration of material and immaterial resources in the factory both despite {{and as a result of}} the global restructuring of the textile industry. The second is the embodiment of knowledge, and therefore craft skill, both within persons and distributed through the worker’s material environments. Third, is the recognition that the skilled practice the workers carry is not uniform but is multiple, resulting from an unequal distribution of opportunities within the lace industry and different versions of practice that result from the re-concentration of human capital in the factory. This article demonstrates that skill is not uncontested, but is power-ridden and value-laden, and transcends scale. It shows that knowledge and skill are not bound within an individual but are distributed among social actors, material objects and locales, where an attention to each is necessary for understanding the spaces of skilled practices and the ongoing survival of contemporary industrial craft production...|$|E
