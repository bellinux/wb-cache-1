They had been chopped <b>with</b> a hatchet, <b>sliced</b> <b>with</b> a <b>knife,</b> and stabbed with an ice-pick. Josh Ryen, the 8-year-old son of Douglas and Peggy, had survived. His throat had been cut. Mrs. Ryen's purse was in plain sight on the kitchen counter, but no money had been taken. The family station wagon was gone; it was discovered several days later in Long Beach, California, about 50 miles southwest of Chino Hills.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{current study}} aimed to {{determine}} the functional propriety of fresh beets under different cooking methods through the quantification of bioactives compounds. Beets were chosen for uniformity of size, color and absence of defects. They were thoroughly washed in running water to remove dirt, manually peeled <b>with</b> a <b>knife,</b> <b>sliced</b> through a stainless-steel food processor (5 mm slicing disc) and submitted to four different cooking methods: steaming, pressure, oven-baked and hot-water immersion. Analysis were performed in both uncooked and cooked beets to evaluate antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, carotenoids, flavonoids and betalains. The experiment was completely randomized design (CRD). Data were subjected to analysis of variance (F test) and means were compared by Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Oven-baked beets preserve most of the bioactive coumpouds, maintaining better levels of carotenoids, flavonoids, betacyanin and betaxanthin than the other cooking methods. The antioxidant activity was similar between the treatments, except in the pressure. Moreover, different cooking methods did not affect phenolic compounds concentration in beets...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to solve the problem}} {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>slicing</b> of tomato which is an important operation required in tomato drying industries, a motorized tomato slicer was designed fabricated and tested. In tomato processing industry, slicing of tomato is usually done to increase the surface area of the product for effective drying. The machine was designed to slice tomatoes into recommended size of 20 mmthick for fast drying. The slicer consists mainly of a feeding unit, cutting compartment, collection unit, power section and tool frame. Tomato fruits fed through the feeding unit go down to the cutting compartment by gravitational force and the reciprocating motion of <b>slicing</b> <b>knives</b> cut the fruits by shearing action. In the design of the tomato slicer, physical properties of UC- 82 B tomato variety were considered. Results of performance evaluation showed that the machine has anoutputcapacity of 468 kg/h, percentage loss of 28. 40 %, and slicing efficiency of 60. 34 %...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>slicing</b> <b>knife</b> {{serves a}} similar {{function}} to a carving knife, {{although it is}} generally longer and narrower. Slicers may have plain or serrated edges. Such knives often incorporate blunted or rounded tips, and feature kullenschliff (Swedish/German: [...] "hill-sharpened") or Granton edge (scalloped blades) to improve meat separation. Slicers are designed to precisely cut smaller and thinner slices of meat, and are normally more flexible to accomplish this task. As such, many cooks find them better suited to slicing ham, roasts, fish, or barbecued beef and pork and venison.|$|R

The wind dropped with the sun, leaving a maddened sea and a devastated sky. The heavens above the house seemed to be draped in black rags, held up here and there by pins of fire. Madame Levaille, for this evening the servant of her own workmen, tried to induce them to depart. [...] "An old woman like me ought to be in bed at this late hour," [...] she good-humouredly repeated. The quarrymen drank, asked for more. They shouted over the table {{as if they had been}} talking across a field. At one end four of them played cards, banging the wood with their hard knuckles, and swearing at every lead. One sat with a lost gaze, humming a bar of some song, which he repeated endlessly. Two others, in a corner, were quarrelling confidentially and fiercely over some woman, looking close into one another's eyes as if they had wanted to tear them out, but speaking in whispers that promised violence and murder discreetly, in a venomous sibillation of subdued words. The atmosphere in there was thick enough to <b>slice</b> <b>with</b> a <b>knife.</b> Three candles burning about the long room glowed red and dull like sparks expiring in ashes.|$|R
