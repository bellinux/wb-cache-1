40|$|Abstract:In the {{industries}} where bulk material {{is to be}} transferred from one place in the process plant to the other, material handling systems are required. Various types of conveyors {{are available in the}} market having their own characteristic features. But in {{the industries}} where very high mass flow rates are required, pneumatic <b>conveying</b> <b>system</b> can be very useful. Various other conveyors are also present but some occupy a lot of space in the plant whereas some cannot give such high mass flow rates. Pneumatic <b>conveying</b> <b>system</b> is not a very new concept.

40|$|Material {{handling}} equipment (MHE) {{is important for}} every industry because it {{has an effect on}} the productivity of manufacturing. Conveyor systems are presently one popular type of MHE. This paper presents an integration of the analytic network process (ANP) with the benefits, opportunities, costs and risk (BOCR) model in order to select the best conveyor system. The proposed model established a network with four merits, six strategies criteria, and twenty six sub-criteria with four alternatives (present, roller conveyor, chain conveyor, and monorail). The ANP is to determine the relative weights of an evaluative criteria and decision alternatives. Therefore, the final ranking of the alternatives are calculated by synthesizing the score of each alternative under BOCR. The results showed that the best alternative under all five methods is the chain conveyor. These research results can be easily applied, adapted and used to improve performance of selecting the <b>conveyer</b> <b>system</b> in small and medium enterprises through large industries...|$|E
40|$|Alpha {{detectors}} {{based on}} the long-range alpha detection (LRAD) technology have numerous uses, both potential and demonstrated, in facility D&D. These monitors operate by detecting the ions created by alpha particles interacting with ambient air. Thus, detection is not limited by the short range of the alpha particle and no window is required between the contamination and the detection region. These properties make LRAD-based detectors ideal for operation in field environments where complex objects to be monitored are the norm and reliability is crucial. Three monitors of particular interest in D&D operations are the building surface monitor, the internal volume monitor for use on the inner surfaces of pipes, ducts, and tanks, and the conveyer belt monitor for concrete rubble and structural steel. Surface monitors have been used extensively, both in laboratory and field environments, internal volume monitors have been tested in the laboratory, and the <b>conveyer</b> <b>system</b> is still a conceptual design. These monitors and related applications demonstrate the utility of LRAD-based monitors for D&D operations as well as exploring {{some of the new}} ways that fieldable monitoring systems can be used for D&D.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a simple method for {{estimating}} the driving resistance of rubber conveyer belts. The driving resistance of a rubber belt running on the carrier roller was estimated by a resistance force acting on a roller moving on the rubber conveyer belt while the belt was fixed on an aluminum channel. Four types of conveyor belts were tested to confirm the present technique is useful for grading rubber conveyer belts from a viewpoint of energy dissipation on the carrier rollers of the <b>conveyer</b> <b>system.</b> The effects of normal force acting on the roller and driving speed of the roller on the resistance force were investigated. Four belts were fabricated with different rubber types of rubber, respectively. It was confirmed from the experiments that the estimated resistance force varied with respect to the rubber characteristics, which was consistent to the experience from the existing belt conveyer systems for energy consumption. The resistance force of the carrier roller increases with an increase of roller speed. It also decreases when a lower damping rubber is used while the belt rigidity does not affect the resistance force when low resistance rubber is used. The proposed method is applicable to estimate the total energy loss of rubber conveyer belts on the carrier rollers...|$|E

40|$|A new {{experimental}} apparatus, {{known as}} the NIST Reduced Scale Continuous Feed Firebrand Generator (the NIST continuous feed Baby Dragon) is presented. This version of the Firebrand Generator {{is based upon the}} NIST Dragon, the only experimental device capable of generating controlled firebrand showers. The unique features of the continuous feed Baby Dragon, as opposed to the present NIST Dragon, is the capability to produce a constant firebrand shower in order to expose building materials to continual firebrand bombardment. An experimental series was conducted to determine the range of operating conditions for this device. Wood pieces were fed into the device using a <b>conveyer</b> <b>system,</b> ignited using a propane burner, and a blower was used to loft the generated firebrands. The number flux and mass flux were measured as a function of feeding rate to determine optimum conditions to generate steady firebrand showers. It was observed that a feeding rate of 15 pieces (34. 6 g/min) provided the most constant and uniform continuous firebrand production. Measurements of heat release rate (HRR) were conducted to make sure the device provided low HRR in order to determine if it may be considered for use by testing laboratories in a safe manner. Finally, the firebrand size and mass produced using the newly developed device presented in this paper are commensurate to those measured from full-scale tree burns and actual WUI fires...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. This paper {{is concerned with the}} development of a new energy-saving vacuum pad using CFD-technique. Nowadays, application of pneumatic vacuum pads may be found in many different real industries, especially in the field of automatic <b>conveyer</b> <b>system,</b> automatic assembly line, semiconductor industry as well as silicon wafer factory, etc. Traditional vacuum pads generally utilize nozzles to create the effect of vacuum. In this paper, however, a new idea to generate the effect of vacuum is proposed by designing a structure similar to that of an aerostatic bearing. In details, the air is guided to flow through an optimally designed restrictor inside the vacuum pad and flow out through the outlet between the vacuum pad and the sucked work-piece. Therefore, according to Bernoulliâ€™s equation, the air pressure near the center line of the vacuum pad decreases because of the increased airflow velocity. Consequently, the effect of vacuum is generated. To achieve two preset requirements, that is, large suction force output and low air consumption, the commercial CFD-RC software is utilized to simulate the air flow field and design the optimal geometry inside the vacuum pad. Experimental results further prove that the new vacuum pad with two preset features is successfully developed and implemented in this study. cs 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:With the {{improvement}} of the load and speed of belt conveyor, the dynamic characteristic problem of belt conveyer appears especially outstanding. This paper analyzed the force situation of the conveyer by the discrete dynamics model, divided n viscoelastic properties mass units in advance, then built system analysis dynamics model by vibration mechanics, built modal neutral file of the flexible belt block by means of finite element analysis software, and built the virtual prototype model of the belt conveyor using ADMAS program. It analyzed the effect of stiffness and damping of belt on the starting process by dynamic characteristics simulation method. The simulation results showed that the speed wave period of belt with the smaller stiffness was longer and the peak was bigger, the belt speed easily occurred stronger surge, the transverse vibration of belt conveyor became more violent. With the increasing of stiffness, the belt speed wave peak value decreased. As the same time, the speed surge also decreased when other operation parameters of the belt <b>conveyer</b> <b>system</b> are fixed, with increasing of the damping, the dynamic tension force peak became smaller gradually, it led to decrease of vibration curve peak. Damping coefficient played the important role in decreasing the vibration intensity, the research result offers a new basis for the analysis and study of the dynamic characteristics of belt conveyor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Industrial rollers made in polyurethane, PUR, {{are made}} {{to be used in}} a <b>conveyer</b> <b>system</b> in slaughterhouses. The rollers are made by the company Dansk Gummiindustri A/S. During use the rollers or the {{materials}} give some problems with the durability. Break in the rollers come much earlier than expected. An intensively investigation of the rollers has therefore been made. The investigations have been on the mechanical and chemical properties of the rollers. During their lifetime the rollers are cleaned at least once per day with cleaning agents of different types. The mechanical forces on the rollers have been analysed. It has been assumed that the weight of the meat pieces have been 7 kg each. The force on the roller under use has been calculated by using Finite Element method, FEM. The strength of the roller has been determined to be 26 MPa, and the maximum load on the roller under use has been calculated to be 1, 8 MPa, which is far from the 26 MPa. The fatigue strength is not known, but from knowledge of PUR there should not be any risk of fatigue. The rollers can have different colours though they are made of the same type of material all of them. The colour differences of the rollers appear because the cooling time is different for the rollers. Samples for testing if the curing and cooling parameters have any influence of the strength and the chemical resistance for the cleaning agents used in the slaughterhouses are made. Th...|$|E

CFD based simulations still pose significant challenges {{to ensure that the}} physical nature of gas-solid flow can be effectively presented by numerical simulation for bypass pneumatic <b>conveying</b> <b>systems.</b> In this thesis, an experimental program was planned which defined the particle properties and conveying experiments were conducted within a bypass pneumatic conveying pipeline. Based on the parameters utilised in the experiment, the CFD based numerical investigation of pressure drop was initially conducted by applying kinetic theory and conventional frictional-kinetic model. By comparing simulation results with experimental results and analysing images captured by high speed camera for selected cases, resistance models which better represented sustained particle contact for dense flows were investigated. Based on the review of previous research, this thesis proposed a modified frictional-kinetic model which better reflected the physical nature of gas-solid flow behaviour in bypass pneumatic <b>conveying</b> <b>system</b> for alumina and sand. Unfortunately, no improvement was found for the flyash flow prediction. The sensitivity analysis of empirical constants in the modified frictional-kinetic model was conducted and the most appropriate values were determined.

Combined with mode of flow charts, some guidance was provided which related the frictional resistance model type to the particle flow type in a bypass system...|$|R
