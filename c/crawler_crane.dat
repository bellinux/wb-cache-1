40|$|Cranes {{are often}} the most {{conspicuous}} machines on a construction site. This is due to their large size, {{in addition to the}} important role they have in transporting heavy payloads vertically and horizontally. There are two major families of construction cranes: tower cranes and mobile cranes. Mobile cranes that are mounted on tracks are a subgroup referred to as ``crawler cranes''. <b>Crawler</b> <b>cranes</b> are widely used on construction sites, and are a backbone of the United States construction industry, thus a detailed study of these cranes' behavior is essential.

50|$|These {{telescopic}} cranes are single-engine machines, {{with the}} same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane, similar to a <b>crawler</b> <b>crane.</b> In a rough terrain crane, the engine is usually mounted in the undercarriage {{rather than in the}} upper, as with <b>crawler</b> <b>crane.</b> Most have 4 wheel drive and 4 wheel steering which allows them to traverse tighter and slicker terrain than a standard truck crane with less site prep. In addition, there are rough terrain cranes with the operating cab mounted on the lower as opposed to the P&H in the above image.|$|E

50|$|Crawler cranes {{have both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages depending on their use. Their main advantage {{is that they can}} move around on site and perform each lift with little set-up, since the crane is stable on its tracks with no outriggers. Caterpillar tracks are also far better at traversing soft ground without sinking in, as they spread the weight out over a great area. Thus a <b>crawler</b> <b>crane</b> can move about an unprepared job site with less risk of getting stuck in soft ground. In addition, a <b>crawler</b> <b>crane</b> is capable of traveling with a load. The main disadvantage is that they are very heavy, and cannot easily be moved from one job site to another without significant expense. Typically a large crawler must be disassembled and moved by trucks, rail cars or ships to its next location.|$|E
