40|$|SUMMARY In {{this paper}} the {{complications}} of current <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> is outlined in case of cross-boundary infrastructure objects. Traditionally, <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> concentrates on parcels defined by their surface boundaries. Consequently {{the legal status of}} the subsurface and rights regarding constructions in the subsurface is established and registered by means of the surface configuration. Especially in the case of infrastructures that cross parcel boundaries this leads to problems in understanding the legal situation when querying the cadastral database. In this paper first the principles of land ownership and of <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> are explained. Although we focus on the Dutch situation, we address general issues as well. In the second part we describe the way the legal status of cross-boundary infrastructure is currently secured in the <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration,</b> which meets complications. In the third part we propose and evaluate a solution to improve current <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> in case of cross-boundary infrastructure without changing the basic entity of <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> which is the 2 D parcel. We end with conclusions in which we argue that <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> can considerably benefit when the land oriented approach as only approach for <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> would be abandoned...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> {{of rights}} and limited rights is {{traditionally}} based on parcels that are represented in two dimensions.

This research describes the development of a prototype registration system that accommodates spatial information in the vertical dimension. The three-dimensional cadastre conceptual development meets the needs of clearly defining ownership while taking advantage of new technical opportunities. The concept is illustrated through a prototype implementation and is an extension of the current <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> system based on two-dimensional parcels.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the first 3 D <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> of {{multi-level}} ownerships rights in the Netherlands, which was accomplished in March 2016. It {{is the result of}} a study that was undertaken from 2013 to 2015 to determine how insight about multi-level ownership can be provided in 3 D by the <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration.</b> The solution was sought within the existing cadastral and legal framework, with the aim to build a more fundamental solution for 3 D <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> in the future, based on practical experience and involving the stakeholders. The 3 D cadastral case presented in this paper is the new combined structure of the city hall and underground railway station in the town of Delft. The complex contains the new city hall, the railway station, the underground platforms and railway tunnel, several technical installations as well as the underground bicycle-parking. The paper presents the procedure that was followed to secure the ownership rights before the construction was completed; the translation of ownership described in the deeds into legal volumes based on the architectural drawing of the buildings; and, finally to create the 3 D visualisation of the 3 D rights involved and to register a deed that contains the 3 D visualisation in the interactive 3 D PDF format. The paper then evaluates the registration to obtain insights for an improved 3 D <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration.</b> The main conclusion is that in some situations a 3 D approach has important advantages for <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> over a 2 D approach. It requires further study on how to implement the solution in a standardised and uniform way from registration to querying and updating in the future and from an informal to a formal (i. e. legally binding) registration process. 3 D Geo-InformationGeo-information and Land Developmen...|$|E
40|$|The individualisation of {{property}} started initially with {{a division of}} land using 2 D boundaries. This is why the central paradigm in <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> is traditionally a 2 D parcel. This paradigm needs to be adjusted since there is an increasing interest in using space {{above and below the}} surface. Today’s <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> should therefore be able to reflect the true principle {{of property}} rights: property rights always have entitled persons to volumes and not to just an area, otherwise the use of the land would have been impossible. In our 3 D cadastre research we described several conceptual models to improve <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration.</b> The most challenging conceptual model, the full 3 D cadastre, is described in this paper. To prove the potentials of this model we studied several countries and states in which it is already possible to establish 3 D property units with separate ownership from the legal point of view (Norway, Sweden, Queensland and British Colombia). As will be seen in this paper, the basic drawback of those solutions is that a complete 3 D <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> for these 3 D property units is not available. We applied our full 3 D cadastre model in a prototype to a case study in Queensland.

Future research will focus on defining the 3 D right-objects more precisely in 2 D and 3 D (geometrically as well as topologically) and on the registration of 3 D physical objects (objects as they occur in the real world).

40|$|In the Dutch <b>{{cadastral}}</b> <b>registration</b> a cadastral object (real-estate object) is {{by definition}} 2 D (a parcel). In intensively used areas {{there is a tendency}} to use space above and under the surface, e. g. constructions on top of each other, infrastructure above/under the ground, increasing number of cables and pipes, apartments above shops/offices/other apartments. These factual 3 D objects cannot be defined as cadastral objects in the cadastral map, which is based on 2 D parcels, and cannot be used as a base for registration. From a juridical point of view the current registration has proved to be still sufficient in those situations. However, the Netherlands ’ Kadaster wants to assure a sustainable, uniform and efficient registration in the future.

In the present paper, information on the results of the cadastral valuation of land parcels in the Sverdlovsk region is presented. Based on an analysis of the data, it is possible to distinguish the following problems in this area: the imperfection of the methods of valuation and regulatory framework, the lack of accurate land boundaries: secrecy and opacity in the system of assigning information. The main stages of professional <b>cadastral</b> <b>registration</b> in the Russian Federation are reviewed. The approaches taken to determine the cadastral value of land according to Russian practices are discussed. It is shown that the cadastral value established can vary by several times according to the different valuation techniques employed. The possibility of challenging the results of an erroneous determination of cadastral value is demonstrated based on an analysis of legal precedents established in the Urals region. A conclusion is reached about the need to improve the methodological and legislative frameworks of cadastral valuation of land parcels as real estate.

Where states succeeded in introducing more comprehensive reforms they developed higher capacity to extract more tax, more equitably, and developing direct fiscal contracts with social groups below elites, fostering norms of trust.

Independence has allowed self-determination of the future political direction yet the range, legal framework, institutional structure and administration systems tend to mirror those of ex-colonial powers. Do land policies, administration systems and processes developed to serve large heavily populated countries scale down to serve the requirements of micro-states? The evidence suggests not: many land administration systems in the Caribbean face difficulties due to poor records, unclear title, exploitation of state lands, incomplete or ongoing land reform programmes, irregular or illegal settlement and non-enforced planning regulations.

In the prototype, parcel boundaries need to be located in 3 D space as {{they have to be}} combined with 3 D objects such as tunnels and pipelines. To extend the spatial model of parcel boundaries into 3 D, simply assigning one z-coordinate to each parcel is not sufficient. Providing a z-coordinate to the vertices describing parcel boundaries does also not meet the requirements for a 3 D cadastre. In this paper we elaborate on how parcel boundaries can be integrated with point heights to meet the requirements for a 3 D cadastre, i. e. obtaining a height surface for parcels. A height surface of parcels is the digital terrain model (DTM) on the locations of parcels. Therefore a parcel surface changes when the terrain surface changes. We will describe and evaluate several possibilities to obtain a height surface for parcels based on a DBMS approach. TS 23 3 D Cadastre...|$|E
40|$|Following recent {{worldwide}} {{developments and}} initiatives by FIG (Cadastre 2014) and UN, an object oriented, conceptual {{model for the}} Cadastral Domain, adapted to Portuguese Cadastre and related Real Estate Register is presented, based on a previously proposed standard. After {{a brief description of}} present <b>Cadastral</b> and Land <b>Registration</b> situation in Portugal, UML (Unified Modeling Language) literate modeling was used to describe the top level classes by using a structured mix of UML Class Diagrams and natural text 1. Important contributions of this paper are the evaluation of the FIG core cadastral model by applying it to Portugal. It turns out that a limited number of the classes of the core model are currently not needed (but some of them might be used in the future) and that other classes were added specifically for the situation in Portugal. This is anticipated use of the core model and in case similar patterns occur in several countries, the new version of the core model should be adapted accordingly within the FIG. In addition to these static model aspects, Activity Diagrams were used to model dynamic behavior concerning a number of chosen Cadastral Update tasks. Currently, the dynamic aspects are not yet present in the FIG core cadastral model, but in case similar dynamic patterns occur in several countries, then they should be added to the core model.

40|$|Greece is {{a country}} that claims a {{significant}} cultural heritage that affected the evolution of many cultures and has set the cornerstone {{for the development of the}} western societies. As a crossroad of ideas due to its geographical position, Greece has always been a place of creation. This has given marvelous examples of history, architecture, art, philosophy and so on. The Greek State, since its establishment, has a strict legal framework which reflects the importance of the conservation of ancient treasures. Over the years, various public services have been responsible for the protection of different types of culture; movable, immovable and tangible heritage are the three classifications described in the legal framework for the protection of cultural assets. Regarding the management tools, there is a plethora of registries implemented for the administration of national cultural assets, such as the National Monuments Archive and the Constant Catalogue for Declared Archaeological Sites and Monuments. Today, the Hellenic Archaeological Cadastre is an ongoing project for the registration of the ownership status of the immovable archaeological assets with a cadastral approach. The project aims to the development of a modern registry for properties with archaeological an architectural features. Land Administration is an international good practice followed by public institutions and other organizations for the identification and management of people-to-land-relationships. Land Administration is expressed in the various systems developed around the world for terrestrial and marine territories. In this context, infrastructure for the administration of issues related to the land with spatial reference has been implemented. Spatial Data Infrastructure for specific spatial components provide institutions with valuable management tools, such as Land and Marine Administration Systems, cadastral systems, coastal management registries and environmental assessment tools. Standardization in Land Administration has also raised as a necessity to the implementation of spatial management systems. Standards are widely used today for the formation of conceptual models and software architecture as they provide possibilities for common development, expression of shared terminology to the systems and compatibility with global structures. Last but not least, standards have enabled the interoperability between different systems, leading to feasible forms of databases and communication between various organizations. The main purpose of this Master Thesis is the adjustment of the LADM in the basic conceptual schema of the Hellenic Archaeological Cadastre, for the development of a three-dimensional system with extension to marine regions. A second goal is set to the research; the identification of the legal, jurisdictional and technical requirements that are necessary for the three-dimensional spatial representation of archaeological cadastral data in properties with archaeological interest as well as in marine archaeological sites in Greece. For the above aims, the research comprises two phases. The first phase includes the analysis of a theoretical background in Land Administration. This combines an attempt to provide the State of the Art in Land Administration Systems, Spatial Data Infrastructures marine and coastal administration systems as well as the investigation of the standardization process, together with an explicit description of the concepts and attributes of the Land Administration Domain Model. The field of 3 D Cadastres and the barriers and legal constraints for the definition of 3 D property objects are also investigated. At last, a review of the State of the Art in the management of the cultural heritage and a description of efforts for the implementation of cultural property protection systems on a national and international scale are also included. The second phase aims to the conceptualization of a three-dimensional Hellenic Archaeological Cadastre based on the LADM. A conceptual model that adopts the codification proposed by the core model of the LADM in the complex task of classification of data for the archaeological space of Greece is described in detail. Classes and their attributes, together with codelists for the various types are explicitly presented. Explanations and external classes necessary to the system due to the multiplicity of the Greek archaeological environment are also added to the proposed model. At last, an extensive report to the various legal, organizational and technical reforms that need to be realized on a national scale in order to determine the premises for the assignment of 3 D property objects on an Archaeological Cadastre are provided. Several stimulating conclusions for the three-dimensional and marine archaeological <b>cadastral</b> <b>registrations</b> and for the interoperability of systems arise from the description of the developed model, which are extensively presented in the final part of this second phase.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to map the {{prevalence}} of aeolian sand dunes in Västerbotten, northern Sweden to find dunes formed during earlier deglaciation phases, which was then preserved in cold-based conditions during the youngest stadial of the Weichselian glaciation. These preserved dunes were expected to be covered by a layer of till and have a rather faint morphology compared to dunes formed during the Holocene. Consequently, high resolution LIDAR-derived images from the Swedish mapping, <b>cadastral</b> and land <b>registration</b> authority (Lantmäteriet) was used to detect the dunes throughout an area covering most of Västerbotten, above the highest coastline and below the mountain range. The analysis resulted in several new findings of aeolian dunes compared to the findings in the quaternary soil map created by the Geological Survey of Sweden. Despite the fact some of the dunes at the LIDAR-derived image had a strange faint appearance, it was quickly evident during the fieldwork that the aeolian sand was not covered by till on any of the dunes visited. The common view during the last decades has been that cold-based ice will not erode or alter the morphology of the landscape beneath the ice. However, this study suggests that hypothesis may not be entirely correct, and therefore it can be hard to use geomorphological implications to reconstruct past glacial environments. Thus, it can be concluded that even under cold-based conditions, preservation of aeolian sand dunes in Västerbotten is probably not very common...|$|R
