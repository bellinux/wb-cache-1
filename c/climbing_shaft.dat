2500|$|A {{maximum of}} six [...] bombs could be carried {{as well as}} up to five machine-guns. Similar to the Coastal and C-Star class airships, one gun was mounted on a {{platform}} {{on top of the}} envelope which was reached through a <b>climbing</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|Buildings {{may have}} {{maintenance}} shafts for passage of pipes and ducts between floors. <b>Climbing</b> these <b>shafts</b> {{is known as}} shafting. The practice is similar to buildering, which is done on the outsides of buildings.|$|R
25|$|The miners sank their shafts in {{turns of}} up to , each turn being {{a few yards away}} {{from the bottom of the}} {{preceding}} one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier <b>shaft.</b> They <b>climbed</b> up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or stemples, wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These <b>climbing</b> <b>shafts</b> were usually within the miners' “coe”, the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an adit or tunnel driven into the slope.|$|R
5000|$|Mag, Caroline, and Zone <b>climb</b> the <b>shaft</b> {{and arrive}} in DeWitt's old office. Through the broken window they see Los Angeles in ruins. A large collage of photos is {{assembled}} {{on the wall}} under the words [...] "To Remember." [...] Photos of Whiskey, Victor, Sierra, November, and Caroline are amongst them. Caroline picks her photo off the wall, saying she hopes she'll find herself alive; then she puts the photo back. The group then climb out the window onto a ladder and the episode ends.|$|R
50|$|Common {{features}} in a mine include drifts (horizontal tunnels), shafts (vertical tunnels) and winzes or air vents {{that are much}} smaller and can be at any angle underground. <b>Climbing</b> through these <b>shafts,</b> tunnels, and winzes can be very dangerous due to their unseen entrances and exits. A drift with a portal to the outside is called an adit.|$|R
5000|$|Sunny <b>climbs</b> up the <b>shaft</b> {{with her}} razor sharp teeth, gets their ersatz rope and jumps {{back down into}} the net. Sunny bites a hole in the net, and using the rope, they climb down from the net. Using Violet's ersatz welding torches, they travel along the hallway {{at the bottom of the}} shaft, only to find that it leads to a [...] Pounding on the [...] "ceiling" [...] reveals that it is in fact a trap door; the {{children}} escape through it, and find themselves in the ashes of their old home.|$|R
60|$|Close on noon {{he reached}} the township. Glamour seemed still to hover over it. He drove on to the mine. The winding-engine was turning, the pulley {{at the top of}} the head-gear {{whizzing}} round; nothing looked unusual. 'Some mistake!' he thought. He drove to the mine buildings, alighted, and <b>climbed</b> to the <b>shaft</b> head. Instead of the usual rumbling of the trolleys, the rattle of coal discharged over the screens, there was silence. Close by, Pippin himself was standing, smirched with dirt. The cage, coming swift and silent from below, shot open its doors with a sharp rattle. Scorrier bent forward to look. There lay a dead man, with a smile on his face.|$|R
50|$|From {{the service}} corridor, Morris and the Anglins <b>climbed</b> the {{ventilation}} <b>shaft</b> to the roof. Guards {{heard a loud}} crash as they broke out of the shaft, but since nothing further was heard, {{the source of the}} noise was not investigated. Hauling their gear with them, they descended 50 ft to the ground by sliding down a kitchen vent pipe, then climbed two 12 ft barbed-wire perimeter fences. At the northeast shoreline, near the power plant—a blind spot in the prison's network of searchlights and gun towers—they inflated their raft with the concertina. At some time after 10 o’clock, investigators estimated, they departed in the dense fog toward their objective, Angel Island, two miles to the north.|$|R
2500|$|The next day, Weena shows George domed, well-like {{structures}} {{that dot the}} landscape: air shafts that double as access to the Morlock underworld. She takes him to an ancient museum where [...] "talking rings" [...] tell of a nuclear war in the distant past. A reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements, while some returned to the surface. George realises this {{was the beginning of}} speciation for the Morlocks and the Eloi. He starts to <b>climb</b> down a <b>shaft,</b> but stops when sirens blare from atop the sphinx. He finds Weena gone and crowds of Eloi in a trance-like state, entering open doors at its base. The sirens stop and the doors close.|$|R
60|$|But first, the ventilator. This is a steel shaft {{that leads}} {{up from the}} coal-carrying bowels of the ship beneath the lazarette and that wins to the outside-world via the after-wall of the chart-house. In fact, it {{occupies}} the hollow inside of the double walls of the afterwall of the chart-house. Its opening, {{at the height of}} a man's head, is screened with iron bars so closely set that no mature-bodied rat can squeeze between. Also, this opening commands the wheel, which is a scant fifteen feet away and directly across the booby-hatch. Some mutineer, crawling along the space between the coal and the deck of the lower hold, had <b>climbed</b> the ventilator <b>shaft</b> and was able to take aim through the slits between the bars.|$|R

50|$|The widened holes {{opened into}} an {{unguarded}} utility corridor behind the cell tier. From the corridor they {{climbed to the}} roof of their cell block, inside the building, where they set up a small workshop. There, they assembled a variety of stolen and donated materials, including more than 50 raincoats that they turned into makeshift life preservers and a 6 by 14 ft rubber raft, the seams carefully stitched together and sealed with heat from nearby steam pipes. They stole a small accordion-like concertina from another inmate to serve as a bellows to inflate the raft, and built makeshift paddles from scrap wood. Finally, they <b>climbed</b> a ventilation <b>shaft</b> leading to a large fan and grille on the roof and cut away the rivets holding both in place.|$|R
5000|$|Klaus {{notices that}} there is one {{elevator}} door on each floor except for the top floor, which has two. The children discover that the extra elevator is [...] "ersatz", fake, and consists of nothing but an empty <b>shaft.</b> They <b>climb</b> down the <b>shaft,</b> to find the two Quagmire triplets trapped in a cage {{at the bottom of the}} shaft. The Quagmires say that Count Olaf is planning to smuggle them out of the city by hiding them as an object at the [...] "In" [...] auction, which one of his associates will bid on. The Baudelaires return to the penthouse to find tools with which they can free the Quagmires, but they return to find that Gunther has cast the Quagmires away already. They return, dispirited, to the penthouse.|$|R
50|$|Jo and Bert {{have made}} good {{progress}} through the old mine tunnels, when they find a green slime trickling down the wall. When Bert touches this, he begins to grow weak, and his hand starts to turn bright green. At Bert's insistence, Jo goes on without him. Dave and the Doctor find Bert, and the Doctor goes on to find Jo. By the time they reunite, Jo has found a vast lake of bright green slime, filled with huge maggot creatures. When the tunnel collapses behind them, they use an old mining wagon to get across the green lake. They then <b>climb</b> a steep <b>shaft,</b> where the Doctor collects a huge egg to take back for experimentation. At {{the top of the}} natural shaft, they find a large pipe, with the insides covered with traces of crude oil waste—meaning that the pipe leads to the Global Chemicals plant.|$|R
50|$|They {{lure the}} snake {{into the water}} {{treatment}} plant by having it chase John through a shaft while they set a bomb near the entrance. Kristin drops a line down another shaft for John to escape. The other two escape through the regular door, where Greg is waiting to drive them to the other shaft. They pull John out and the python is unable to <b>climb</b> up the <b>shaft.</b> Trapped in the tunnel, the python returns to the doorway entrance. The group returns to the entrance to trigger the bomb, {{but it does not}} detonate. Rudolph says the snake must have torn out the antenna when it crashed into the bunker, so he leaves his pet snake with Kristin and runs back in to reset it. While Rudolph resets the charges, he is confronted by the snake, but is able to succeed in his task. The charges go off, killing Rudolph, and the other four are celebrating their success, but the Python emerges unscathed.|$|R
50|$|The Ersatz Elevator is {{the sixth}} novel in A Series of Unfortunate Events. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny {{are sent to}} live with Jerome and Esmé Squalor, a wealthy couple {{who live in the}} {{penthouse}} of a 66 story apartment complex in the city. While Jerome is kindly toward the orphans, Esmé is obsessed with fashion and constantly occupied in her collaboration with a man named Gunther on a fashion auction known as the In Auction. When the children finally meet Gunther, they realize he is Count Olaf in disguise. When Olaf leaves the apartment complex without passing the doorman, the orphans search for a secret exit, and discover that there is an extra elevator door on the 66th floor which leads to an empty elevator shaft. The children make a rope and lower themselves down until they reach a room in which they find Duncan and Isadora Quagmire trapped in a cage. The Baudelaires climb back up the shaft to find a means of rescue for Quagmires, but when they return the triplets are gone. The children return and find Esmé, who tells them she is working with Olaf, then pushes them into the shaft, where they are caught in a net. Sunny <b>climbs</b> the <b>shaft</b> using her teeth and retrieves the rope, then the children climb down to the bottom, where they discover a tunnel which leads to a secret door in the ruins of their former home. The children head to the In Auction to find Olaf and Esmé; at the auction they find Mr. Poe and Jerome. The children expose Olaf and Esmé, and to Jerome's dismay, the count announces Esmé is his girlfriend, then the two villains escape. Jerome announces he will take the orphans far away from their troubles, but the Baudelaires are unwilling to desert the Quagmires. Jerome relinquishes his custody back to Poe and leaves the children.|$|R
50|$|The trio then <b>climb</b> {{down the}} <b>shaft</b> - Kyle and Salaak {{subsequently}} settling any remaining tension between them when Salaak apologizes for judging Kyle {{by what he}} was not rather than what he was, and discover five of Crowe’s crewmates, cocooned by the xenomorphs, four {{of which have been}} killed by chestbursters. The xenomorphs then attack the trio, and Crowe and Rayner flee through a passageway, separated from Salaak. They then come across a chamber where they discover a xenomorph Queen, with the remainder of Crowe’s crew and Rayner’s companions cocooned around the walls, and Rayner’s power ring on the floor. After exchanging a brief kiss for luck, Crowe jumps into the chamber firing at the aliens to distract them while Rayner goes for his ring. During this attempt, the skin on the right half of Crowe’s face is ripped away, revealing that she is a gynoid. Rayner reacquires his ring. Crowe, fatally damaged during the melee, tells Rayner that he shouldn’t leave the xenomorphs alive to endanger someone else in the future as Jordan did, so Rayner destroys the xenomorphs, rescuing the surviving Signet Dawn crew and his companions. Ash, Brik and Salaak do not survive. Rayner is left with the thought that sometimes the past comes back to haunt you no matter what one does, another reminder of the legacy of Hal Jordan that looms over him.|$|R
60|$|Comely beeches send {{up their}} white, straight, {{clustered}} branches, barred with green moss, {{like so many}} fingers from a half-clenched hand. Mighty oaks stand to the ankles in a fine tracery of underwood; thence the tall <b>shaft</b> <b>climbs</b> upward, and the great forest of stalwart boughs spreads out into the golden evening sky, where the rooks are flying and calling. On the sward of the Bois d'Hyver the firs stand well asunder with outspread arms, like fencers saluting; and the air smells of resin all around, {{and the sound of}} the axe is rarely still. But strangest of all, and in appearance oldest of all, are the dim and wizard upland districts of young wood. The ground is carpeted with fir-tassel, and strewn with fir-apples and flakes of fallen bark. Rocks lie crouching in the thicket, guttered with rain, tufted with lichen, white with years and the rigours of the changeful seasons. Brown and yellow butterflies are sown and carried away again by the light air--like thistledown. The loneliness of these coverts is so excessive, that there are moments when pleasure draws to the verge of fear. You listen and listen for some noise to break the silence, till you grow half mesmerised by the intensity of the strain; your sense of your own identity is troubled; your brain reels, like that of some gymnosophist poring on his own nose in Asiatic jungles; and should you see your own outspread feet, you see them, not as anything of yours, but as a feature of the scene around you.|$|R
