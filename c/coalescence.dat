5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, <b>coalescence</b> continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. <b>Coalescence</b> generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than <b>coalescence</b> when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E

Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth.

5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void <b>coalescence,</b> which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The <b>coalescence</b> of British and Indian culture resulted {{in the emergence of}} a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities.

Although matched filtering is the optimal search method for well-modeled systems, alternative detection strategies {{can be used}} to guard against theoretical errors (e. g., involving new physics and/or assumptions about spin or eccentricity) while providing a measure of redundancy. In a previous paper, we showed how “seedless clustering” {{can be used to}} detect long-lived gravitational-wave transients in both targeted and all-sky searches. In this paper, we apply seedless clustering to the problem of low-mass (M_total≤ 10 M_⊙) compact binary <b>coalescences</b> for both spinning and eccentric systems.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the use, in gravitational wave data analysis, of higher order wave form {{models of the}} gravitational radiation emitted by compact binary <b>coalescences.</b> We begin with an introductory chapter that includes {{an overview of the}} theory of general relativity, gravitational radiation and ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. We then discuss, in Chapter 2, the gravitational waves emitted by compact binary <b>coalescences,</b> with an explanation of higher order waveforms and how they differ from leading order waveforms we also introduce the post-Newtonian formalism. In Chapter 3 the method and results of a gravitational wave search for low mass compact binary <b>coalescences</b> using a subset of LIGO's 5 th science run data are presented and in the subsequent chapter we examine how one could use higher order waveforms in such analyses. We follow {{the development of a new}} search algorithm that incorporates higher order waveforms with promising results for detection efficiency and parameter estimation. In Chapter 5, a new method of windowing time-domain waveforms that offers benefit to gravitational wave searches is presented.

5|$|Manganese {{is part of}} {{the iron}} group of elements, which are thought to be {{synthesized}} in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, 53Mn is relatively rare, produced by cosmic rays impact on iron. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before <b>coalescence</b> of the solar system.|$|E

5|$|Thus, Peking opera {{is not a}} {{monolithic}} form, but rather a <b>coalescence</b> of many older forms. However, the new form also creates its own innovations. The vocal requirements {{for all of the}} major roles were greatly reduced for Peking opera. The Chou, in particular, rarely has a singing part in Peking opera, unlike the equivalent role in Kunqu style. The melodies that accompany each play were also simplified, and are played with different traditional instruments than in earlier forms. Perhaps most noticeably, true acrobatic elements were introduced with Peking opera. The form grew in popularity throughout the 19th century. The Anhui troupes reached their peak of excellence {{in the middle of the}} century, and were invited to perform in the court of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom that had been established during the Taiping Rebellion. Beginning in 1884, the Empress Dowager Cixi became a regular patron of Peking opera, cementing its status over earlier forms like Kunqu. The popularity of Peking opera has been attributed to the simplicity of the form, with only a few voices and singing patterns. This allowed anyone to sing the arias themselves.|$|E

40|$|Interferometric {{gravitational}} wave detectors are dynamic instruments. Changing gravitational-wave strains influence the trajectories of null geodesics and therefore modify the interferometric response. These effects {{will be important}} when the associated frequencies are comparable to the round-trip light travel time down the detector arms. The arms of advanced detectors currently in operation are short enough that the strain can be approximated as static, but planned 3 ^rd generation detectors, with arms {{an order of magnitude}} longer, will need to account for these effects.

25|$|The {{nucleation}} reaction {{can start}} with any heterogeneous surface, such as rock salt, but Mentos {{have been found to}} work better than most. Tonya Coffey, a physicist at Appalachian State University, found that the aspartame in diet drinks lowers the surface tension in the water and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the process. It has also been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors can also enhance fountain heights. In some cases, dissolved solids that increase the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights. These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble <b>coalescence.</b> Decreased bubble <b>coalescence</b> leads to smaller bubble sizes and greater foaming ability in water. Thus, the geyser reaction will still work even using sugared drinks, but diet is commonly used both {{for the sake of a}} larger geyser as well as to avoid having to clean up a sugary soda mess.|$|E

We apply this technique to recent results from LIGO to produce the first simultaneous 95 % confidence level limits on multiple parameters in generic power-law SGWB models and in SGWB models of compact binary <b>coalescences.</b> We also estimate {{the sensitivity of the}} upcoming second-generation detectors such as Advanced LIGO/Virgo to these models and demonstrate how SGWB measurements can be combined and compared with observations of individual compact binary <b>coalescences</b> in order to build confidence in the origin of an observed SGWB signal. In doing so, we demonstrate a novel means of differentiating between different sources of the SGWB. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
