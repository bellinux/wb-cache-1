The season also features the return of Soundwave and Ratchet from Transformers: Primethe former appearing for one episode while the latter appears in the two-part finale. A miniseries, {{consisting of}} six episodes, premiered in October 2016 and features the return of Starscream, placing him as the main antagonist. In April 2017, the series' third season, entitled <b>Combiner</b> Force, began airing and focuses on Bee Team's realization that they can combine into the <b>Combiner,</b> Ultra Bee, as well as the arrival of the Stunticons, who are also capable of combining. Soundwave also plans to return with the help of Activators, a new breed of Minicons.|$|E

40|$|So far few {{theoretical}} works {{investigated the}} conditions under which specific fusion rules can work well, and a unifying framework for comparing rules of different complexity is clearly beyond the state of the art. A clear theoretical comparison is lacking even if one focuses on specific classes of <b>combiners</b> (e. g., linear <b>combiners).</b> In this paper, we theoretically compare simple and weighted averaging rules for fusion of imbalanced classifiers. Continuing the work reported in [10], we get a deeper knowledge of classifiers' imbalance effects in linear <b>combiners.</b> In addition, we experimentally compare the performance of linear and order statistics <b>combiners</b> for ensembles with different degrees of classifiers imbalance...|$|R

In this article we investigate a family of <b>combiners</b> based on order statistics, for robust handling of situations where there are large discrepancies in performance of individual classifiers. Based on a mathematical modeling of how the decision boundaries are affected by order statistic <b>combiners,</b> we derive expressions for the reductions in error expected when simple output combination methods based on the the median, the maximum and in general, the i th order statistic, are used. Furthermore, we analyze the trim and spread <b>combiners,</b> both based on linear combinations of the ordered classifier outputs, and show that {{in the presence of}} uneven classifier performance, they often provide substantial gains over both linear and simple order statistics <b>combiners.</b> Experimental results on both real world data and standard public domain data sets corroborate these findings...|$|R

500|$|The {{phases of}} the inputs to each power <b>combiner</b> are {{arranged}} such that the two inputs are 90° out of phase with each other. [...] Since the coupled port of a hybrid <b>combiner</b> is 90° out of phase with the transmitted port, this causes the powers to add at {{the output of the}} <b>combiner</b> and to cancel at the isolated port: a representative example from figure 21 is shown in figure 22. [...] Note that there is an additional fixed 90° phase shift to both ports at each combiner/divider which is not shown in the diagrams for simplicity. [...] Applying in-phase power to both input ports would not get the desired result: the quadrature sum of the two inputs would appear at both output ports – that is half the total power out of each. [...] This approach allows the use of numerous less expensive and lower-power amplifiers in the circuitry instead of a single high-power TWT. [...] Yet another approach is to have each solid state amplifier (SSA) feed an antenna and let the power be combined in space or be used to feed a lens attached to an antenna.|$|E

500|$|A {{typical power}} divider {{is shown in}} figure 13. [...] Ideally, input power would be divided equally between the output ports. [...] Dividers are made up of {{multiple}} couplers and, like couplers, may be reversed and used as multiplexers. [...] The drawback is that for a four channel multiplexer, the output consists of only 1/4 the power from each, and is relatively inefficient. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} at each <b>combiner</b> half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load. [...] If the two inputs were coherent the phases could be so arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 and then all the power would go to port 1. [...] However, multiplexer inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent. [...] Lossless multiplexing can only be done with filter networks.Naval Air Warfare Center, pp.6.4.4, 6.4.5 ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} and experimental analysis of linear <b>combiners</b> for multiple classifier systems is presented. Although linear <b>combiners</b> {{are the most}} frequently used combining rules, many important issues related to their operation for pattern classification tasks lack {{a theoretical}} basis. After a critical review of the framework developed in works by Tumer and Ghosh [30], [31] on which our analysis is based, we focus on the simplest and most widely used implementation of linear <b>combiners,</b> which consists of assigning a nonnegative weight to each individual classifier. Moreover, we consider the ideal performance of this combining rule, i. e., that achievable when the optimal values of the weights are used. We do not consider the problem of weights estimation, which has been addressed in the literature. Our theoretical analysis shows how the performance of linear <b>combiners,</b> in terms of misclassification probability, depends on the performance of individual classifiers, and on the correlation between their outputs. In particular, we evaluate the ideal performance improvement that can be achieved using the weighted average over the simple average combining rule and investigate in what way it depends on the individual classifiers. Experimental results on real data sets show that the behavior of linear <b>combiners</b> agrees with the predictions of our analytical model. Finally, we discuss the contribution to {{the state of the art}} and the practical relevance of our theoretical and experimental analysis of linear <b>combiners</b> for multiple classifier systems...|$|R

Remember also this fact of difference, that, while through the antique and through the mediaeval ages, highest thoughts and ideals realized themselves, and their expression made its way by other arts, as much as, or even more than by, technical literature, (not open to the mass of persons, or even to the majority of eminent persons,) such literature in our day and for current purposes, is not only more eligible than all the other arts put together, but has become the only general means of morally influencing the world.

40|$|Background and aims: {{there is}} little {{information}} regar ding changes in antihypertensive drug treatment in Switzerland. We aimed at assessing those changes in a population-based, prospective study. Methods: 768 hypertensive subjects (372 women, 397 men) followed for 5 years. Subjects were defined as continuers (no change), switchers (one antihypertensive class replace by another), <b>combiners</b> (one antihypertensive class added) and discontinuers (stopped treatment). Results: Analysis of all patients (mono or combination therapy) showed that 54. 6 % were continuers, 27. 2 % <b>combiners,</b> 12. 9 % switchers and 5. 3 % discontinuers. Similar findings were obtained for participants on monotherapy only: 42. 2 % continuers, 36. 7 % <b>combiners,</b> 13. 4 % switchers and 7. 7 % discontinuers. <b>Combiners</b> had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure values at baseline than the other groups (p< 0. 001), while no difference were found for personal and family history and other clinical and biological variables. Compared to continuers, <b>combiners</b> and switchers improved their blood pressure status at follow-up: 26. 7 % of <b>combiners</b> and 26. 3 % of switchers improved, versus 17. 7 % of continuers and 7. 3 % of discontinuers (p< 0. 001). Among participants on monotherapy at baseline, continuation was greatest for angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agents (ARBs, 53. 1 %), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (44. 4 %) and β-blockers (41. 8 %). Only one quarter of participants treated with diuretic or calcium channel blockers at baseline remained so at follow-up. Conclusion: Antihypertensivedrug treatment is very stable in Switzerland. There are no big differences in persistence between antihypertensive classes, even if ARBs had the most favorable utilization pattern.

30|$|The {{classification}} accuracy of stand-alone classifiers that perform early classification, can be significantly improved {{by combining the}} outputs of multiple classifiers using combination algorithms [108, 121]. Donato et al. [121] propose Traffic Identification Engine (TIE), a platform that allows the development and evaluation of ML (and non-ML) classification techniques as plugins. Furthermore, TIE capitalizes on complementarity between classifiers to achieve higher accuracy in online classification. This is realized by using classifier output fusion algorithms, called <b>combiners,</b> including NB, majority voting (MV), weighted majority voting (WMV), Dempster-Shafer (D-S) [484], Behavior-Knowledge Space (BKS) method [199], and Wernecke (WER) method [473].
