50|$|Above decks is the {{wheelhouse}}, {{mounted on}} the forward cabin's coaming; aft of that, the exposed breezeway; and, {{mounted on the}} after cabin's coaming, a Zodiac launch {{as well as a}} food locker and barbecue. Above the wheelhouse is an open bridge, fitted with chart table and a gyro <b>compass</b> <b>repeater.</b> A second gyro repeater is fitted on the quarterdeck. Each YAG is equipped with a small navigation radar, with the display located in the wheelhouse.|$|E
50|$|In {{appearance}} and use, a pelorus resembles a compass or <b>compass</b> <b>repeater,</b> with sighting vanes or a sighting telescope attached, {{but it has}} no directive properties. That is, it remains at any relative direction {{to which it is}} set. It is generally used by setting 000Â° at the lubber's line. Relative bearings are then observed. They can be converted to bearings true, magnetic, grid, etc., by adding the appropriate heading. The direct use of relative bearings is sometimes of value. A pelorus is useful, for instance, in determining the moment at which an aid to navigation is broad on the beam. It is also useful in measuring pairs of relative bearings which can be used to determine distance off and distance abeam of a navigational aid.|$|E
25|$|Land-based ship {{simulators}} may {{feature a}} full-scale {{replica of a}} steering stand with a ship's wheel. Such simulators incorporate magnetic and gyro <b>compasses</b> (or <b>repeaters)</b> for steering. Moreover, a rudder angle indicator that responds appropriately to the helm {{is part of the}} configuration.|$|R
