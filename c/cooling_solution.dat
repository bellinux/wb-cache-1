50|$|The compute nodes of the QPACE {{supercomputer}} {{are cooled}} by water. Roughly 115 Watt {{have to be}} dissipated from each node card. The <b>cooling</b> <b>solution</b> {{is based on a}} two-component design. Each node card is mounted to a thermal box, which acts as a large heat sink for heat-critical components. The thermal box interfaces to a coldplate, which is connected to the water-cooling circuit. The performance of the coldplate allows for the removal of the heat from up to 32 nodes. The node cards are mounted {{on both sides of the}} coldplate, i.e., 16 nodes each are mounted on the top and bottom of the coldplate. The efficiency of the <b>cooling</b> <b>solution</b> allows for the cooling of the compute nodes with warm water. The QPACE <b>cooling</b> <b>solution</b> also influenced other supercomputer designs such as SuperMUC.|$|E

50|$|The simple {{design of}} a shell and tube heat {{exchanger}} makes it an ideal <b>cooling</b> <b>solution</b> {{for a wide variety}} of applications. One of the most common applications is the cooling of hydraulic fluid and oil in engines, transmissions and hydraulic power packs. With the right choice of materials they can also be used to cool or heat other mediums, such as swimming pool water or charge air. One of the big advantages of using a shell and tube heat exchanger is that they are often easy to service, particularly with models where a floating tube bundle (where the tube plates are not welded to the outer shell) is available.|$|E
50|$|The 512 MB {{version of}} the GeForce 7800 GTX was {{released}} on November 14, 2005. The card features more than simply an increased frame buffer from 256 MB to 512 MB. The card features a much improved core clock speed of 550 MHz vs. 430 MHz (27.9% increase) and fast 1.1 ns GDDR3 memory clocked at 1.7 GHz vs. 1.2 GHz (41.7% increase), {{when compared to the}} original version. Like ATI's X1800 XT, the addition of another 256 MB of memory, and to a lesser extent, the increased clock speeds, have raised the heat and power output significantly. To combat this, the GeForce 7800 GTX 512 sports a much larger yet quieter dual slot <b>cooling</b> <b>solution</b> when compared to the original 256 MB version.|$|E
5000|$|Material - The thermal {{conductivity}} {{of the material}} that the heat sink is made from directly affects the dissipation efficiency through conduction. Normally this is aluminum, although copper may be used with an advantage for flat-sheet heat sinks. New materials include thermoplastics that are used when heat dissipation requirements are lower than normal or complex shape would be advantaged by injection molding, and natural graphite solutions which offer better thermal transfer than copper with a lower weight than aluminum plus {{the ability to be}} formed into complex two-dimensional shapes. Graphite is considered an exotic <b>cooling</b> <b>solution</b> and does come at a higher production cost. Heat pipes may also be added to aluminum or copper heat sinks to reduce spreading resistance.|$|E

50|$|Since 2011, the {{effectiveness}} of water cooling has prompted a series of all-in-one (AIO) water <b>cooling</b> <b>solutions.</b> AIO solutions result in a much simpler to install unit, and most units have been reviewed positively from review sites.|$|R
50|$|In {{the above}} {{reaction}} scheme, {{a mixture of}} gaseous hydrogen chloride and hydrogen sulfide are passed into a <b>cooled</b> <b>solution</b> of benzophenone in ethanol. Thiobenzophenone can also be produced by a Friedel-Crafts reaction of thiobenzoyl chloride and benzene.|$|R
50|$|Disadvantages {{of liquid}} cooling include {{complexity}} {{and the potential}} for a coolant leak. Leaked water can damage any electronic components with which it comes into contact, and the need to test for and repair leaks makes for more complex and less reliable installations. (Notably, the first major foray into the field of liquid-cooled personal computers for general use, the high-end versions of Apple's Power Mac G5, was ultimately doomed by a propensity for coolant leaks.) An air-cooled heat sink is generally much simpler to build, install, and maintain than a water <b>cooling</b> <b>solution,</b> although CPU-specific water cooling kits can also be found, which may be just as easy to install as an air cooler. These are not limited to CPUs, however, and liquid cooling of GPU cards is also possible.|$|E
50|$|Together with Baltzar von Platen and John Tandberg, Munters {{invented the}} gas {{absorption}} refrigerator for domestic use. His {{intention was to}} create an easy-to-use refrigerator without any moving parts. The technique removed thermal energy, which was driven by a heat source such as propane, electricity, or kerosene. The team rented a room and worked into the night. They slept in the mornings and missed classes at the Royal Institute of Technology where they were students. It took them about a year to create a first prototype that worked with self-circulation. The prototype still had one moving part, a ball valve, and was big and clumsy. Eventually the design was improved and their <b>cooling</b> <b>solution</b> was a world sensation. Albert Einstein once mentioned how astonished he was by their ingenious solution.|$|E
50|$|One {{major change}} with the {{manufacturing}} of the core {{was the use of}} the flip-chip packaging, a technology not used previously on video cards. Flip chip packaging allows far better cooling of the die by flipping it and exposing it directly to the <b>cooling</b> <b>solution.</b> ATI thus could achieve higher clock speeds. Radeon 9700 PRO was launched clocked at 325 MHz, ahead of the originally projected 300 MHz. With a transistor count of 110 million, it was the largest and most complex GPU of the time. A slower chip, the 9700, was launched a few months later, differing only by lower core and memory speeds. Despite that, the Radeon 9700 PRO was clocked significantly higher than the Matrox Parhelia 512, a card released but months before R300 and considered to be the pinnacle of graphics chip manufacturing (with 80 million transistors at 220 MHz), up until R300's arrival.|$|E
50|$|Worthy of note {{regarding}} the R300-based generation {{is that the}} entire lineup utilized single-slot <b>cooling</b> <b>solutions.</b> It {{was not until the}} R420 generation's Radeon X850 XT Platinum Edition, in December 2004, that ATI would adopt an official dual-slot cooling design.|$|R
5000|$|The Company has now several {{different}} versions of the Enthoo serie.Further, the <b>cooling</b> <b>solutions</b> have been extended by more CPU coolers, fans and accessories. Since {{the beginning of the year}} 2017 the company also produces liquid cooling blocks and fittings ...|$|R
40|$|Increasing power densities and {{the high}} cost of low thermal {{resistance}} packages and <b>cooling</b> <b>solutions</b> make it impractical to design processors for worst-case temperature scenarios. As a result, packages and <b>cooling</b> <b>solutions</b> are designed for less than worst-case power densities and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is used to prevent dangerous on-chip temperatures at run time. Unfortunately, DVFS can cause unpredicted drops in performance (e. g., long response times). We propose and optimally solve the problem of thermally-constrained online work maximization for general-purpose computing systems on uniprocessors with discrete speed levels and non-negligible transition overheads. Simulation results show that our approach completes 47. 7 % on average and up to 68. 0 % more cycles than a naïve policy...|$|R
