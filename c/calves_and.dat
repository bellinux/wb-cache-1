5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have <b>calves</b> <b>and</b> ankles that {{return and}} amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have <b>calves</b> <b>and</b> ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

5|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. <b>Calves</b> <b>and</b> heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the hide {{and most of the}} skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.|$|E

5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of <b>calves</b> <b>and</b> the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E

We estimated favourable genetic correlations between <b>Calving</b> Interval <b>and</b> type traits ranging from 20. 027 to 20. 297.

5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe <b>calves</b> <b>and</b> increases their survival probability.|$|E
5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small <b>calves,</b> <b>and</b> especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Mendenhall Glacier is a lake-calving glacier {{in southeastern}} Alaska, USA, that is {{experiencing}} substantial thinning and increasingly rapid recession. Long-term mass wastage linked to climatic trends {{is responsible for}} thinning of the lower glacier and leaving the terminus vulnerable to buoyancy-driven <b>calving</b> <b>and</b> accelerated retreat. Bedrock topography has {{played a major role}} in stabilizing the terminus between periods of rapid <b>calving</b> <b>and</b> retreat. Lake-terminating glaciers form a population distinct from both tidewater glaciers and polar ice tongues, with some similarities to both groups. Lacustrine termini experience fewer perturbations (e. g. tidal flexure, high subaqueous melt rates) and are therefore inherently more stable than tidewater termini. At Mendenhall, rapid thinning and simultaneous retreat into a deeper basin led to flotation conditions along approximately 50 % of the calving front. This unstable terminus geometry lasted for approximately 2 years and culminated in largescale <b>calving</b> <b>and</b> terminus collapse during summer 2004. Buoyancy-driven <b>calving</b> events <b>and</b> terminus break-up can result from small, rapidly applied perturbations in lake level. 1...|$|R
5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with <b>calves,</b> <b>and</b> all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until {{four or five years}} old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
5|$|Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were {{probably}} social {{and lived in}} matriarchal (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also {{similar to that of}} modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as the Dent Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a flash flood, and that the arrangement of some of the skeletons suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of <b>calves</b> <b>and</b> large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may have approached the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate factors associated with resumption of postpartum estrous cycles and embryonic survival in lactating dairy cows. Holstein cows, 6396 from four dairy farms were evaluated to determine the relationships among parity, body condition score (BCS) at <b>calving</b> <b>and</b> at AI, season of year when cows <b>calved,</b> <b>and</b> milk yield on resumption of postpartum estrous cycles by 65 days postpartum, and all the previous variables, estrual or anestrus and AI protocol on conception rates and embryonic survival at the first postpartum insemination. Cows had their estrous cycle pre-synchronized with two PGF 2 α injections given 14 days apart and were inseminated between 69 and 82 days postpartum following either an estrous or ovulation synchronization protocol initiated 12 – 14 days after the presynchronization. Blood was sampled and analyzed for progesterone twice, 12 – 14 days apart, to determine whether cows had initiated onset of estrous cycles after calving. Cows were scored for body condition in the week after <b>calving,</b> <b>and</b> again at AI, between 69 and 82 days postpartum. Pregnancy was diagnosed at 30 ± 3 and 58 ± 3 days after AI. Farm influenced all reproductive outcomes evaluated. More (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) multiparous than primiparous cows had initiated estrous cycles. Onset of estrous cycles was also influenced (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) by BCS at <b>calving</b> <b>and</b> at AI, BCS change, season, and milk yield. More (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) cows that had initiated estrous cycles than anestrous cows were pregnant at 30 and 58 days after AI, but anestrus did not affect pregnancy loss.
