5000|$|Behavioral styles theory: Blake and Mouton, {{in their}} {{managerial}} grid model, proposed five leadership styles {{based on two}} axes - <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the task versus <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> people. They suggested that the ideal is the [...] "team style", which balances <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the task with <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> people. Scouller (2011) argued that this ideal approach may not suit all circumstances; for example, emergencies or turnarounds.|$|R

5|$|On 9 November 2008, Chelsea Football Club were {{reported}} to be considered moving to a new purpose built stadium at the power station. The proposed stadium was to hold between 65,000 and 75,000 fans and feature a retractable roof. The proposals were designed by HOK Sport, the same company who designed Wembley Stadium. However, the Chelsea FC scheme was seriously in doubt due to <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> {{the preservation of the}} site and the collapse of the REO scheme in late November 2011.|$|E

40|$|The public’s <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> {{animal welfare}} is {{evolving}} {{and it is}} important to consider factors that are related to <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> animals and their use by humans. An online survey of 825 U. S. residents was conducted. Relationships between approval of animal uses and stated <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> animal welfare were examined. More than 90 % of respondents reported that using animals for egg production, service or therapy, pets, and milk production was acceptable to them. Respondents who were younger or reported being female less frequently found most uses acceptable than older or male respondents. Half of respondents reported <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the welfare of bison while 40 % or more stated <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> the welfare of elk, beef cattle, and dairy cattle. Respondents who stated they were <b>concerned</b> <b>for</b> the welfare of dairy cattle less frequently reported accepting using animals for meat production, livestock shows, and hunting. Thus, self-reported <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> animal species and acceptance of the use of animals were related in some instances. A better understanding of the factors related to acceptance of animal uses and <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> animal welfare will help animal-related industries and wildlife agencies develop practices that are consistent with public attitudes...|$|R

5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> {{the safety of the}} large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E

He made the active roster and originally split time with Warner and Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer {{in his first game}} in that role. He experienced nagging injury <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of the season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly {{after the end of the}} 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries as a factor in his release from the team.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend. The only ship {{available}} in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> {{the safety of the}} cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank.|$|E
5|$|Fortune's activities—including her {{leadership}} of the new group {{and a series of}} articles that she wrote for The Occult Review—raised <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> Alpha et Omega leader Moina Mathers. After Fortune suggested that her own organisation could serve as a feeder group to Mathers's Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was necessitated by Fortune having the wrong signs in her aura. Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she was confronted and assaulted by both real and etheric cats.|$|E

5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take {{a very long time}} to disperse from a badly designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.|$|E

5000|$|In contrast, yielding, “accommodating”, {{smoothing}} or suppression conflict {{styles are}} characterized by {{a high level of}} <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> others and a low level of <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> oneself. This passive pro-social approach emerges when individuals derive personal satisfaction from meeting the needs of others and have a general <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> maintaining stable, positive social relationships. When faced with conflict, individuals with a yielding conflict style tend to harmonize into others’ demands out of respect for the social relationship.|$|R
