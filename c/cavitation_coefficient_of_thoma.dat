40|$|This paper {{presents}} the cavitation characteristics for circular cylinder when pressure water is supplied from {{surface of the}} cylinder to main flow around it. I reported already the cavitation characteristics of hydro-foils with pressure water supply. But I couldnit get good results at that time, because cavitation on the foils developed more suddenly by the pressure water. The pressure water is led from a water pipe directly to the testing cylinder. The cylinder has fourteen small holes on its surface, and they are located at some angle ± θ from the stagnation point of upstream side on the circular cylinder surface. Seven holes are located at+θ, the others are at -θ. Pressure water is supplied through these holes to main flow. The angle θ are 70 °, 90 °, 110 °, and 130 °. Experimental results show as follows; 1. When θ equals 70 ° drag coefficients are much larger than one of no pressure water supply. <b>Cavitation</b> inception <b>coefficient</b> varies from 5. 0 to 4. 2 while relative volume of pressure water increases from μ ＝ 7. 02 × 10 ^- 3 to 2. 92 × 10 ^- 2. These values are very large compared with 2. 0 for no water supply. 2. When θ takes 90 °. drag coefficents are also larger, but they are somewhat smaller than ones for 70 °. The inception coefficient takes from 4. 0 to 2. 6, decreasing with increasing relative volume of supplied water which is changed the same range to the former. 3. Drag coefficients almost equal to one of no pressure water When θ takes 110 °. <b>Coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>cavitation</b> inception varies from 3. 7 to 3. 2 with changing supplied water volume. 4. When θ equals 130 °, drag coefficients are much smaller than one of no water supply. The former is about a half of the later {{within the range of}} none <b>cavitation.</b> <b>Cavitation</b> inception <b>coefficient</b> takes from 2. 5 to 3. 5, but on this time, the value increases with supplied water volume. All <b>of</b> them, <b>cavitation</b> inception <b>coefficients</b> are larger than one of no water supply. But when θ equal 110 °and 130 °, cavitation scarcely develops within some ranges <b>of</b> <b>cavitation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> At 110 °for θ, the limiting <b>cavitation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for no development of cavitation varies from 2. 7 to 1. 8, and it decreases with increasing supplied water volume. At 130 °, it varies from 1. 8 to 1. 6. As previously described, <b>cavitation</b> inception <b>coefficient</b> for no pressure water supply is about 2. 0, and cavitation develops gradually with decreasing <b>cavitation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Then, if the pressure water is supplied at about 130 ° from stagnation point of upper stream side, a scale of cavitation development is smaller than one of no pressure water supply...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} report {{concerning}} with the characteristics of hydro-foils on cavitation. On the first paper, I reported how cavitation changes the characteristics, such as lift and drag, of hydro-foils from non-cavitation. In this paper, I will discribe how pressure distribution changes, when pressure water issues from upper surface of foil to main flow around it. The pressure water is led from tank to main hole in the foil, and the main hole is connected to several small holes {{on the surface of}} foil. At non-cavitation range, experimental results show that pressure on the upper surface of foil somewhat increases, when pressure water issues out of surface of foil. Therefore, lift of foil decreases, but drag does not change as ever. On the other hand, when cavitation occurs and extends considerably on surface of the foil, the pressure water decreases pressure on the foil. But the lift does not increase compared with none issued water, and yet, the drag increases fairly. Besides, cavitation inception point (the value <b>of</b> <b>cavitation</b> <b>coefficient</b> K_d) is the same as n one issued water...|$|R
