A mole plough {{has a very strong}} frame which slides along the ground when the machine is in work. A heavy leg, similar to a subsoiler leg, is attached to the frame and a circular section share with a larger diameter expander on a flexible link is bolted to the leg. The bullet shaped share forms a tunnel, about 75mm diameter, in the soil and the expander presses the soil outwards to form a long-lasting drainage channel.|$|E
500|$|C.L.Best {{introduced}} a <b>crawler</b> <b>tractor</b> in 1913 that was virtually a carbon copy of Holt's design. Holt's tractors had a conventional wheel on the front, {{which was used}} to steer, and crawling-type wheels on the back, but otherwise looked very similar to a traction engine. During 1914, both Best and Holt introduced models without the front [...] "tiller" [...] or steering wheel. Holt offered the Caterpillar 45 and Best introduced his C.L.Best Model 40 [...] "Tracklayer".|$|E

500|$|The Holt Manufacturing Company traces {{its roots}} to the 1883 {{founding}} of Stockton Wheel Service in Stockton, California, United States. Benjamin Holt, who was later credited with patenting the first workable <b>crawler</b> <b>tractor</b> design, incorporated the Holt Manufacturing Company [...] in 1892. Holt Manufacturing Company {{was the first}} company to successfully manufacture a continuous track tractor. By {{the start of the}} 20th century, Holt Manufacturing Company was the leading manufacturer of combine harvesters in the United States and the leading California-based manufacturer of steam traction engines.|$|E
500|$|In Washington, Pliny Holt {{supervised}} {{the design and}} building of 10 Ton, 5 Ton, and 2.5 Ton artillery tractors based on the Caterpillar <b>crawler</b> <b>tractor</b> design, {{at the request of}} the Naval Consulting board, which work was finally completed in conjunction with the engineers of the Westinghouse company. The first tank Holt built was the Holt Gas-Electric, a prototype utilizing a combined gasoline-electric propulsion. A Holt [...] four cylinder engine produced power for a G.E.C. generator, which in its turn provided current to drive two electric motors, one motor for each track. It did not progress beyond the prototype stage.|$|E
2500|$|Like Model T {{cars and}} trucks, the Fordson tractor {{provided}} {{the basis for}} a large and varied aftermarket in accessories and conversions. A pair of articles in a 1922 issue of the Chilton Tractor Journal describes the business environment and gives photographs of many of the attachments and conversions available. As with most other tractors, farmers and construction contractors could buy aftermarket governors, ignition parts, hitches and drawbars; but with the Fordson especially, one could buy a <b>crawler</b> <b>tractor,</b> road grader, or self-propelled combine built by an aftermarket firm that used the Fordson essentially as a platform. For example, the original Gleaner self-propelled combines were built by attaching the combine to a Fordson. At least 3 companies offered crawler conversions, and others offered enlarged cleats, including the [...] "overgrown tire chain" [...] type that had led to crawler development not long before. Several companies converted Fordsons to road graders; the Wehr (...) is well remembered. [...] The first tricycle cultivator version of the Fordson was available as an aftermarket conversion by the Moline Implement Company as early as 1920 or 1921, [...] which was 3 to 4 years before the Farmall was introduced, a full decade before Dearborn prototyped the Fordson All-Around, [...] and a full decade and a half before Ford Ltd produced that model. It lacked those tractors' high clearance but was otherwise prescient.|$|E

The Vulcan car of the 1920s also was available with a Dorman engine, and several other cars of very limited production used Dorman engines in the 1920s. The Dorman 4JO engines was also used in the new model 1922 40 hp Clayton & Shuttleworth 'chain-rail' <b>crawler</b> <b>tractors.</b> Their previous model, which had been made throughout the war, had a 35 hp rating, though it is not clear if these were also Dorman-engined.

A variety of heavy earth-moving equipment, e.g. compact and small wheel loaders, track type loaders and <b>crawler</b> <b>tractors,</b> skid-steered loaders and asphalt compactors use hydrostatic transmission. Hydrostatic CVTs are usually not used for extended duration high torque applications because of the heat that is generated by the flowing oil, although {{there are a variety}} of oil cooler designs to help counter this problem.|$|R
