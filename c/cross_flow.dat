25|$|Although not yet widely used, {{tidal energy}} has {{potential}} for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than {{the wind and}} the sun. Among sources of renewable energy, tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However, many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons) and turbine technology (e.g. new axial turbines, <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> turbines), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed, and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels.|$|E

40|$|Propeller {{exciting}} {{forces are}} the main causes of stern vibrations. In this paper, three-dimension exciting bearing forces of one blade and the whole propeller under nonuniform ship’s wake were predicted, {{and the influence of}} <b>cross</b> <b>flows</b> on these exciting forces was studied. All simulations were carried out using a commercial solver, STAR-CCM+. To obtain the nominal wake for studying propeller exciting forces, flow field around a bare hull was simulated. Numerical results were widely validated by measured data, especially the velocity field at the propeller plane. Harmonic characteristics of the nonuniform ship’s wake were studied. Then, a propeller under uniform inflow and nonuniform ship’s wake with/without <b>cross</b> <b>flows</b> was simulated. Free-water surface and hull boundary were considered using a specially designed dummy stern. Results show that the influence of <b>cross</b> <b>flows</b> on propeller exciting forces is obvious. As for the exciting forces of one blade, the <b>cross</b> <b>flows</b> have greater influence on the axial force. As for the exciting forces of the whole propeller, the <b>cross</b> <b>flows</b> have greater influence on the transverse and vertical forces, and if the <b>cross</b> <b>flows</b> in ship’s wake are not considered, the amplitudes of the main harmonics of transverse and vertical forces increase obviously...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNitrate as heat {{transfer}} and storage media can be {{widely used in}} solar thermal power, nuclear power, and other industrial engineering. If the leaked nitrate cannot be timely recovered, it will probably dissolve in the water, and then transport to the soil and groundwater. In this paper, a numerical model was built to simulate large-scale migration of nitrate in the soil and groundwater, and then the unsteady diffusion performance of nitrate in the groundwater was studied to prevent and reduce the environment pollution of leaked nitrate. The soil system was constructed by the loam and sand, and different groundwater levels and <b>crossing</b> <b>flow</b> rates were also considered. The {{results showed that the}} vertical nitrate diffusion range was mainly impacted by the groundwater depth and annual precipitation. As the groundwater depth was deeper or the local annual precipitation was larger, the nitrate pollution can permeate deeper.
