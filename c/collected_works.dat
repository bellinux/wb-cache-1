5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's <b>collected</b> <b>works</b> in four volumes in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition led to controversy, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under English copyright law, {{to many of}} the works included in Faulkner's edition. The English, in 1735, attempted to pass a law that would allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law failed to pass through Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} republished in many editions by {{publishers}} in cities including London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Philadelphia. The twentieth reprint {{was made in}} 1820. Versions appeared in years including 1802, 1807, 1809, 1813, 1818, 1819, 1821, 1823, 1825, 1826, 1829, 1830, 1840, 1854 and many later years. The book remains in print, with more recent editions for example in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2014. The book was also republished in editions of Paley's <b>Collected</b> <b>Works.</b> It has been translated into languages including French and Welsh.|$|E
5|$|William Morris was a {{prolific}} writer of poetry, fiction, essays, and translations of ancient and medieval texts. His first poems were published {{when he was}} 24 years old, and he was polishing his final novel, The Sundering Flood, {{at the time of}} his death. His daughter May's edition of Morris's <b>Collected</b> <b>Works</b> (1910–1915) runs to 24 volumes, and two more were published in 1936.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s, Johnson aligned {{himself with}} the {{supporters}} of the French Revolution, and published {{an increasing number of}} political pamphlets in addition to a prominent journal, the Analytical Review, which offered British reformers a voice in the public sphere. In 1799, he was indicted on charges of seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by the Unitarian minister Gilbert Wakefield. After spending six months in prison, albeit under relatively comfortable conditions, Johnson published fewer political works. In the last decade of his career, Johnson did not seek out many new writers; however, he remained successful by publishing the <b>collected</b> <b>works</b> of authors such as William Shakespeare.|$|E

It has also been published as part of the <b>collected</b> <b>works</b> of Symeon of Durham, edited by Thomas Arnold in two volumes of the Rolls Series published in 1882–1885. A translation of the work appeared in Joseph Stevenson's The Church Historians of England, published between 1853 and 1858; specifically in volume iii, part ii. A more recent translation appeared in the English Historical Documents series, volume ii.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his <b>collected</b> <b>works.</b> In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people's minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{continued}} to be hailed as a relevant writer during the ten years following his death, and his wors went through new critical editions. Pajere was published in spring 1936, having been edited by Marica Caragiale-Sion and Alexandru Rosetti. Later in the year, a volume of <b>collected</b> <b>works,</b> Opere, was published by Rosetti and featured prints made by Mateiu Caragiale at various moments during his lifetime. Large portions of the diaries kept by Mateiu Caragiale are lost. The transcript made by Perpessicius was criticized for having selectively discarded much content, while originals kept by Rosetti were mysteriously lost during the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941. Additional notes, which notably featured Caragiale's criticism of his father, were preserved for a while by Șerban Cioculescu, before being borrowed to Ecaterina Logadi, Ion Luca's daughter, and never recovered. A significant number of his drawings and paintings, which Vianu assumed had survived by 1936, have also been misplaced.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{banning of}} their paper, the Golos Truda group {{continued}} on, however, and issued a final edition {{in the form of}} a journal, in Petrograd and Moscow in December 1919. During the New Economic Policy period (1921–1928), it released a number of works, including the publication of the <b>collected</b> <b>works</b> of pre-eminent anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin from its bookstore and publishing house in Petrograd between 1919 and 1922. What little anarchist activity the regime tolerated ended in 1929, after the accession of Joseph Stalin, and the bookshops of the Golos Truda group in Moscow and Petrograd were closed permanently amidst an abrupt and violent wave of repression. The newspaper was also suppressed by the Post Office Department in the United States, where it was succeeded by the widely circulated Khleb i Volya (Bread and Freedom), first published on February 26, 1919, which in turn was banned from the United States and Canada for its anarchist position.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Synge visited Italy {{to study}} the {{language}} for a time before returning to Paris. Later that year he met W. B. Yeats, who encouraged him to live {{for a while in}} the Aran Islands, and then return to Dublin and devote himself to creative work. That year he joined with Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory, and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He also wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's Irlande Libre and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent fin de siècle style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his <b>Collected</b> <b>Works.)</b> He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by the noted Celtic scholar Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, {{the film}} was {{released}} on Blu-ray in Japan. Its video format is MPEG-4 AVC and its digitally-remastered audio is improved over that of the DVD, but contains no English audio or subtitle options despite being in Region A format. Years later, a new HD digital remaster was produced and Cagliostro was given a limited theatrical re-release in Japan on 9 May 2014. The remaster was released both individually {{and as part of}} The <b>Collected</b> <b>Works</b> of Hayao Miyazaki, a box set containing all of Miyazaki's movies. Both these newer releases were released by Studio Ghibli in conjunction with Disney. StudioCanal released a Blu-ray and DVD bundle of the film on 12 November 2012 in the UK. The StudioCanal release is of superior quality with its new high definition transfer, but the credits for the film are absent.|$|E
