2500|$|A crystal {{microphone}} or piezo microphone uses {{the phenomenon of}} piezoelectricity—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. An {{example of this is}} potassium sodium tartrate, which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. [...] Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10megohms) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment, and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the {{crystal microphone}} made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the <b>connecting</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At least twelve {{people were}} killed {{as a direct result}} of the fire, and an {{additional}} two Albanian tugboat crewmembers were killed during salvage operations on 30 December when a <b>connecting</b> <b>cable</b> snapped. Eight people were injured in the original incident. Officials stated that one person died after jumping from the burning ship. A 62-year-old Greek man was the first of the fatalities to be recovered. On 30 December the number of people on board the ferry was revised to 499; 487 passengers and 12 crew. The number of people unaccounted for was revised to 179 by Italian authorities. On 1 January 2015 the number of people not accounted for was 98 according to the Italian prosecutor Giuseppe Volpe, but according to the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry 18 people were still missing. [...] On 3 January 2015 Mr. Volpe said that the number of unaccounted persons from the fire was 10 to 15, while Greek authorities said the number was up to 19, [...] including nine Greek men.|$|E

40|$|Using a long, {{flexible}} test <b>cable</b> <b>connected</b> with a one-wire {{voltage feedback}} circuit, a resistive tactile sensor in a shared row-column fashion exhibited flexibility in robotic operations but suffered from crosstalk {{caused by the}} <b>connected</b> <b>cable</b> due to its wire resistances and its contacted resistances. Firstly, we designed a new non-scanned driving-electrode (VF-NSDE) circuit using two wires for every row line and every column line to reduce the crosstalk caused by the <b>connected</b> <b>cables</b> in the circuit. Then, an equivalent resistance expression of the element being tested (EBT) for the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit was analytically derived. Following this, the one-wire VF-NSDE circuit and the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit were evaluated by simulation experiments. Finally, positive features of the proposed method were verified with the experiments of a two-wire VF-NSDE prototype circuit. The experiment {{results show that the}} two-wire VF-NSDE circuit can greatly reduce the crosstalk error caused by the cables in the 2 -D networked resistive sensor array...|$|R

50|$|As {{a signal}} travels from its source to its destination, it can {{encounter}} {{various forms of}} interference and sources of error, so whenever a signal passes through a <b>connecting</b> <b>cable</b> or switch point, it may be degraded. For example, in low current and high resistance applications, unshielded cabling can introduce leakage currents that will degrade measurement accuracy. Unshielded cable can result in noisy readings for low current and high resistance applications, especially if the cabling runs adjacent to equipment generating electromagnetic interference.|$|E
