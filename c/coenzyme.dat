This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the <b>coenzyme</b> in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the <b>coenzyme.</b>|$|E

In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl <b>coenzyme</b> A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E

While the catalytic activities of RNA have been expanding rapidly, a similar strategy for RNA to utilize <b>coenzymes</b> and to increase its functional capabilities {{has yet to be}} demonstrated. A general in vitro transcription procedure has been developed to ef®ciently prepare RNA with <b>coenzymes</b> CoA, NAD and FAD covalently attached to the 5 ¢ end.

This method provides easy access to CoA±, NAD ± and FAD±RNA, which may ®nd broad applications in generating coenzymeutilizing ribozymes. In addition, both oxidized FAD and reduced NADH are highly ¯uorescent. NADH±RNA and FAD±RNA can therefore be used as probes for DNA/RNA detection and for structural investigation of RNA function by ¯uorescence spectroscopy...|$|R
5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this <b>coenzyme</b> to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this <b>coenzyme</b> being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coenzyme</b> NAD {{was first}} {{discovered}} by the British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide <b>coenzyme</b> in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|The main role of NAD in {{metabolism}} is {{the transfer}} of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by {{a large group of}} enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by <b>coenzyme</b> Q. However, these enzymes are also referred to as dehydrogenases or reductases, with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called NADH dehydrogenase or sometimes <b>coenzyme</b> Q reductase.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl <b>coenzyme</b> A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the <b>coenzyme</b> nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important <b>coenzyme</b> {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the <b>coenzyme</b> is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E

5|$|Many catabolic {{biochemical}} processes, such as glycolysis, the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced <b>coenzyme</b> NADH. This <b>coenzyme</b> contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release {{a large amount of}} energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} (NAD) is a <b>coenzyme</b> {{found in}} all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD and NADH respectively.|$|E
5|$|Since coenzymes are {{chemically}} {{changed as}} a consequence of enzyme action, it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes.

(The oxidized <b>coenzymes</b> appear to exist in the same folded structure.) Furthermore, the ribose protons undergo very little conformational change upon reduction of the pyridine ring; this observation strongly suggests a considerable similarity between the folded forms of the oxidized and reduced <b>coenzymes.</b> A model of the folded structure is presented...|$|R

5|$|The {{reaction}} catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of ubiquinol and {{the reduction}} of two molecules of cytochrome c, a heme protein loosely associated with the mitochondrion. Unlike <b>coenzyme</b> Q, which carries two electrons, cytochrome c carries only one electron.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this <b>coenzyme</b> in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|As <b>coenzyme</b> Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the {{membrane}} and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E

The properties of the ADP-Fe 3 + reductase activity were highly consistent with those of the lipid-peroxidation reaction. These observations suggest that electrons from reduced <b>coenzymes</b> are transferred to ADP-Fe 3 + chelate from a component between a mercurial-sensitive site and the rotenone-sensitive one of the NADH dehydrogenase and that the reduction of ADP-Fe 3 + chelate by the NADH dehydrogenase is an essential step in the lipid peroxidation...|$|R

Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester <b>coenzyme</b> A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|From the hydride {{electron}} pair, one electron {{is transferred}} to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a strong reducing agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the <b>coenzyme</b> can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the <b>coenzyme</b> NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two <b>coenzymes,</b> enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective <b>coenzymes,</b> and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both <b>coenzymes</b> in some species.|$|R
