40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} schools exacerbate inequality {{in the digital}} era. Existing educational research argues that one reason social stratification persists is that privileged children develop valued cultural competencies {{as a result of}} class-based differences in parenting. However, we are at a point in history when children, regardless of social origin, develop <b>competencies</b> <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> through online play with peers. Does this mean less privileged children are no longer disadvantaged in their use of <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> at school? I use comparative ethnographic data collected in three middle schools to show how teachers treat students’ online play. Contrary to Bourdieuian perspectives of social reproduction that emphasize the role of parenting in providing students vital resources for educational success, I document the role played by teachers in determining whether kids’ digital play is an educational asset or not. This disciplinary process occurred through teachers’ messages to children about the value of the skills they developed in play online with peers. I find that at a school for mostly wealthy and White children, teachers actively encouraged, if not required, students to communicate online, use social media, and share video game creations as a part of school success. At a school for mostly middle-class and Asian-American children, teachers reprimanded and sanctioned students for the exact same types of activities in favor of traditional learning activities like exams. Lastly, at a school for mostly working class and Latino youth, teachers communicated that online play was irrelevant to achievement, instead emphasizing the development of basic digital skills for twenty-first century vocational work. School-level approaches to kids’ digital play differently enabled the use of digital youth culture for educational success. A likely consequence of this variability in how teachers discipline play is that children were differently prepared for their next steps as students. Only privileged students received training to geek out and mess around <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> tools as part of a learning agenda. Schools provided early training grounds for kids to see learning as either a space to create and share or, instead, simply as only an activity where students were consumers of teachers’ lessons...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} {{revealed}} a high comfort level among students <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> alongside a reasonably similar student comfort level with several uses of <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> for informal learning. The descriptive results of DIL showed {{students are more}} get involved in cognitive learning <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> than other aspects of informal learning, while students {{appear to be more}} inclined to enhance understanding and expand their knowledge of discipline. However, students perform all these informal learning activities with a relatively high engagement of DIL in general. Therefore, using <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> to assist learning in personal informal learning context is more universal, while the shift towards a transformation of learning <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> is inevitable in the informal learning context.|$|R

30|$|Engagement <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> {{has become}} {{a central part of}} students’ daily life. This trend {{suggests}} a transformative way of approaching learning and studying, not only inside but also outside of university. However, <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> are not being fully exploited in education and training systems. In higher education, learners now are expecting more personalized, collaborative and better managed links between formal learning and informal learning (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012; Margaryan, Littlejohn, & Vojt, 2011). Previous educational studies have focused on the implementation of <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> in formal settings, while the investigation of individual constructs on informal learning <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> are limited requiring that this area of research needs to be fully addressed (Chan, Walker, & Gleaves, 2015; Song & Lee, 2014).|$|R

40|$|The idea of "going on {{a digital}} detox" arrives as a {{response}} to a proliferation of <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> and a concern that this addictive form of sociality erodes meaningful or authentic connection. This paper explores concerns about our relationship <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> through a short ethnography of Camp Grounded: a Californian digital detox retreat and summer camp for adults. At Camp Grounded, digital detoxers conceptualise consumption of technology using a food parallel. While the brief connection or "snack" of a text message might temporarily satisfy, detoxers feel that waiting for a more nutritious face-to-face encounter will ultimately be more emotionally nourishing. This paper interrogates the food/technology metaphor to unpack its analytical limitations and the questions it prompts about the future of our relationship <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology...</b>|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to create a model which {{describes}} the main elements for improving schools <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> and helps to reveal differences between schools and identify their best practices and challenges. The innovative digital school model (IDI school) offers a framework for research but also a research-based model for schools to examine their own practices <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies.</b> The model combines previous research on school improvement, creation of innovations, and <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> in education as a special case of innovations and learning as knowledge creation to define six main elements describing an innovative, digital school: visions of the school, leadership, practices of the teaching community, pedagogical practices, school-level knowledge practices and digital resources. The model was applied to investigate three basic education schools. The results indicate that the model worked: we found essential differences between the schools and their best practices and challenges for improvement. It worked particularly well for those elements, which are mainly the responsibility for leadership inside a school. The differences of various elements between schools were not based on socioeconomic background but on the school-level practices. As a conclusion, we suggest that to improve schools <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology,</b> all elements of the model should be included in the evaluation and development process.|$|R
30|$|Most of {{the current}} {{university}} students belong {{to one of the}} two highly technological generations: the “Millennials” (the first generation to grow up <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology)</b> and the “Centennials” (who have never known a world without computers and cell phones, which they were able to fully integrate into their daily lives), both usually described as tech-savvy and highly engaged <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> which they use {{for long periods of time}} and in different combinations. Therefore, digital media consumption and the use of multiple devices apparently does not represent a problem in terms of students’ digital literacy. However, the problem seems to reside in the multitasking effect that results from these multiple uses.|$|R
30|$|Also, {{the nature}} of {{pedagogical}} practices <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> differed between schools. At school A, pupils reported using <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> more than pupils at the other two schools, both {{in the classroom and}} at home for school-related activities. The use focused on general applications and pedagogically ‘advanced’ practices, such as using a virtual learning environment and collaborating via the web. These practices probably helped to improve pupils’ basic digital competence: the regular use of digital tools was an essential condition for competence learning (see also OECD 2011; Aesaert et al. 2015). Furthermore, classroom practices were most advanced at school A and a comparisons of the teachers’ survey answers between the schools indicated that teachers at school A used and believed less in teacher-centred practices <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> than teachers at school C.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the time}} {{adolescents}} spend <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> has sparked wide concerns their use might be {{negatively associated with}} mental well-being, these potential deleterious influences have not been rigorously studied. In line with a preregistered analysis plan, data from {{a representative sample of}} English adolescents (n = 120, 115) provided evidence that the links between digital screen time and mental well-being follow quadratic functions. Further, these results showed that the relations <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> vary as a function of when it is used, suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities involves examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, evidence indicated that moderate <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> use is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world.

40|$|Background/Aims: Use of placebo is {{the ideal}} for {{comparison}} in clinical trials to reduce biases. <b>With</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> being used more frequently in healthcare interventions, how do we determine the placebo effect where interventions exploit technology? If placebo in medicine is traditionally defined {{by a lack of}} pharmacological agents, how might we begin to move towards controlling for effects of <b>digital</b> <b>technology?</b> Method: This paper explores the traditional placebo effect and discusses its impact in healthcare contexts <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> <b>with</b> reference to a particular trial. Different meanings of placebo in the context of evaluating technology suggest new challenges and positive consequences. Results: Methodological considerations are discussed, which enabled the development of a placebo-controlled evaluation of a <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> in healthcare and rehabilitation. Conclusion: Digital placebo was controlled in our trial by employing technology across all groups in the absence of evidence-based practice and shows how to control for unknown and hidden effects of technology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{existence}} of a “digital divide,” or inequalities of access to <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> among different American subpopulations, has been hotly debated and contested since the National Telecommunications and Information Administration first popularized the phrase in 1995. The purpose of this thesis is to critically examine the dominant discourses around the digital divide and articulate the {{existence of}} counterdiscourses to highlight the complexities of access to <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> {{and the implications of}} their various uses by African American college students at Oregon State University. After implementing a multidisciplinary approach incorporating interpretive analysis and ideas from cyberculture studies, using qualitative methods gleaned from cultural anthropology, a more multidimensional picture of the “digital divide” emerged. Early individual experiences <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies,</b> age, and location appeared to have a deeper impact on the students’ relationships <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies,</b> challenging the dominant discourse’s focus on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status as primary determinants of an individual’s lack of access due to their membership in a “disadvantaged population. ...|$|R

40|$|Today’s youngsters {{interact}} <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> to a {{great extent}} which leads scholars to question the influence of this exposure on human cognitive structure. Through resorting to digital nativity assumptions, it is presumed that cognitive architecture of the youth may change in accordance <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> use. In this regard, the current study investigated the relationship between <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> experience, daily media exposure and working memory capacity of so-called digital native participants. A total of 572 undergraduate students responded to self-report measures, which addressed years of experience for 7 different digital devices and the daily time spent for 14 different digital activities. Participants’ working memory capacity was measured through the Computation Span and the Dot Matrix Test. While the former was used to measure the phonological loop capacity, the latter was used to address the visuo-spatial sketchpad capacity. Correlational analyses revealed that neither the phonological loop capacity nor the visuo-spatial sketchpad capacity was related to <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> experience and daily media exposure. Thus, the transformative contribution of <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> experience to human cognitive architecture could not be observed through the current measure...|$|R

40|$|Taught Master's {{students}} have been largely overlooked in research into learners' engagement <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies.</b> This article reports work to redress this imbalance, in which an extended email correspondence was conducted with 23 Master's students. Specifically, it investigates (1) {{the extent to which}} these students start their courses both functionally competent in the use of IT and digitally literate, and (2) the relationship between students' engagement <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> and their experience of transition to postgraduate study in five areas: knowledge and skills, autonomy, 'deeper' learning, enculturation into an academic community, and self-concept. Findings suggest that students may initially be less functionally competent in IT than might be expected, but use these tools in an informed manner. Engagement with a wider range of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> parallels their shift from novice to expert practice and their developing self-concept as researchers; however, non-digital means also remain important in mediating all aspects of transition. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
