Underpricing of Initial Public Offerings in New Zealand: A Comparison of the Fixed Price and Book-Build Methods The paper compares the characteristics of firms that conduct their initial public offering as a book-build with firms that make a traditional fixed price offer. The choice of the type of offer to make appears to be based on gross proceeds. However, there is no <b>clear</b> <b>dollar</b> value that separates the offer types firms choose. While there are clear differences in the characteristics of the companies whose directors chose the alternate offer types there is no difference in underpricing between the two mechanisms. While the result appears inconsistent with prior research, it is argued that because the number of securities that can be allocated is fixed the organising broker needs to increase the level of underpricing to compensate investors for truthfully revealing private information in a book-build. We document evidence consistent with the partial adjustment theory from a jurisdiction with institutional arrangements different from those in which the theory has previously been tested. ...|$|R

The investigation considers the post-crisis era from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2007 and focuses on the five original members of ASEAN (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand) plus Vietnam. Unlike most papers that use classical regression analysis of logarithmic data in first differences to detect the influence of various foreign currencies on particular Asian currencies, this paper considers modern time series analysis more seriously. In particular, this paper finds evidence of cointegration among individual ASEAN currencies {{and some of the}} global currencies, indicating a long-run relationship. Examination of the cointegrating vectors yields four main findings. First, there is a notable absence of a <b>clear</b> US <b>dollar</b> standard. Second, the yen is downright unimportant, suggesting that ASEAN currencies are quite far from a yen standard. Third, ASEAN currencies are also quite far from a euro standard. Fourth, and most surprisingly, the UK pound is very important. These results are at odds with the traditional (short-run) regressions which suggest that ASEAN is on a dollar standard, although it is not a perfect dollar standard because coefficients are not at unity and various other currencies are significant in different equations. Hence, the overall conclusion from this research {{is that there is a}} wide variety of influences on ASEAN exchange rates in both the long run and the short run. This suggests that ASEAN, as a group, is not pursuing - and is in fact not ready for - a global-currency standard. ASEAN, Exchange rate regimes, Dollar standard, Cointegration analysis...|$|R

6000|$|My {{uncle was}} an old traveller--I might almost say, an old resident--in Europe; for he had passed no less than twenty years of his fifty-nine off the American continent. A bachelor, {{with nothing to do}} but {{to take care of a}} very ample estate, which was rapidly {{increasing}} in value by the enormous growth of the town of New York, and with tastes early formed by travelling, it was natural he should seek those regions where he most enjoyed himself. Hugh Roger Littlepage was born in 1786--the second son of my grandfather, Mordaunt Littlepage, and of Ursula Malbone, his wife. My own father, Malbone Littlepage, was the eldest child of that connection; and he would have inherited the property of Ravensnest, in virtue of his birthright, had he survived his own parents; but, dying young, I stepped into what would otherwise have been his succession, in my eighteenth year. My uncle Ro, however, had got both Satanstoe and Lilacsbush; two country-houses and farms, which, while they did not aspire to the dignity of being estates, were likely to prove more valuable, in the long run, than the broad acres which were intended for the patrimony of the elder brother. My grandfather was affluent; for not only had the fortune of the Littlepages centred in him, but so did that of the Mordaunts, the wealthier family of the two, together with some exceedingly liberal bequests from a certain Colonel Dirck Follock, or Van Valkenburgh; who, though only a very distant connection, chose to make my great-grandmother's, or Anneke Mordaunt's descendants his heirs.

5000|$|By 1930, the Daily News {{began working}} with {{television}} broadcasting; a published announcement of March 30, 1930 indicated the equipment would be installed and operable within two months. The video signal was to be sent by the shortwave station W9XAP, while the audio would be broadcast on the normal WMAQ radio frequency. [...] WMAQ did not receive an experimental license from the Federal Radio Commission to operate station W9XAP until September 2, 1930. The first broadcast of the station actually occurred shortly before this was granted, on August 27, 1930. Only those with special receivers-primarily radio stores who had received them from the Daily News-could see the video portion of the broadcast. The station distributed 200 receivers {{in the city and}} suburbs. Those at the dealerships saw and heard Bill Hay, the announcer for Amos 'n' Andy, present a variety-show broadcast from the Daily News Building. The man behind this and other early Chicago television broadcasts was Ulises Armand Sanabria, who 2 years before used the WCFL Navy Pier transmitter to provide the video and radio station WIBO for the audio portions of the broadcast. Both the technical limitations and economic climate of the times brought an end to the station's broadcasts in August 1933. It was the beginning of WMAQ-TV, which would not re-appear until a World War later.On November 1, 1931, the Daily News sold WMAQ to the National Broadcasting Company; the arrangement originally began as NBC becoming a partner in the station with the Daily News. In May of the next year, NBC moved the station from the Daily News Building to the Merchandise Mart, where it had newly completed a broadcasting center in 1930. WMAQ remained there until a 1989 move to the NBC Tower. It {{became a member of the}} NBC Red Network, later known as the NBC Radio Network, and remained affiliated with NBC well into the 1990s, even after the station was sold to Westinghouse Broadcasting.In 1935, WMAQ would once again change transmitter sites - this time to one in Bloomingdale purchased for a <b>dollar.</b> <b>Clear</b> channels were reassigned in 1934, with Illinois losing a frequency and Pennsylvania gaining it. Preserving its clear channel frequency for KYW meant Westinghouse would need to move the station from Chicago. Westinghouse moved KYW east to Philadelphia in late 1934, leaving an unneeded transmitter building and site behind, which is the location of the present transmitter. [...] WMAQ became a 50,000 watt station in 1935; the station had only 5,000 watts of power when purchased by NBC.WMAQ carried original local and network programming. Marian and Jim Jordan started at WLS in 1927 with The Smith Family. They came to WMAQ, doing a local show called Smackout and later would move on to form Fibber McGee and Molly, which was produced at WMAQ from 1935-1939, when the show moved to California. During its first months on the air, Fibber McGee and Molly was distributed over NBC's Blue Network, which meant that in Chicago the program was produced at WMAQ but heard over WLS, one of three NBC Blue Network affiliates in Chicago at the time. Amos 'n' Andy was also a popular program that continued being broadcast from Chicago until 1938, when the program moved to Hollywood. Both of these shows moved production to the new NBC West Coast Radio City.|$|R
40|$|New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s {{seasonal}} workers scheme has {{lessons for}} Australia, writes NIC MACLELLAN OVER {{the last year}} nearly 4000 workers from developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region have travelled to New Zealand on temporary visas, employed as seasonal workers in vineyards and orchards. New Zealand and Pacific governments have hailed the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) program as a great success. Employers can address labour shortages, while Pacific workers have <b>cleared</b> thousands of <b>dollars</b> {{in just a few}} months work after paying their share of travel and administrative costs. But our report Workers for all Seasons?, looking at {{the first year of the}} NZ scheme, shows there are a number of areas where a lack of engagement with unions, the community sector and Pacific diaspora communities has led to significant problems. The first year of the seasonal worker program in New Zealand has highlighted the need for increased effort on welfare services and “pastoral care” for workers. There is also a need to link the scheme to broader development programs in the Pacific islands, to maximise the outcomes of increased remittance flows into rural villages. After a year of operation, 92 companies have been approved as Recognised Seasonal Employers in New Zealand. Nearly 4000 workers from the Pacific and South East Asia have arrived under RSE visas since April 2007, working in the horticulture industry for periods of up to seven months. Thousands more villagers are seeking the chance to travel to New Zealand on temporary visas. A key objective of any seasonal work program is to encourage more remittances to flow into rural communities, to fund children’s education, improve housing or start small businesses. Interviews with workers from the RSE scheme show that there are clear financial benefits: after a few months work, some workers from Vanuatu cleared over 5000 after expenses, at a time when the annual minimum wage for an agricultural worker in Vanuatu is about 300. The early evidence from New Zealand also suggests potential for community links between horticulture regions and districts where workers are recruited. One significant outcome of the RSE program is that communities in Tonga and Vanuatu have coordinated to send a number of workers at a time, encouraging them to commit a portion of their wages to community projects like microcredit schemes for women. But the increased remittances should not overshadow the significant social costs of temporary migration. Seasonal workers are separated from family for months at a time, which can affect children’s welfare and education and put an extra burden on the elderly left in the village. The protection of workers’ entitlements, labour rights and health and safety is a major concern in precarious industries like horticulture, agriculture and construction, which often operate in areas with low union coverage, limited government regulation and a highly casualised, mobile workforce. Breaches of labour rights and workplace safety under Australia’s 457 visas for temporary skilled workers highlight significant challenges for the recruitment of unskilled workers from the Pacific, who have little knowledge of their legal rights in another country. Based on the first year of the RSE program, support services and pastoral care for seasonal workers are the weakest element of the process. Some workers have expressed concerns over poor housing, lack of work at down times (which means no income but ongoing expenses), or employers making unscheduled deductions from their pay. Workers from the Pacific are given preferential access under the RSE scheme, which began in five “kickstart” countries (Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, Kiribati and Tuvalu). But in spite of NZ government ministers stating the scheme will focus on the Pacific islands, more than 20 per cent of RSE workers came from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia or the Philippines (811 of 3923 as of April 2008). This undermines one of the principal justifications for the scheme - that it offers opportunities for development and employment in island nations with restricted economic options. If Australia is to introduce a similar scheme, it will be important to develop clear policy on whether seasonal worker schemes should only be targeted on small island developing states in the Pacific (especially as Australia has political relationships with countries like Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Indonesia that differ from New Zealand’s ties to Polynesia). The Rudd Labor government says it is closely monitoring the NZ program to decide whether Australia should create its own seasonal worker scheme. Prime Minister Rudd is expected make an announcement on the issue at the next meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum in Niue in August 2008. The New Zealand experience shows there must be extensive consultation with unions, churches, welfare and support services before any program starts in Australia. By designing a pilot program that pays more attention to the welfare of Pacific workers and addressing issues of skills training and labour market testing, we can work to avoid Australian workers in rural areas being disadvantaged. • Nic Maclellan is author of Workers for all Seasons? published by the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University.
