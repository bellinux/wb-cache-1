40|$|In {{enlarging}} the field content of pure Yang-Mills theory to a cutoff dependent matrix valued complex scalar field, we construct a vectorial operator, which {{is by definition}} invariant {{with respect to the}} gauge transformation of the Yang-Mills field and with respect to a Stueckelberg <b>type</b> <b>gauge</b> transformation of the scalar field. This invariant operator converges to the original Yang-Mills field as the cutoff goes to infinity. With the help of cutoff functions, we construct with this invariant a regularized action for the pure Yang-Mills theory.

Since the scalar fields flat measure is invariant under the Stueckelberg <b>type</b> <b>gauge</b> transformation, we obtain a regularized gauge invariant path integral for pure Yang-Mills theory that is mathematically well defined.

In a subsequent paper, we construct the virtual fundamental cycle of a compact oriented Kuranishi manifold, and prove some of its basic properties. Manifest from this new formulation {{is the fact that}} [0, 1]-type homotopy L_∞ spaces are naturally Kuranishi manifolds. The former structured spaces naturally appear as derived enhancements of Maurer-Cartan moduli spaces from Chern-Simons <b>type</b> <b>gauge</b> theory.

40|$|Under the {{assumption}} that the color charge can be written in a BRST exact form, the color confinement mechanism proposed by Kugo and Ojima (KO) explains the confinement of any colored particles including dynamical quarks and gluons. This mechanism, however, is known to break down in the Abelian gauge which treats the maximal Abelian subgroup of the gauge group in a special manner. In order to study whether the failure of the KO mechanism is particular only to the Abelian gauge or whether this failure occurs in a wide class of gauges including the ordinary Lorentz <b>type</b> <b>gauge,</b> we carry out a renormalization group study of the SU(2) gauge theory in the gauge fixing space. Our gauge fixing space consists of four distinct regions that are not connected with each other by renormalization group flows, and we find that the Abelian gauge is infrared unstable in three regions which include the Lorentz <b>type</b> <b>gauge.</b> This suggests that the failure of the KO mechanism is a phenomenon which occurs only in the Abelian gauge. We also find that the Lorentz gauge is infrared stable. Comment: 20 pages + 3 figures (not included), phyzzx. te...|$|R

In this Kaluza-Klein formalism we find that general relativity of 4 -dimensional spacetimes can be interpreted in a natural way as a (1 + 1) -dimensional gauge theory.
