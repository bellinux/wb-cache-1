50|$|The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a {{protocol}} used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network. On a local area network, it achieves <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy</b> in the sub-microsecond range, making it suitable for {{measurement and control}} systems.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecoms}} networks two key {{parameters are}} used for measurement of synchronisation performance. These parameters are defined by the International Telecommunication Union in its recommendation G.811, by European Telecommunications Standards Institute in its standard EN 300 462-1-1, by the ANSI Synchronization Interface Standard T1.101 defines profiles for <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy</b> at each stratum level, and by Telecordia/Bellcore standards GR-253 and GR-1244.|$|E
50|$|The <b>accuracy</b> of the <b>clock</b> was {{measured}} on 5 May 2011 {{for a period}} of 3 hours and 22 minutes. The <b>clock's</b> <b>accuracy</b> varied from +10 to -40 seconds, but {{it is very hard to}} make any predictions on the day-to-day <b>accuracy</b> of the <b>clock.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clockmakers {{developed}} their art in various ways. Building smaller clocks was a technical challenge, as was improving <b>accuracy</b> and reliability. <b>Clocks</b> could be impressive showpieces to demonstrate skilled craftsmanship, or less expensive, mass-produced items for domestic use. The escapement {{in particular was}} an important factor affecting the <b>clock's</b> <b>accuracy,</b> so many different mechanisms were tried.|$|R
50|$|The NIST {{team are}} not able to measure clock ticks per second because the {{definition}} of a second is based on the NIST-F1 which cannot measure a more precise machine. However the aluminium ion clock's measured frequency to the current standard is 1121015393207857.4(7)Hz. NIST have attributed the <b>clock's</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{to the fact that it}} is insensitive to background magnetic and electric fields, and unaffected by temperature.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Clock</b> <b>accuracy</b> is {{paramount}} when testing the latency between systems. Any discrepancies will give inaccurate results. Many tests involve locating the publishing node and the receiving node {{on the same}} machine to ensure the same clock time is being used. This isn’t always possible however, so clocks on different machines need {{to be kept in}} sync using some sort of time protocol: ...|$|E
50|$|In 2013 Bathys Hawaii {{introduced}} their Cesium 133 Atomic Watch {{the first}} watch to keep time with an internal atomic clock. Unlike the radio watches described above, which achieve atomic <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy</b> with quartz clock circuits which are corrected by radio time signals received from government atomic clocks, this watch contains a tiny cesium atomic clock on a chip. It {{is reported to}} keep time to an accuracy of one second in 1000 years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{microgravity}} {{environment of}} space allows slowing of atoms to speeds well below {{those used in}} terrestrial atomic clocks, providing for substantial improvement in <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This very accurate space clock will be compared continuously to the SUMO oscillator, and these two clocks (being fundamentally different) will provide a test of [...] "local position invariance." [...] Comparisons between the space and earth clocks will yield a related, but important measurement of the gravitational frequency shift. Finally, the signals conveyed to the ground through the GPS time-transfer system {{will serve as a}} truly international time standard available to anyone on earth.|$|E
5000|$|This caused much {{annoyance}} to both {{residents of}} Hanwell and commuters who passed the tower {{on their way}} to work. Parish's views were seen as 'arrogant' and 'insulting'. Some thought it was a useful reminder of the time (Mr Parish later doubted the <b>clock's</b> <b>accuracy)</b> or a good meeting place. Others defended it as being {{in the style of the}} time [...] "if the clock tower is typical of the thirties, that is how it should be". The Elthorne Ward Labour Group also defended the tower, some members feeling that its removal might herald the construction of an office block.|$|R
50|$|In {{a similar}} manner star occultations by the moon can be observed. By using a digital <b>clock</b> an <b>accuracy</b> of 0.2 second is possible. This {{represents}} only 200 meters at the moon's distance of 385,000 km.|$|R
50|$|Finally, in April 1992, {{all of this}} {{machinery}} {{was replaced}} by a digital device with no moving parts. The (digitized) voice was provided by actress Joke Driessen and the <b>clock's</b> <b>accuracy</b> is maintained by linking it to the German longwave radio transmitter DCF77. To comply with international guidelines limiting double-zero to use as an international prefix, the 002 number was changed on 3 December 1990 to 06-8002, and later to 0900-8002. Even though many people today have access to accurate time displays from digital wristwatches, mobile phones, and computers, the service still receives approximately four million calls a year, especially around New Year's Eve and whenever the clocks change in connection with daylight saving time.|$|R
50|$|Spectracom {{was founded}} in Rochester, New York USA in 1972. Its first product was a WWVB Receiver-Comparator, an {{instrument}} used to calibrate oscillators with traceability to national standards. Other early products included WWVB frequency and time standards which offered atomic <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{at a fraction of}} the cost. This led to widespread use of these products in vital communications networks such as two-way police radio simulcast systems and master clocks for accurate time stamping of data and events within emergency call centers such as 9-1-1 public safety answering points. When GPS signals became publicly available in the 1990s, Spectracom offered its time and frequency products with embedded GPS receivers. These products are known by the registered trademarks Ageless and NetClock, the second being a popular brand of network time servers and master clocks.|$|E
50|$|To meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Ofcom {{spectrum}} mask requirements, femtocells must generate the {{radio frequency signal}} {{with a high degree}} of precision. To do this over a long period of time is a major technical challenge. The solution to this problem is to use an external, accurate signal to constantly calibrate the oscillator to ensure it maintains its accuracy. This is not simple (broadband backhaul introduces issues of network jitter/wander and recovered <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy),</b> but technologies such as the IEEE 1588 time synchronisation standard may address the issue. Also, Network Time Protocol (NTP) is being pursued by some developers as a possible solution to provide frequency stability. Conventional (macrocell) base stations often use GPS timing for synchronization and this could be used, although there are concerns on cost and the difficulty of ensuring good GPS coverage.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{ground station}} {{occupied}} a small Quonset hut. The {{accuracy of the}} ground station measurements was {{a function of the}} ground station master <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Initially a quartz oscillator in a temperature controlled oven was used as the master clock. The master clock was checked daily for drift using a VLF receiver tuned to a US Navy VLF station. The VLF signal had the property that the phase of the VLF signal did not change from day to day at noon along the path between the transmitter and the receiver and thus could be used to measure oscillator drift. Later rubidium and cesium beam clocks were used. Ground stations had number names; for example, Station 019 was McMurdo Station, Antarctica. For many years during the 1970s this station was staffed by a graduate student and an undergraduate student, typically in electrical engineering, from the University of Texas at Austin. Other stations were located at New Mexico State University, the University of Texas at Austin, Sicily, Japan, Seychelles Island, Thule Greenland {{and a number of other}} locations. The Greenland and Antarctica stations saw every pass of every Transit satellite because of their near pole location for these polar orbiting satellites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Running clock {{synchronization}} protocols over packet based networks introduces a considerable challenge, since <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy</b> is highly {{sensitive to the}} network latency behavior. As packet based networks are becoming the common transport for most applications requiring {{clock synchronization}}, accuracy requirements are becoming increasingly stringent. In this paper we introduce a novel approach that uses multiple communication paths between the master and slave clocks to improve the <b>clock</b> <b>accuracy</b> without increasing the total rate of protocol messages. We show that the multi-path approach {{can also be used}} to reduce the time error caused by asymmetric communication paths.

40|$|We {{devise a}} perturbation-immune version of Ramsey's method of {{separated}} oscillatory fields. Spectroscopy of an atomic clock transition without compromising the <b>clock's</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{is accomplished by}} actively balancing the spectroscopic responses from phase-congruent Ramsey probe cycles of unequal durations. Our simple and universal approach eliminates {{a wide variety of}} interrogation-induced line shifts often encountered in high precision spectroscopy, among them, in particular, light shifts, phase chirps, and transient Zeeman shifts. We experimentally demonstrate auto-balanced Ramsey spectroscopy on the light shift prone $^{ 171 }$Yb$^{+}$ electric octupole optical clock transition and show that interrogation defects are not turned into clock errors. This opens up frequency accuracy perspectives below the $ 10 ^{- 18 }$ level for the Yb$^{+}$ system and for other types of optical clocks. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We perform 3 D {{finite element}} {{calculations}} {{of the fields}} in microwave cavities and analyze the distributed cavity phase errors of atomic clocks that they produce. The fields of cylindrical cavities are treated as an azimuthal Fourier series. Each of the lowest components produces clock errors with unique characteristics that must be assessed to establish a <b>clock's</b> <b>accuracy.</b> We describe the errors and how to evaluate them. We prove that sharp structures in the cavity do not produce large frequency errors, even at moderately high powers, provided the atomic density varies slowly. We model the amplitude and phase imbalances of the feeds. For larger couplings, these can lead to increased phase errors. We show that phase imbalances produce a novel distributed cavity phase error {{that depends on the}} cavity detuning. We also design improved cavities by optimizing the geometry and tuning the mode spectrum so that there are negligible phase variations, allowing this source of systematic error to be dramatically reduced.
