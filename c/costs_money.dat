Players can build transportation networks, which include roads, streets, avenues, highways, railways, subway lines, and bus stations. Players can also terraform and plant trees in this mode, but in a much smaller scale than in god mode. Terraforming in this mode <b>costs</b> <b>money.</b> Zones are conducted building plots that are empty at first but then AI controlled buildings pop up in these spaces.|$|E

2500|$|If IVF were {{to involve}} the {{fertilisation}} of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then {{this would not be}} an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time. [...] As a result, the couple must {{decide what to do with}} these extra embryos. Depending on their view of the embryo’s humanity or the chance the couple will want to try to have another child, the couple has multiple options for dealing with these extra embryos. Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen <b>costs</b> <b>money,</b> donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in stem cell research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, tenure {{for school}} {{teachers}} was challenged in a California lawsuit called Vergara v. California. The primary {{issue in the}} case was the impact of tenure on student outcomes and on equity in education. [...] On June 10, 2014, the trial judge ruled that California's teacher tenure statute produced disparities that [...] "shock the conscience" [...] and violate the equal protection clause of the California Constitution. On July 7, 2014, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan commented on the Vergara decision during a meeting with President Barack Obama and representatives of teacher's unions. Duncan said that tenure for school teachers [...] "should be earned through demonstrated effectiveness" [...] {{and should not be}} granted too quickly. Specifically, he criticized the 18-month tenure period {{at the heart of the}} Vergara case as being too short to be a [...] "meaningful bar." [...] It has been argued that sometimes it <b>costs</b> <b>money</b> to fire a bad teacher and that the teacher tenure has only become as a scapegoat law to not go through the process of hearings and documentations.|$|E

2500|$|Increased {{spending}} on disease prevention is often suggested {{as a way}} of reducing health care spending. Whether prevention saves or <b>costs</b> <b>money</b> depends on the intervention. Childhood vaccinations, or contraceptives save much more than they cost. Research suggests that in many cases prevention does not produce significant long-term cost savings. Some interventions may be cost-effective by providing health benefits, while others are not cost-effective. [...] Preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life. On the other hand, research conducted by Novartis argues that the countries that have excelled in getting the highest value for healthcare spending are the ones who have invested more in prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. The trick is to avoid getting patients to hospital, which is where highest healthcare dollars are being consumed. Not all preventive measures have good ROI (EG. Global vaccination campaign for a rare infectious diseases). However, preventive measures such as diet, exercises and reduction of tobacco intake would have broad impact on many diseases and will offer good return of investment.|$|E

50|$|The 95th {{percentile}} {{is a widely}} used mathematical calculation to evaluate the regular and sustained use of a network connection.
