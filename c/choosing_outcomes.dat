40|$|Outcomes {{management}} has received considerable {{attention in the}} literature on mental health services delivery. However, relatively little practical information is available on how to implement an outcomes management system in the mental health care setting. The authors review seven key issues that must be addressed in planning such a system: involving senior organizational leaders in ownership of the project, securing the support of clinicians and patients, selecting personnel to operate the system, <b>choosing</b> <b>outcomes</b> assessment instruments, developing. data collection procedures, selecting techniques for data management, and using the data to improve outcomes. Ultimately, an outcomes management system is intended to generate data {{that can be used to}} stimulate discussion, to guide clinicians in tailoring treatments, and to identify efficient treatment approaches. (Psychiatric Services 48 : 364 - 368, 1997) Outcomes {{management has}} recently received considerable attention as a process for improving the quality and effectiveness of health care (1 - 7). Originally described by Ellwood (8), outcomes management involves the systematic assessment of health outcomes and financial information to improve the delivery of services and quality of care. Outcomes management systems can be used to achieve several organizational objectives such as monitoring processes of care, clinical quality improvement, program accountability, and determination of value. To illustrate how an outcomes management system has been useful in a particular mental health setting, consider th...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{markedly}} different clinical presentations, {{few studies have}} reported differences in neuropsychological functioning between mania and depression. Recent work has suggested that differences may emerge on cognitive tasks requiring affective processing, such as decision-making. The present study sought to compare decision-making cognition in mania and depression in order to clarify the current profiles of impairment for these disorders and to contribute to our more general {{understanding of the relationship}} between mood and cognition. METHODS: Medicated manic patients, depressed patients, and normal healthy controls completed a computerized decision-making task. All subjects were asked to win as many points as possible by <b>choosing</b> <b>outcomes</b> based on variably-weighted probabilities and by placing 'bets' on each decision. RESULTS: Both patient groups were impaired on this task, as evidenced by slower deliberation times, a failure to accumulate as many points as controls and suboptimal betting strategies. Manic, but not depressed, patients made suboptimal decisions [...] an impairment that correlated with the severity of their illness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with a growing consensus that manic and depressed patients are characterized by significant impairments in cognitive and particularly executive, functioning. Furthermore, the distinct patterns of observed impairment in manic and depressed patients suggests that {{the nature and extent of}} cognitive impairment differ between these two groups. Viewed in the context of other recent studies, these findings are consistent with a role for the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in mediating mood-cognition relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{alternative}} outcome {{refers to}} {{the outcome of the}} unselected option in decision-making tasks, which has significant influence on the <b>chosen</b> <b>outcome</b> evaluation. Most paradigms have presented the alternative outcome either after or simultaneous with the <b>chosen</b> <b>outcome,</b> which complicates the observation on the brain activity associated with the alternative outcome. To circumvent this perceived shortcoming, we modified the classic paradigm designed by Yeung and Sanfey (2004) such that the alternative outcome was presented before the <b>chosen</b> <b>outcome</b> in each trial while an electroencephalogram was recorded. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by the positive alternative outcome was larger than that elicited by the negative alternative outcome, suggesting that the participants evaluated the positive alternative outcome as negative feedback. Moreover, the FRN and the P 3 elicited by the <b>chosen</b> <b>outcome</b> were influenced by the valence of the alternative outcome. The current study reveals that the alternative outcome is treated as important information even though it is economically neutral...|$|R

Here we investigated the neuronal basis of relief with functional resonance imaging in a choice task in which the <b>outcome</b> of the <b>chosen</b> option and that of the unchosen option were revealed sequentially. We found parametric activation increases in anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex with increasing relief (<b>chosen</b> <b>outcomes</b> better than unchosen outcomes). Conversely, anterior ventrolateral prefrontal activation was unrelated to the opposite of relief, increasing regret (<b>chosen</b> <b>outcomes</b> worse than unchosen outcomes). Furthermore, the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal activation was unrelated to primary gains and increased with relief irrespective of whether the <b>chosen</b> <b>outcome</b> was a loss or a gain. These results suggest that the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex encodes a higher-order reward signal that lies at the core of current theories of emotion...|$|R
40|$|Decision-making {{forms an}} {{integral}} part of everyday human life. Yet, understanding the processes that govern it {{has proven to be a}} difficult challenge. Historically, economists have suggested that individuals behave in a rational manner, <b>choosing</b> <b>outcomes</b> based on their expected value (EV). However, a number of systematic violations of EV have indicated that this is an inadequate explanation of the complexities involved in decision-making. One important variable that is now known to influence decision-making is affect. However, it is unclear how affective contexts might modulate the neural processes involved in decision-making. The aim of this thesis was to examine the role of affective priors on the event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with risk-taking and feedback processing. Across four studies the probability of reward, the interval between affective priors and subsequent decision-making were manipulated and the EV associated with outcomes was controlled within a simple two-choice gambling task. It was found that transient negative affective priors elicited a rapid neural response differentiating between subsequent risk and safe choices, indexed by a stimulus-locked P 1 /N 1 complex. This component may reflect an automatic orienting of attention to salient stimuli after a negative experience. It is speculated that it may index a general vigilance detection mechanism in the brain. The feedback-related negativity (FRN), a neural correlate of outcome processing, was found to distinguish between good and bad outcomes in positive, but not negative valenced contexts. Furthermore, it was observed that subjective evaluations of outcomes, driven by prior affective states, modulated the FRN in the same way as objective evaluations did. Overall, the thesis demonstrates that affective priors modulate the decision-making process. Specifically, the data suggest that transient affective priors may enhance attentional processes related to choice selection, and sustained negative affect may inhibit the processes involved in the discrimination between good and bad outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Our {{discussion}} so far {{has assumed}} that each agent has quasi-linear utility, meaning that it acts to maximize its valuation vi(ω) for the <b>chosen</b> <b>outcome</b> ω minus the payment pi {{that it has to}} make. Thus, a bidder’s utility is a linear function of the payment made. We have placed no restrictions on payments, other than the minimal conditions that they are nonnegative and no more than the bid bi(ω) agent i made for the <b>chosen</b> <b>outcome.</b> In some important applications, payments are constrained. We first focus on budget constraints, which limit {{the amount of money that}} an agent can pay. Sometimes, there is little need to incorporate budget constraints. In a single-item auction, where we interpret the valuation of an agent as its maximum willingness-to-pay, its valuation is presumably bounded above by its budget. In other applications, especially where an agent might wind up buying a large number of items, budgets are crucial. For example, every keyword auction used in practice asks a bidder for its bid-per-click (e. g., $. 25) and its daily budget (e. g., $ 100). Per-item values and overall budgets model well how many people made decisions in auctions with lots of items, especially when the items are identical. The simplest way to incorporate budgets into our existing utility model is to redefine the utility of player i with budget Bi for outcome ω and payment pi as vi(ω) − pi if pi ≤ Bi − ∞ if pi> Bi. One can of course study smoothed version of this utility function, where there is a cost that is an increasing function of the budget violation. ∗ c© 2013, Tim Roughgarden...|$|R

The present study describes the development and evaluation of the Individualised Outcome Measure (IOM), which is a patient-specific outcome measure to be used for RCTs of complex interventions. IOM was developed using a narrative review, expert consultation and piloting with mental health service users (n= 20).
