40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the cytohistologic {{features}} of cervical <b>condylomas</b> with respect to the presence of associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and to evaluate whether or not the prevalence of virus antigen, as detected by immunologic staining with peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, varies with the histologic appearance of the lesions. In a series of 94 histologically confirmed <b>condylomas</b> of the cervix, almost half (43) had features of CIN grades 1 and 2, corresponding to mild and moderate dysplasia. The prevalence of papillomavirus antigen decreased markedly as the features of associated dysplasia became more severe. The antigen prevalence was 82 % in pure <b>condylomas,</b> 32 % in <b>condylomas</b> with CIN 1, and 0 % in <b>condylomas</b> with CIN 2. The evidence that virus production decreased as the lesion became more severe does not preclude papillomavirus etiology for the CIN lesions. Cells transformed by papillomaviruses may be expected to cease production of virus particles even as they continue to harbor the viral genome...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{papilloma}} viruses (HPV) {{are responsible}} {{for a variety of}} proliferative epithelial lesions including anogenital <b>condylomas.</b> These lesions may regress during treatment with an immune-response modifier such as imiquimod. The release of specific cytokines from the monocyte-macrophage lineage induces a cascade of events abating the HPV replication. METHOD: A total of 14 persistent warty anogenital lesions were excised 4 to 7 weeks after completing a 4 -month imiquimod treatment. Another series of 25 untreated <b>condylomas</b> and 8 bowenoid papulosis served as controls. All examined lesions had been excised in otherwise healthy individuals with a normal immune status. Lesions were examined for the presence of Langerhans cells and subpopulations of the monocyte/macrophage/dendrocyte lineage using immunohistochemical detection of L 1 -protein, CD 68, lysozyme and Factor-XIIIa. CD 45 R 0 -positive T lymphocytes were also identified. HPV capsid antigens and genotypes were searched for using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. RESULTS: The persistent although treated anogenital lesions were identified as 10 viral <b>condylomas,</b> 3 bowenoid papulosis and 1 basal cell carcinoma. The inflammatory cell densities and distributions were similar in the untreated and imiquimod-resistant <b>condylomas</b> with the exception of Factor XIIIa-positive dendrocytes. These dermal dendritic cells were slim and rare in all imiquimod-resistant lesions. In contrast, about two-thirds of the untreated <b>condylomas</b> were enriched in these cells. CONCLUSION: As dermal dendritic cells {{play a role in the}} immune surveillance, their low densities in some lesions might be a key feature responsible for low cytokine local production and failure of imiquimod treatment. The combined apparent lack of Langerhans cell activation might suggest that both intraepidermal and intradermal compartments of antigen-presenting cells are affected in imiquimod-resistant lesions.

40|$|The authors {{examined}} 18 cervical intraepithelial neoplasms (CIN) for {{the presence}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences by Southern blot hybridization and DNA-DNA in situ hybridizations for HPV DNA sequences and compared the epithelial distribution of HPV 16 DNA sequences with HPV 6 / 11 sequences in selected <b>condylomas.</b> Fifteen of the 18 CIN lesions contained HPV 16 DNA as determined by Southern blot hybridization. With the use of biotinylated HPV 16 DNA probes, 10 of the 18 were positive by in situ hybridization, 9 of which were also positive by Southern blot hybridization. In situ hybridization to HPV 16 probes was found primarily in areas of CIN which contained either maturation or koilocytotic atypia, although in two cases hybridizing sequences were detected in superficial cells from epithelium with no discernible maturation. Staining in both <b>condylomas</b> and CIN lesions varied in distribution and intensity. However, in some CIN lesions staining from cell to cell varied considerably. This greater variability in staining appeared to correlate with greater morphologic variations which characterize CIN, and which may influence greater variation in HPV DNA replication. Thus, some differences in patterns of hybridization for HPV DNA between CIN and <b>condylomas</b> may be explained by morphologic differences in the two classes of lesions. Differences in viral gene expression between <b>condylomas</b> and CIN and their relationship to morphologic findings remain to be clarified...|$|R

Aim: To assess the response of the treatment of vulvo-perineal <b>condylomas</b> treated with 5 % Imiquimod and the adverse events arised from its use. Material and methods: The studied population is constituted by 112 patients who presented vulvo-perineal <b>condylomas.</b> Pregnant and HIV positive patients were not included. All of them underwent a complete gynecological study and specifically, cytology, colposcopy, a PCR for HPV and a vulvoscopy to assess the location of the <b>condylomas,</b> size and number of such. Lesions were treated with Imiquimod 5 % in cream at alternate nights. Tests were carried out to verify the results of the treatment at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. The maximum time of application was 16 weeks. Results: The multiple locations were the most common, followed by those ones of the perineal area and the ano-fourchette. The disappearance of <b>condylomas</b> occurred in the highest percentage between 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and 3 months later no lesions were 88. 8 %. 87, 5 % had no lesions at 6 months.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effect of tissue {{specific}} human papillomavirus (HPV) expression {{and its effect on}} local immunity in <b>condylomas</b> from HIV positive individuals. METHODS: Biopsy specimens of eight penile and eight perianal <b>condylomas</b> from HIV seropositive individuals were analysed. Expression of viral genes (HIV-tat and HPV E 7 and L 1) was determined by RT-PCR. The status of local immunity also was determined by RT-PCR by measuring CD 4, CD 8, CD 16, CD 1 a, HLA-DR, and HLA-B 7 mRNA levels in the tissues. Differentiation was determined by measuring involucrin, keratinocyte transglutaminase, as well as cytokeratins 10, 16, and 17. Proliferation markers such as PCNA and c-myc were also determined. RESULTS: The transcription pattern of HPV in perianal <b>condylomas,</b> which preferentially expressed the early (E 7) gene, was different from that of penile <b>condylomas,</b> which primarily expressed the late (L 1) gene. This transcription pattern is in good correlation with the keratinisation and differentiation patterns of the two epithelia: perianal biopsies preferentially expressed K 16 and K 17 while penile warts mainly expressed K 10, markers of parakeratotic and orthokeratotic epithelia, respectively. Perianal biopsies also showed a higher degree of proliferation (PCNA and c-myc). Interestingly, transcription of HIV-tat was also higher in perianal than in penile biopsies. A high degree of local immunodeficiency was observed in perianal biopsies [...] that is, levels of CD 4, CD 16, and CD 1 a mRNAs were significantly lower. A negative correlation between CD 1 a (Langerhans cells) levels and HPV E 7 levels was established. HPV E 7 levels positively correlated with HIV-tat levels. Perianal tissues demonstrated more CD 1 a depression and tat associated HPV upregulation. CONCLUSION: HIV influences the expression of HPV genes resulting in local immunosuppression that might lead to an inappropriate immune surveillance of viral infection. Also, tissue type {{is an important factor in}} controlling viral transcription in a differentiation dependent manner. These findings may explain the higher rate of dysplasia and neoplasia in the perianal area. ...|$|R
