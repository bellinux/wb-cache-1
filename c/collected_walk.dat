40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: The {{kinematics}} of {{the saddle}} and rider have not been thoroughly described at the walk. OBJECTIVE: To describe saddle and rider movements during <b>collected</b> <b>walk</b> {{in a group of}} high-level dressage horses and riders. METHODS: Seven high-level dressage horses and riders were subjected to kinematic measurements while performing <b>collected</b> <b>walk</b> on a treadmill. Movements {{of the saddle}} and rider's pelvis, upper body and head were analysed in a rigid body model. Projection angles were determined for the rider's arms and legs, and the neck and trunk of the horse. Distances between selected markers were used to describe rider position in relation to the horse and saddle. RESULTS: During the first half of each hindlimb stance the saddle rotated cranially around the transverse axis, i. e. the front part was lowered in relation to the hind part and the rider's pelvis rotated caudally, i. e. in the opposite direction. The rider's seat moved forwards while the rider's neck and feet moved backwards. During the second half of hindlimb stance these movements were reversed. CONCLUSION: The saddles and riders of high-level dressage horses follow a common movement pattern at <b>collected</b> <b>walk.</b> The movements of the saddle and rider are clearly related to the movements of the horse, both within and outside the sagittal plane. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The literature suggests that the rider's influence on the movement pattern of the horse is the strongest at walk. For assessment of the horse-rider interaction in dressage horses presented for unsatisfactory performance, evaluations at walk may therefore be the most rewarding. Basic knowledge about rider and saddle movements in well-performing horses is likely to be supportive to this tas...|$|E

These range from providing a means of monitoring construction activities to performing a fundamental role in resolving any disputes. From the literature survey and the informal pilot survey involving interviews with several senior engineers, construction managers and the site in charges that may need to be used to prepare the questionnaire survey for the thesis.

It exists to {{celebrate}} the unique geological heritage of Lyme Regis and the Jurassic Coast and {{to educate the public}} on advances in natural environment research, and especially palaeontology. It is organised by the Lyme Regis Development Trust with major support from the Natural History Museum in London and the Jurassic Coast team. [...] It was the idea of Dr Paul Davis of the Natural History Museum who worked with Marcus Dixon of the Lyme Regis Development Trust and Jo Draper of the Lyme Regis Museum to establish the first one in 2005 and since then it has regularly occurred over the early May Bank Holiday Weekend. The festival includes a wide range of activities run primarily by scientists from the Natural History Museum, various universities, and scientific societies. There are also guided fossil <b>collecting</b> <b>walks,</b> scientific talks, a wide range of stalls run by fossil preparators and collectors, and related art events such as a replica of a Victorian iguanodon.

40|$|Unstable {{footwear}} generally lacks thorough peer-review {{published research}} to support concepts and marketing claims. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the instability induced by four (FitFlop, Masai Barefoot Technology, Reebok Easy-Tone and Skechers Tone-Ups) commercially available unstable sandals and one stable control sandal (Earth) in walking in 15 females (mean ± SD age was 29 ± 6. 7 years, mass 62. 6 ± 6. 9 kg and height 167. 1 ± 4. 2 cm). Three-dimensional motion with synchronised electromyography and kinetic data were <b>collected.</b> <b>Walking</b> speed and step length remained consistent between conditions, however double support time decreased in Masai Barefoot Technology. Centre of pressure data identified no consistent difference between the stable control and the unstable sandals, however Masai Barefoot Technology reduced the anterior–posterior range of centre of pressure. Muscle activity differed significantly at the ankle in the unstable footwear. FitFlop, Reebok and Skechers increased peroneal activity during pre-swing, whereas Masai Barefoot Technology increased medial gastrocnemius and decreased tibialis anterior activity in loading response and mid-stance. The larger rocker sole of the Masai Barefoot Technology altered gait and muscle activation with regard to braking and progression in the sagittal plane. Reebok, Skechers and FitFlop, with softer, less stable foreparts increased evertor action at toe-off, having their effect in the coronal plane.

A call to the Clemson Botanical Gardens about this tree revealed that it was in fact a Royal Paulownia Tree (Paulownia tomentosa), an invasive tree that made its way from its native habitat in China.
