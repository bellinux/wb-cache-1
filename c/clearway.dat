Construction of {{the first phase of}} the final link road, the Eastern Bay Link Road, started on 17 March 2016 and the first of two phases was opened on 16 June 2017. When fully completed, the road will form part of the Cardiff ring road system. The PDR runs west, south and east of Cardiff, with the M4 between junction 30 and junction 33 completing the northern section. The PDR is dual carriageway for its entire length except for Rover Way and the East Moors Viaduct, which is a single carriageway. The entire length of the road has <b>clearway</b> restrictions on it.|$|E

He founded and ran pioneering software companies, including Document.com, later acquired by Merrill, and <b>Clearway</b> Technologies, acquired by Mirror Image Internet. After college, Kriegsman worked for Cognitive Systems, Inc. (started by notable AI researcher Roger Schank), developing large scale rule-based, statistical, and text-processing AI systems. He later integrated those three technologies in a paper he wrote for IEEE. Designing document management systems at Interleaf led him to found his first startup, Document.com.

50|$|In aviation, <b>clearway</b> {{is a term}} {{related to}} the {{dimension}} of some runways and it is abbreviated with CWY. <b>Clearway</b> is an area beyond the paved runway, free of obstructions and {{under the control of}} the airport authorities. The length of the <b>clearway</b> may be included in the length of the takeoff distance available. For example, if a paved runway is 2000 m long and there are 400 m of <b>clearway</b> beyond the end of the runway, the takeoff distance available is 2400 m long. When the runway is to be used for takeoff of a large airplane, the maximum permissible takeoff weight of the airplane can be based on the takeoff distance available, including <b>clearway.</b> <b>Clearway</b> allows large airplanes to take off at a heavier weight than would be allowed if only the length of the paved runway is taken into account.|$|E

5000|$|The new {{timetable}} {{was designed}} to integrate the projects of the Rail <b>Clearways</b> Program, a 2004 plan to divide the network's fourteen metropolitan rail lines into five independent [...] "clearways" [...] by installing extra tracks, passing loops, turnouts and turnbacks at pinch points around the network. By 2013, the Rail <b>Clearways</b> Program was substantially complete, allowing the timetable to be rewritten. At the same time, the delivery of 78 new Waratah trains was almost complete as well. A substantial change introduced by the new timetable was the abolition of Bankstown loop services and most Liverpool via Regents Park services. These changes were made possible by Rail <b>Clearways</b> projects to construct new turnbacks at Homebush and Lidcombe. This allowed {{the operation of the}} Inner West and Bankstown lines to be separated, freeing up capacity between Lidcombe and Homebush for use by other services. However, the changes attracted criticism due to the increased number of interchanges and increase in travel time for passengers for all stations between Carramar/Berala and Birrong.|$|R
