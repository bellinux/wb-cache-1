5|$|William Halliday, like George Pullman, had {{cherished}} {{a desire}} to create a model <b>company</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen {{remained}} {{purely a}} <b>company</b> <b>town</b> until 1989 when utilities, culture and education was separated into Svalbard Samfunnsdrift. In 1993 {{it was sold}} to the national government and the University Centre was established. Through the 1990s, tourism increased and the town developed an economy independent of Store Norske and the mining. Longyearbyen was incorporated on 1 January 2002, receiving a community council.|$|E
5|$|Northern Paiutes {{or their}} ancestors, who were hunter-gatherers, {{have lived in}} the region for {{thousands}} of years. Since the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, cattle ranching and other forms of agriculture have dominated land use in the area. In 1930, logging in the mountains north of Burns {{led to the creation of}} Hines, a lumber <b>company</b> <b>town,</b> and the timber industry remained important to the local economy until the 1990s. In addition to ranching, a variety of private and public enterprises support the Burns–Hines economy in the 21stcentury. Annual events include a migratory bird festival, the county fair, and a country music jamboree.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{settings}} for <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> were where extractive industries — coal, metal mines, lumber — {{had established a}} monopoly franchise. Dam sites and war-industry camps founded other <b>company</b> <b>towns.</b> Since <b>company</b> stores often had a monopoly in <b>company</b> <b>towns,</b> {{it was possible to}} pay in scrip through a truck system. In the Soviet Union there were several cities of nuclear scientists (atomicals) known as atomgrad; particularly in Ukraine those were Pripyat, Varash, Yuzhnoukrainsk among others.|$|R

50|$|Model <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> {{around the}} mid-nineteenth century, such as Copley (1849), near Halifax, and Saltaire (1853), close to Bradford, were {{differentiated}} by improved dwellings for workers which contrasted with working-class housing in other industrial villages and cities. These model <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> prompted {{the creation of}} others, such as Port Sunlight, Bournville and Creswell, within an environment of reform.|$|R
5|$|Ny-Ålesund is a {{permanent}} settlement based entirely around research. Formerly a mining town, {{it is still a}} <b>company</b> <b>town</b> operated by the Norwegian state-owned Kings Bay. While there is some tourism there, Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimize impact on the scientific work. Ny-Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute has outposts at Bjørnøya and Hopen, with respectively ten and four people stationed. Both outposts can also house temporary research staff. Poland operates the Polish Polar Station at Hornsund, with ten permanent residents.|$|E
5|$|Raised by teachers, William Halliday also {{believed}} {{in the value of}} education. One of the original buildings in Hallidayboro, the schoolhouse followed the overall architecture scheme of the village. Nestled at the west end of Main Street, the frame schoolhouse accommodated forty students. Typical of the period, separated entrances for boys and girls appeared under the twin bell towers. It is also likely that Halliday maintained a book collection {{for the use of the}} residents of his <b>company</b> <b>town.</b> In his home city he served on the Cairo Library Board and he endowed the Cairo Library with $5,000.00 in his will. A high degree of literacy existed in Hallidayboro.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of industry, the company still found itself with {{thousands}} of acres of land that could be developed. William M. Ladd, who had succeeded Reed as President of Oregon Iron and Steel and his father as President of Ladd & Tilton Bank, formed the Ladd Estate Company to manage these real estate assets. The newly formed Ladd Estate Company converted the depressed <b>company</b> <b>town</b> into a prestigious suburb complete with country club, golf course, polo field, and even worked to rename the harsh-sounding Sucker Lake to Oswego Lake. The company existed as a shell until 1960, when in its final act, it deeded its powerhouse and dams to lake shareholders.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1970s, the {{communities}} of Onaping Falls were <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> with no direct municipal government.|$|R
5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned <b>company</b> <b>town</b> in Pará, Brazil. This {{was part of a}} large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining <b>company</b> <b>town</b> by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach the North Pole by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have accomplished this. On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution, the River Beal was used to power large weaving mills. Within one {{generation}} during the late-19th century, and following a boom in nearby Oldham, Milnrow's staple industry changed from wool weaving to cotton spinning. Soon, distinctive rectangular brick-built mills dominated Milnrow's landscape. Milnrow, the location of some of the earliest ring spinning companies, had many of the characteristics of a <b>company</b> <b>town.</b> The Heaps of Milnrow exercised significant deferential and political influence in the local area. Following the Great Depression, the region's textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid-20th century. Milnrow's last cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill, demolished in the late 1990s. Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area, making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable. Milnrow Metrolink station opened as part of Greater Manchester's light-rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013.|$|E
50|$|Sugar {{workers on}} {{plantations}} in Cuba {{and elsewhere in}} the Caribbean lived in <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> known as bateyes.|$|R
50|$|Sayre, Pennsylvania and Atlanta, Georgia {{were among}} the American <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> created by railroads in places where no {{settlement}} already existed.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{accessibility}} {{of the working class}} to private transport also marked a step of equality as they had previously only been accessible to the wealthy. As access to surrounding municipalities increased, residents of <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> gained access to an increasing amount of government-funded public resources such as schools, libraries, and parks. Accordingly, there was no longer a need for the amenities of <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> which, prior to welfare capitalism, had previously been unattainable to the working class.|$|R
5|$|TCI was {{not fully}} {{incorporated}} into U. S. Steel, {{and continued to}} operate as an extremely profitable subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new <b>company</b> <b>town,</b> and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new coking coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new steel mills and rail links. Several rolling mills were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill. In 1923 a merchant steel mill was completed, followed by the opening of a sheet products mill in 1926.|$|E
25|$|The town {{agent was}} in charge of the <b>company</b> <b>town.</b> The town agent oversaw {{departments}} including street and building maintenance, gas and water works, and fire protection. The town agent also oversaw businesses including the hotel, sewage farm, as well as the nursery and greenhouse. Under the town agent there were nine department heads and approximately 300 men under them. All <b>company</b> <b>town</b> officials were selected by Pullman. There were no elections in the <b>company</b> <b>town</b> besides elections for the school board.|$|E
25|$|George Pullman {{announced}} {{his plan to}} build a <b>company</b> <b>town</b> along with a factory in late April 1880. Three years prior, the United States underwent the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. The strike forced businessmen, like Pullman, to take the feelings of their employees into consideration. Pullman’s objective in building a <b>company</b> <b>town</b> was to attract a superior type of employee and elevate his employees through the exclusion of baneful influences. Pullman also expected the rents on the houses in the <b>company</b> <b>town</b> to make a return of 6 percent on its investment. This was never realized. The rents of the houses in the <b>company</b> <b>town</b> only made a return of 4 ½ percent on investments.|$|E
50|$|Although {{many small}} <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> existed in mining areas of Pennsylvania before the Civil War, {{one of the}} largest, and most {{substantial}} early <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> in the United States was Pullman, developed in the 1880s just outside the Chicago city limits. The town, entirely company-owned, provided housing, markets, a library, churches and entertainment for the 6,000 company employees and {{an equal number of}} dependents. Employees were required to live in Pullman, although cheaper rentals could be found in nearby communities.|$|R

2500|$|These {{companies}} were very paternalistic. <b>Company</b> <b>towns</b> (colloquially {{referred to as}} [...] "coal patches") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.|$|R
25|$|During the Panic of 1893, Pullman {{closed his}} {{manufacturing}} plant in Detroit {{in order to}} move all manufacturing to the <b>company</b> <b>town.</b> Wages were reduced and employees were laid off, but the costs of utilities remained unchanged. On May 11, 1894, the employees of the Pullman Co. walked off the job and initiated the Pullman Strike. The Pullman Co. had reduced wages, but not the rents on housing. 30 people were killed {{as a result of the}} strikes and sabotage. After the strike, the <b>company</b> <b>town</b> was not the same. The strike resulted in the loss of pride for the <b>company</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 1904, the Pullman Company was {{mandated}} {{to sell the}} <b>company</b> <b>town</b> by court order. Despite this, the Pullman Company did not sell the <b>company</b> <b>town</b> until 1907. Today, Pullman is a Chicago neighborhood, and a historical landmark district on the state, National Historic Landmark and National Register of Historic Places lists.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Steel's Fairless Works near Morrisville, Pennsylvania {{were named}} for him. U.S. Steel also {{developed}} a <b>company</b> <b>town</b> near the steel plant, which it named Fairless Hills in his honor.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} nineteenth century, model <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> materialised, as enlightened {{industrialists}} recognised that many poor workers were living in appalling conditions. These industrialists wished to combat the unsanitary and congested conditions common to working class districts {{in order to create}} better living conditions for workers. Model <b>company</b> <b>towns</b> such as Port Sunlight (1888) and Bournville (1895) were influential in regards to their building and planning innovation. The ideas generated from these model towns are regarded as having a significant influence on the Garden City movement.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{conditions}} in <b>company</b> <b>towns,</b> the Manly report observed that they displayed [...] "every aspect of feudalism except {{the recognition of}} special duties {{on the part of}} the employer." ...|$|R

25|$|Another of Ybor’s {{modifications}} to the <b>company</b> <b>town</b> model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) <b>company</b> <b>town.</b> To {{increase the number of}} jobs (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar workers and other cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few were willing to take the risk of moving to and buying a home in a new place that might not last.|$|E
25|$|Ybor {{had moved}} his cigar-making {{operation}} from Cuba to Key West, Florida, in 1869, due to political {{turmoil in the}} then-Spanish colony. But, labor unrest {{and the lack of}} room for expansion had him looking for another base of operations, preferably in his own <b>company</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
