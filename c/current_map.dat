Beck did actually draw versions with other formats, 22½ degrees rather than 45 (the Paris Métro version uses 22½ degrees as a base); and an unused version for the 1948 Olympic Games.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{alterations}} {{have been}} made to the map over the years. More recent designs have incorporated changes to the network, such as the Docklands Light Railway and the extension of the Jubilee line. It has also been expanded to include routes brought under Transport for London control such as TfL Rail, and to indicate which Tube stops connect with National Rail services, links to airports, and River Services. In some cases, stations within short walking distance are now shown, often with the distance between them, such as 's distance from [...] (this is an evolution of the pedestrian route between Bank and Monument stations, which was once prominently marked on the map). Further, step-free access notations are also incorporated in the <b>current</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E

40|$|ZnO {{nanostructures}} {{are promising}} {{candidates for the}} development of novel electronic devices due to their unique electrical and optical properties. Here, we present a complementary electrical characterization of individual upright standing and lying ZnO nanorods using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). Initially, the electrical properties of the arrays of upright standing ZnO NRs were characterized using two-dimensional <b>current</b> <b>maps.</b> The <b>current</b> <b>maps</b> were recorded simultaneously with the topography acquired by contact mode AFM. Further, C-AFM was utilized to determine the local current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the top and side facets of individual upright standing NRs. Current-voltage characterization revealed a characteristic similar to that of a Schottky diode. Detailed discussion of the electrical properties is based on local I-V curves, {{as well as on the}} 2 D <b>current</b> <b>maps</b> recorded from specific areas. © 2011 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The Compressed Sensing (CS) sampling theory has been combined with the Light Beam Induced Current (LBIC) method, to produce an alternative <b>current</b> <b>mapping</b> technique for photovoltaic (PV) devices. Compressive sampling of photocurrent is experimentally implemented using a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD). The main advantage of this new method for <b>current</b> <b>mapping</b> is that measurement time can be significantly reduced compared to conventional LBIC measurement systems. This is achieved mainly by acquiring fewer measurements than a raster scan would need and by utilizing the fast response of the micro-mirror array. Two different experimental layouts are considered in this work. The first is a small area optical set-up based on a single wavelength laser source. The second layout utilizes a commercial Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector through which compressive sampling is applied. Experimental results with both experimental schemes demonstrate that <b>current</b> <b>maps</b> can be produced with less than 50 % of the measurements a standard LBIC system would need. The ability to acquire <b>current</b> <b>maps</b> of individual cells in encapsulated modules is also highlighted. The advantages and drawbacks of the method are presented and its potential to significantly reduce measurement time of <b>current</b> <b>mapping</b> of PV cells and modules is indicated...|$|R
