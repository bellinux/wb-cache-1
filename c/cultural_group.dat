5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other <b>cultural</b> <b>group</b> which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or <b>cultural</b> <b>group</b> and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that in-group favoritism arises endogenously, through the {{formation}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>groups.</b> Symbolic markers in certain conditions can result in trivial groupings developing into <b>cultural</b> <b>groups.</b> The formation of such <b>cultural</b> <b>groups</b> then results in {{a higher degree of}} in-group favoritism.|$|R
40|$|Intercultural interaction” {{refers to}} the {{behavior}} (including, but not limited to, verbal and nonverbal communication) that occurs when members of different <b>cultural</b> <b>groups</b> engage in joint activity. Such a definition raises a number of questions, including how to distinguish different <b>cultural</b> <b>groups</b> and what interaction entails. Traditionally nationality or ethnicity has been taken as the criterion for distinguishing <b>cultural</b> <b>groups,</b> {{but in fact the}} situation is much more complex than this. We are all members of multiple different <b>cultural</b> <b>groups</b> (e. g., professional, organizational, religious), each of which can be said to have its own culture in terms of values, norms, and patterns of behavior. So what then counts as “intercultural” interaction...|$|R

5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and <b>cultural</b> <b>group</b> that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

25|$|History {{has better}} words {{to speak for}} Misamis Occidental.

As the Subanon retreated {{deeper and deeper into}} the interior, the coastal areas became home to inhabitants from Bukidnon who were steadily followed by settlers from nearby Cebu and Bohol.|$|E
25|$|Early man {{entered the}} area south of Lake Michigan after the glaciers retreated around 15,000 years ago. As the glaciers receded, {{people began to}} move into the area. The {{earliest}} people recorded in Indiana are the Early Paleoindians. No sites have been found in the dunes. During the period of this <b>cultural</b> <b>group,</b> the dunes area had just emerged from beneath the continental glaciers. The landscape was not conducive to the existence of the animals upon which the Early Paleoindian culture depended. A few scattered Late Paleoindian artifacts have been found on the higher and older ridges in the dunes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of 19th century, Bengali {{literature}} gained momentum. During this period, the Bengali Pandits of Fort William College did the tedious work of translating the text books in Bengali to help teach the British some Indian languages including Bengali. This work {{played a role in}} the background in the evolution of Bengali prose. In 1814, Raja Ram Mohan Roy arrived in Calcutta and engaged in literary pursuits. Translating from Sanskrit to Bengali, writing essays on religious topics and publishing magazines were some the areas he focussed on. He established a <b>cultural</b> <b>group</b> in the name of 'Atmiya Sabha' (Club of Kins) in 1815. Another significant contributor of Bengali literature in its early stage was Ishwar Chandra Bandyopadhyaya.|$|E
25|$|Rochester {{was founded}} {{shortly after the}} American Revolution by a wave of English-Puritan descended {{immigrants}} from New England who were looking for new agricultural land. They would be the dominant <b>cultural</b> <b>group</b> in Rochester for over a century. On November 8, 1803, Col. Nathaniel Rochester (1752–1831), Maj. Charles Carroll, and Col. William Fitzhugh, Jr. (1761–1839), all of Hagerstown, Maryland, purchased a 100-acre (ca. 40 ha) tract from the state in Western New York along the Genesee River. They chose the site because its three cataracts on the Genesee offered great potential for water power. Beginning in 1811, and {{with a population of}} 15, the three founders surveyed the land and laid out streets and tracts. In 1817, the Brown brothers and other landowners joined their lands with the Hundred Acre Tract to form the village of Rochesterville.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} that European contact with Newfoundland {{began in the early}} 16th century, the Beothuk were the only {{indigenous}} group living permanently on the island. Unlike other groups in the Northeastern area of the Americas, the Beothuk never established sustained trading relations with European settlers. Instead, their trading interactions were sporadic, and they largely attempted to avoid contact in order to preserve their culture. The establishment of English fishing operations on the outer coastline of the island, and their later expansion into bays and inlets, cut off access for the Beothuk to their traditional sources of food. In the 18th century, as the Beothuk were driven further inland by these encroachments, violence between Beothuk and settlers escalated, with each retaliating against the other in their competition for resources. By the early 19th century, violence, starvation, and exposure to tuberculosis had decimated the Beothuk population, and they were extinct as a <b>cultural</b> <b>group</b> by 1829.|$|E
