50|$|Polymers are {{chemical}} compounds {{made up of}} a large number of identical components linked together like chains. They are an important part of materials science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are really the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene, nylons, polyesters, acrylics, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates and also rubbers which have been around are natural <b>rubber,</b> styrene-butadiene <b>rubber,</b> <b>chloroprene,</b> and butadiene <b>rubber.</b> Plastics are generally classified as commodity, specialty and engineering plastics.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} blend ratio on {{properties}} of <b>chloroprene</b> rubber/natural <b>rubber</b> (CR/NR) blends was investigated. In {{addition to the}} mechanical properties, attention was also given to the resistance to thermal aging, oil and ozone of the blends. Silica was selected as a reinforcing filler in this study due to its unique characteristic to interact with CR. The results reveal that, due to the better filler dispersion and the greater crosslink density, the silica-filled CR possesses lower compound viscosity and better mechanical properties, compared to the silica-filled NR. The aging properties, oil and ozone resistance of the silica-filled CR are also significantly better {{than those of the}} silica-filled NR. The mechanical properties and the resistance to degradation of the silica-filled CR/NR blends are mainly governed by the blend morphology. It is found that good mechanical properties in association with adequately high resistance to degradation from thermal aging and oil are obtained when CR remains the matrix in the blends. Even though the ozone cracks are found in all blends, a thorough look at the results reveals that considerable improvement in ozone resistance is achieved with increasing CR content...|$|R

Theprocess comprises a mixture of a natural rubber with, (a) halogenated free flame retardant agent (zinc hydroxystannate;STORFLAM ZHS) and (b) halogenated flame retardant agent (decabromodiphenyl; Great Lake DE- 83 R and chlorinatedparaffins; Plastoil 152) and another material like antimony trioxide and aluminium hydroxide in appropriate amount, with ratio of halogenated flame retardant agent: antimony trioxide 3 : 1. In the resulting product with halogen flame retardant showed a more efficient flame retardant property than halogen free flame retardant, i. e. brominated flame retardant provide higher efficiency than chlorinated and ZHS, respectively. The minimum requirement ratio for being flame retardant of antimonytrioxide: brominated or chlorinated agent is 7 : 21 or 10 : 30 phr while aluminium hydroxide: ZHS is 10 : 150 phr.

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} of the work {{was to determine the}} resistance of selected protective clothing and glove materials to permeation of cytostatics such as docetaxel, fluorouracil, and doxorubicin. Material and Methods The following glove materials were used: natural rubber latex (code A), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (code B) and <b>chloroprene</b> <b>rubber</b> (code C). In addition, we tested a layered material composed of a non-woven polyester (PES), a polypropylene (PP) film, and a non-woven PP used for protective coats (code D). The cytostatics were analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The tested samples were placed in a purpose-built permeation cell modified to be different from that specified in the standard EN 6529 : 2001. Results The tested materials were characterized by good resistance to solutions containing 2 out of the 3 selected cytostatics: doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil, as indicated by a breakthrough time of over 480 min. Equally high resistance to permeation of the third cytostatic (docetaxel) was exhibited by natural rubber latex, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, and <b>chloroprene</b> <b>rubber.</b> However, docetaxel permeated much more readily through the clothing layered material, compromising its barrier properties.

However, the slurry wear rate of the NR and CR vulcanizates did not change significantly, even with changes in the concentration of acid and the immersion time in both HCl and NaCl solutions; the fluid decreased the friction between the abrasive paper and the specimen.
