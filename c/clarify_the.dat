The Ministry was liable to the Party, the state, and the people. The Ministry's main goal was to strengthen socialist legality {{and the rule of}} law within Soviet judicial institutions.|$|E

5|$|Banksiamyces is {{classified}} in the Helotiaceae, a widespread but poorly known family of fungi, many species of which are saprobic on herbaceous or woody tissues. The placement in the Helotiaceae is tentative, and no molecular analysis has yet been performed that might <b>clarify</b> <b>the</b> phylogenetic relationships of Banksiamyces to other taxa in the Helotiales order. Based on physical similarity, Wen-Ying Zhuang included Banksiamyces under Encoelia in his 1998 study of the Encoelioideae subfamily of the Helotiaceae. He conceded, however, {{that he had not}} examined any specimens.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, a phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{nuclear and}} mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences helped to <b>clarify</b> <b>the</b> phylogeny of Calostoma. Using the species C.cinnabarinum and C.ravenelli as representative examples, the research showed the genus evolutionarily {{related to the}} monophyletic Boletales clade, and separate from clades containing most of the gilled mushrooms, puffballs, stalked puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns and non-bolete Gasteromycetes. Calostoma belongs to the suborder Sclerodermatineae in the Boletales order. The Boletales comprise the following genera: Boletinellus, Calostoma, Gyroporus, Phlebopus, Pisolithus, Scleroderma, and Veligaster. Calostoma {{is thought to have}} diverged evolutionarily from the other Boletales between 52–115 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the subject of {{subsequent}} studies seeking to <b>clarify</b> <b>the</b> relationships within Mentheae. Further research combined palynological analysis of pollen grains with rbcL sequencing to provide additional support for the relationship between Perovskia and Salvia clade I. It also distinguished between P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides, while confirming their close relationship. A subsequent multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram, making Rosmarinus a sister group to Perovskia.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Tribunal in 1994, only one constitutional reference has been made to it. Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995 arose from the issue of the application of Article 22H(1) of the Constitution in relation to Article 5(2A), which was and is still not yet in force. The matter was referred by President Ong Teng Cheong to <b>clarify</b> <b>the</b> scope of the application of both Articles. The Government was represented by Chan Sek Keong and Soh Tze Bian of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and the Presidency by Joseph Grimberg and Walter Woon.|$|E

This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and <b>clarify</b> <b>the</b> taxonomy of the genus. The {{results indicate that}} S.spraguei is most closely related to S.decipiens. The species S.granulatus and S.placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S.spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E
5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar {{in some ways}} to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped <b>clarify</b> <b>the</b> earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E

5|$|The Organic Laws were {{drafted by}} a {{legislative}} committee on May 16, 1843 and June 28, 1843, before being adopted on July 5.

This constitution-like document divided the government into three departments: a judiciary branch, an executive branch, and a legislature. The definition of the executive branch had previously been modified, in late 1844, from a three-person committee to a single governor; this change took effect in 1845.|$|E
