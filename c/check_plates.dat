40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle nuts, retaining washers, locking washers, serrated washers, <b>check</b> <b>plates,</b> disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|E

It {{is essential to}} have an updated DTM (Digital Terrain Model) of the entire airport area for viewing and creating a land registry of aeronautical obstacles {{in order to proceed}} to the design of flight plans. By means of georeferenced stereo pairs of high resolution satellite images it is possible to build DTM on wide areas. For high traffic load airports, runways, taxiways and aprons maintenance is a critical task. A Pavement Management System requires periodic monitoring activities to control structural and geometrical characteristics, with the aim of ensuring the infrastructure functionality. Surface regularity, runway slope, plates planarity and reciprocal asset, are among the most relevant parameters, on which has been investigated in this note. A very high level of accuracy is required and {{it has been shown that}} the TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanner) is a very precise and efficient tool. The note summarizes the results of the processing of both high resolution satellite images (acquired on Trinidad and Tobago airport area) and of data acquired by TLS on the pavement of an international airport. Four Pleiades stereo pairs, with 0. 5 m spatial resolution, have been georeferenced by GPS and processed to produce a grid DEM (1 m step) Scans obtained by TLS on a runway segment have been co-registered and georeferenced. From the point clouds, a very dense DTM has been obtained, which allowed the extraction of longitudinal and transversal profiles. The linear fit of the profiles produces the gradients, which were compared with the required standards. On the same airport, a concrete apron was surveyed by TLS.

Handwritten numeral recognition approach is used in many fields like bank <b>checks,</b> car <b>plates,</b> ZIP code recognition, mail sorting, reading of commercial forms etc. This paper presents a technique to recognize handwritten numerals, taken from different pupils of different ages including male, female, right and left handed persons. 340 numerals were collected from 34 people for sample creation. Conjugate gradient descent back-propagation algorithm (CGD-BP) is used for training purpose. CGD-BP differs from primary back-propagation algorithm {{in the sense that}} conjugate algorithms perform line search along different directions which produce faster convergence than primary back-propagation.

Methods and Results: Single cells were obtained using 1 / 2 dilution series in microtitre plates. Seventy-two Lactococcus lactis dilution series were <b>checked</b> by <b>plate</b> counting. When the last five columns of the plates were observed, the chance of having one single cell was 80 %, while the yield was 75 wells containing cells. A simulation model confirmed these results.
