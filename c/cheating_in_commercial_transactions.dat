40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the article is to present {{economic}} and legal aspects of payment backlogs <b>in</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions.</b> <b>In</b> terms of economic aspects, the study focuses on the structure and cycle diversity of corporate receivables, payment terms and the scale of losses caused by late payments in the chosen European countries. The analysis {{was based on the}} data presented in the reports of the multinational information agency Intrum Justitia. The study shows that paying credibility in European countries is strongly diversifi ed. The most reliable and favourable situation regarding the analysed aspect should be enjoyed by the Scandinavian countries, Finland, Island and Switzerland. In turn, the least stable situation and gravest problems relating paying credibility occurred in the Southern European countries, especially in Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Croatia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania and Cyprus. The legal aspects of the payment backlogs were analysed on the ground of both EU and domestic law. The brief characteristics of both Directive 2000 / 35 /EC of 29. 6. 2000 on combating late payment <b>in</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions</b> and Directive 2011 / 7 /EU of 16. 02. 2011 on combating late payment <b>in</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions</b> was presented <b>in</b> the article.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the conception of}} gharar, which is generally translated as either risk or uncertainty, <b>in</b> post-formative Islamic <b>commercial</b> law. According to Muslim jurists, gharar arises from uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions.</b> However, unlike {{other areas of the}} Islamic intellectual tradition in which uncertainty engenders errors, the uncertainty associated with gharar enables jurists and counterparties to make informed legal and financial decisions. Nevertheless, gharar is not structurally a form of certainty. In order to understand this interesting paradox and reach a better understanding of representation in general, this study employs discourse analysis to trace the concepts, reasoning methods, and descriptive techniques that Ibn H 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;azm (d. 1064), B 2 ̆ 6 amacr;j 2 ̆ 6 imacr; (d. 1081), Sh 2 ̆ 6 imacr;r 2 ̆ 6 amacr;z 2 ̆ 6 imacr; (d. 1083), Sarakhs 2 ̆ 6 imacr; (d. 1090), Ibn Qud 2 ̆ 6 amacr;ma (d. 1223), and Ibn Rushd (d. 1261) use in order to represent gharar. First, this study details how jurists conceptualize the types of uncertainty that engender gharar <b>in</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Second, it examines the ways that jurists employ these forms of uncertainty to analyze <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions.</b> This study demonstrates that gharar arises from a privation of thought. This privation mimics the relationship between the identity of thought and referent that produces certainty. Gharar thus indicates how knowledge creates and subsumes uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|In the Republic of Macedonia, the {{legislator}} {{has tried}} {{to solve the problem}} of late payment <b>in</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions</b> by enacting the Financial Discipline Act. The justifications for enacting this Act were the illiquidity of the business sector and the implementation of the EU Directive on combating late payment <b>in</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Yet, the Act includes several differences in comparison to the regime envisaged in the Directive. The time limits governing the performance of monetary liabilities in transactions between economic operators (undertakings) are identical with those in the EU Directive; however, the Act does not regulate payment in installment and does not provide for an extension of time limits unless expressly agreed. On the other hand, public authorities have a few privileges: time limits for <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions</b> between public authorities and economic operators are identical with the time limits for transactions between economic operators (whereas in the Directive time limits for public authorities are shorter); contracts on perennial procurement are exempt from compliance with this Act; and particular categories of public authorities should comply with the general time limits for <b>commercial</b> <b>transactions</b> as of 1 January 2016. Additionally, considering the prescribed misdemeanor sanctions applicable in cases where the debtor has failed to pay within the prescribed time limits, the purpose of the Financial Discipline Act remains unclear.
