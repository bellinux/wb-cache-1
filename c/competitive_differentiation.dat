40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between practices of quality management (QM) and the characteristics of organizational design, and QM and competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a partial least squares approach to test these relationships in 350 hotels in Spain. Findings – The findings show that QM influences specialization, formalization and interdepartmental interactions, and that QM practices influence both cost and <b>differentiation</b> <b>competitive</b> advantage. The results also indicate the importance of QM strategic and operational systems as practices that have a key impact on the characteristics of organizational design. Similarly, the QM operational system is key in the relationship between QM and cost competitive advantage. Finally, the QM operational, information and strategic systems positively influence <b>differentiation</b> <b>competitive</b> advantage. Practical implications – When hotels adopt QM practices, there will be significant changes in a number of organizational variables, including specialization, formalization and interdepartmental interactions. This paper provides empirical evidence that QM practices improve both cost and <b>differentiation</b> <b>competitive</b> advantage in the hotel industry. Originality/value – There has been little research on the effects of QM on organizational design in the hotel industry. The contribution of this paper is that analyze the effects of QM on organizational design and competitive advantage, extending knowledge about these issues in a specific sector.

It needs to be noted that there isn't {{a specific set of}} rules or steps to follow as companies (in their various industries) will have different strategies.

Hence why businesses want to offer a better experience to their customers and want to manage this process efficiently. In order to gain success as a business customers need to be understood.

40|$|The brand {{behind the}} garment {{is what gives}} the product popularity, {{relevance}} to the consumer, and overall profitability. As time passes, markets are becoming flooded with more brands that inherently provide the commodities. As a result, fashion marketers must put more time and investment into stipulating ways for which their brand can reach a select target consumer and enhance repeat purchase intentions with their <b>competitive</b> <b>differentiations.</b> As their efforts engage, an experiential perspective emerges in the fashion industry. By comparing fashion brands and their different distribution channels, the objectives {{of this study are}} to identify consumers’ perceptions of fashion brand experience dimensions and experience types, and to investigate the effect of brand experience dimensions and types on brand resonance. Upon extending Schmitt and Brakus, Schmitt, and Zarantonello’s experience dimensions and types, in conjunction with Keller’s brand resonance model, 12 out of 20 hypotheses confirm the significant impact of consumers experiences on brand resonance by analyzing the data (n = 374) from a university in the United States. Sensory and affective experiences are primary factors for establishing fashion brand association, while cognitive and relational driven experiences lead to establishing fashion brand loyalty. Sensory, affective, and relational experiences affect both product and store type experiences, while only product experience affects brand resonance. With the depiction of different brand effects, this study concludes that while Forever 21 may focus on relational experiences with the consumer, Gap utilizes positive cognitive experiences to develop a link to brand loyalty and fashion product reliability...|$|R

Brand extensions are used by companies across various industries for <b>competitive</b> <b>differentiation.</b> But {{in the era of}} hyper competition, a successful differentiation strategy requires that a brand emphasizes on uniqueness rather than commoditization. In this article, we make a case for creating a meaningful differentiation strategy. We emphasize the role of brand extensions for <b>competitive</b> <b>differentiation</b> and highlight the main perils of using brand extensions as a primary differentiation strategy. By using qualitative research, we identify primary objectives for brand extensions in practice. This investigation uses in-depth interviews with 14 senior brand managers across various industries to highlight brand portfolio strategies in relation to the brand differentiation strategy. Findings reveal that for business {{at the base of the}} pyramid, in markets such as Romania, brand managers are using brand extensions to increase sales or to boost short-term revenue rather than to implement a coherent differentiation strategy. We conclude with multiple recommendations for improving brand extension usage as a strategic instrument for creating meaningful differentiation in the era of hyper competition...|$|E

30|$|Whether {{the pattern}} of {{resource}} utilization detected arises from an ecological process, such as competition, is unclear until a comparative study of patterns is carried out to understand processes that underlie the community structure (MacNally 1983; Bell 2001). Under the classical niche paradigm, i.e., <b>competitive</b> niche <b>differentiation</b> resulting from exploitation of limited resources, interspecific competition over shared resources will drive the community structure (MacNally 1983; Hubbell 2006).

30|$|It was {{suggested}} that ecological patterns {{can be used}} to infer the nature of ecological processes (i.e., competition) that structure communities. Analysis of patterns of resource partitioning under the classical niche paradigm (<b>competitive</b> niche <b>differentiation</b> in exploiting limited resources) has traditionally been used to understand the structure of communities. On the contrary, neutral theory states that patterns result from neutral processes such as stochasticity and dispersal abilities. Thus, if any ecological process gives rise to a characteristic ecological pattern, the comparative study of patterns with appropriate neutral models may reveal the magnitude of that process. In this study, we analyzed patterns of resource utilization of a waterbird community in Lake Acuitlapilco, an epicontinental lake in central Mexico. In February 2011 to January 2012, we recorded foraging behaviors of waterbird species in two niche dimensions or axes: feeding technique and foraging habitat. The pattern of resource utilization was characterized by niche breath and niche overlap.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the concept of {{competitive}} advantage has taken centre stage in discussions of business strategy; that is why, {{one of the major}} challenges organizations face today is how to have a competitive advantage. In most cases a stand out product will do the job, since products are perceived as both highly relevant and meaningfully, the ability for any one product to standout in a competitive category will guarantee the success of such organization. While there are numerous ways to differentiate brands, identifying meaningful product-driven differentiators can be especially fruitful in gaining and sustaining a <b>competitive</b> advantage. <b>Differentiation</b> is when a firm or brand outperforms rival brands in the provision of a feature(s) such that it faces reduced sensitivity for other features (Sharp & Dawes, 2001).

50|$|Researchers use {{a variety}} of methods to measure {{ambivalent}} prejudice. The most widely used method is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) for sexism created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. Typical of all ingroup- outgroup relations, one group (men) has a much greater societal status. This is due to male ambivalence having three sources: paternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality. This assessment measures an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism. The theory of ambivalent sexism postulates that male ambivalence has three sources: paternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexuality. Women who resist traditional gender roles are punished by hostile sexism which resembles old-fashioned sexism. The theory predicts resentment of nontraditional women along each dimension: dominative paternalism, <b>competitive</b> gender <b>differentiation,</b> and heterosexual hostility. Conversely, women who cooperate with traditional gender roles and relationships evoke benevolent sexism which comprises protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy. The ASI measures sexism along each of the six dimensions that compose hostile sexism and benevolent sexism.|$|R
