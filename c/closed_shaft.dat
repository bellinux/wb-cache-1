40|$|AbstractThe present {{paper is}} engaged in an {{experimental}} study over a rise-time of smoke layer interface and deduced the relation between dimensionless rise-time of smoke layer interface and dimensionless height of the shaft. Based on the theoretical results, the risetime of smoke layer interface is measured by using small scale shaft which are located at the PolyU/USTC Atrium. Our study shows that the rise-time of the smoke layer interface be inversely proportional to the 1 / 3 power of heat release rate of the fire source, and proportional to the 1. 05 and the 1. 50 power of the height in open and closed shafts, respectively. Furthermore, it is also proved that the smoke layer interface movement in open shaft be faster than that in a free space and <b>closed</b> <b>shaft</b> due to the stack effect.

40|$|The injury of the radial nerve is not {{uncommon}} in humeral shaft fractures. These lesions may be of different types and levels and their treatment changes depending on traumatic characteristic. The authors present a case report of a patient affected by a <b>closed</b> <b>shaft</b> humeral fracture, consequence of an high energy trauma, associated with motor palsy of the radial nerve in which an open surgical revision was performed. The nerve appeared medially displaced and entrapped within the fracture fragments and the fibrous tissue around the lesion and showed signs of posttraumatic suffering without disruption. The nerve was repositioned in its anatomical site after neurolysis and intramedullary nailing of the humeral fracture. The fracture healed after 4 months with full recovery of motor function of the radial nerve.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Femoral shaft {{fracture}} {{is the most}} common major paediatric orthopaedic. For generations traction and casting was the standard treatment for all femoral {{shaft fracture}}s in children. Over the past two decades the advantages of fixation and rapid mobilisation have been increasingly recognised. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in five private hospitals in the district of Bankura, West Bengal over a period of two years (April 2010 to March 2012) on 70 patients with <b>closed</b> <b>shaft</b> femur fractures between 6 - 14 years age of either sex. The aim was to find out the short term complications of titanium elastic nailing in diaphyseal fracture of femur in children and compare {{the findings of this study}} with pre- existing studies in this field. Results: In our study the most common complication was pain at nail entry site (60 %). 5. 71 % had local inflammatory reaction due to nails. Superficial infection occurred in 2. 85 %. At the end of 1 year, 2. 85 % had limb length discripancies. Proximal migration occurred in 2. 85 %. 2. 85 % encountered acute reactive synovitis, 5. 71 % developed angulation of fracture site and 2. 85 % developed per operative breakage of nail. Conclusion: The treatment of paediatric shaft femur fracture has been drastically changed over the last two decades to internal fixation by elastically stable intra- medullary nail (ESIN). In our study, we encountered only a few complications most of them being minor. Most of the complications were surgical technique related and were seen at the initial phase of the learning curve...|$|E

40|$|<b>Closed</b> femoral <b>shaft</b> {{fractures}} {{have always}} been a challenge to orthopaedic surgeons and traumatologists for many years. They account for high morbidity rates in trauma wards, prolonged hospitalization as well as affecting the productive age group of the society.

In the developing world however, owing to lack of both qualified personnel and funds to purchase modern implants, conservative treatment still remains the mainstay of treatment. The broad objective {{of this study was to}} determine medical and financial benefits of embarking on early surgery of femoral shaft fractures versus conservative treatment in the form of continuous skeletal traction.

40|$|The tibial shaft {{represents}} {{the most common}} site of long bone fractures¹. Fractures of the tibial shaft {{are the most common}} long bone fractures, with an incidence of more than 75, 000 per year in the US 3; most of these fractures are found in young males with a second peak of incidence among elderly patients, whose injuries likely resulted from a simple fall 4. The most frequently used methods of treatment for closed fractures of the tibial shaft are immobilization in a cast, open reduction and internal fixation with a plate or intramedullary device. However, it is not clear which method has the best outcome. There is a lack of substantive data to support the concept that open reduction and internal fixation leads to a better outcome than immobilization in a cast or brace 13. Data is also sparse on the functional outcome of these fractures after the necessary intervention done. Therefore a study was undertaken from June, 2012 to March, 2013 recruiting patients of <b>closed</b> tibial <b>shaft</b> fractures attending MOI after obtaining an informed consent. Broad Objective: To assess the functional outcome of closed reduction and POP immobilization of <b>closed</b> tibial <b>shaft</b> fractures in MOI. Materials and Methods Design: A hospital based Prospective Cross-sectional study. Setting: A total of 91 patients, aged 12 years and above with <b>closed</b> tibial <b>shaft</b> fractures attending at MOI were included in the study after obtaining an informed consent. Anonymous questionnaires based on structured guidelines were used to obtain data from the patient. Short-term Functional Outcome was assessed among these patients evaluating Post treatment X-rays, pain, activity limitation, maximum walking distance, ability to walk on uneven surfaces and stairs, gait, adjacent knee motion, leg stability, alignment, POP loosening and difficulty bearing weight at follow-up intervals of 2, 6 and 12 weeks. Later the collected data was computed and analyzed using SPSS version 15 program. Results: Of the 91 patients examined, 72 (79. 1 %) were males and 19 (20. 9 %) were females. The Median age for the patients was 29 years (Range 21 years – 42 years). The most commonly affected Age group was 21 years- 30 years(28, 30. 8 %). Most of the patients had Primary education(34. 1 %) and majority were involved in petty trades and jobs (56 %). The most common cause of injury was because of being involved in MVC (40. 65 %), followed by those who sustained falls(30. 76 %), motorbike injuries(25. 27 %) and assaults(3. 29 %). Majority sustained injury on Left side(52. 7 %) followed by those who sustained injury on Right side(47. 3 %). None of the patients had Bilateral injury. The most common site of injury was Distal-third(42, 46. 15 %). The commonest fracture type was Type A(57. 14 %). When further sub-classified, majority of patients had Type A 3 injury(21. 97 %). After 2 weeks of follow-up, all patients had their POP changed because of loosening. All patients had varied degrees of difficulty on weight bearing after 6 weeks. POP could be removed on 87. 9 % patients after 12 weeks. The rest 12. 1 % still had wobbling at fracture site. So their POPs had to be changed and continued for clinical union to occur. Good Functional Outcome was seen in most of the patients after 12 weeks (59. 34 %). Malunion accounted for 28. 57 % and in the rest 12. 09 %, fracture had not united. Conclusion: <b>Closed</b> Tibial <b>Shaft</b> Fractures were one of the commonest injuries attended at MOI. Males were more commonly involved than Females. It was more common among the younger age groups. The most common causes were MVC, falls, motorbike injuries and assaults. Type A injuries were the commonest injuries followed by Type B and Type C. Good functional outcome was seen in almost two-thirds of the patients. But 40. 66 % were diagnosed with disability in the end of this study. Complications like Malunion, fracture not united by 12 weeks and Ankle stiffness were seen. This is not satisfactory and thus further change in protocol to manage such patients are needed with large randomized controlled trials to fully solve the controversy as to decide the best management for such patients. No other complications like Refracture, Compartment Syndrome, Peripheral Nerve Injury, Anterior Knee Pain or Deep Venous Thrombosis were seen...|$|R
30|$|Operative {{treatment}} {{has been used}} in patients with multiple trauma, open fractures, unstable or segmental fractures, but has been controversial in closed stable fractures [11].
