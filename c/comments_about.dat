5|$|In the 18th century {{two members}} of the clan earned {{considerable}} regard for their Gaelic poetry. James, the poet-chief, (1727–1799) is best remembered for a biting satire he composed in Gaelic in response to Samuel Johnson, the English encyclopedist, who had made derogatory <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> the Scots in his famous trip to the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
5|$|<b>Comments</b> <b>about</b> Heliade and his Bucharest statue feature {{prominently}} in Macedonski's short story Nicu Dereanu, whose main character, a daydreaming Bohemian, idolizes the Wallachian writer. Sburătorul, a modernist literary magazine of the interwar period, edited by Eugen Lovinescu, owed {{its name to}} Zburătorul, making use of an antiquated variant of the name (a form favored by Heliade). During the same years, Camil Petrescu made reference to Heliade in his novel Un om între oameni, which depicts events from Nicolae Bălcescu's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Following the injury, McLeod {{stated that}} she was {{relieved}} because the injury gave her a much needed break from the national team. After the 2007 World Cup, she experienced a drop in confidence due to both her own negative thoughts about her performances as well as derogatory <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> her sexuality made by fellow national team players. It took her years to finally {{get back to the}} national team.|$|E

5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> him on their website.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Pinker wrote a mixed {{review of}} Malcolm Gladwell's essays in The New York Times criticizing his {{analytical}} methods. Gladwell replied, disputing Pinker's <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> {{the importance of}} IQ on teaching performance and by analogy, the effect, if any, of draft order on quarterback performance in the National Football League. Advanced NFL Stats addressed the issue statistically, siding with Pinker and showing that differences in methodology could explain the two men's differing opinions.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, a Florida {{judge ordered}} Jack to stop selling nude {{photographs}} of Runnels. Runnels filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> her and requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack {{said that he}} took the photos, that they belonged to him {{and that he should}} be free to pass them on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E

5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such hypotheses {{ought to be the}} subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> the linesman.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the game}} has been positive. The average score in Metacritic is of 82 out of 100. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 36/40, earning the magazine's Platinum award and becoming the highest-ranking review score that week. The reviewers were generally positive about their experience: despite some <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> a lack of polish in environments, the game's character design, aesthetics, gameplay and story all came in for general praise, with multiple reviewers calling it a worthy part of the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E
5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
