40|$|This {{piece is}} a violin concerto modeled after, but not {{explicitly}} quoting melodic material of, several pieces of music by composers Bear McCreary, and Martin O 2 ̆ 7 Donnell. The {{first and third}} movements of my piece were each modeled after two of Bear McCreary 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pieces</b> from the soundtrack to Battlestar Galactica Season 2 - Allegro, and Prelude to War, respectively. The second movement of my piece was modeled after Martin O 2 ̆ 7 Donnell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>piece</b> Ashes, from the soundtrack to Halo: Reach. ^ Although I model my piece on the formal structures and, occasionally, the chord progressions of McCreary 2 ̆ 7 s and O 2 ̆ 7 Donnell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pieces,</b> my piece is significantly different from theirs. This difference in overall sound is accomplished through my use of orchestration, original melodic lines, fuller harmonies, use of rhythm, and changes to the original piece 2 ̆ 7 s key structure and metrical plan. ^ My concerto has a total duration of approximately 18 minutes, and was written for violin soloist and full orchestral accompaniment. Each of my piece 2 ̆ 7 s three movements was written {{to be able to}} stand independently of the other two. This allows an orchestra to play only a single movement without sacrificing any of the broader understanding of the works 2 ̆ 7 construction, as would occur if all the movements were closely thematically linked to one another. ^ The overall character of the piece was written in a post-minimalist style, with distinct melodies supported by often repetitious rhythmic patterns. The harmonies used in the piece are primarily based on triadic and pandiatonic structures. However, extended chords were also employed. By composing a piece in this style, my goal was to create a work that will appeal to younger audiences, and which would therefore aid in attracting newer audiences to the concert hall. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of garbage collectors and leak detectors in identifying dead objects {{depends on the}} accuracy of their reachability traversal. Accuracy has two orthogonal dimensions: (i) whether the reachability traversal can distinguish between pointers and nonpointers (type accuracy), and (ii) whether the reachability traversal can identify memory locations that will be dereferenced in the future (liveness accuracy). This article presents an experimental study {{of the importance of}} type and liveness accuracy for reachability traversals. We show that liveness accuracy reduces the reachable heap size by up to 62 % for our benchmark programs. However, the simpler liveness schemes (e. g., intraprocedural analysis of local variables) are largely ineffective for our benchmark runs: one must analyze global variables using interprocedural analysis to obtain significant benefits. Type accuracy has an insignificant impact on a garbage <b>collector</b> <b>s</b> ability to find unreachable objects in our benchmark runs.
