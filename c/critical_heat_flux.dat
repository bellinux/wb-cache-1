50|$|The use {{of boiling}} {{is limited by}} a {{condition}} called <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> (CHF), which is also called a boiling crisis or {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB). The most serious problem is that the boiling limitation can be directly related to the physical burnout of the materials of a heated surface due to the suddenly inefficient heat transfer through a vapor film formed across the surface resulting from the replacement of liquid by vapor adjacent to the heated surface.|$|E
5000|$|The {{characteristics}} of pool boiling are different for zeotropic mixtures {{than that of}} pure mixtures.

[...] Zeotropic mixtures and pure liquids also have different <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes.</b> In addition, the heat transfer coefficients of zeotropic mixtures are less than the ideal values predicted using the coefficients of pure liquids.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Experimental {{results on}} the heat {{transfer}} in a liquid film falling over a single vertical heater with the height and the width of 6. 5 and 13 mm, respectively, are reported. A 25 % mixture of ethyl alcohol in water {{was used as a}} working liquid. The temperature distribution {{on the surface of the}} liquid film was measured with an infrared system. It was determined that when the length of the boundary layer region was substantially less than the height of the heater the Marangoni effect had a dramatic influence on the liquid film movement. A horizontal standing wave and two lateral standing waves were formed. The liquid fell in one, two or tree "horseshoes " form.

40|$|In this study, subcooled flow boiling was {{investigated}} in horizontal microtubes. Experiments were conducted using deionized water as the working fluid over a mass flux range of 4000 - 7000 kgm− 2 s− 1 in microtubes with inner and outer diameters of ∼ 600 and ∼ 900 μm, respectively. Microtubes with lengths of 3, 6 and 12 cm were tested to clarify the effect of heated length on flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics. A force analysis related to two phase flow was conducted to understand the effect of forces on bubble dynamics. Pressure drop and heat transfer data in flow boiling were acquired. Experimental <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> data were compared with partial boiling <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> correlations, and good agreements were obtained. Pressure drop was larger in longer microtubes in comparison to shorter ones, while higher <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> were obtained in shorter microtubes at the same wall superheat. Two-phase heat transfer coefficient increased with the microtube length due to lower temperature difference between wall temperature and bulk fluid temperature in longer microtubes. Higher <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> achieved in shorter microtubes at the same wall superheat imply higher <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> in shorter microtubes...|$|R
50|$|A {{new class}} of {{coolants}} are nanofluids which consist of a carrier liquid, such as water, dispersed with tiny nano-scale particles known as nanoparticles. Purpose-designed nanoparticles of e.g. CuO, alumina, titanium dioxide, carbon nanotubes, silica, or metals (e.g. copper, or silver nanorods) dispersed into the carrier liquid enhance the heat transfer capabilities of the resulting coolant compared to the carrier liquid alone. The enhancement can be theoretically as high as 350%. The experiments however did not prove so high thermal conductivity improvements, but found significant increase of the <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> of the coolants.|$|E
50|$|When the {{relative}} {{increase in the}} temperature difference is balanced by {{the relative}} reduction in the heat transfer coefficient, a maximum heat flux is achieved as observed by the peak in the graph. This is the <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux.</b> At {{this point in the}} maximum, considerable vapor is being formed, making it difficult for the liquid to continuously wet the surface to receive heat from the surface. This causes the heat flux to reduce after this point. At extremes, film boiling commonly known as the Leidenfrost effect is observed.|$|E
50|$|If {{the heat}} flux of a boiling system {{is higher than}} the <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> (CHF) of the system, the bulk fluid may boil, or in some cases, regions of the bulk fluid may boil where the fluid travels in small channels. Thus large bubbles form, {{sometimes}} blocking the passage of the fluid. This results in a departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) in which steam bubbles no longer break away from the solid surface of the channel, bubbles dominate the channel or surface, and the heat flux dramatically decreases. Vapor essentially insulates the bulk liquid from the hot surface.|$|E

It was found that apart from data at low exit qualities (less than 0. 1) or short boiling lengths less than approximately 50 the correlation agrees with the data to within +- 10 per cent for boiling length ratios less than approximately 150; for values greater than 150 more than 90 per cent of points agree with the correlation to within +- 5 per cent...|$|R

40|$|This report {{contains}} a prescriptive design analysis and a performance based design analysis for a newly constructed United States Air Force 3 -Bay Aircraft General Maintenance Hangar and support spaces. The prescriptive design analysis reviews the code requirements for fire suppression, fire alarm, life safety, and structural fire protection. Additionally, the hydraulic {{demands of the}} fire suppression system, and the voltage drop and power supply requirements of the fire alarm systems were calculated. The results of the analysis portray a compliant prescriptive design of the fire protection systems. The performance based design analysis evaluates the hazards in the 3 -bay facility for two objectives; Life safety and aircraft protection. The life safety objective has been evaluated through {{an analysis of the}} available safe egress time (ASET) versus the required safe egress time (RSET). The ASET tenability limits for this analysis were defined as when the smoke layer would descend to 6 ft above finished floor. For this scenario, RSET was determined to be 63 % less than ASET. The aircraft protection objective was evaluated by modeling the effects of the design fire on the aircraft against the known <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> of the aircraft coatings.

50|$|Boiling is {{the rapid}} {{vaporization}} of a liquid, which {{occurs when a}} liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid {{is equal to the}} pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. The higher the pressure the higher the boiling point. There are two main types of boiling; nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of water is 100 °C or 212 °F, but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes.|$|E
50|$|In a {{water-cooled}} {{power reactor}} (or in a water-filled spent fuel pool, SFP), if a power surge occurs {{as a result}} of a reactivity initiated accident, an understanding of the transfer of heat from the surface of the cladding to the water is very useful. In a French study, metal pipe immersed in water (both under typical PWR and SFP conditions), was electrically heated to simulate the generation of heat within a fuel pin by nuclear processes. The temperature of the pipe was monitored by thermocouples and for the tests conducted under PWR conditions the water entering the larger pipe (14.2 mm diameter) holding the test metal pipe (9.5 mm outside diameter and 600 mm long) was at 280 °C and 15 MPa. The water was flowing past the inner pipe at circa 4 ms−1 and the cladding was subjected to heating at 2200 to 4900 °C s−1 to simulate an RIA. It was found that as the temperature of the cladding increased the rate of heat transfer from the surface of the cladding increased at first as the water boiled at nucleation sites. When the heat flux is greater than the <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> a boiling crisis occurs. This occurs as the temperature of the fuel cladding surface increases so that the surface of the metal was too hot (surface dries out) for nucleation boiling. When the surface dries out the rate of heat transfer decreases, after a further increase in the temperature of the metal surface the boiling resumes but it is now film boiling.|$|E
40|$|A {{large-scale}} fire test {{was conducted on}} a compartment constructed from cross laminated timber (CLT). The internal faces of the compartment were lined with non-combustible board, {{with the exception of}} one wall and the ceiling where the CLT was exposed directly to the fire inside the compartment. Extinction of the fire occurred without intervention. During the fire test, measurements were made of incident radiant <b>heat</b> <b>flux,</b> gas phase temperature, and in-depth temperature in the CLT. In addition, gas flow velocities and gas phase temperatures at the opening were measured, as well as incident <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> at the facade due to flames and the plume leaving the opening. The fuel load was chosen to be sufficient to attain flashover, to achieve steady-state burning conditions of the exposed CLT, but to minimize the probability of uncertain behaviors induced by the specific characteristics of the CLT. Ventilation conditions were chosen to approximate maximum temperatures within a compartment. Wood cribs were used as fuel and, following decay of the cribs, self-extinction of the exposed CLT rapidly occurred. In parallel with the large-scale test, a small scale study focusing on CLT self-extinction was conducted. This study was used to establish: the range of incident <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> for which self-extinction of the CLT can occur; the duration of exposure after which steady-state burning occurred; and the duration of exposure at which debonding of the CLT could occur. The large-scale test is described, and the results from both the small and large-scale tests are compared. It is found that self-extinction occurred in the large-scale compartment within the range of <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> obtained from the small scale tests...|$|R
40|$|Safety {{of large}} {{capacity}} boiling channel system was highly advanced in this three decades. Recent advanced compact watertube boilers, {{on the other}} hand, brought about high possibility of unstable flow condition owing to the operation at low-mass flux and low-pressure. Many existing researches on the safely issues focused mainly on the stable flow, and therefore relevant information {{on the effect of}} the flow oscillation on the safety issues, e. g. <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes,</b> was insufficient for the sound design of compact watertube boilers. Aiming at the fundamental understanding of the possible two-phase flow dynamics, this paper focuses the discussion on the experimental and analytical investigations about the effect of oscillatory flow on the flow pattern and void fraction behavior. Then, the results are summarized as follows: (1) The flow pattern transition is different under oscillatory flow condition from that of the safety condition, and a large bubble and thus slug flow is temporarily formed in the gas injection area during the flow reversal state. (2) Void fraction fluctuation and void propagation velocity can be well predicted by the numerical simulation based on the one-dimensional drift-flux model...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{variation}} in {{the characteristics of the}} pressure oscillations in a thermoacoustic engine is explored as the input <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> is varied. A bifurcation diagram is plotted to study the {{variation in}} the qualitative behavior of the acoustic oscillations as the input <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> changes. At a <b>critical</b> input <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> (60 Watt), the engine begins to produce acoustic oscillations in its fundamental longitudinal mode. As the input <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> is increased, incommensurate frequencies appear in the power spectrum. The simultaneous presence of incommensurate frequencies results in quasiperiodic oscillations. On further increase of <b>heat</b> <b>flux,</b> the fundamental mode disappears and second mode oscillations are observed. These bifurcations in the characteristics of the pressure oscillations are the result of nonlinear interaction between multiple modes present in the thermoacoustic engine. Hysteresis in the bifurcation diagram suggests that the bifurcation is subcritical. Further, the qualitative analysis of different dynamic regimes is performed using nonlinear time series analysis. The physical reason for the observed nonlinear behavior is discussed. Suggestions to avert the variations in qualitative behavior of the pressure oscillations in thermoacoustic engines are also provided...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} using vertical heated tubes cooled internally by Freon- 12 to determine <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> (CHFs) for both a uniformly heated section and an exit region with a separately controlled power supply. Heated lengths of the main separately were 2870 mm (8. 48 and 16. 76 mm tube bores) and 3700 mm (for 21. 34 mm tube bore); heated length of the exit section was 230 mm. Coolant pressures exit qualities and mass fluxes were in the range 0. 9 to 1. 3 MPa 0. 19 to 0. 86 and 380 to 2800 kg m - 2 - 1 respectively. The data have been compared with published empirical correlations specifically formulated to predict CHFs in Freon-cooled vertical tubes; relevant published CHF data have also been compared with these correlations. These comparisons show that even over the ranges of conditions for which the correlations were developed predicted values are only accurate to within +- 20 per cent. Moreover as mass fluxes increase above 3500 kg m - 2 - 1 the modified Groeneveld correlation becomes increasingly inadequate and the Bertoletti and modified Bertoletti correlations under-predict CHF values by increasing amounts.

40|$|Abstract- This {{review is}} {{concerned}} with energy transport in current-carrying, thermal plasinas, in particular with energy transport close to and at the anode surface of high intensity arcs. Experimental studies of the anode region of such arcs at atmospheric pressure reveal two types of anode arc roots which strongly affect the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> distribution. In relatively short arcs {{the action of the}} cathode jet leads to a diffuse anode attachment (cathode jet dominated mode). In contrast, simulations of long arcs clearly demonstrate a more or less severe constriction of the current path in front of the anode inducing an anode jet (anode jet dominated mode). Modeling of the anode region under identical conditions confirms that the "natural " arc attachment in this situation will always be constricted, resulting in extremely high specific <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> at the anode. The analysis also shows that enthalpy transport by the electrons is the dominating heat transfer mechanism in the ano. de region. An analysis of the anode boundary layer of high current atmospheric pressure arcs indicates that presently available anode fall theories are not adequate for describing this zone. A one-dimensional analysis of the nearanode zone predicts negative anode falls in the range from one to three volts depending on the anode current density and on the plasma temperature. The electron temperature is substantially elevated over the temperature of the heavy particles close to the anode. Because of negative anode falls, the anode heat transfer model will no longer contain a term due to the anode fall. It is felt that this finding will be of great practical significance for the prediction of anode heat transfer in arc furnaces and in other applications which employ transferred arcs. Calculations of the <b>critical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> which lead to melting or evaporation of the anode surface in spite of intense water cooling of the rear face of the anode are in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. 1...|$|R
