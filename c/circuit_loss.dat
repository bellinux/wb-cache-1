30|$|Regardless of the cause, the {{net result}} is that some {{nutrients}} are significantly lost in the ECMO circuit and the clinical relevance of this remains unclear. While saturation of circuit binding sites over time may partly alleviate <b>circuit</b> <b>loss</b> of nutrients, the <b>circuit</b> <b>loss</b> from other mechanisms such as chemical and physical degradations, oxidation etc. may continue over the duration of ECMO, as up to second/third of patient's cardiac output may be exteriorised every minute for gas exchange and mechanical circulatory support [23]. Even though enteral or parenteral nutritional support and endogenous synthetic/metabolic mechanisms ensure an ongoing supply of macro- and micronutrients into the blood stream during ECMO, its unclear how much of their bioavailability is affected by ongoing losses in the circuit. In addition, the <b>circuit</b> <b>loss</b> of some nutrients can further be compounded by critical illness factors [24]-[26] such as inflammation, multiple organ dysfunction, fluid shifts and capillary leaks that may further affect their bioavailability. Interestingly, this may be the fate of many circulating endogenous compounds such as hormones and many other biologically active substances which are neither monitored nor replaced during ECMO. This calls for further clinical studies to further elucidate the biological impact of the ECMO circuit on circulating nutrients.|$|E

40|$|Most {{processing}} of sensation involves the cortical hemisphere opposite (contralateral) to the stimulated limb. Stroke patients can exhibit {{changes in the}} interhemispheric balance of sensory signal processing. It is unclear whether these changes {{are the result of}} poststroke rewiring and experience, or whether they could result from the immediate effect of <b>circuit</b> <b>loss.</b> We evaluated the effect of mini-strokes over short timescales (< 2 h) where cortical rewiring is unlikely by monitoring sensory-evoked activity throughout much of both cortical hemispheres using voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Blockade of a single pial arteriole within the C 57 BL 6 J mouse forelimb somatosensory cortex reduced the response evoked by stimulation of the limb contralateral to the stroke. However, after stroke, the ipsilateral (uncrossed) forelimb response within the unaffected hemisphere was spared and became independent of the contralateral forelimb cortex. Within the unaffected hemisphere, mini-strokes in the opposite hemisphere significantly enhanced sensory responses produced by stimulation of either contralateral or ipsilateral pathways within 30 – 50 min of stroke onset. Stroke-induced enhancement of responses within the spared hemisphere was not reproduced by inhibition of either cortex or thalamus using pharmacological agents in nonischemic animals. I/LnJ acallosal mice showed similar rapid interhemispheric redistribution of sensory processing after stroke, suggesting that subcortical connections and not transcallosal projections were mediating the novel activation patterns. Thalamic inactivation before stroke prevented the bilateral rearrangement of sensory responses. These findings suggest that acute stroke, and not merely loss of activity, activates unique pathways that can rapidly redistribute function within the spared cortical hemisphere...|$|E

We previously reported a Caenorhabditis elegans mutant, acr- 2 (gf), that displays spontaneous convulsions {{as the result}} of a gain-of-function mutation in a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit. The ACR- 2 channel is expressed in the cholinergic motor neurons, and acr- 2 (gf) causes cholinergic overexcitation accompanied by reduced GABAergic inhibition in the locomotor circuit. Here we show that neuropeptides play a homeostatic role that compensates for this excitation-inhibition imbalance in the locomotor <b>circuit.</b> <b>Loss</b> of function in genes required for neuropeptide processing or release of dense core vesicles specifically modulate the convulsion frequency of acr- 2 (gf). The proprotein convertase EGL- 3 is required in the cholinergic motor neurons to restrain convulsions. Electrophysiological recordings of neuromuscular junctions show that loss of egl- 3 in acr- 2 (gf) causes a further reduction of GABAergic inhibition. We identify two neuropeptide encoding genes, flp- 1 and flp- 18, that together counteract the excitation-inhibition imbalance in acr- 2 (gf) mutants. We further find that acr- 2 (gf) causes an increased expression of flp- 18 in the ventral cord cholinergic motor neurons and that overexpression of flp- 18 reduces the convulsion of acr- 2 (gf) mutants. The effects of these peptides are in part mediated by two G-protein coupled receptors, NPR- 1 and NPR- 5.
