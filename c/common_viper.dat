In Europe, only the <b>common</b> <b>viper</b> is frequent, though in other regions moorlands are commonly home to dozens of reptile species. Amphibians such as frogs are well represented in moorlands. When moorland is overgrazed, woody vegetation is often lost, being replaced by coarse, unpalatable grasses and bracken, with a greatly reduced fauna.|$|E

50|$|In the {{mountain}} {{areas in the}} interior, reindeer can be seen (these have Sami owners), hunted by the indigenous wolverine. There are also a few brown bears in the interior. The Arctic fox is now in danger of extinction on the mainland, but a few are left in these mountain areas, particularly in Børgefjell mountains. Red foxes, moose, hares, squirrels, small rodents, pine marten (inland valleys) and stoats are all common in the forests. As of 2008, there were a minimum of 50 lynx in Nordland residing in the forests in all Nordland except Lofoten and Vesterålen. In lowland areas, roe deers now occur in most of Nordland, and red deers are seen {{in the southern part}} of Nordland. The badger and the <b>common</b> <b>viper</b> has their most northerly habitat in southerly coastal areas of Nordland. Grey wolves have been observed in inland areas of Helgeland. There are few species of amphibians, although the common frog is common in all Nordland except mountain areas, and the smooth newt has its most northerly habitat in the world in the river Vefsna. There are seven national parks in, or partly in, Nordland. From south to north, these are Børgefjell National Park, Lomsdal-Visten National Park, Saltfjellet-Svartisen National Park, Junkerdal National Park, Rago National Park, Sjunkhatten National Park and Møysalen National Park. The national park centre for Nordland is situated in Saltdal.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse most {{important}} epidemiological and clinical aspects of registered snakebites caused by a native common European viper Vipera berus in the Czech Republic over a period of 15 years (1999 – 2013). Data have been collected retrospectively from a database of the Toxinology Centre belonging to the General University Hospital in Prague. In total, 191 cases of snakebites caused by <b>common</b> <b>viper</b> were registered during the study period. Systemic envenoming occurred in 49 (25. 7 %) patients, local envenoming without systemic symptoms was recorded in 91 (47. 6 %) and asymptomatic dry bites were seen in 51 (26. 7 %) cases, respectively. Twenty-four patients (12. 6 % of all bites) were treated with administration of antivenom. None of the victims died as a result of snakebite during the observation period. Native viper snakes usually did not cause serious harm to the patients, with the exception of children. Antivenom should be administered in all cases with systemic manifestations, in children even with serious local affection and administered as soon as possible. Envenomed patients should be admitted to the hospital and treated at least under supervision of specialists with experience in snakebite treatment, who can indicate and provide administration of the antivenom...|$|E
50|$|A {{subspecies}} of {{the smooth}} newt (L. vulgaris ampelensis), endemic to the Charpatian mountains, lives here, while the European common frog can be fould {{all over the}} park.
