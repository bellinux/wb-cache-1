50|$|Most {{methods of}} lipid {{extraction}} and isolation from biological samples exploit the high solubility of hydrocarbon chains in organic solvents. Given the diversity in lipid classes, {{it is not}} possible to accommodate all classes with a common extraction method. The traditional Bligh/Dyer procedure uses chloroform/methanol-based protocols that include phase partitioning into the organic layer. These protocols work relatively well for a wide variety of physiologically relevant lipids but they have to be adapted for complex lipid chemistries and low-abundance and labile lipid metabolites.When organic soil was used, <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer</b> in the extraction mixture gave higher amounts of lipid phosphate than acetate buffer, Tris, H2O or phosphate buffer.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fluoride}} ions concentration on the electrochemical behavior of Ti grade 2 and Ti 6 Al 4 V in <b>citrate</b> <b>buffers</b> was studied. Open circuit potential (OCP) measurements and voltammetric {{studies of the}} samples in the fluoride containing <b>citrate</b> <b>buffers</b> revealed a dissolution process when the pH falls below 5. 0 and the NaF content is higher than 0. 01 M. However, in citrate pH 7. 6 the materials showed a passive behavior even in 0. 1 M NaF. Some micrographs of Ti grade 2 obtained after longer immersion times in citrate pH 5. 0 with 0. 01 M NaF showed a surface attack. EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Sprectroscopy) data obtained at the OCP revealed that the film resistance decreases when the immersion time is increased in pH 5. 0 containing 0. 1 M NaF. In the citrate pH 7. 6 the EIS data indicated a two-layer model of an oxide film consisting of a more compact inner layer and a porous outer layer. On the other hand, the EIS results in citrate pH 4. 0 change significantly when the fluoride ions concentration increases from 0. 01 to 0. 05 M. The electrochemical data revealed that the corrosion behavior of Ti grade 2 and Ti 6 Al 4 V in the <b>citrate</b> <b>buffers</b> depends on the pH, the fluoride content and the exposure time...|$|R

Both these activities were determined for extracts {{of the plant}} Cynara cardunculus in fresh form and after lyophilization followed by reconstitution, either in water or in <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer</b> (pH 5. 4) and stored for up to 4 weeks at 4 °C. The patterns of degradation of ovine and caprine caseins were followed by urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in attempts to qualitatively differentiate {{the activity of the}} enzyme extracts as storage time elapsed. Storage at 4 °C significantly decreased the clotting power of the extracts but lyophilization retarded this decrease; β- and αs-casein breakdown generally increased with storage time, via patterns that depend on caseinate type and extract used, but lyophilized extracts reconstituted in <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer</b> were significantly less proteolytic than the other extracts.

40|$|Novel acetone and {{aldimine}} covalent adducts {{were identified}} on the N-termini and lysine side chains of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. Photochemical degradation of <b>citrate</b> <b>buffers,</b> {{in the presence}} of trace levels of iron, is demonstrated as the source of these modifications. The link between degradation of citrate and the observed protein modifications was conclusively established by tracking the citrate decomposition products and protein adducts resulting from photochemical degradation of isotope labeled 13 C citrate by mass spectrometry. The structure of the acetone modification was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on modified–free glycine and found to correspond to acetone linked to the N-terminus of the amino acid through a methyl carbon. Results from mass spectrometric fragmentation of glycine modified with an acetone adduct derived from 13 C labeled citrate indicated that the three central carbons of citrate are incorporated onto protein amines {{in the presence of}} iron and light. While citrate is known to stoichiometrically decompose to acetone and CO 2 through various intermediates in photochemical systems, it has never been shown to be a causative agent in protein carbonylation. Our results point to a previously unknown source for the generation of reactive carbonyl species.

The median amount of ammonium released into the incubating solution over five minutes was lower at pH 6. 0 (9 mumol) than at pH 7. 0 (18 mumol) despite similar uptake of urea. The median five minute survival of H pylori in 0. 2 M <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer,</b> pH 6. 0, decreased from 89 % to 14 % when the urea concentration was increased from 1 mmol/l to 50 mmol/l.

Survival of H pylori in the presence of 30 mmol/l urea at pH 6. 0 was compared in 0. 2 M citrate, acetate, and phosphate buffers. The median five minute survival was less in the <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer,</b> at 29 %, than in either the acetate buffer 80 % or the phosphate buffer 100 %.

30|$|In {{an effort}} to {{decouple}} competing ligand effects due {{to the presence of}} changing buffering species with actual pH-dependent Cu release, we sought to reduce the buffer effect while concomitantly introducing competing ligands that were unaffected by solution pH. The use of <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer</b> was less than ideal in this case due to the multiple acidic protons capable of generating four possible species in solution. The use of acetate buffer in place of citrate was expected to reduce this complexity. Acetate buffer generates only two species with relative concentrations of A- and HA being 95 % and 5 % at pH 6 and 15 and 85 % at pH 4, respectively (pKa = 4.75). Furthermore, even though the concentration of the anion changes in this case as well, and is higher at pH 6, this species is identical to the particle-bound carboxylate groups making it a less effective competitor compared to the species present in <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer</b> at the same pH. A direct comparison of Cu release at pH 5 in acetate buffer and <b>citrate</b> <b>buffer</b> (Figure 3 B), both at 100 mM, confirmed this assumption. Cu release was much slower in acetate buffer most likely a result of the reduced competitive nature of A- compared to LH 2 -.
