2500|$|The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) {{recognizes that}} {{conflicts}} may {{exist between the}} respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights. In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called [...] "Human rights and intellectual property" [...] that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws. According to the Committee, when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health, and to <b>cultural</b> <b>participation</b> and scientific benefits. In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization which argues that WIPO should [...] "focus more {{on the needs of}} developing countries, and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself".|$|E

More knowledge on how <b>cultural</b> activity <b>participation</b> may influence self-perceived health, life-satisfaction, self-esteem and mental health is needed. Methods: This article use data from the general population-based Norwegian HUNT Study, using the cross-sectional Young-HUNT 3 (2006 – 08) Survey including 8200 adolescents. Data on <b>cultural</b> activity <b>participation,</b> self-perceived health, life-satisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety and depression were collected by self-reported questionnaires. Results: Both attending meetings or training in an organisation or club, and attending sports events were positively associated {{with each of the}} health parameters good self-percieved health, good life-satisfaction, good self-esteem, and low anxiety and depression symptoms. We found differences according to gender and age (13 – 15 years versus 16 – 19 years old) for several culture activities, where girls aged 16 – 19 years seemed to benefit most from being culturally active. The extent of participation seemed to matter. Those who had frequent <b>participation</b> in <b>cultural</b> activities reported better health outcomes compared to inactive adolecents.
