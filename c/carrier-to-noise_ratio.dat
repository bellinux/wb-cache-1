Digital accumulators or summers are used extensively in digital signal processing to perform averaging or to reduce processing rates to acceptable levels. For tracking the Doppler of high-dynamic targets at low <b>carrier-to-noise</b> <b>ratios,</b> it is shown through simulation and experiment that digital accumulators can contribute an additional loss in operating threshold.

40|$|Abstract—The use {{of direct}} RF {{sampling}} has been explored {{as a means}} of designing multifrequency RF front ends. Such front ends will be useful to multifrequency RF applications such as global navigation satellite system receivers that use global positioning system (GPS) L 1, L 2, and L 5 signals and Galileo signals. The design of a practical multifrequency direct RF sampling front end is dependent on having an analog-to-digital converter whose input bandwidth accommodates the highest carrier frequency and whose maximum sampling frequency is more than twice the cumulative bandwidth about the multiple carrier signals. The principle of direct RF sampling is used to alias all frequency bands of interest onto portions of the Nyquist bandwidth that do not overlap. This paper presents a new algorithm that finds the minimum sampling frequency that avoids overlap. This design approach requires a multifrequency bandpass filter for the frequency bands of interest. A prototype front end has been designed, built, and tested. It receives a GPS coarse/acquisition code at the L 1 frequency and GPS antispoofing precision code at both L 1 and L 2.

40|$|Project thesis {{submitted}} in part fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Master of Science in Positioning and Navigation Technology, The University of Nottingham. Growing dependence on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), especially GPS, for positioning and navigation at sea has raised a concern about the potential risks of signal interference. Technology for jamming is easily available, {{and in recent years}} there have been many cases of intentional jamming. As GPS is the principal means of position fixing used by the Norwegian Navy, important questions to find answers to is how vulnerable the GPS and the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) are to a jamming attack, and further whether employing the Glonass satellite system in addition to GPS will provide better performance regarding robustness and redundancy when receivers are exposed to jamming. By having a Coast Guard Vessel operating inshore the Norwegian fjords as case, this research aims to explore these issues and it does so by asking the following research questions: - Will employing Glonass in addition to GPS provide better performance in Northern areas when the systems are exposed to GNSS jammers? - How is the ability of the existing GPS system on board a Norwegian Coastguard Vessel to provide a reliable position when there is a jamming threat, and how will the ECDIS system on board handle an eventually loss of GPS position? The study consists of two jamming tests: A static test where focus is to analyze and compare the GPS and Glonass system and a dynamic test where the GPS and ECDIS system on board is analyzed when exposed to jamming. The results from the static test showed that the jammer has effect on large distances, and that the different receivers used react differently when exposed to jamming. Further, the <b>carrier-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> for Glonass are less affected by the jammer, and the receiver is able to track Glonass satellites with lower <b>carrier-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> than GPS satellites. We have seen that utilizing Glonass satellites in addition to GPS satellites in the receiver contribute to a later loss of position fix and an earlier calculation of new position under difficult jamming conditions. The dynamic test showed that the marine grade GPS receiver is easy to jam. A weak jamming signal caused the GPS receivers to give misleading information without any warning from itself or the ECDIS system. The ECDIS system provided an adequate DR positioning, but there are issues that need to be resolved for better functionality. As Glonass signals has shown to be more resistant to jamming than GPS signals, applying the Glonass system in addition to GPS might provide benefits with regards to reliability and redundancy, especially for maritime navigation in Northern areas where the Glonass satellites also have higher elevation and better coverage than GPS...|$|R
