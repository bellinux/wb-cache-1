40|$|To work {{towards an}} {{advanced}} {{model of the}} bicycle-rider-environment system, an open-loop bicycle-rider model {{was developed in the}} commercial multibody dynamics software ADAMS. The main contribution of this article to bicycle dynamics is the analysis of tyre and rider properties that influence bicycle stability. A system identification method is used to extract linear stability properties from time domain analysis. The weave and capsize eigenmodes of the bicycle-rider system are analysed. The effect of tyre properties is studied using the tyre’s forces and torques that have been measured in several operating conditions. The main result is that extending simplified models with a realistic tyre model leads to a notable decrease in the weave stability and a stabilization of the <b>capsize</b> <b>mode.</b> This effect is mainly caused by the twisting torque. Different tyres and tyre inflation pressures have little effect on the bicycle’s stability, in the case of riding straight at a constant forward speed. On the other hand, the tyre load does have a large effect on bicycle stability. The sensitivity study of rider properties shows that body stiffness and damping have a small effect on the weave and <b>capsize</b> <b>mode,</b> whereas arm stiffness destabilizes the <b>capsize</b> <b>mode</b> and arm damping destabilizes the weave mode...|$|R

Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled bike to fall over.|$|R
5|$|In 1970, David E. H. Jones {{published}} an article in Physics Today showing that gyroscopic effects are not necessary to balance a bicycle. Since 1971, when he identified and named the wobble, weave and <b>capsize</b> <b>modes,</b> Robin Sharp has written regularly about the behavior of motorcycles and bicycles. While at Imperial College, London, he worked with David Limebeer and Simos Evangelou.|$|R
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the <b>capsize</b> <b>mode</b> from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|R
40|$|For four-wheelers, vehicle {{stability}} control systems, VSC (e. g. Bosch ESP) {{have proven}} {{their ability to}} lower fatal accidents by a significant number. For motorcycles, no comparable systems are available. This {{is due to the}} complex motorcycle driving dynamics. In a research project at TU Darmstadt, the feasibility of motorcycle VSCs beyond anti-lock and traction control systems has been evaluated. A method to detect relevant critical driving situations was developed and a yaw control system for the prevention of high-sider type accidents has been identified as feasible, and also potential for a system to stabilize the dangerous <b>capsize</b> <b>mode</b> of motorcycles on low-friction surfaces by means of active suspension has been identified. The results of that work have already been published in a project report and are summarized here. This paper then goes beyond the published work and focuses on the potential of active suspension to control the roll and yaw motion of a motorcycle. With a simplified inverted pendulum model of a motorcycle, it is shown that no positive effect can be achieved in terms of roll stabilization. However, wheel load control by means of active suspension can be used to achieve yaw motion stabilization. The required force demands can be fulfilled by today’s actuator systems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to design, {{construct}} and validate a model {{to be used for}} enhancing the performance of competitive cyclists in road time trials. Modelling can be an effective tool for identifying methods to enhance performance in sports with a high mechanical component such as cycling. The thesis questioned whether an effective road cycling model could be built. Existing models were analysed and found to have insufficient predictive accuracy to make them effective under general time trial conditions. It was hypothesised that an effective and generalised model could be developed. A computer simulation model was constructed that extended the functionality of existing models. The three-dimensional model combined the bicycle, rider and environment in a single parameterised system which simulated road cycling at high frequency. Three model components were validated against published benchmark studies. Firstly, a pedalling model was compared to an experimental benchmark study. Modelled vertical pedal force normalised root mean squared error (NRMSE) was 9. 5 % and horizontal pedal force NRMSE was 8. 8 % when compared to the benchmark. Both these values were below the 10 % error level which a literature analysis indicated as the limit for validity. Modelled crank torque NRMSE was 4. 9 % and the modelled crank torque profile matched the benchmark profile with an R 2 value of 0. 974. A literature analysis indicated R 2 > 0. 95 was required for validity. Secondly, bicycle self-stability was evaluated against a benchmark model by comparing the eigenvalues for weave and <b>capsize</b> <b>mode.</b> Weave mode error level of 9. 3 % was less than the 10 % error considered the upper limit for validity. <b>Capsize</b> <b>mode</b> error could not be evaluated as the modelled profile did not cross zero. Thirdly, modelled rear tyre cornering stiffness was qualitatively compared with the results of an experimental study. The experimental study reported mean cornering stiffness of 60 N/deg at 3 degrees slip angle, 10 degrees camber and 330 N vertical load. This compared well with a model simulation which generated mean cornering stiffness of 62 N/deg at 3 degrees slip angle, 4 degrees camber and 338 N load. Experimental validation comprised a field case study and a controlled field time trial using 14 experienced cyclists. In the former study, modelled completion time was 1 % less than actual time. In the latter study, model prediction over a 4 km time trial course was found to be within 1. 4 ± 1. 5 % of the actual time (p= 0. 008). The validated model was used to test potential performance enhancement strategies. A strategy of power variation in response to gradient changes had been previously proposed, but never experimentally confirmed. The thesis model predicted a 4 % time advantage for a variable power strategy compared to a constant power strategy. This was confirmed experimentally in field trials when 20 cyclists obtained a significant (p< 0. 00 l) time advantage of 2. 9 ± 1. 9 %. The model also predicted a 1. 2 % time advantage if power was varied in head/tail wind conditions on an out-and-back time trial course. A 2 % time advantage was obtained in field trials but was not statistically significant (p= 0. 06). A final investigation examined the sensitivity of model prediction to variances in assumptions and initial conditions. An important sensitivity was the aerodynamic coefficient which could cause time differences of up to 6 %. Tyre forces were also found to be a critical factor in the accuracy of model prediction. The thesis investigation confirmed the hypothesis that an effective and generalised model could be built and used to predict performance in road time trials.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to determine the large amplitude motions of a vessel subjected to severe wave conditions, including those {{that may lead to}} capsizing. The aim was to numerically identify different <b>modes</b> of <b>capsizing,</b> and to study relevant  mechanisms and conditions. The theory is  based on a combination of potential and viscous flow approaches in the time domain, where large displacements, the instantaneous free surface and memory effects are considered. Reasonable agreement was found between predicted motions and experimental results for a variety of wave conditions. A number of capsizes, observed experimentally, were simulated successfully using the {{numerical model}}. An investigation has been carried out to determine the sensitivity of th roll response to changes in the force components.  The Froude-Krylov forces were found to be always of importance, irrespective of the wave conditions. Generally, the relative importance of the various components depends strongly on the ship and wave conditions. Special {{attention has been paid to}} random following seas, which tend to have an important effect on capsizing. Wave statistics have been obtained for an observer in a random following seaway, represented by the superposition of a finite number of wave components. It was found that the mean square wave elevation observed at a fixed point, and from a reference point moving at an angle with the waves, can be different, suggesting that care must be taken when conducting simulations. In random following seas, any point on the ship may be subjected to a quasi regular excitation, while the motion behavior is affected simultaneously by the spatial and temporal characteristics of the seaway. Also, for a short term simulation of an extreme event, it is shown that the random following sea may be replaced by an equivalent wave system, consisting of only two components. Several <b>modes</b> of <b>capsizing</b> in following to beam seas have been identified by simulation: low cycle resonance, loss of transverse static  stability, broaching and resonant excitation. An analysis has been made of the behavior of the roll moment components associated with these <b>capsize</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
