5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E

50|$|A {{company with}} $5000 on hand and incomes of $3000 a month has a {{constraint}} of $8000. That means, if {{the terms of}} an economic exchange (buying equipment, etc.) require terms that are cash-in-advance, then the limit that the company <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> obtain <b>is</b> $8000.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1970, he {{developed}} his first models of imaginary vehicles, aeroplanes, balloons or helicopters, in original and surprising appearances. Many of his sculptures are modern variants {{of the myth}} of Icarus. The question of whether his creations <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> fly <b>is</b> part of their mystery and appeal.|$|R
5|$|The Kirtlandian faunal age {{was named}} by Lucas and Sullivan in 2003, and found by their {{original}} study to date from 74.9 to 72million years ago. In 2006, Sullivan and Lucas refined their estimate, {{stating that the}} Kirtlandian ranged from 75 to 72.8million years ago. Later that year, Sullivan changed the time range again, finding that the faunal age lasted only 2 million years, from 74.8 to 72.8million years ago. He said that the later part of the Kirtlandian, from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, dated to 73 million years ago, {{on the basis of}} ash layers dating to 73.04 and 73.37million years ago. This observation was based on findings by Sullivan and Lucas, who dated the two ash layers from 73.04 ± 0.25 and 73.37 ± 0.28million years ago. They also dated the earlier ashes from the Fruitland Formation, which dated to 75.56 ± 0.41, 74.55 ± 0.29, and 74.11 ± 0.62 million years ago. The first ash, called by them the Dog Eye Pond, was found slightly higher than the start of the Fruitland Formation, which meant that the start of the Fruitland Formation was older than 75.5 million years ago. More precise dating in 2010 by Longrich found that the second youngest ash <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> dated more precisely than thought by Sullivan (2006), only having an error range of 0.18million years. Longrich also dated the two older ashes, finding a date {{the same as that of}} Sullivan in 2006. These ash datings are what Sullivan used to find the precise age of the Kirtlandian age.|$|E
25|$|The French {{mathematician}} Paul Lévy {{proved the}} following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous Rn-valued stochastic process X {{to actually be}} n-dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, Lévy's condition <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> used as an alternative definition of Brownian motion.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{signaling}} {{can occur}} between different organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular. The emitting organism produces the signaling molecule, secretes {{it into the}} environment, where it diffuses, and it is sensed or internalized by the receiving organism. In some cases of interspecies signaling, the emitting organism <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a host of the receiving organism, or vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|The nearest major {{airport is}} Birmingham International Airport, {{approximately}} [...] away. The airport {{is easy to}} reach by train, with a direct express service to it.

25|$|There {{are many}} galaxies visible in telescopes with red shift numbers of 1.4 or higher. All {{of these are}} {{currently}} traveling away from us at speeds greater {{than the speed of}} light. Because the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, there <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> cases where a galaxy that is receding from us faster than light does manage to emit a signal which reaches us eventually.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there is}} much debate {{regarding}} whether the species B. virginiensis and B. nitida <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> distinguished from one another. Thomson and Thomas state that five species of Bothriolepis from the United States (B. nitida, B. minor, B. virginiensis, B. darbiensis and B. coloradensis) are unable to be consistently distinguished from one another. Conversely, Weems asserts that there are several traits that distinguish the species from one another, including several listed above.|$|E
25|$|Thinkers such as John Fiske {{have looked}} at how audiences use popular media to get their own {{enjoyment}} from them, claiming, in a diametrically opposed fashion to much other media theory, that popular media, and thus the popular culture they are both part of and help create, <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> progressive as audiences struggle to use these media for their own individual purposes, and the media then shift to accommodate these purposes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{acquired}} immunity, pathogen-specific receptors are [...] "acquired" [...] {{during the}} lifetime of the organism (whereas in innate immunity pathogen-specific receptors are already encoded in the germline). The acquired response is called [...] "adaptive" [...] because it prepares the body's immune system for future challenges (though it <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> also <b>be</b> maladaptive when it results in autoimmunity).|$|R

50|$|The {{president}} may also dissolve the National Council, but only once {{for the same}} reason during his term of office. Note that the president does not have the power to veto specific acts of legislation: no matter how vehemently he objects to some particular bill, or believes it to be unconstitutional, all he <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> do <b>is</b> threaten to dismiss the government or dissolve the National Council before the bill <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> passed.|$|R
25|$|Perimeter Aviation is a {{regional}} airline that operates its own small, exclusive terminal building at Winnipeg International Airport to facilitate its passenger, cargo and charter services. Perimeter Aviation {{does not use}} the main terminal building due to its varied operations to small remote communities throughout Northern Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario using small propeller aircraft, with which regular airport terminal services (jet bridge, catering, etc.) are unnecessary and <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a hindrance to day-to-day operations.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} aspect of any ICF research project is ensuring that experiments <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> carried out on a timely basis. Previous devices generally had to cool down for many hours to allow the flashlamps and laser glass to regain their shapes after firing (due to thermal expansion), limiting use to one or fewer firings a day. One of the goals for NIF is to reduce this time to less than four hours, {{in order to allow}} 700 firings a year.|$|E
25|$|Woks are wide, roughly bowl-shaped vessels {{with one}} or two handles at or near the rim. This shape allows a small pool of cooking oil in the centre of the wok to be heated to a high {{temperature}} using relatively little fuel, while the outer areas of the wok are used to keep food warm after it has been fried in the oil. In the Western world, woks are typically used only for stir-frying, but they <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> used for anything from steaming to deep frying.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, {{supersymmetry}} {{was discovered}} {{in the context of}} string theory, and a new version of string theory called superstring theory (supersymmetric string theory) became the real focus. Nevertheless, bosonic string theory remains a very useful model to understand many general features of perturbative string theory, and many theoretical difficulties of superstrings <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> already <b>be</b> found in the context of bosonic strings.|$|R

25|$|Ninety-five of 146 books {{known to}} have been written by Bīrūnī were devoted to astronomy, mathematics, and related {{subjects}} like mathematical geography. His religion contributed to his research of astronomy, as in Islam, Muslim customs require knowing the directions of certain sacred locations, which <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> found through this type of scientific study. Biruni's major work on astrology is primarily an astronomical and mathematical text, only the last chapter concerns astrological prognostication. His endorsement of astrology is limited, in so far as he condemns horary astrology as 'sorcery'.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{wondered}} by many readers if Garfield <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> {{understood by the}} human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned {{in more than one}} strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. However, in the feature film Garfield Gets Real and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the 1 April (April Fools' Day) 1997 strip, Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, UV {{intensity}} can {{be higher}} or lower for surfaces at different angles to the horizontal. For example, if people are walking or standing outdoors, UV exposure to the eyes and vertical surfaces of skin, such as the face, <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> more severe {{when the sun is}} lower (though UVB:UVA ratio can also differ), such as the end of a summer's day, or winter afternoons on a ski trail. This is partly a consequence {{of the fact that the}} measurement equipment upon which the index is based is a flat horizontal surface.|$|E
30|$|As Maloney (1998) Bosch & Maloney (2008) and Levy (2008) point out, workers, {{especially}} poor workers, {{are highly}} mobile between sectors and hence workers <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> not <b>be</b> labelled as formal workers or informal workers per se. For simplicity we use these terms here but actually, {{when referring to}} an informal (formal) worker, we mean an individual whose current job {{at the time of}} data collection is in informal (formal) employment.|$|R

50|$|The Great Depression was {{regarded}} {{by some as}} a deflationary spiral. A deflationary spiral is the modern macroeconomic version of the general glut controversy of the 19th century. Another related idea is Irving Fisher's theory that excess debt can cause a continuing deflation. Whether deflationary spirals <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> occur <b>is</b> controversial, with its possibility being disputed by freshwater economists (including the Chicago school of economics) and Austrian School economists.|$|R
25|$|Reserpine-mediated {{depletion}} of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synapses {{is often cited}} as evidence to the theory that {{depletion of}} the monoamine neurotransmitters causes subsequent depression in humans (c.f. monoamine hypothesis). However, this claim is not without controversy. The reserpine-induced depression is considered by some researchers to be a myth, while others claim that teas made out of the plant roots containing reserpine have a calming, sedative action that <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> considered antidepressant. Notably, reserpine was the first compound shown {{to be an effective}} antidepressant in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.|$|E
25|$|Some {{claim that}} recent European antisemitic {{violence}} <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> {{seen as a}} spillover from the long running Arab-Israeli conflict since {{the majority of the}} perpetrators are from the large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and {{much of the rest of}} Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents. According to The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.|$|E
25|$|Studies of the eclipsing ternary Algol {{led to the}} Algol paradox in {{the theory}} of stellar evolution: {{although}} components of a binary star form at the same time, and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive ones, it was observed that the more massive component Algol A is still in the main sequence, while the less massive Algol B is a subgiant at a later evolutionary stage. The paradox can be solved by mass transfer: when the more massive star became a subgiant, it filled its Roche lobe, and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence. In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E
