50|$|Although local wahoo populations can be {{affected}} by heavy commercial and sports fishing pressure, wahoo as a species are less susceptible to industrial commercial fishing than more tightly schooling and abundant species such as tuna. Wahoo are regularly taken as a bycatch in various commercial fisheries, including longline fisheries for tuna, billfish, and dolphinfish (mahi-mahi or dorado) and in tuna purse seine fisheries, especially in sets made around floating objects, which act as {{a focal point for}} a great deal of other marine <b>life</b> besides <b>tuna.</b> In 2003, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council issued a Dolphin Wahoo Fishery Management Plan for the Atlantic.

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} and antioxidant {{effect of}} Majorana syriaca extract, obtained by ethyl acetate, to Yellowfin tuna was examined. The extract {{was added to}} refined corn oil at different concentrations (0 - 3900 ppm). Minced tuna was mixed with corn oil containing the extract (tuna/oil: 3 / 1 w/w); the mixture was packed aerobically and stored at 0 °C. Microbial growth and lipid oxidation were determined periodically. Majorana syriaca extract delayed the microbial growth (total viable count, Pseudomonas sp. and lactic acid bacteria) as compared with pure minced tuna, with an increasing effect as concentration increased. Oxidation was monitored through measurement of peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. Both tests showed inhibition of tuna oxidation as the concentration of the extract increased.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{potential}} trophic interactions among tuna larvae and other fish species, we studied the larval fish assemblages inhabiting the surface mixed layer around the Balearic Islands {{using data from}} two surveys carried out in summer 2006 and 2008. Despite the high diversity, Thunnus alalunga, Auxis rochei, Cyclothone pygmaea and Ceratoscopelus maderensis clearly dominated the catch in both years. The spatial distribution of several larval fish assemblages, in which tuna larvae were among the dominant species, {{was related to the}} presence of fronts and mixed Atlantic waters (AW). Different developmental stages of tuna were found in similar hydrographical scenarios. Smaller tuna larvae and plausible piscivorous tuna were found in the areas with mixed AW. Later in the season, potential piscivorous tuna were found together with small larvae from other non-tuna species that had been spawned later and transported by the fresh AW flow to offshore stations. That the different <b>life</b> stages of <b>tuna</b> co-occur with mesopelagic species in the mixed layer reveals the interesting possibility of ecological interactions between the different larvae...|$|R
40|$|Early <b>life</b> {{stages of}} <b>tuna</b> species were {{investigated}} {{along the northern}} coasts of Tunisia {{in the summer of}} 2010, from 7 to 14 July. A total of 74 stations, distributed on a regular grid, were sampled. Larvae of five tuna species were identified: the Atlantic bluefin tuna, the bullet tuna, the Atlantic black skipjack, the Atlantic bonito and the albacore tuna. Larval distribution patterns show that Atlantic bluefin tuna and albacore tuna usually spawn in offshore oligotrophic waters and Atlantic black skipjack larvae on the continental shelf. The widespread distribution of bullet tuna larvae, suggests that it spawns on the entire continental shelf and over the shelf break. The results from the quotient analysis carried out to characterize the spawning habitat of each species, show that the input of recent surface Atlantic water (AW) masses {{play a key role in}} the spawning strategy of tuna species, particularly in the case of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, whose larvae were mainly caught in the mixed waters resulting from the interaction between recent AW and resident AW, as demonstrated by their preference for salinity values between 36. 9 and 37. 4...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurse seine {{fishing on}} fish {{aggregating}} devices (FADs) has expanded considerably {{during the last}} 15 yr in tropical tuna purse seine fisheries, and FADs currently account for about 70 % of their reported tuna catches. The scientific community has expressed concern over {{the consequences of this}} fishing practice in terms of yield per recruit and suspected detrimental effects on FAD-associated tunas. To explore possible detrimental effects, we compared stomach fullness, fish plumpness, growth rate, and migration behaviour between free school and drifting FAD-associated tunas for skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis and yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares caught in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Significant differences in fish plumpness and individual growth rates were found, suggesting that individuals associated with drifting FADs were less healthy than those in free schools. Since stomach fullness indicated that tunas associated with FADs eat less than those in free schools, the difference in growth rate and condition could be the consequence of altered feeding patterns. For each species, significant changes in migratory direction and displacement rates were observed in the presence of drifting FADs. These findings support the hypothesis that FADs act as a super-stimulus, misleading tunas to make inappropriate habitat selection. However, further studies are required to investigate the long-term effect of FADs on the entire <b>life</b> cycle of <b>tunas...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of storage temperatures on the shelf <b>life</b> of yellowfin <b>tuna</b> (YFT) loins by studying of microbial, chemical and organoleptic changes. Shelf life of YFT was determined through changes in total aerobic bacterial plate counts (APC), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) trimethylamine (TMA), organoleptic properties and histamine development during storage at 0, 4 and 7 °C. Based on TVB-N value indices, YFT maintained an acceptable shelf life for 21, 17 and 12  days at 0, 4 and 7 °C, respectively. Nevertheless, YFT was rejected earlier by the sensory panellists than their TVB-N value indicated. Histamine development was found to be lower than the European Union safety level for 100  mg/kg fish during storage at 0 and 7 °C for 21 and 17  days, respectively. Aerobic bacteria initially dominated the micro-flora on YFT; however, as storage time increased, aerobic bacteria became dominant at cold storage, but the numbers exceeded the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) limit of 107  cfu/g in storage at 7 °C after 17  days. Therefore, it can be concluded that the storage of fresh YFT in below 4 °C has good enough to the shelf life of products (two weeks) ...|$|R
40|$|Early <b>life</b> {{stages of}} <b>tuna</b> species were {{investigated}} along the Tunisian east coast {{during the summer}} of 2008 by means of a larval survey conducted on board the R/V HANNIBAL. In this study we define the spawning grounds of tuna fishes in Tunisian waters and relate the tuna larvae spatial distribution to the hydrographic features and other environmental parameters. A total of 282 larvae of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, Linnaeus, 1758), 902 of bullet tuna (Auxis rochei, Risso, 1810) and 19 of little tuna (Euthynnus alletteratus, Raf, 1810), were identified. High larval concentrations of bluefin tuna were located offshore (mean = 200 ± 18 m), at sea surface temperatures ranging between 23. 7 to 25. 3 °C, whereas the highest concentrations of bullet and little tuna were located in shallower waters (mean = 135 ± 75 m), at sea surface temperature ranging between 25. 1 to 25. 9 °C. According to their preference for waters with surface salinities ranging between 37. 1 and 37. 8, spawning of these species seems to occur mainly in mixed waters. Stations where tuna larvae were collected showed oxygen concentrations between 6. 55 and 6. 85 mg l- 1, as well as low turbidity and chlorophyll a values, from 0. 2 to 0. 5 NTU a d less than 1 mg m- 3, respectively. These three environmental factors were weakly correlated with tuna larvae abundancePublicado...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{knowledge}} of stock mixing and migration patterns of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) {{is required to}} appropriately manage and conserve declining populations. The nursery origin of giant bluefin tuna present in the Gulf of St. Lawrence was identified using stable carbon (? 13 C) and oxygen (? 18 O) isotopes in sagittal otoliths. Anthropogenic and natural processes are capable of impacting atmospheric and oceanic concentrations of ? 13 C and ? 18 O, affecting otolith concentrations. Therefore, inter-decadal variation of ? 13 C and ? 18 O in the otolith cores (corresponding to {{the first year of}} <b>life)</b> of bluefin <b>tuna</b> was examined prior to stock predictions and temporal variability was detected in both isotope ratios. Significant changes in both ? 13 C and ? 18 O were recorded in the otolith cores of individuals with birthdates between 1947 and 2003. Both ? 13 C and ? 18 O varied significantly as a function of year of birth, with ? 13 C decreasing and ? 18 O increasing over the time period investigated (- 2. 39 ? 10 - 2 and 5. 78 ? 10 - 3 per year, respectively). The rate of change in otolith ? 13 C was nearly identical to the reported rates of atmospheric ? 13 C depletion, recently attributed to the burning of fossil fuels (referred to as the Suess effect). Observed shifts in otolith ? 18 O were less pronounced and likely linked to changing physicochemical conditions (i. e. salinity) in oceanic reservoirs over the time period investigated. The results show that otolith cores of bluefin tuna effectively track inter-decadal trends and record past oceanic ? 13 C and ? 18 O levels. After adjusting for inter-decadal trends, the isotopic composition of milled otolith cores of giants from three decades (1970 s, 1980 s, 2000 s) and three regions were compared to otolith ? 13 C and ? 18 O values of yearling bluefin tuna collected from eastern and western nurseries. Maximum likelihood estimates indicated that 99 % of bluefin tuna caught in the Gulf of St. Lawrence fishery originated from the western nursery, with no significant differences among the decades and regions examined. Results suggest that little to no mixing of eastern and western populations of adult bluefin tuna occurs in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, making it important for the management and conservation of the declining western population...|$|R
