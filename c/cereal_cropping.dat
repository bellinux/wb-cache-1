40|$|Engineering <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> {{that are}} {{self-supported}} by nitrogen fixation {{has been a}} dream since the 1970 s when nitrogenase was transferred from Klebsiella pneumoniae to Escherichia coli. A renewed interest in this area has generated several new approaches with the common aim of transferring nitrogen fixation to <b>cereal</b> <b>crops.</b> Advances in synthetic biology have afforded the tools to rationally engineer microorganisms with traits of interest. Nitrogenase biosynthesis has been a recent target {{for the application of}} new synthetic engineering tools. Early successes in this area suggest that the transfer of nitrogenase and other supporting traits to microorganisms that already closely associate with <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> is a logical approach to deliver nitrogen to <b>cereal</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the third and final}} part of a study {{attempting}} to analyse associations and communities in <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> of the Łuków Plain. It contains a description of intermediate and impoverished communities established in <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> of the Łuków Plain. Patches with phytocenoses without the combination of species characteristic of cereal associations were frequently observed. Impoverished communities of the alliance Aperion spicae-venti established in winter <b>cereal</b> <b>crops.</b> In turn, in spring <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> phytocenoses including species characteristic of tuber and root crops were found; they represented either a community with species characteristic of Panico-Setarion or an intermediate community with species characteristic of Aperion spicae-venti and Polygono-Chenopodion. Such communities are established, among others, because of production intensification which changes habitat conditions. Some patches found in the study area were intermediate between the two most frequently observed associations Arnoserido-Scleranthetum and Vicietum tetraspermae...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cereal</b> <b>crops</b> such as maize, wheat, {{and rice}} {{account for a}} {{majority}} of biomass produced globally in agriculture. Continuous economic and population growth especially in developing countries accompanied more intensive production of <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> to meet increasing demands for them as main staple foods and livestock feeds. However, imbalance between production and consumption of <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> which is inevitably reflected as their higher market prices, is becoming palpable in recent years. Stable production of <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> has been threatened by various abiotic and biotic stresses. One of the most threatening constraints is virus diseases. Especially, intensification of <b>cereal</b> <b>crop</b> production is often achieved by monoculture of a popular crop variety in a wide area. Such agroecosystems with low biodiversity is usually more conducive to biotic stresses, and may result in the outbreaks of existing and emerging cereal viruses. Numerous reports on incidences of various virus diseases of <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> attested that viruses have been a long-standing obstacle eroding yields of <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> worldwide. Despite of the evident economic losses incurred by virus disease of <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> the progress in basic research on virus species causing major diseases of <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> lagged behind compared to that carried out for viruses that can infect dicotyledonous plants. This was partially {{due to the lack of}} ideal experimental systems to investigate the interaction between viruses and monocotyledonous crops. For example, inoculation of many viruses to cereal plants still requires tedious manipulation of vector organisms, and reverse genetic systems are not available for many cereal viruses. However, application of latest molecular biology technologies has led to significant advance in cereal virology recently; transient gene expression systems through particle bombardment and agroinfiltration have been exploited to examine the functions of cereal virus proteins. Cell culture systems of vector insects enabled to investigate the molecular interactions between cereal viruses and insect vectors. Furthermore, RNAi technologies for vector insects and monocotyledonous plants facilitated identification of specific host and viral factors involved in viral replication and transmission cycles. Also, accumulating information on the genome sequences of <b>cereal</b> <b>crop</b> species has been simplifying the roadmap to pinpoint resistance genes against cereal viruses. The objective of this research topic is to provide and share the information which can contribute to advances in cereal virology by covering recent progresses in areas such as: 1) characterization of emerging viruses, 2) analyses of genetic and biological diversities within particular viruses, 3) development of experimental systems applicable to cereal viruses, 4) elucidation of the molecular interactions among viruses, vector organisms, and host plants, 5) identification of traits and genes linked to virus resistance in <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> 6) development of novel genetic approaches for virus resistance, and 7) assessment of epidemiological factors affecting the incidences of cereal virus diseases. Synergistic integration of ideas from such areas under this research topic should help to formulate practical alternatives to the current management options for virus diseases in <b>cereal</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat and}} range of pygmy bluetongues is very restricted, as {{individuals}} live in old spider burrows within areas of unploughed native grasslands, which have become rare due to extensive development of <b>cereal</b> <b>cropping</b> throughout the region. Since their rediscovery, surveys have estimated that 5,000 to 7,000 individuals live in scattered areas between Kapunda and Peterborough.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s the {{south-east}} of Western Australia {{was opened}} for agricultural purposes {{and the town}} was developed as a supply centre for the region. The government gazetted the townsite in 1966. The dominant agricultural industry in the area is sheep grazing and <b>cereal</b> <b>cropping</b> with cattle grazing and lupin cropping to a lesser extent. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.|$|E

50|$|Digitaria exilis holds high {{nutritional}} value to humans. It contains methionine and cysteine, two amino acids {{that are important}} to human survival. These two amino acids, however, are lacking in wheat, rice, maize, and other <b>cereal</b> <b>crops.</b> Moving from the amino acid level to the macromolecule level, D. exilis, compared to other <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> has greater protein, carbohydrate, and fiber content. Digitaria exilis has more protein and fiber content than rice. Additionally, D. exilis has more carbohydrate content than millet, sorghum, and maize. Therefore, the nutritional benefit from D. exilis outweighs the nutritional benefits from other similar <b>cereal</b> <b>crops.</b>|$|R

50|$|Goyder {{is named}} after former Surveyor General George Goyder who mapped Goyder's Line (of rainfall) in 1865. This map is still of great {{relevance}} to local <b>cereal</b> <b>cropping</b> as the line dissects the council area. It is also of great cultural importance to whole upper Mid North region of South Australia, with the 150th anniversary of Goyder's Line being celebrated in Orroroo, {{just north of the}} Goyder council area, in November 2015.|$|E
50|$|From the 1880s onwards {{the most}} {{important}} economic driver in the area has been <b>cereal</b> <b>cropping,</b> despite the proximity to Goyder's Line, which traditionally marks the geographic edges of agricultural viability in South Australia. Wallaroo is a significant sea port in South Australia and {{is the point of}} international export for many agricultural products originating on Yorke Peninsula and nearby parts of the South Australian Mid North. This especially includes seeds and grain products via the Wallaroo Grain Terminal.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s {{the area}} had {{significant}} change {{with the construction of}} the Waranga - Mallee channel, which bisects the town. Irrigation altered land use {{to the north of the}} town and to this day has made it very productive farmland. <b>Cereal</b> <b>cropping</b> and livestock production have been important industries in the Colbinabbin area.

50|$|The South Para River {{catchment}} {{is one of}} the key watersheds in {{the northern}} Mount Lofty Ranges. It plays an important role in the functioning of South Australia, providing much of the water used by Adelaide's domestic supply in the Northern Adelaide area. The rainfall in the South Para River catchment varies from 775 mm per annum in the north-east of the catchment to 675 mm per annum near Williamstown. Its waters are also used for livestock production, <b>cereal</b> <b>cropping</b> and recreation.|$|E
50|$|Sustainable {{production}} on marginal lands. Cassman et al. (2003) wrote that for large areas in poor {{regions of the}} world, “annual <b>cereal</b> <b>cropping</b> …is {{not likely to be}} sustainable over the longer term because of severe erosion risk. Perennial crops and agroforestry systems are better suited to these environments.” Current perennial crops and agroforestry systems do not produce grain. Grain provides greater food security than forage or fruit because it can be eaten directly by humans (unlike forage) and it can be stored (unlike fruit) for consumption during the winter or dry season.|$|E
