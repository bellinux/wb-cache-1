50|$|The 13th {{edition of}} the Wile <b>Cup</b> <b>bore</b> a new tradition; the Junior Championship. As the tournament gets older, so too do the {{children}} of the competitors. As the father of both the croquet club and the eldest child among the members, Daryl Wile decided to create a kid's event for the tournament weekend. The inaugural Junior Wile Cup Championship was a one-game playoff match, contested by Lachlan Wile, Audrey Wile, Robert Cruise, and Fraser Wile.|$|E
5000|$|He was a bay colt foaled in 1959 by Double Bore (GB), his dam, Mauna Kea was by Brimstone (GB). Bore Head's {{half brother}} Hillside, by Todman, was another useful galloper. Brother and sister Robert Chaplain and Carmel Burke owned Hillside and Bore Head, trained by D. Judd and Ron Dillon. [...] Bore Head won the 1963 Queensland Cup with Fred Clarke in the saddle, {{carrying}} just 7 stone 1 pound, defeating Booberanna, 1964 Ipswich Cup (dead-heat with Isaacson), 1965 Caulfield Cup, 1965 QTC Moreton Handicap, 1965 QTC Sir Winston Churchill Stakes and in 1967 the Australian Cup and the Doomben Cup. He {{was placed in}} several other top staying races including the Brisbane Cup and Moonee Valley Cup (twice). After winning the Doomben <b>Cup</b> <b>Bore</b> Head had a further 31 race starts without a victory.|$|E
5000|$|Killzone 3 was {{released}} on February 22, 2011 in North America, February 23 in Europe, and February 25 in the United Kingdom. 7-Eleven offered exclusive downloadable content for Killzone 3 in exchange for Slurpee purchases in stores in the U.S. which ran from February 2011 {{to the end of}} March 2011. 7-Eleven also featured Killzone 3 themed Slurpee cups, in addition to an exclusive Killzone flavor, [...] "Battle Fuel" [...] (a chilling orange flavor). Each Slurpee <b>cup</b> <b>bore</b> a unique code, allowing a download for Killzone 3 content (and other Slurpee rewards), such as content for PlayStation Home (the Helghast [...] "Capture Trooper" [...] and [...] "Jason Narville I.S.A." [...] costumes and a [...] "Slurpee Machine"), the Retro Map Pack, the [...] "Unlock and Load Pack", two PS3 XMB Themes (standard and Dynamic), a PC wallpaper, and an exclusive behind-the-scenes video.|$|E

50|$|The {{researchers}} at the site had expressed a worry that any tombs potentially located at the site might have been already raided by grave robbers searching for jewellery or ceramics. These fears were alleviated during an extraordinary find in August 2012; excavating a palace in the ruined city, archaeologists uncovered the ancient tomb of a young prince, alongside a rare artefact. A concealed entrance to a small burial chamber {{was found in the}} royal palace, leading to the remains of a 25-year-old man and nine ceramic objects. On one of the cups found, it contained a simple message saying, “is the cup of the young man/prince”. Another of the <b>cups</b> <b>bore</b> a date thought to be 711 A.D., giving some indication of when the monarch was alive.|$|R
40|$|Microscopy of coverslips {{that had}} been allowed to float on water from an {{aquarium}} standing over sand in a deep Petri dish revealed the presence of two kinds of colorless flagellates living in stalked, transparent vase-shaped houses (Fig. 1). One of the flagellates inhabits an urn-shaped house which in my material was invariably attached to the sheath around chains of the bacterium Sphaerotilus natans. The other flagellate builds flared cups on relatively long stalks attached directly to the substrate (Figs. 4 and 5). Collodion-coated grids for electron microscopy were placed {{on the surface of the}} water and on the following day were found to have been settled by the two flagellates, Sphaerotilus natans, and many other microorganisms. To the water in the dish was added an equal volume of 10 per cent neutral formalin and 10 minutes later the grids were removed, rinsed 3 times in large volumes of distilled water, dried in air, and without further treatment were examined in a Philips electron microscope (100 -A). The houses of the fagellates were transparent and were marked by closely spaced transverse lines (Figs. 2 and 3). The urn-shaped variety was striated only in its lower half, but the flared <b>cups</b> <b>bore</b> a pattern of similar but more widely spaced transverse lines right up to the lip. At first glance the lines seem to run parallel to each other but closer inspection reveals that those marking the flared cup shown in Fig. 4 are really turns of a very shallow helix. I am indebted to Mr. Roderic Pontefract of our laboratory for pointing this out to me. From a photograph (Fig. 1) and electron micrographs submitted to him since the Arden House Meeting, Professor E. G. Pringsheim of the Pflanzenphysiologisches Institut at the University of Goettingen, Germany, has recognized the flagellates as members of the genus Bikosoeca, discussed in detail by Picken (1941) and Pringsheim (1946). The precise identity of the organism shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is in doubt, but Figs. 4 and 5 are almost certainl...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the antibacterial, antifungi and hypoglycemic effects of methanol and water (ratio 70 : 30) extract of M. balsamina leaves and stem. Antibacterial and antifungi activities were investigated using the <b>cup</b> <b>bore</b> agar diffusion method; while the hypoglycemic effect was evaluated in alloxan induced diabetic rats. The extract of M. balsamina significantly inhibited Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive), klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative) to varying degrees, {{but it had}} no inhibitory effect on fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Mucor pusillus (fungi), and Candida albicans (yeast). Gentamycin, the standard antibacterial drug used was effective in inhibiting these bacteria. The effect on B. subtilis and E. coli were {{comparable to that of}} gentamycin. Ketoconazole, the standard antifungi used was effective against all the fungi and yeast species. The extract of M. balsamina also significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced blood glucose level in alloxan induced diabetic rats twelve hours after administration. The effect of the extract at 1000 mg/kg was comparable to that of the standard drug (chlorpropamide) used. These results support some of the traditional uses of M. balsamina as an antiinfective herb and for the management of diabetic sores...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the curtain}} fell {{in front of}} the throne and chamberlains came forward to lead me and Bes back to our lodging, one of whom took the <b>cup</b> and <b>bore</b> it in front of us. Down the hall we went between the feasting nobles who all bowed to one to whom the Great King had shown favour, and so out of the palace through the quiet night back to the house where I had dwelt while waiting {{audience}} of the King. Here the chamberlains bade me farewell, giving the cup to Bes to carry, and saying that on the morrow early my gold should be brought to me together with all that was needed for my journey, also one who would receive the bow I had promised to the King, which had already been returned to my lodgings with everything that was ours. Then they bowed and went.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} the antimicrobial activity of chloroform (CHCl 3) extracts of chyawanprash (Dabur India Ltd., Uttar Pradesh, India) and hydrolyzed chyawanprash against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus on nutrient agar media using cup plate method. Materials and Methods: CHCl 3 extracts of chyawanprash were prepared directly {{as well as}} by previously hydrolyzing with dilute HCl. Three test groups of 10, 20, and 50 mg/ml were prepared for each CHCl 3 extract, whereas ampicillin 20 mg/ml was used as standard group. Further, six agar plates were prepared for each group, i. e., three for E. coli and three for S. aureus. <b>Cups</b> were <b>bored</b> on each plate with the help of steel cup borer and cups on each plate were marked for identification. Extracts of different concentrations (i. e., 10, 20, and 50 mg/ml) were poured into cups and all plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, plates were observed for bacterial growth and zone of inhibition were measured. Results: Results showed that both CHCl 3 as well as hydrolyzed CHCl 3 extract of chyawanprash showed concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity. The largest zone of inhibition was observed at the concentration of 50 mg/ml of both CHCl 3 extracts of chyawanprash (12. 7 ± 1. 5 mm for E. coli and 15. 0 ± 1. 0 mm for S. aureus) and hydrolyzed chyawanprash (14. 3 ± 0. 6 mm for E. coli and 16. 3 ± 0. 6 mm for S. aureus). Conclusion: Chyawanprash possesses promising potential for use as an antimicrobial agent...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the little}} iron stove, the ink froze on the swing- {{table in the}} cabin, and I found it more {{convenient}} to go ashore stumbling over the arctic waste-land and shivering in glazed tramcars in order to write my evening letter to my owners in a gorgeous cafe in {{the centre of the}} town. It was an immense place, lofty and gilt, upholstered in red plush, full of electric lights and so thoroughly warmed that even the marble tables felt tepid to the touch. The waiter who brought me my <b>cup</b> of coffee <b>bore,</b> by comparison with my utter isolation, the dear aspect of an intimate friend. There, alone in a noisy crowd, I would write slowly a letter addressed to Glasgow, of which the gist would be: There is no cargo, and no prospect of any coming till late spring apparently. And all the time I sat there the necessity of getting back to the ship bore heavily on my already half-congealed spirits- -the shivering in glazed tramcars, the stumbling over the snow- sprinkled waste ground, the vision of ships frozen in a row, appearing vaguely like corpses of black vessels in a white world, so silent, so lifeless, so soulless they seemed to be.|$|R
