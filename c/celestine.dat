5|$|The Angevin-Neapolitan {{influence}} of <b>Celestine</b> {{was evident in}} his first consistory, during which he created twelve cardinals, including seven Frenchmen and three (or five) Neapolitans. This {{was the first time}} in history where a single consistory had swung the College of Cardinals so decidedly in one nationalist partisan direction. The cardinals who were not French or Angevin were members of Celestine's former order. <b>Celestine</b> also moved to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, where he continued to live much like a hermit until he resigned, as advocated by many Roman cardinals, including Benedetto Gaetani (who, a former lawyer, suggested that <b>Celestine</b> first publish a decree establishing the permissibility of papal abdication.) Gaetani, elected Pope Boniface VIII following Celestine's abdication, proceeded to have <b>Celestine</b> imprisoned while the legality of his abdication remained a prominent subject, and <b>Celestine</b> died a prisoner in 1296.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360parts per {{million in the}} Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral <b>celestine</b> (SrSO4) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO3). Of the two, <b>celestine</b> occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century <b>celestine</b> was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's <b>Celestine,</b> but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E

5|$|John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, died in December 1292. On 13 February 1293, Winchelsey {{was elected}} as his successor. Unusually, neither the pope nor {{the king had}} a hand in his election. On 1 April, Winchelsey left England for Rome to get papal confirmation. He was not consecrated {{immediately}} because of a papal vacancy; <b>Celestine</b> V eventually performed the ceremony at Aquila on 12 September 1294.|$|E
5|$|Before abdicating, <b>Celestine</b> re-enacted Ubi Periculum, the Apostolic Constitution of Pope Gregory X, {{which has}} governed all {{subsequent}} papal elections {{under the laws}} of the conclave. Two subsequent papal elections may be considered possible exceptions, although they adhered to {{the laws of the}} conclave to a great degree: the Council of Constance, which elected Pope Martin V to end the Western Schism, and the papal conclave, 1799-1800, for which Pope Pius VI suspended Ubi Periculum due to the interference of Napoléon Bonaparte.|$|E

While inspecting the earthquake damage during a 28 April 2009 visit to the Aquila, Pope Benedict XVI visited <b>Celestine's</b> remains in the badly damaged Santa Maria di Collemaggio and left the woolen pallium he wore during his papal inauguration in April 2005 on his glass casket as a gift.|$|R
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. <b>Celestine</b> V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|In 1197, Reginald Fitz Jocelin's successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, {{with the}} {{approval}} of Pope <b>Celestine</b> III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey, but the monks there would not accept their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219. Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206.|$|E
5|$|In January 1195 Geoffrey {{was ordered}} to appear in Rome to answer various charges, under the threat of {{suspension}} from office {{if he did not}} appear by 1 June. Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed, including an instance of the cathedral chapter throwing chrism on a dungheap in protest. Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey's projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates once more. This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a legatine council at York in June 1195. Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November, but was still unable to attend, which led Pope <b>Celestine</b> to order that Geoffrey's suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln. Hugh protested, and as a result <b>Celestine</b> himself suspended Geoffrey on 23December 1195, finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him. He travelled to Rome in 1196, where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by the pope.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} {{suggested}} that the Kir'Shara itself was similar in context to the Nag Hammadi library, which was a collection of thirteen codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 that date back to between the 2nd to 5th centuries. Unlike those codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress the revelation of the Kir'Shara {{in a similar manner}} to the Catholic Church's suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code or James Redfield's The <b>Celestine</b> Prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Simon of Southwell was {{a medieval}} English canon lawyer and canon who became {{treasurer}} of the cathedral chapter of Lichfield Cathedral. He served in the household of Hubert Walter, who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1193 to 1205.

5|$|Adrian V {{abolished}} Gregory X's strict {{regulations in}} 1276, but <b>Celestine</b> V, elected in 1294 following a two-year vacancy, restored them. In 1562 Pius IV issued a papal bull that introduced regulations {{relating to the}} enclosure of the conclave and other procedures. Gregory XV issued two bulls that covered the most minute of details relating to the election; the first, in 1621, concerned electoral processes, while the other, in 1622, fixed the ceremonies to be observed. In December 1904 Pope Pius X issued an apostolic constitution consolidating almost all the previous rules, making some changes, Vacante sede apostolica. John Paul II instituted several reforms in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and <b>celestine.</b> It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element {{that is highly}} reactive chemically. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals <b>celestine,</b> strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive {{and is one of the}} most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E
50|$|Appiano Buonafede {{was born}} in Comacchio, a Province of Ferrara, and died in Rome. He became a {{professor}} of theology while in Naples in 1740, and entering the religious body of the <b>Celestines,</b> rose to be general of the order.|$|R
5000|$|St. Joseph's Academy {{was founded}} as Mother <b>Celestine's</b> in 1840. Mother St. John Fontbonne and the Superior Sisters of St. Joseph were sent from Lyon, France to the territories of Cahokia and Carondelet. Upon their arrival, they opened a convent school. Following this, they founded the St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf in 1937. In 1841, Mother <b>Celestine's</b> {{moved from the}} log cabin {{that it had been}} founded in to a motherhouse in Carondelet, Missouri. In 1925, the Academy moved into Clayton, Missouri along with Fontbonne University. In 1946, the campus became too small for both the high school and the college, so the Academy decided to move to Frontenac, Missouri, its current location. In 1955, the new school opened.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Celestines</b> {{wore a white}} woollen cassock {{bound with}} a linen band, and a leathern girdle of the same colour, with a {{scapular}} unattached {{to the body of}} the dress, and a black hood. It was not permitted to them to wear any shirt save of serge. Their dress in short was very like that of the Cistercians. But it is a tradition in the order that in the time of the founder they wore a coarse brown cloth. The church and monastery of San Pietro in Montorio originally belonged to the <b>Celestines</b> in Rome; but they were turned out of it by Sixtus IV to make way for Franciscans, receiving from the Pope in exchange the Church of St Eusebius of Vercelli with the adjacent mansion for a monastery.|$|R
