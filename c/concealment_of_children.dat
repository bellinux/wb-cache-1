40|$|The {{current study}} sought to examine social {{identity}} factors that {{may contribute to the}} widespread failure of institutions to respond appropriately to allegations <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse. Six hundred and one participants completed a survey responding to items before and after exposure to a news article detailing an allegation <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse against a Catholic Priest. An intergroup bias effect emerged such that Catholics indicated less willingness to judge the allegation as valid than non-Catholic Christians who in turn indicated less willingness to judge the allegation as valid than non-Christians. This bias was reflected in participants’ attitudes to the alleged victim and the Priest as well as punitiveness should the Priest be convicted. Intergroup biases were particularly evident amongst those Catholic respondents who identified highly with their religious group. In comparison to low identifying Catholics, high identifying Catholics responded with more suspicion towards the accused, responded more positively to the Priest and less positively to the alleged victim, and recommended more lenient punishment of the Priest. There was no similar effect of identification for non-Catholics. This research has the potential to provide greater insight into social identity factors that may result in tolerance or <b>concealment</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse allegations where guilt of the accused is uncertain...|$|R

40|$|Congenital {{deafness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common childhood disorders and every year many children are born with permanent hearing loss. The present study was carried out to understand the experience of mothers with deaf children. This study was conducted with a qualitative approach. The participants were 35 mothers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with congenital deafness who were selected by purposive sampling. The data was collected through semi structured indepth interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis introduced by Braun and Clarke. Data analysis revealed 3 themes and 9 sub-themes including social stigma (prying eyes, pity aversion, feeling of discrimination, taunt from people), internalized stigma (feeling of inferiority, feeling of shame and embarrassment), and reaction to stigma(turning to concealment, cautious disclosure, and marginalization). Shame and stigma were the major experiences of Iranian mothers <b>of</b> deaf <b>children</b> that shadowed their lives. These experiences lead mainly to ineffective coping mechanisms such as avoidance of using hearing aids and <b>concealment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child’s</b> hearing loss. In addition, to cope with perceived stigma, mothers isolate and marginalize themselves and pursue secrecy strategies. Therefore, our findings are important for health professionals who are working with families having children with hearing loss. They need to aware of the problems faced by the families and should advocate necessary support. ...|$|R
6000|$|Had he felt {{during these}} years any qualms of {{conscience}} at this <b>concealment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>child's</b> sex? None. For to him the babe was sexless, as most befitted one who was to live and die {{at the foot of}} the altar. There was no attempt to deceive God; what mattered else? Nor was he withholding the child from the ministrations of the sacred sisters. There was no convent near the Mission, and as each year passed, the difficulty of restoring her to the position and duties of her sex became greater and more dangerous. And then the acolyte's destiny was sealed by what again appeared to Father Pedro as a direct interposition <b>of</b> Providence. The <b>child</b> developed a voice of such exquisite sweetness and purity that an angel seemed to have strayed into the little choir, and kneeling worshipers below, transported, gazed upwards, half expectant of a heavenly light breaking through the gloom of the raftered ceiling.

40|$|Descriptive and {{qualitative}} study aimed {{to identify the}} social representations of motherhood in women bearing children exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Performed between February and March 2011 in a hospital considered a benchmark in caring for people with HIV, with ten biological mothers {{with at least one}} child born exposed to the virus. Semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. Analysis of the testimonials determined the categories: guilt and fear of giving birth to a child with HIV, discrimination and <b>concealment</b> <b>of</b> having HIV, <b>child</b> overprotection, lack <b>of</b> family support, and religiosity as a way of coping. The social representations of the women was an organization of meanings that acted as a system for interpreting reality, governing the relations with the physical and social environment, thus determining behaviors and practices.

40|$|Article 12 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects <b>of</b> International <b>Child</b> Abduction allows an abducting {{parent to}} avoid the return <b>of</b> the <b>child</b> if the parent can show {{that more than a}} year has passed since the {{wrongful}} removal or retention <b>of</b> the <b>child,</b> and that the child is well settled in his or her new environment. In cases where <b>concealment</b> <b>of</b> the abducted <b>child</b> prevented a parent from filing a claim within one year of the abduction, the U. S. Courts of Appeals for the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have applied equitable tolling to delay the start of the temporal limitation. More recently, however, the U. S. Courts of Appeals for the First and Second Circuits have rejected the application of equitable tolling. The U. S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on this issue in December 2013. This Note argues that the text, drafting history, and underlying purposes of the Convention fail to support the application of equitable tolling. It then explains that the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits applied equitable tolling to the Convention—despite a lack of support for doing so—because they adhered to the American legal tradition of placing the rights of parents ahead of the rights and interests <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> Ultimately, this Note recommends that the Supreme Court reject the application of equitable tolling and instead instruct lower courts to consider the <b>child’s</b> <b>concealment</b> as part <b>of</b> their analysis <b>of</b> whether the <b>child</b> is well settled in his or her new environment. This proposed approach is consistent with the text and underlying goals of the Convention, and—like the application of equitable tolling—will work to deter child abductions...|$|R
40|$|This article reconsiders the way {{in which}} the State deals with the {{suppression}} or <b>concealment</b> <b>of</b> crimes, particularly <b>child</b> sexual abuse, by members of institutions such as churches. There are legal mechanisms available to bring such prosecutions and yet they are not being utilized. This article critically analyses the exemption from prosecution for concealing a serious indictable offence, by members of the clergy under section 316 (4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW); and that section’s relationship to the religious confession privilege under section 217 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The article deconstructs the three major justifications underpinning the legislative provisions. These justifications overlap, but can be isolated under the following headings: history, freedom of religion, and spiritual considerations. I argue that interpretation of section 316 (4) of the Crimes Act 1900 should, at a minimum, be confined to the scope of the religious confession privilege in section 217 of the Evidence Act 1995. Further, I argue that the justifications underpinning the legislative scheme and the assumptions they are based on are untenable in a secular society...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{sentencing}} {{of women}} convicted of infanticide offences at the Central Criminal Court between 1922 and 1949. A sample of 124 cases involving {{women who had}} been convicted <b>of</b> manslaughter, <b>concealment</b> <b>of</b> birth, or <b>child</b> abandonment/child cruelty, after appearing at the Central Criminal Court on a charge of murdering their newly or recently born infant, is examined. The sentences imposed in this sample mainly include short prison terms, suspended prison sentences, and conditional discharges/probation. It will be argued that the limited use of imprisonment, particularly in cases involving manslaughter convictions, indicates that Irish judges took a lenient approach to sentencing in cases of maternal infanticide. The court records show that a notable aspect of sentencing practice in these Irish infanticide cases is the use of non-penal religious institutions, mostly convents, as an alternative to traditional custody. The impact of patriarchal ideologies and pragmatic considerations on sentencing practice in cases of infanticide is explored, particularly in regard to the use of religious institutions. One of the questions considered is whether the approach to sentencing women convicted of infanticide offences was a unique product of the patriarchal, conservative, catholic, and nationalist philosophies of the Irish Free State, or whether sentencing practice in these cases reflects wider trends in the response to female criminality which have been identified elsewhere...|$|R
