40|$|The {{importance}} of seagrass beds and mangroves as a juvenile habitat {{as opposed to}} other shallow water habitat types is investigated using a single sampling method on four islands in the western Indian Ocean for <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus,</b> and on one island in the southern Caribbean Sea for Scarus guacamaia. Both species occur on the Red list of threatened species. Juveniles of <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus</b> were predominantly found on seagrass beds while adults were limited to the coral reef. The presence of seagrass beds resulted in significantly higher densities of the species on coral reefs in front of these habitats, indicating the {{importance of}} seagrass beds as a juvenile habitat. For Scarus guacamaia, juveniles were exclusively observed in mangroves while adults only occurred on the coral reef. Adult S. guacamaia occurred on all coral reefs along the sheltered coast of the island containing mangroves, but no relationship with distance to mangroves was observed.

For the first time we quantify the localized impact of the LRFT.

Total monthly catch and relative abundance (catch-per-unit-effort) declined significantly in several species, including the most valuable species the Napoleon wrasse (<b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus,</b> estimated changes of − 98 and − 78 % over 8 years in catch and relative abundance, respectively) and lower-value bluelined groupers (Plectropomus oligocanthus: − 99 and − 81 %) and Epinephelus groupers (− 89 and − 32 %). These severe declines were rapid, species-specific and occurred in the first 2 – 4 years of the dataset and are, we believe, directly attributable to the LRFT.

40|$|Bolbometopon muricatum (Valenciennes 1839), {{the largest}} of the scarine labrids (Choat et al. 2006), is an {{excavating}} parrotfish (Scaridae). The genus is monotypic comprises a distinct lineage within the group and is notable for its massive jaws and associated musculature (Bellwood 1994). The evolutionary history of the scarine labrids identifies them as a geographically widespread but relatively recent group, confined mainly to coral reefs. The lineage containing Bolbometopon diverged approximately 13 my bp (Alfaro et al. 2009). Although the parrotfishes have a number of distinctive morphological and nutritional traits recent phylogenetic analyses place them within the broader grouping of the Family Labridae (Westneat and Alfaro 2004). We now know that large wrasses such as <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus</b> (Chap. 12. 13) are more closely related to large parrotfishes such as Bolbometopon than they are to any of the smaller wrasses that inhabit coral reefs. B. muricatum is widespread on Indo-Pacific coral reefs with a distribution covering 37. 6 × 10 6 km 2 and extending from the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean and Indo- Australian archipelago to the central and southern Pacific excluding the Hawaiian Islands and the Marquesas.

Eight sites in Komodo National Park that included two fish spawning aggregation (FSA) sites were monitored for groupers and humphead wrasse, <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus,</b> from 1998 to 2003 and from 2005 to 2008 to examine temporal changes in abundance and assess the effectiveness of conservation and management efforts. Monitoring identified FSA sites for squaretail coralgrouper, Plectropomus areolatus, and brown-marbled grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus. Both species formed aggregations before and during full moon from September to December, prior to lapses in monitoring (2003 – 2005) and in enforcement (2004 - 2005). Following these lapses, data reveal substantial declines in P. areolatus abundance and the apparent extirpation of one aggregation at one site. Other non-aggregating species targeted by the LRFFT showed similar declines at three of eight monitored sites. This paper highlights the impact of FSA fishing {{and the need for}} a seamless monitoring and enforcement protocol in areas where aggregation fishing pressure is high.

40|$|Humphead wrasse, {{known as}} the Napoleon fish (<b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus),</b> is the largest living {{member of the family}} Labridae. It is slow growing but can grow to a maximum size {{exceeding}} 2 m and 190 kg. This species was the first commercially important coral reef food fish to be listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II in 2004 because of its vulnerable status and the ongoing threat to its conservation from international trade. Like many coral reef fishes, the humphead wrasse, <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus,</b> aggregate in reef areas when they spawn and this spawning behaviour makes them highly vulnerable to overfishing. Assessment of the spawning aggregations of this species was conducted in the municipalities of Sibutu and Sitangkai in the province of Tawi-Tawi, Philippines. Key informant interviews (KII) with fishermen, mariculturists, and other stakeholders and focus group discussions (FGD) with local government leaders, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management (FARMC) members, mariculturists, and exporters were conducted. Guided by the results of these KII and FGDs, underwater visual census of mameng (local common name for Napoleon wrasse) populations (juvenile and mature) were conducted to document spawning aggregation sites. Since there was no photo-documentation of actual spawning aggregations of mameng in the reef areas, indirect measures were used. Result of the KII and FGD indicated that the Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot and Tando Owak are major sources of spawners. Anecdotal accounts of Bajau fishermen showed that Dungun Dungon, Baligtang reef, Tando Owak and Tugalan are traditional fishing grounds for mameng spawning aggregations. From the length-frequency analysis of mameng caught by hook and line and fish pot in the Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot, the estimated length at maturity of this species was found to be 25 - 35 cm. There were 134 individuals caught within this size range so they are considered potential spawners. Another indirect proof used was the underwater documentation of juvenile humphead wrasse which were regularly observed and photographed in association with seagrass beds and branching coral reefs in Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot, Sitangkai. Gonadal study also indicated that the mameng caught in this area had mature and ripe gonads but the number of mature fish depends on the season. These were the basis of declaring Spawning Aggregation Sites in Tando Owak and Dungun Dungun in Sibutu and Baligtang Reef, Sipangkot and Tugalan in Sitangkai. These were declared as marine protected areas by ordinance of the municipal Sangguniang Bayan of the two municipalities. Management and enforcement plans have been developed and Bantay Dagat have been trained to protect the spawning aggregations and this strategy aims to protect the wild stocks of humphead wrasse. Protecting the spawners would ensure that there would be enough recruits, prevent recruitment overfishing and enhance the wild stocks...|$|R
40|$|Age-based {{demographic}} parameters {{were estimated}} from 164 individuals {{of the large}} teleost <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus</b> from NE Australia. Analysis of sagittal otoliths revealed alternating translucent and opaque bands in which annual periodicity of a single opaque band was confirmed. A size-at-age plot of 164 individuals showed that males grew significantly faster than females, achieving a size of 140 cm fork length (FL). Male growth trajectories were essentially linear. Maximum ages recorded were 25 yr for males and 30 yr for females. Estimates of annual total mortality ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 14. The age distribution of males suggests protogyny with male recruitment into the population commencing at 9 yr at a size threshold of 70 cm. The age distribution of females confirmed that not all individuals changed sex. Analysis of the sample size revealed a strongly skewed distribution with a modal size peak at 50 to 70 cm and an extended tail of larger individuals. Estimates of size distributions from underwater surveys revealed a right-skewed distribution similar to that observed in our sample. An analysis of size distributions in labrid fishes shows that large size (> 75. 0 cm FL) is rare (4. 5 % of 559 species). Demographic analysis of C. undulatus and of large labrid fishes demonstrates that they share a dynamic demography with fast indeterminate growth rates and relatively short life spans...|$|R

Protogynous hermaphroditism, previously proposed for this species, was confirmed in this study. Based on histological examination of 178 specimens, mainly < 500 mm total length (L T) and ranging from 208 to 1290 mm L T (119 · 1 g to 43 · 0 kg whole body mass), the minimum body sizes for female and male sexual maturation were determined to be 650 and 845 mm L T, respectively. Primary male development through juvenile sexual differentiation was not detected. A unique blind pouch, with a possible sperm storage function and associated with the testis, was reported {{for the first time in}} the Labridae. In Hong Kong retail markets, the global trading centre for this valuable species, live C. undulatus on sale for food were dominated by body sizes < 500 mm L T between 1995 and 2009, reflecting an international trade largely focused on juveniles.

40|$|In recent decades, {{spearfishing}} with SCUBA {{has emerged}} as an efficient method for targeting reef fish in deeper waters. However, deeper waters are increasingly recognised as a potential source of refuge that may help sustain fishery resources. We used a combination of historical catch data over a 20 -year time period and fishery-independent surveys to investigate the effects of SCUBA spearfishing on coral reef fish populations in the southern Mariana Islands. Two jurisdictions were studied; Guam, where SCUBA spearfishing is practiced, and the nearby Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), where SCUBA spearfishing has been banned since 2003. Fishery-independent data were collected using baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) stratified by depth, marine protected area status and jurisdiction. Herbivores (primary consumers) dominated spearfishing catches, with parrotfish (scarines) and surgeonfish/unicornfish (acanthurids) the main groups harvested. However, the large, endangered humphead wrasse (<b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus)</b> was the main species by weight landed by SCUBA spearfishers. SCUBA spearfishing was associated with declining size of scarines over time and catches shifting from a dominance of large parrotfishes to a mixed assemblage with increasing proportions of acanthurids. Comparisons between Guam and the nearby CNMI revealed differences in the assemblage of fished species and also greater size of scarines and acanthurids in deep water where SCUBA fishing is banned. These results suggest that SCUBA spearfishing impacts reef fish populations and that the restriction of this fishing method will ensure refuge for fis...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} reef {{ecosystem}} where corals {{may have lost}} their role as major reef engineering species but fish biomass and assemblage structure is comparable to unfished reefs elsewhere around the world. This scenario {{is based on an}} extensive assessment of the coral reefs of Farquhar Atoll, the most southern of the Seychelles Islands. Coral cover and overall benthic community condition at Farquhar was poor, likely due to a combination of limited habitat, localized upwelling, past coral bleaching, and cyclones. Farquhar Atoll harbors a relatively intact reef fish assemblage with very large biomass (3. 2 t ha(- 1)) reflecting natural ecological processes that are not influenced by fishing or other local anthropogenic factors. The most striking feature of the reef fish assemblage is the dominance by large groupers, snappers, and jacks with large (> 1 m) potato cod (Epinephelus tukula) and marbled grouper (E. polyphekadion), commonly observed at many locations. Napoleon wrasse (<b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus)</b> and bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) are listed as endangered and vulnerable, respectively, but were frequently encountered at Farquhar. The high abundance and large sizes of parrotfishes at Farquhar also appears to regulate macroalgal abundance and enhance the dominance of crustose corallines, which are a necessary condition for maintenance of healthy reef communities. Overall fish biomass and biomass of large predators at Farquhar are substantially higher than other areas within the Seychelles, and are some of the highest recorded in the Indian Ocean. Remote islands like Farquhar Atoll with low human populations and limited fishing pressure offer ideal opportunities for understanding whether reefs can be resilient from global threats if local threats are minimized...|$|R

Through 2655 face-to-face interviews conducted between August 2012 and July 2014, we used fishers' recall of past catch rates of reef-associated finfish to infer species disappearances from catches in five marine key biodiversity areas (Lanuza Bay, Danajon Bank, Verde Island Passage, Polillo Islands and Honda Bay). We modeled temporal trends in perceived catch per unit effort (CPUE) based on fishers' reports of typical good days' catches using Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling. Fifty-nine different finfish disappeared from catches between the 1950 s and 2014; 42 fish were identified to species level, two to genus, seven to family and eight to local name only. Five species occurring at all sites with {{the greatest number of}} fishers reporting zero catches were the green bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), humphead wrasse (<b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus),</b> African pompano (Alectis ciliaris), giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and mangrove red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus). Between the 1950 s and 2014, the mean perceived CPUE of bumphead parrotfish declined by 88 %, that of humphead wrasse by 82 %, African pompano by 66 %, giant grouper by 74 % and mangrove red snapper by 64 %. These declines were mainly associated with excess and uncontrolled fishing, fish life-history traits like maximum body size and socio-economic factors like access to market infrastructure and services, and overpopulation. The fishers' knowledge is indicative of extirpations where evidence for these losses was otherwise lacking. Our models provide information as basis for area-based conservation and regional resource management particularly for the more vulnerable, once common, large, yet wide-ranging reef finfish species...|$|R

Under laboratory conditions (25 Â°C, 2 â€“ 25 ppt) P. similis produced its first offspring on 2. 5 to 2. 8 days after hatching, and produced 4. 3 to 7. 8 offspring within 4. 0 to 4. 7 days life span.

The growth rate of P. similis was not significantly different when fed fresh N. oculata and super fresh Chlorella vulgaris -V 12 Â®. Total lipid per wet weight of P. similis fed by N. oculata and C. vulgaris were 2. 4 and 2. 6 %, respectively. The compositions of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (ARA) of P. similis fed N. oculata were 23. 2, 0. 0 and 5. 3 %, respectively, while these were 11. 0, 17. 5 and 0. 5 % respectively, when fed C. vulgaris.

40|$|Contrary to {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the world aquaculture production, fish production in Japan has been decreasing slightly due to the decreasing trend in seafood consumption of Japanese. Aquaculture production is approximately 20 % in terms of yield, and 30 % in terms of market value, of the country s total fisheries production. In Japan, about 80 species are targeted for release for sea ranching and resource enhancement purposes. The local governments (prefectures) are the main driving force in resource enhancement programs. Chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, and scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensisis are examples of successful resource enhancement in Japan. Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, and red seabream, Pagrus major, represent intensely released fish species in Japan, and around 10 % of the total catch of those species are estimated as released fish. The low price of products and increasing costs of production, such as costs of fuel and fish meal, are the major pressing issues in coastal fisheries and aquaculture in Japan. For aquaculture, the guarantee of food safety, minimization of environmental impact, and management of natural stock populations are highly {{necessary in order to}} achieve the sustainability of the industry. For resource enhancement, budget constraint is the major issue, and possible impact on natural stocks caused by released fish should also be considered. The Government of Japan (GOJ) is implementing some measures to rectify unstable business practices of aquaculture and to improve production techniques in aquaculture. For resource enhancement, the GOJ encourages cooperation among local governments (prefectures) for seed production and release of certain targeted species {{in order to reduce the}} cost and improve the efficiency of stock enhancement. In Japan, traditionally, the purpose for release was mainly sea ranching, namely harvesting all released animals. Nowadays, actual resource enhancement, i. e. the integrated release program including resource management and development of suitable nursery for released fish, is encouraged by the government. The evaluation and counter measures for the negative impact of stocked fish on genetic diversity of the wild population are also implemented. Recently, marked progress was achieved in seed production technologies of two important tropical fish species, namely coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus, and humphead wrasse, <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus.</b> These technologies are expected to contribute to the advancement of the aquaculture industry in the South East Asian region...|$|R
40|$|The humphead wrasse, <b>Cheilinus</b> <b>undulatus,</b> is {{the largest}} living {{member of the family}} Labridae, with a maximum size {{exceeding}} 2 m and 190 kg. Its geographic range covers much of the Indo-Pacific. The species is not common, recorded maximum adult densities rarely exceeding 20 fish/ 10, 000 m 2. Small individuals are typically associated with high coral cover; larger fish are found mainly on outer or deep reefs, steep slopes and passes, singly or in small groups and seagrasses. However, for reproduction the species forms small spawning aggregations of tens to more than one hundred fish. The diet of the humphead wrasse includes large invertebrates and small fishes. The species attains at least 30 years and reaches sexual maturation at about 35 - 50 cm total length and < 5 years of age. Most small adults are female while mainly males exceed 1 m and there is evidence of female to male sex change. The humphead wrasse is of considerable cultural value in some Pacific countries and is among the most prized in the live reef food fish export trade, for which it is often taken in its juvenile size range, either directly for sale or, increasingly, for grow-out to market size. It is also marketed chilled. The species is particularly sensitive to fishing pressure. In most fished areas, density and body size have dropped substantially. It appears to be particularly heavily targeted and depleted in SE Asia and in some places faces extirpation. The humphead wrasse is often taken by night spearfishing and by cyanide, with protection typically weak or non-existent, despite regulations and by a "vulnerable" assessment on the 1996 IUCN Red List. The humphead wrasse has not been reared successfully in hatcheries. Other giant reef fish share many similar problems and detailed study of the humphead wrasse contributes to a better understanding and conservation of all such species. This review examines and evaluates published and gray literature, original unpublished research and correspondence with almost 50 knowledgeable workers. It examines the value of such sources for quickly, but adequately, assessing the conservation and management status and key data gaps in species that are little known, vulnerable, difficult and expensive to study and may require urgent management or conservation action. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
