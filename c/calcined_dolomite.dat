The features of biomass fast catalytic pyrolysis in the apparatus are studied, whereas the kinetics model of biomass catalytic pyrolysis is presented.

40|$|The {{reversible}} {{absorption of}} CO 2 by CaO at high temperature is a promising method for capturing and removing CO 2 from a hot gas stream. The main challenge facing {{the use of}} this method is the deterioration of CO 2 absorption capacity when the method is applied over a large number of CO 2 absorption/desorption cycles. Although various techniques have been proposed for improving the cyclic stability and performance of calcium based sorbents, a cost effective method is still needed for industrial applications. Therefore, two promising methods for improving the cyclic stability were selected for further investigation. One method is to optimize the preparation conditions applied to various particle sizes of CaO precursors while the second method involves incorporating an inert material, MgO, in the sorbent. While applying the first method, it was discovered that the absorption capacity and stability of a sorbent derived from limestone is dependent on many factors including the initial calcination atmosphere, temperature and time as well as particle size. It was found that both the absorption capacity and stability were greater for a sorbent derived from 11 ym limestone particles than for one derived from a much coarser material. It was also found that by calcining the 11 ym limestone at 1000 oC for 1 hr in 50 vol% CO 2, the resulting sorbent had an initial absorption capacity of 7 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent which only declined to 6. 3 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent over 80 cycles of CO 2 absorption/regeneration. A sorbent prepared by calcining calcium acetate at 1000 oC for 1 hr in an atmosphere containing from 50 to 100 % CO 2 exhibited the highest absorption capacity among the materials tested. It was also reasonably stable over 40 cycles tested. One of the most promising sorbents was prepared from plaster of Paris (calcium sulphate hemihydrate) by treating the material with a cyclic oxidation/reduction process at 1070 oC. This sorbent exhibited an increasing trend in absorption capacity throughout a 200 cycle test of CO 2 absorption and desorption. For the second method for improving the cyclic stability of the sorbent, small amounts of MgO were incorporated in a sorbent as an inert diluent and structural stabilizer. It appeared that addition of MgO improved the performance of the sorbent in some cases depending on both the source of MgO and calcination conditions. However, this method did not seem to offer an advantage over the use of dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) alone, especially when the particle size of the dolomite was reduced by grinding so that it was more nearly comparable to that of the 11 ym limestone. A sorbent prepared by <b>calcining</b> the ground <b>dolomite</b> at 1000 oC for 1 hr in N 2 had an absorption capacity in excess of 8 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent over 80 cycles of CO 2 absorption/desorption...|$|R

This paper presents {{an evaluation of}} the resistance of ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) activated with <b>calcined</b> <b>dolomite,</b> as a novel alkali activator, to 5 % sodium sulfate attack and 5 % magnesium sulfate attack. Two calcined dolomites, D 800 and D 1000, were prepared in the laboratory at 800 °C and 1, 000 °C, respectively. The results demonstrated the good potential of using <b>calcined</b> <b>dolomite</b> activated slag in resisting sulfate attack. Immersion in Na 2 SO 4 Na 2 SO 4 (aqueous) led to an increase in strength in both the D 800 (D 800 S) and the portland cement CEM I 52. 5 N (PCS) activated slag with a more pronounced effect in the former and a decrease in the D 1000 (D 1000 S) activated slag. Conversely, <b>calcined</b> <b>dolomite</b> activated slag had less strength loss than PCS after MgSO 4 MgSO 4 attack. The products of sulfate attack and the deterioration processes are also analyzed by a range of tests, including pH, weight change, corroded depth, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). After Na 2 SO 4 Na 2 SO 4 attack, the main product on D 800 S and D 1000 S was gypsum with a larger amount in the latter. Gypsum, thaumasite, and M-S-H were the main products of D 800 S and D 1000 S after MgSO 4 MgSO 4 attack. The better resistance of D 800 S to sulfate attack was attributed to the absence of portlandite in the hydrated paste.

40|$|The catalyzed steam {{cracking}} of n-heptane {{was carried out}} using a fixed-bed reactor and different, commercially available limestone [CaCO 3], dolomites [CaMg(CO 3) (2) ], and NiMo/gamma-Al 2 O 3 as the catalysts. The {{steam cracking}} of n-heptane was investigated by variation of water and n-heptane partial pressure and by the additions of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to the water vapor at a total pressure of 101. 3 kPa. In the presence of <b>calcined</b> <b>dolomite</b> (1073 K), the partial pressure of water vapor (P-H 2 O = 9. 1 - 34. 2 kPa) enchances cracking efficiency, whereas hydrogen (p(H 2) approximate to 33 kPa) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 = 39 vol %), when added to the cracking mixture (973 K), do suppress conversion of n-heptane...|$|E
40|$|The Pidgeon {{process is}} {{currently}} the dominant silicothermic process route to produce magnesium. <b>Calcined</b> <b>dolomite</b> is briquetted with ferrosilicon and reduction is carried out at 1100 - 1200 degrees Celsius. The magnesium vapour extracted is removed using vacuum condition to condense as a dense metal. Thermodynamic analysis of this process {{has been carried out}} in the past to predict the distribution of the metal impurities in condensed magnesium. The results suggested that a number of impurities in different phases formed in the region between reaction zone and condenser. The thermodynamic results only are not sufficient to describe the process, and the knowledge of the kinetics of the Pidgeon process is required. Kinetics plays important role to give more insight to the process such as for process design and control...|$|E
40|$|Lime-ground {{granulated}} blast-furnace slag (GGBS) blends {{have been}} widely used in soil stabilization applications. More recently, reactive MgO-GGBS blends were shown to outperform lime-GGBS blends in terms of various engineering properties of the stabilized soils. Although the use of MgO or CaO in blends has been investigated, their combined use with GGBS has not. This paper considers the <b>calcined</b> <b>dolomite</b> as a source of MgO-CaO combination and investigates the use of calcined natural dolomite-GGBS blends in the stabilization of a clayey soil and a clayey silty sand. The influence of the calcination temperature, soil type, dosages of binder and curing period on the properties of the stabilized soils were studied by unconfined compressive strength (UCS), elastic stiffness (E 50), XRD analysis and SEM. This initial work revealed that calcined dolomite-GGBS blends are practical and are an effective option for soil stabilization...|$|E
40|$|At a total {{pressure}} of 101. 3 kPa, {{and in the}} presence of water vapor (P-H 2 O = 32 kPa), the impact of commercially available Norwegian and Swedish quarried mineral rocks on the gaseous product yields and selectivities generated during the catalytic steam pyrolysis of n-heptane (Pn-C 7 H 16 = 2. 9 - 4. 7 kPa) in the intermediate temperature range of 973 - 1073 K and GHSV 1200 - 4000 h(- 1) was investigated. The results indicate that the choice of calcined mineral particles as the bed material influences the product distribution of alkenes. In particular, calcined dolomites [CaMg(O) (2) ] suppressed the evolution of unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbon species; however, the formation of ethylene (C 2 H 4) was correlated. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism has also been proposed to describe the rate equation of the vapor-phase steam pyrolysis of n-heptane on <b>calcined</b> <b>dolomite</b> at 973 K...|$|E
