5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E

The investigation has showed that for a 275 kV 150 MVAr <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank,</b> the lifecycle cost of a C-type filter bank is 1, 73 times that of a plain <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank</b> and 1, 31 times that of a de-tuned <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank,</b> evaluated over a 20 years period. This high cost of the C-type filter bank is mainly due to the initial capital cost, as the operational cost of the de-tuned <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank</b> {{is higher than the}} other topologies. A change in the dielectric medium used for the capacitor units from PCB to all film dielectric has reduced the operational cost drastically. The performance of the C-type filter is better during inrush and transient conditions and therefore provides higher reliability. Additionally, a C-type filter has better harmonic performance, and provides harmonic damping over a range of frequencies...|$|R

25|$|Capacitors may catastrophically fail when {{subjected}} to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life. Dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid, resulting in case bulging, rupture, {{or even an}} explosion. Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially {{in the center of}} the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation. Proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A pseudo-exponential <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank</b> {{structure}} is proposed {{to implement a}} wide-band CMOS LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with linearized coarse tuning characteristics. An octave bandwidth VCO employing the proposed 6 -bit pseudo-exponential <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank</b> structure has been realized in 0. 18 - m CMOS. Compared to a conventional VCO employing a binary weighted <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank,</b> the proposed VCO has considerably reduced the variations of the VCO gain (VCO) and the frequency step per a <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank</b> code (step/code) by 2. 7 and 2. 1 times, respectively, across the tuning range of 924 – 1850 MHz.

25|$|If {{a purely}} {{resistive}} load {{is connected to}} a power supply, current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> or buried cable generate reactive power with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source {{during the rest of}} the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Sandia, with {{extensive}} experience in pulsed power delivery, designed the <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed {{that there was no}} way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing. Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.|$|E

2500|$|In field {{installations}} {{of electrical}} power distribution equipment, capacitor bank fault tolerance is often improved by connecting multiple capacitors in parallel, each protected with an {{internal or external}} fuse. [...] Should an individual capacitor develop an internal short, the resulting fault current (augmented by capacitive discharge from neighboring capacitors) blows the fuse, thus isolating the failed capacitor from the remaining devices. [...] This technique {{is analogous to the}} [...] "T metallization" [...] technique described above, but operating at a larger physical scale. More-complex series and parallel arrangements of <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> are also used to allow continuity of service despite individual capacitor failures at this larger scale.|$|E
2500|$|Induction {{machines}} {{are some of}} the most common types of loads in the electric power system today. These machines use inductors, or large coils of wire to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. When a voltage is initially placed across the coil, the inductor strongly resists this change in current and magnetic field, which causes a time delay for the current to reach its maximum value. This causes the current to lag behind the voltage in phase. Inductors are said to [...] "sink" [...] reactive power, and thus to cause a lagging power factor. Induction generators can source or sink reactive power, and provide a measure of control to system operators over reactive power flow and thus voltage. Because these devices have opposite effects on the phase angle between voltage and current, they can be used to [...] "cancel out" [...] each other's effects. This usually takes the form of <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> being used to counteract the lagging power factor caused by induction motors.|$|E
