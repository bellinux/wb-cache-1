50|$|Currently {{there are}} no active {{management}} initiatives specifically for the warpaint shiner. Though the warpaint shiner is considered a “special concern” in parts of Alabama and South Carolina, global populations are considered stable and secure. Habitat destruction resulting from deforestation, loss of riparian cover, siltation {{and the creation of}} impoundments pose the greatest risk to the warpaint shiner. The warpaint shiner is not a valued sport or pan fish and the population is relatively stable in most of its range. The management measures necessary to preserve these fish are beneficial not only to the warpaint shiner but to a myriad of stream dwelling fishes. The warpaint shiner also provides important forage for very popular sport fish such as the largemouth bass and smallmouth bass. Additionally, the warpaint shiner is known to be a host for the Tennessee heelsplitter, a federally endangered freshwater mussel. In their larval stage these mussels are parasitic and need to attach to the gills or fins of fish in order to mature into juveniles. Because freshwater mussels are the most endangered <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in North America, the protection of the fishes that act as hosts for the mussel larva is essential for the recovery of the species.|$|E

40|$|Benthic {{invertebrates}} inhabiting boreal rivers {{are exposed}} to very large seasonal variations in their physical environment. The extremes are in winter when the littoral area freezes solid and in spring when water flow increases rapidly. In the North Swedish river Vindelälven, the invertebrates fell into three main categories according to their seasonal lateral distribution. One <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> was stationary in the littoral zone and let itselt freeze into the ice, adopting a "take it" alternative. The category consisted of many species belonging to several higher taxa. By overwintering in ice, the animals avoided predation for nearly half the year {{and they were in}} the productive littoral {{at the same time as}} they thawed out from the ice in spring. On the other hand the animals had to withstand sub-zero temperatures. A typical representative for this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> was the semivoltine snail Gyraulus acronicus. It is a less mobile species connected to dense stands of macrophytes, which are found only in the littoral zone of the river. Nearly the whole population was found overwintering successfully enclosed in ice. Its shell and epiphragm could serve as mechanical protection when frozen into the ice. G. acronicus was cold-hardy only during late autumn and early winter, but it could stand prolonged sub-zero exposure during the proper time. A second category of animlas avoided being frozen by performing lateral movements to deeper parts of the river, adopting the Vleave it" alternative. No species tested in this category were found cold-hardy. It consisted of mobile species known to utilize sedimentated detritus which was only found in greater amounts in the littoral zone of the river. In springtime, prior to spring flood peak, these species colonized promptly the former frozen zone. This behaviour was most pronounced in several lentie mayfly species. An extreme case of migratory behaviour was found in the mayfly Pararneletus chelifer which not only moved towards the river bank but continued up into small tributaries. The shoreward movements of mayflies both allowed the nymphs to avoid the high current velocities in the central part of the river during spring flood time and to utilize the food resources in the flooded areas. A third <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> avoided the ice by living stationary in the sublittoral zone, adopting the "never face it" alternative. This category was dominated by filter feeders.

This study was aimed at examining how Finnish-speaking healthy elderly subjects (n = 30) and mildly (n = 20) and moderately (n = 20) demented AD patients utilize semantic knowledge to perform a semantic fluency task, a method of studying semantic memory. In this task subjects are typically given 60 seconds to generate words belonging to the semantic <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> Successful task performance requires fast retrieval of subcategory exemplars in clusters (e. g., farm animals: ‘cow’, ‘horse’, ‘sheep’) and switching between subcategories (e. g., pets, water animals, birds, rodents).

We measured the daily energy expenditure of mothers, helpers and offspring during peak lactation in cooperatively breeding meerkats Suricata suricatta using the doubly labelled water technique.

Most of the crayfish are produced in the southern United States (Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Mississippi) and most of that production is consumed in the same area.

Although the law is very complex, including a large number of issues, including general and special requirements on the units, care and housing of animals, animal species that can be used in procedures, there are a number of issues for which the law requires the development of a secondary legislation in areas such as: authorize breeders and users of laboratory animals, create a bank of organs and tissues of animal origin, able to reduce the number of animals used in experiments, authorization of projects, setting and punishing contraventions and others.

40|$|Resistance to {{anthelmintics}} in {{populations of}} gastrointestinal nematodes {{is a major}} concern in small ruminants. One solution to limit the spread of anthelmintic resistance is to apply treatments selectively by targeting the most susceptible animals within a flock. In dairy goats, previous studies have shown that, within a flock, goats in first lactation and those with high level of milk production were highly receptive to nematode infections. These results provided the rationale for targeted treatments. In dairy ewes, such epidemiological information on possible factors modulating the susceptibility to parasitism were still lacking. The objective of the current study was therefore to examine differences in the level of parasite infection and in the pathophysiological consequences in dairy ewes, depending on the age or on the level of milk production. In three farms, parasite egg excretion, and the serum concentrations of pepsinogen and inorganic phosphate were compared on one hand between primiparous and multiparous ewes; on the other hand, between ewes with the highest and the lowest level of milk production, within a cohort of 3 – 5 -year old animals. Overall, the results did not indicate significant differences for both either the parasitological or pathophysiological measurements depending on the level of milk production. In contrast, significant differences were found according to age, indicating higher levels of infections in the primiparous ewes than in the multiparous ones and suggesting that this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> represents a particular parasitic risk within a flock...|$|E
