40|$|The saving {{rate and}} amount of {{consumer}} savings has taken on heightened importance in both the cyclical and secular settings. Does the current low <b>consumer</b> <b>saving</b> rate imply that spending must grow less than income in coming months, therefore slowing economic growth? Does the large and soon-to-reach-retirementage Post WW II baby boom population have enough savings to continue to support consumption and economic growth over the next decade? To answer these questions, we first look at how well the standard NIPA saving rate measures savings, and we find it inadequate. We then turn to the more difficult task of determining the amount and adequacy of consumer savings for the large, soon–to–retire baby boom population.

40|$|We {{document}} {{the phenomenon of}} “bias for the whole, ” wherein greater value is perceived for money {{in the form of}} a whole (large denomination) than for equivalent amounts of money in parts (smaller denominations), resulting in a lower inclination to spend with the whole. We demonstrate across four experiments that the bias arises from greater processing fluency experienced in processing the whole as opposed to parts. This processing fluency is hedonically marked and generates positive affect that is attributed to the money, which results in an overvaluation of the whole, making one reluctant to spend with the whole. As marketing is conceptualized as an exchange process (e. g., Bagozzi 1978), the role of money as a medium of exchange makes it an important element in consumer behavior and economic theories.

For many years economists have tolerated the amalgam of good sense and bad psychology which is their microeconomic theory because of the empirical plausibility of its predictions.

This is exemplified by Houthakker's and Taylor's (1970) use of a consumer's "stock of habits" as a var. 3 ble in their demand equations, and by Katona's (1960) appeal to low levels of "consumer confidence " in his rationalization of the observation that <b>consumer</b> <b>saving</b> rates tend to-increase in times of unusual inflation.

40|$|The {{low rate}} of <b>consumer</b> <b>saving</b> in the U. S. {{is a source of}} concern to policy makers [5] as well as to {{consumers}} [6]. Financial educators have traditionally advised consumers not only to save more, but also to save systematically (see, for example, [3, p. 57] and [4, p. 148]). The ideal method of saving is assumed to be to treat saving as a fixed expense that must be met each pay period. Other methods include "residual saving, " or saving whatever income has not been spent {{at the end of a}} pay period, and "windfall saving, " which allocates most or all unexpected income to saving. What savings methods are consumers using? Does the savings method chosen affect the way consumers feel about their financial situation? This paper reports a study designed to answer these questions. Procedures A mail questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire was based on a modification [I] of the management framework proposed by Deacon and Firebaugh. A two-stage cluster sample of Kansas households was drawn. The first stage of the sampling procedure involved drawing seven counties at random from those Kansas counties which did not include a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) within their borders. The second stage involved selecting households at random from within the seven counties. Telephone listings comprised the sampling frame. Following the initial letter, three attempts were made to contact non-respondents, in accordance with the procedures recommended by Dillman [2]. Of the 1, 200 households contacted, 672 usable responses were received. The "typical " respondent was a married person in his or her late 40 's.

40|$|Installation of an evaporatively cooled hydroponic {{greenhouse}} on {{the roof}} of building can yield net energy savings for the combined structure, when compared to conventional air conditioning, and can conserve space by adding productive capacity to the rooftop. The proposed system offers energy and water savings far exceeding the levels achieved by traditional green roofs, but re-quires circumstances that favor co-location of a techni-cally sophisticated agricultural facility with the building. Compared with field agriculture, the hydroponic culti-vation of crops in greenhouses sharply reduces water consumption, requires no pesticides, uses several times less land, and doubles the growth rate. Integration of hy-droponics into the built environment also sharply reduc-es the distance from farm to <b>consumer,</b> <b>saving</b> transport costs, reducing waste, and increasing product quality. A 120 m 2 low-energy greenhouse was constructed in 2006 on a barge platform in the Hudson River Estuary, a temperate eastern North American climate. A staged cooling algorithm escalates from passive ventilation to active ventilation to evaporative cooling as a function of internal and external temperature. In a Mediterranean climate, a temperature differential as large as 15 C can be achieved by evaporative cooling in arid summer conditions. Placed on a building, the greenhouse could serve as a complete HVAC system, although higher air velocities will require customized design of building ventilation systems. A hypothetical 720 m 2 building of two stories in a Mediterranean climate is analyzed using a highly simplified spreadsheet model. Results indicate that this building adds only 9 % to the summer cooling load for a rooftop greenhouse of the same planform area. Required inputs include water (550 tons per year) and power for fans (23 MWh per year), but these inputs for the com-bined system are lower than the energy cost to cool the building alone using conventional air conditioning. For this purpose, it is assumed that the greenhouse is inde-pendently viable as an agricultural venture. 1...|$|E

Economy 7 can offer some <b>consumers</b> <b>savings,</b> but a careful analysis should be done. For example, if the price is double the normal tariff during the 'day' period, and half the normal during the 'night' period, then to break even the consumer would need to use over 2/3 of their energy during the 'night' period. Typically this holds true when heating/water is electric rather than gas, or if the supply is used to charge an electric vehicle overnight. An Economy 7 tariff can end up costing significantly more than a standard tariff without restructuring current energy usage.|$|R

40|$|The {{model is}} an {{application}} of the precautionary <b>consumer</b> <b>saving</b> model to the external debt policy of a small open economy. Let us assume that the welfare criterion of macroeconomic policy is the utility function of a representative infinitely living dynasty. This approach {{is in line with}} the intertemporal optimization model of the current account of Obstfeld-Rogoff [1995]. It is known that assuming differences in tastes or growth rates across countries imply unacceptably extreme long-run predictions in this model. We show that a model with uninsurable wage risks and precautionary behaviour leads to stable stationary indebtedness levels within the range of magnitudes observed in reality. Let us assume that the consumption function of the representative dinasty has the form of a CES function. The positive third derivative of this function and uncertainty together give rise to a precautionary behavior. As a result, countries who grow fast relative to their own time preference, will borrow, but their debt will be constrained by the risk that indebtedness implies. By similar reasoning, a patient or slow-growing country will lend but its lending will converge to an amount where the gained security that its reserves offer is equal to its opportunity cost. We parameterized the model assuming a drifting random-walk aggregate income with a standard error of 2 %, a habit factor of 80 % of the previous years income incorporated into the CES funtion, risk-aversion and time preference parameters taken from the literature, and found that typical indebtedness ratios observed in the world can be replicated as a policy outcome of our model, in contrast to deterministic models where the rate of the optimal indebtedness was in the range of 20 - 30 times GDP. The calculations are based on adaptation of the Taylor-series approximation of Skinner [1989]. A sensitivity analysis of the stationary solution to various parameters and various scenarios for effects of assumed shocks and consequences of catch-up growth paths for a converging country are calculated. In another section the problem is discussed whether the level of indebtedness can be considered a goal of macroeconomic policy and if it was a goal how could it be achieved. Let us assume agents with idiosynchratic uninsured wage risks. These risks are correlated but there exists an aggregate risk for the country as a whole. Aggregate risk has to be handled by macroeconomic policy. The optimum intertemporal consumption choice of the social planner (macro-policy maker) does not necessarily coincide with the sum of the optimal decisions of individual agents. Fiscal policy is the tool that creates consistency between the two. It is shown that the model with the parametrizations given above and a proportional income tax system implies that government debt nearly fully appears in external debt, i. e. Ricardian compensation is very close to 0. This means, that the fiscal tool is effective in enforcing the social optimum of indebtedness. ...|$|E
