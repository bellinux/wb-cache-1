40|$|A {{family of}} {{classical}} superintegrable Hamiltonians, depending on an arbitrary radial function, which are defined on the 3 D spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces {{as well as}} on the (2 + 1) D anti-de Sitter, Minkowskian and de Sitter spacetimes is constructed. Such systems admit three integrals of the motion (besides the Hamiltonian) which are explicitly given in terms of ambient and geodesic polar coordinates. The resulting expressions cover the six spaces in a unified way as these are parametrized by two contraction parameters that govern the curvature and the signature of the metric on each space. Next two maximally superintegrable Hamiltonians are identified within the initial superintegrable family by finding the remaining constant of the motion. The former potential is the superposition of a (curved) central harmonic oscillator with other three oscillators or <b>centrifugal</b> <b>barriers</b> (depending on each specific space), so that this generalizes the Smorodinsky–Winternitz system. The latter one is a superposition of the Kepler– Coulomb potential with another two oscillators or <b>centrifugal</b> <b>barriers.</b> As a byproduct, the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector for these spaces is deduced. Furthermore both potentials are analysed in detail for each particular space. Some comments on their generalization to arbitrary dimension are also presented...|$|R

5000|$|The above {{equation}} is valid for an adiabatic turbine passage; it {{clearly shows that}} while gas moving towards the center is getting colder the peripheral gas in the passage is [...] "getting faster". Therefore, vortex cooling is due to angular propulsion. The more the gas cools by reaching the center, the more rotational energy it delivers to the vortex and thus the vortex rotates even faster. This explanation stems directly from the law of energy conservation. Compressed gas at room temperature is expanded {{in order to gain}} speed through a nozzle; it then climbs the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>barrier</b> of rotation during which energy is also lost. The lost energy is delivered to the vortex, which speeds its rotation. In a vortex tube, the cylindrical surrounding wall confines the flow at periphery and thus forces conversion of kinetic into internal energy, which produces hot air at the hot exit.|$|E

The L 1527 dust continuum emission has a deconvolved size of 78 au × 21 au, and shows a flared disk-like structure. A thin infalling-rotating envelope is seen in the CCH emission outward of about 150 au, and its thickness is increased by a factor of 2 inward of it.

40|$|The {{fluctuation}} determinant, the preexponential {{factor for}} the instanton transition, has been computed several {{years ago in the}} Abelian Higgs model, using a method based on integrating the Euclidean Green' function. A more elegant method for computing functional determinants, using the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem, has been applied recently to a variety of systems. This method runs into difficulties if the background field has nontrivial topology, as is the case for the instanton in the Abelian Higgs model. A shift in thre effective <b>centrifugal</b> <b>barriers</b> makes the s-wave contribution infinite, an infinity that is compensated by the summation over the other partial waves.

The probability of chemical reactions and collisional energy transfer can be very large at temperatures near zero Kelvin.

A compact component around the protostar is clearly detected in the CS and SO emission. The velocity structure of the compact component of CS reveals infalling-rotating motion conserving the angular momentum.

Complex organic molecules (COMs) and doubly deuterated formaldehyde (D 2 CO) are detected {{above and below the}} dusty disk within ~ 40 AU of the central protostar. The COMs are methanol (CH 3 OH), deuterated methanol (CH 2 DOH), methyl mercaptan (CH 3 SH), and formamide (NH 2 CHO, a prebiotic precursor). We have modeled the gas kinematics in HCO+ and COMs, and found a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>barrier</b> at a radius of ~ 44 AU, within which a Keplerian rotating disk is formed.

Another deformed Hamiltonian is also shown to provide superintegrable systems on the usual sphere, hyperbolic and (anti-) de Sitter spaces with a constant curvature that exactly coincides with z.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the quartet potential energy surface for Li+NH {{and use it}} to calculate elastic and spin-relaxation cross sections for collisions in magnetically trappable spin-stretched states. The potential is strongly anisotropic but spin-relaxation collisions are still suppressed by <b>centrifugal</b> <b>barriers</b> when both species are in spin-stretched states. In the ultracold regime, both the elastic and inelastic cross sections fluctuate dramatically as the potential is varied because of Feshbach resonances.
