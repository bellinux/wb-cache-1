25|$|First, {{stakes were}} {{driven into the}} ground to roughly mark out the {{positions}} for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by theodolite measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. <b>Connector</b> <b>brackets</b> were attached {{to the top of}} each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using shears (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several metres apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.|$|R
40|$|DE 19950964 A UPAB: 20000725 NOVELTY - A movable element, {{forming a}} counter {{electrode}} and carrying a contact bracket, is coupled to the substrate (1) by a connector. There are two contact faces spaced by a gap. On applying a voltage between the bottom and counter electrode, the <b>connector</b> and <b>bracket</b> are moved towards the bottom electrode. Thus, the bracket is pressed against the contact faces to form an electrical contact. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The contact faces are formed by flexible, reversibly deformable material regions, set under bias voltage such that, in the contactless state, they deflect upwards, and on compression of the bracket, they are deflected downwards. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the manufacturing method. USE - For use with miniaturizing techniques in sub-mm range. ADVANTAGE - Reliable switching with low contact resistance...|$|R

50|$|The 1A2 {{system used}} a modular plug-in {{construction}} concept that permitted many configurations {{using the same}} basic components. A typical system consisted of a basic metal mounting frame, the Key Service Unit (KSU), also called a panel, with card-edge <b>connectors</b> and mounting <b>brackets</b> for components and punch-down blocks for interconnecting cabling. The principal switching and control modules were constructed on printed circuit boards, called Key Telephone Units (KTU). KTUs provided many system features, such as various types of line interfaces, dial intercom, music-on-hold, and alarms. Each central office telephone line connected to the system required at least one KTU.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{describes}} a low-cost, portable and flexible Sensor Configuration Unit (SCU) design {{for use in}} engineering measurements with various sensors. The unit consists of a sturdy ring stand, a plate with holes to hold various sensors, and a bracket fastened to the plate to hold the signal conditioning unit of the sensors and provide the input output connections. This puts the sensor to be used and its signal conditioning unit into a single central unit. The output from the sensor {{is connected to the}} measurements hardware and, more preferably, the computer data acquisition hardware, through the BNC <b>connectors</b> on the <b>bracket.</b> The set-up is very portable and has a minimal footprint on the experiment workbench. It eliminates the problems of many wires scattered around the workbench during experiments. The exchange of different sensors in the unit is easily carried out and enables purchasing standalone sensors for different engineering measurements applications for existing measurement hardware, instead of buying much more expensive all-in-one measurement units. This set-up is especially useful to an undergraduate measurement and instrumentation class in small size engineering programmes with limited budgets...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the seismic design of multi-storey buildings made from cross-laminated timber panels (‘crosslam’). The use of seismic analysis {{methods such as}} the modal response spectrum and the non-linear static (push-over) analysis is discussed at length, including {{issues such as the}} modelling of crosslam walls and connections, the evaluation of the connection stiffness, and the schematization of floor panels. It was found that it is crucial to account for the flexibility of the connections (hold-downs and angle brackets) between upper and lower walls, since otherwise the vibration periods of the building would be underestimated. The basics of capacity design to ensure the attainment of ductile mechanisms in crosslam timber structures under seismic actions are presented. The ductile failure mechanism is characterized by plasticization of <b>connectors</b> (hold-downs, angle <b>brackets</b> and screws) between adjacent wall panels and between panels and foundations. The crosslam panels and the connections between adjacent floor panels must be designed for the overstrength of the connectors to ensure that they remain elastic during the earthquake and the ductile failure mechanism is attained. Based on the results of preliminary quasi-static cyclic tests, a value of 1. 3 was found for the overstrength factors of hold-downs and angle brackets. A case study multi-storey crosslam massive wooden building was then analysed using the non-linear push-over analysis as implemented in the N 2 method recommended by the Eurocode 8. The building was modelled using shell elements and non-linear links to schematize the hold-downs and angle brackets. The building ductility, calculated from the bilinear curve equivalent to the actual non-linear push-over curve, was then investigated. Such a quantity, defined as the ratio of the displacement at the near collapse state and the maximum elastic displacement of the top floor, was found to rise from 1. 7 to 2. 5 when ductile instead of brittle hold-downs and angle brackets are used. Furthermore, the maximum peak ground acceleration the building can resist raised from 0. 2 g to 0. 4 g, demonstrating the importance of using ductile connectors in seismic design...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{composite}} beam in buildings has {{known to be}} more economical compared to bare steel beams with hot-rolled steel section, as the composite action between steel and concrete results in significant savings in steel weight and reduce the beam depth. However, the use of {{composite beam}} with cold-formed steel of lipped C-channel {{is yet to be}} established as the structural behavior of such beam is not well understood. This study presents and discusses the behavior of composite beam with cold formed steel section and innovative shear connectors. The composite beam comprises two cold formed steel of lipped C-sections oriented back to back to form I-steel beam and perpendicular metal decking concrete slab. Three types of <b>bracket</b> shear <b>connectors</b> namely single <b>bracket</b> (SBSC), double bracket (DBSC) and hot rolled plate (HPSC) shear connectors were developed and used; the proposed shear connectors were fixed to the web of steel beam by bolts. In addition, headed stud (HSSC) shear connector welded to the top flange of cold formed steel beam was also investigated. Push tests in accordance with Eurocode 4 were carried out to determine the strength capacity and ductility of the proposed shear connectors. Sequentially, full-scale beam tests were conducted to investigate the actual behavior of the composite beam with the proposed shear connectors. The length of full-scale specimen between supports is 4000 mm. Theoretical validation for the experimental results was performed based on the plastic analysis of composite beam. The experimental results of push tests showed very good strength with extreme deformation capacity for all <b>bracket</b> shear <b>connectors</b> suggesting that they are strong and ductile enough to provide composite action between steel beam and concrete slab. Also, it was observed that strength capacity of shear connector increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. For headed stud shear connectors, the stud possess strength capacity as high as its predicted strength. The results of full-scale beam tests showed very good agreement as compared to theoretical values that predicted based on push test results. The bending resistance and stiffness of the composite beams were improved up to 170 % and 270 % respectively as compared to non-composite cold formed steel beam. Composite beam with HSSC shear connectors showed the best performance as compared to composite beams with SBSC, DBSC and HPSC shear connectors. Also, the results showed that the bending resistance of the composite beam increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. It is concluded that the proposed composite beams with cold formed steel section are strong enough to be used in small and medium size buildings...|$|R
