He also held a job at Heathrow Airport. Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man who showed {{a great deal of}} interest in music. In 1969 he joined the Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage. He lived briefly in a flat above the Liverpool pub, The Dovedale Towers. When this band failed to take off, he joined a second band called Sour Milk Sea. However, by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.|$|E
5|$|Several ethnic {{minority}} communities have centred on Whitechapel Road. The road was {{a focal point}} of the Jewish Community from the 1850s to the 1930s, with many Jewish shops and market stalls. Towards {{the latter part of the}} 20th century, the street became an established settlement of the British Bangladeshi community, who now sell a range of authentic Asian food and <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market and on shop fronts. Altab Ali Park sits on the site of the original church at the western end of Whitechapel Road, and is a memorial to an Asian worker who suffered a fatal racial attack in 1978.|$|E

In the enlistment office are nude men undergoing physical exams, who can be seen from behind through a door which is opened and closed. Bow's breasts are revealed for a second during the Paris bedroom scene when military police barge in as she is changing her <b>clothes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> scene in which Rogers becomes drunk, the intoxication displayed on screen was genuine, as although 22 years of age, he had never tasted liquor before, and quickly became inebriated from drinking champagne. A boom was built with the camera mounted on an extension to shoot the Café de Paris scene.|$|E

5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|E

30|$|Most {{residential}} <b>clothes</b> washers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and Asia {{have been}} traditionally top-loading, vertical-axis washers (Pakula and Stamminger 2010). As estimated by Tomlinson and Rizy (1998), top-loading, vertical axis washers use {{an average of}} over 40 gallons of water and over 7700 British thermal units (Btu) of energy per load of laundry. From these averages, the authors estimated that nearly 1.4 trillion gallons of water and 270 trillion Btu of energy were used by these vertical axis washers annually nationwide. Clothes dryers are also significant energy users.

Nevertheless, every night Sir Thomas Heneage, Groom of the Stool, came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the City of London to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by jointure at Baynard Castle: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards.

25|$|After {{the conquest}} of the city, in 1462 Sultan Mehmet II (r. 1444–1446; 1451–1481) {{fortified}} the harbour, now known as Kadırga Limanı ("Harbour of the Galleys"), building several towers. However, {{the beginning of the}} construction in 1515 of a new arsenal on the Golden Horn, the Tersâne-i Âmire, protected from the storms provoked by the southwest wind, and the enormous growth of the Ottoman navy, caused the decay of the Kadırga Limanı. The 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles reports that around 1540 the women living in that neighbourhood used to wash their <b>clothes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basin. However, in some 18th-century maps, the harbour is still shown in active use. The end of the port was accelerated by the erection of the Nuruosmaniye Mosque, started in 1748, since the excavated earth was partly thrown in the harbour. The basin and the arsenal have since long time disappeared, and today they are partly built up.|$|E

The new {{building}} was designed by architect Joseph Emberton as a new and revolutionary retail establishment, the shop front windows exhibited the first curved glass display in Great Britain and the largest in the world at the time, these were designed so that no reflection would be cast to obscure the displays inside. The outstanding feature of the shop's interior was the travertine staircase that ran up through the centre of the store lit by a continuous window up the height of the building. The current lighting structure suspended through the staircase centre is the original from the 1930s as the building has since become a listed building.|$|E
