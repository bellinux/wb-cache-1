40|$|The {{technology}} development for a low-cost, roll-to-roll compatible <b>chip</b> <b>embedding</b> process {{is described in}} this paper. Target applications are intelligent labels and disposable sensor patches. Two generations of the technology are depicted. In {{the first version of}} the <b>embedding</b> technology, the <b>chips</b> are <b>embedded</b> in an adhesive layer between a copper foil and a PET film. While this results in a very thin (< 200 μm) and flexible system, the single-layer routing and the incompatibility with passive components restricts the application of this first generation. The double-sided circuitry embedding technology is an extension of the single-sided, foil-based <b>chip</b> <b>embedding,</b> where the PET film is replaced by a second metal foil. To obtain sufficient mechanical strength and to further reduce cost, the adhesive film is replaced by a substrate material which is compatible with the <b>chip</b> <b>embedding</b> concept. Both versions of the foil-based embedding technology are very versatile, as they are compatible with a broad range of polymer materials, for which the specifications can be tuned to the final application...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European project "HIDING DIES" an innovative <b>chip</b> <b>embedding</b> technology for integration of active component into printed circuit boards (PCBs) has been developed. Besides the successful development of a technology platform for <b>chip</b> <b>embedding</b> in the PCB manufacturing flow, the reliability of test vehicles was assessed. In this paper experimental results of reliability tests will be discussed. The tests were performed using thin <b>chips,</b> <b>embedded</b> into build-up layers of PCBs. The chip thickness was 50 m and the sizes varied from 2. 5 × 2. 5 mm 2 to 10 × 10 mm 2. The performed tests were high temperature storage, humidity storage, thermal shock and reflow tests. Additionally experiments with <b>embedded</b> Si <b>chips</b> without interconnects were performed in order to investigate the polymer interface behaviour after stress conditions. Finite element simulations were used for thermo-mechanical pre-optimization with respect to the desired functionality and operating condi tions. Reliability aspects were also investigated numerically before first tests with real devices were available, revealing points of potential defects...|$|R

40|$|At PCB {{manufacturing}} level, 50 m thin <b>chips</b> {{have been}} <b>embedded</b> with pitches up to 200 m {{in up to}} 18 "× 24 " panels. This paper shows the further developments in <b>chip</b> <b>embedding</b> technologies to incorporate chips with even smaller pitches. The technology developed in this study does not necessitate expensive redistribution layers for enlarging the pad pitch. Embedding of small pitch chips has been realised with concurrent developments in accurate chip positioning, plating methods and chemistries and ultra fine line patterning. The results in this paper show {{the emergence of a}} new prototype Embedded chip-QFN package with contact pads at 400 m pitch and a total number of 84 I/Os with dimensions of 10 mm× 10 mm. The <b>embedded</b> <b>chip</b> in the QFN package is 5 mm× 5 mm in size and has a peripheral pad configuration at 100 m pitch. All Embedded chip-QFN packages have been manufactured in 10 "× 14 " panels at prototype level. This paper also addresses all challenges for semi-additive processes for c opper structuring of <b>chip</b> <b>embedded</b> packages with pitches lower than 100 m. Qualitative analysis using acoustic microscopy and shear testing of the QFNs provides evidence of good resin adhesion and package mechanical robustness. This study shows promising results for <b>embedding</b> of <b>chips</b> with different contact pitches through alternative embedding strategies and in conjunction with developments for very dense copper routing, it provides strong evidence for the manufacturability of highly miniaturised <b>embedded</b> <b>chip</b> system-in-packages with a total thickness of 160 m...|$|R
