5|$|On 28 April 2015, the Augsburger Allgemeine, a German {{regional}} daily newspaper, {{published an}} article stating that according to Erich Bäcker, Lützow attempted an emergency landing at Donaumünster/Erlingshofen and crashed into the Danube. Bäcker made his claim based on reports made by eye-witnesses who saw a low flying Me262 <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Danube that day.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wall {{at the end of the}} line. The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E
5|$|Jules Naudet, a French cameraman, and Pavel Hlava, a Czech immigrant, videotaped the crash. A webcam {{set up by}} Wolfgang Staehle at an art {{exhibit in}} Brooklyn to take images of Lower Manhattan every four seconds also {{captured}} images of Flight11 <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North Tower. A WNYW newscamera left rolling on the ground also captured audio of the crash and video of the immediate aftermath.|$|E

5|$|Stewie {{discovers the}} Keebler Elves after <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tree, {{who plan to}} kill their competition: Snap, Crackle and Pop, {{with the help of}} Judd Hirsch's nuclear weapon, which Peter views while peeking through a ball return at the bowling alley. Later on in the bar, Crackle and Pop are seen {{discussing}} an attack by the Keebler Elves which apparently resulted in Snap's death.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean. These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing, flown {{to a maximum}} speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E
5|$|In the village, the Expendables find several armed female villagers {{guarding}} {{their children}} from Vilain's forces. The local inhabitants are taken and put to work as slaves in the mine, never returning, and the women ask for the Expendables' help. The Sangs arrive for more villagers, but are ambushed by the Expendables and killed. After locating Vilain and the mine, the team assaults the area with their plane before deliberately <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mine. The team saves the enslaved miners from execution, but Vilain and Hector escape with the plutonium. Vilain remotely detonates explosive charges in the mine; it collapses, trapping the miners and the Expendables.|$|E

5|$|On November 2, 2010, in a {{game against}} the Ottawa Senators, Phaneuf {{sustained}} an injury in the leg by having it cut open with a skate from Peter Regin while <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boards. He was carried off the ice immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said to be off the ice for four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on December 9, 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance {{and fell to the}} ice, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boards and {{catching}} his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very strong}} {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, the origin of which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> satellites.|$|E

5|$|Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> safety barrier between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the peaceful resolution of the Berlin Blockade.|$|E
5|$|Hornish began {{driving for}} Marlboro Team Penske during the 2004 IndyCar Series season in its No. 6 Dallara IR03-Toyota Indy V8, winning {{the season opener}} at Homestead-Miami in his first race with the team. After {{qualifying}} in 11th place at the Indianapolis 500, he battled for the lead with Buddy Rice and Dan Wheldon and led for nine laps (the first laps Hornish led in his Indianapolis 500 career). On lap 105, entering the main straightaway out of the fourth turn, Hornish tried to pass Darren Manning and Greg Ray's lapped car. They collided, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane; Hornish finished 26th, dropping to ninth place in the point standings. The rest of his season was sub-par, with two podium finishes. Hornish was seventh in the championship standings with 387 points, his worst finish since he placed 21st in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rindt {{switched}} to Formula Junior {{with the assistance}} of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria's leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old Cooper T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in Vallelunga, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at Cesenatico. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spectators at a race in the streets of Budapest.|$|E
50|$|The car chase between Cobretti and the Night Slasher was {{originally}} longer and ended differently. In the theatrical version Nightslasher shoots at Cobretti's car and causes him to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boat. In {{the original version}} Night Slasher and his driver are the first ones who <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boat; Cobretti fails to stop his car in time and <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> them. Shots of Night Slasher's car turning around and him breathing in relief after Cobra crashes his car were taken from an earlier part of the chase and the shot of Cobretti seeing the boat before he <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> it was actually taken from Nightslasher's car crash. In the theatrical version, Night Slasher's crashed car is still visible in scene where Cobretti <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boat.|$|R

5|$|On October 14, Japanese {{air forces}} {{attempted}} a reprisal against Task Force 38, but poor weather conditions complicated {{their search for}} the U.S. fleet. Only approximately 25 bombers {{made it to the}} vicinity of Task Group 38.2. VF-18's Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which had been flying above the task group continuously for almost two hours, was vectored to intercept these bombers just outside the task group's picket. They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers that emerged from the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 Snooper Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed to intercept, including one division led by Harris. His division had barely finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships. Harris exploded one midair then raked a second, sending it <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|The first {{engagement}} of Hull's command, on 2 September, resulted {{in three of}} the squadron's Hurricanes being shot down in return for two Messerschmitt Bf109s. On 4 September, Hull led a group of Hurricanes in a decisive aerial victory over coastal Sussex against a large group of Bf110s from ZGs2 and76. Flight Lieutenant Thomas Dalton-Morgan destroyed a Bf110 north of Worthing and chased another until it crashed near Shoreham-by-Sea, while Sergeant Jeffreys shot down another Bf110 in a field. Pilot Officer AEA van den Hove d'Ertsenrijck, from Belgium, pursued a fourth back out to sea and sent it <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> English Channel, but was hit himself and compelled to make an emergency landing at RAF Ford. Hull and Flight Officer Hamilton Upton together seriously damaged two more Bf110s.|$|E
5|$|The most {{acclaimed}} of the neo-noirs {{of the era}} {{was director}} Roman Polanski's 1974 Chinatown. Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years {{in a way that}} makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> present day with Taxi Driver (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed The Driver, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.|$|E

5|$|Howell {{spent eight}} months flying {{operations}} over Italy, conducting attacks against ground targets {{and engaging in}} sorties against aerial forces. While in Italy, he was credited with shooting down a total of nineteen aircraft. In one particular sortie on 12 July 1918, Howell attacked, in conjunction with one other aircraft, a formation of between ten and fifteen German machines; he personally shot down five of these planes and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He had previously been awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry in operations over the front. He was posted back to the United Kingdom in July 1918. In 1919, Howell was killed while {{taking part in the}} England to Australia air race. Piloting a Martinsyde A1 aircraft, he attempted to make an emergency landing on Corfu but the plane fell short, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea just off the island's coast. Both Howell and his navigator subsequently drowned.|$|E
5|$|That day, Lützow had led {{a flight}} of six Me262s of JV44 against a force of 256 medium bombers of the 322nd and 344th Bombardment Group (344th BG). Lützow's flight {{included}} Hauptmann Walter Krupinski and Oberleutnant Klaus Neumann. Two of the Me262s had to abort the mission due to engine problems. The remaining four, of which at least Lützow's and Neumann's Me262s were armed with the R4M air-to-air rockets, attacked elements of 344thBG. Following the first attack, at least three B-26 Marauder bombers were seen trailing smoke, when the Me262s came under attack by P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft of the 365th Fighter Group. Blue Flight leader Captain Jerry G. Mast and his wingman, Second Lieutenant Byron Smith, went into full power dives to drive the attacking Me262s away. Following the dive, Smith got separated from Mast and pursued an Me262. Mast and Second Lieutenant William H. Myers then jointly went after another Me262 which went into an even steeper dive. The Me262 was seen <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground and exploding. In Forsyth's account, the Me262 chased by Mast and Myers was Lützow's and had been flying furthest to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later in the lap Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota. The impact forced Kubica onto the grass {{at the edge of}} the track, where a bump launched his car into and along the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, the BMW flipped back across the track and came to rest against the barrier in the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wall of champions once again.|$|E
