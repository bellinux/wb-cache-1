Here we examine interference in a motor-learning paradigm to test whether rhythmic and discrete movements employ at least partially separate neural representations. Subjects were required to make circular movements of their right hand while they were exposed to a velocity-dependent force field that perturbed the circularity of the movement path. The direction of the force-field perturbation reversed {{at the end of each}} block of 20 revolutions. When subjects made only rhythmic or only discrete <b>circular</b> movements, <b>interference</b> was observed when switching between the two opposing force fields. However, when subjects alternated between blocks of rhythmic and discrete movements, such that each was uniquely associated with one of the perturbation directions, interference was significantly reduced. Only in this case did subjects learn to corepresent the two opposing perturbations, suggesting that different neural resources were employed for the two movement types. Our results provide further evidence that rhythmic and discrete movements employ at least partially separate control mechanisms in the motor system...|$|R

40|$|The {{synchronization}} and/or time acquisition {{problem in}} the presence of interferences has been strongly studied these last two decades, mainly to mitigate the multiple access interferences from other users in DS/CDMA systems. Among the available receivers, only some scarce receivers may also be used in other contexts such as F/TDMA systems. However, these receivers assume implicitly or explicitly <b>circular</b> (or proper) <b>interferences</b> and become suboptimal for noncircular (or improper) interferences.

40|$|Abstract- The “covariance ” {{of complex}} random {{variables}} and processes, when defined consistently with the corresponding notion for real random variables, {{is shown to}} be determined by the usual (complex) covariance together with a quantity called the pseudo-covariance. A characterization of uncorrelatedness and wide-sense stationarity in terms of covariance and pseudocovariance is given. Complex random variables and processes with a vanishing pseudo-covariance are called proper. It is shown that properness is preserved under affine transformations and that the complex-multivariate Gaussian density assumes a natural form only for proper random variables. The maximum-entropy theorem is generalized to the complex-multivariate case. The differential entropy of a complex random vector with a fixed correlation matrix is shown to be maximum, if and only if the random vector is proper, Gaussian and zero-mean. The notion of circular stutionarity is introduced. For the class of proper complex random processes, a discrete Fourier transform correspondence is derived relating circular stationarity in the time domain to uncorrelatedness in the frequency domain. As an application of the theory, the capacity of a discrete-time channel with complex inputs, proper complex additive white Gaussian noise, and a finite complex unit-sample response is determined. This derivation is considerably simpler than an earlier derivation for the real discrete-time Gaussian channel with intersymbol interference, whose capacity is obtained as a by-product of the results for the complex channel.

40|$|We study a stiff {{quasi-periodic}} {{orbit of}} the electromagnetic two-body problem of Dirac's electrodynamics of point charges. We expand the delay equations of motion about circular orbits to obtain the variational equations up to nonlinear terms. We study the normal modes of the variational dynamics with period {{of the order of}} the time for light to travel the interparticle distance. In the atomic magnitude these are fast frequencies compared to the circular rotation. We construct a quasi-periodic orbit with three frequencies; the frequency of the unperturbed circular rotation (slow) and the two fast frequencies of two mutually orthogonal harmonic modes of the variational dynamics. Poynting's theorem gives a simple mechanism for a beat of two mutually orthogonal fast modes to cancel the radiation of the unperturbed <b>circular</b> motion by <b>interference.</b> This mechanism operates when the two fast frequencies beat at the circular frequency, a no-radiation condition. The resonant orbits turn out to have unperturbed orbital angular momenta that are integer multiples of Planck's constant to a good approximation. This dynamics displays many qualitative agreements with quantum electrodynamics (QED); (i) the unperturbed frequency of each resonant orbit agrees with a corresponding emission line of QED within a few percent on average (ii) the unperturbed orbital frequency of a resonant orbit is given by a difference of two linear eigenvalues (the frequencies of the mutually orthogonal fast modes) and (iii) the averaged angular momentum of gyration is of the order of Planck's constant.

40|$|Cache-aided {{communication}} {{is emerging as}} a new topic in wireless networks. Previous works have shown that caching in interference networks can change the interference topology by changing the information flow and hence facilitate advanced interference management. This paper studies the gain of caching in partially connected interference networks where each receiver can only communicate with a subset of transmitters. The performance is characterized by an information-theoretic metric, normalized delivery time (NDT). We obtain an order-optimal NDT for the (K+L- 1) x K partially connected linear interference network with any number of receivers K, any receiver connectivity L <= K, and with caches equipped at all transmitters and receivers. The cache placement phase adopts a file splitting strategy tailor-made for the partial receiver connectivity. Via the aid of virtual receivers, the proposed delivery strategy exploits coded multicasting gain by XOR combining and transmitter coordination gain by interference alignment. In the special case when L is a divisor of K, our NDT results are directly applicable to K x K partially connected <b>circular</b> <b>interference</b> networks. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|Scaling up {{the number}} of base {{stations}} per unit area {{is one of the}} major trends in mobile cellular systems of the fourth (4 G) - and fifth generation (5 G), making it increasingly difficult to characterize aggregate interference statistics with system models of low complexity. This paper proposes a new <b>circular</b> <b>interference</b> model that aggregates given interferer deployments to power profiles along circles. The model accurately preserves the original interference statistics while considerably reducing the amount of relevant interferers. In comparison to common approaches from stochastic geometry, it enables to characterize cell-center- and cell-edge users, and preserves effects that are otherwise concealed by spatial averaging. To enhance the analysis of given power profiles and to validate the accuracy of the circular model, a new finite sum representation for the sum of Gamma random variables with integer-valued shape parameter is introduced. The approach allows to decompose the distribution of the aggregate interference into the contributions of the individual interferers. Such knowledge is particularly expedient for the application of base station coordination- and cooperation schemes. Moreover, the proposed approach enables to accurately predict the corresponding signal-to-interference-ratio- and rate statistics...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{based on a}} gedanken-experiment in the Ether hypothesis, that the {{difference}} of the two wave-propagations and the “optical ” path difference (OPD), or more simply the optical distance (OD) is the same only in systems resting in the conductive medium. In case of moving sources and moving observers, the OD is equal with the actual distance of the source and the observer {{from each other in}} the phase-space, and is not necessarily equal with the length of the wave propagation across the medium. It has turned out that the phase difference of the amplitude-splitted, and later reunited electromagnetic vibrations in the Michelson-Morley experiment will not change while the speed difference of the Ether-wind is changing, and/or the Michelson Interferometer is rotating. Only phase shifts with equal magnitude will occur at the observers, but the interferometer is insensitive to these shifts, and the observed frequency remains constant because of a double Doppler effect. Consequently, the <b>circular</b> <b>interference</b> fringes observed on the screen will not be dislocated. These results urge the revision of the significance of the Theories operating with relativity of Time and absolute constant light speed, refusing the existence of the Ether.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} focuses on {{applications}} and characterization studies of the vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) 157 nm F 2 laser. The laser ablation properties of various polymeric materials, namely polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the photo-resist SU- 8, nylon 66, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), Lexan polycarbonate and CR- 39 polymer have been investigated. The main priority was given to Lexan polycarbonate and CR- 39 polymer as new potential materials to explore using this laser. A considerable component {{of the work is}} directed at gaining {{a better understanding of the}} underlying physics of the laser interaction in relation to surface modification, in particular the possible limitations on surface roughness set by mode coherence effects. White light interferomety, and optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements are carried out to identify the processing conditions for micron scale size structures (cones) produced on the surface, and the realization of 'smooth' and in some instances intentionally 'roughened' surfaces after ablation. It is shown that exceptionally well defined conical structures can be formed on Lexan polycarbonate and CR- 39 polymer with certain laser processing conditions. These cones produce a <b>circular</b> <b>interference</b> fringe system with submicron period adjacent to their base as a result of walls reflections. An ablation model is used to analyse these fringes, and from the range of fringe visibility it is shown possible to estimate the spatial coherence properties of the F 2 laser beam. A preliminary investigation of ablating CR- 39 that had been exposed to an alpha particle source is described. This polymer is widely used for detecting ionizing particles by use of chemical etching to reveal their damage tracks. 157 nm laser ablation of chemically etched, radiation exposed samples showed the etched track 'pores' tended to be smoothed by ablation and also appeared to act as nucleation sites for cones. A fluorescence technique using Lumilass G 9 glass plate and a CCD camera was applied in this work to analyze the VUV laser beam. This required knowledge of using optical systems, a CCD camera, and capturing and analyzing bmp images for analysis in MathCAD. Measurements made in this way permit divergence to be found for the direct and the weakly focussed (asymmetric) laser output beam. Spatial coherence derived in this way is shown to be in reasonable agreement with that based on the cone interference result. The fluorescence method is also applied to characterizing small-scale beam fluctuations on the direct F 2 laser output beam. These are found to have a magnitude of a few %, a value that compares quite well earlier theoretical predictions and a simulation of spatial mode fluctuations in the narrow line-width, highly multimode F 2 laser.
