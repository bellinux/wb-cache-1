50|$|Bath cryostats {{are similar}} in {{construction}} to vacuum flasks filled with liquid helium. A <b>coldplate</b> is placed in thermal contact with the liquid helium bath. The liquid helium may be replenished as it boils away, at intervals between a few hours and several months, depending on the volume and construction of the cryostat. The boil-off rate is minimised by shielding the bath with either cold helium vapour, or vacuum shield with walls constructed from so-called super insulator material. The helium vapour which boils away from the bath very effectively cools thermal shields around {{the outside of the}} bath. In the older designs there may be additional liquid nitrogen bath, or several concentric layers of shielding, with gradually increasing temperatures.

The focus of this work was the development of unit cell modeling techniques for predicting the performance of coldplates with porous foam in the coolant path. Multiple computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models which predict porous foam <b>coldplate</b> pressure drop and heat transfer performance were constructed and compared to gain insight into how to best translate the foam microstructure into unit cell model geometry. Unit cell modeling in this study was realized by applying periodic boundary conditions to the coolant entrance and exit faces of a representative unit cell. A parametric study was also undertaken which evaluated dissimilar geometry translation recommendations from the literature. The use of an effective thermal conductivity for a representative orthogonal lattice of rectangular ligaments was compared to a porosity-matching technique of a similar lattice. Model accuracy was evaluated using experimental test data collected from a porous copper foam <b>coldplate</b> using deionized water as coolant. The compact heat exchanger testing facility which was designed and constructed for this investigation was shown to be capable of performing tests with coolant flow rates up to 300 mL/min and heat fluxes up to 290 W/cm 2.

The governing equations are solved by a finite volume method. The effects of shear thinning, given by the Carreau equation, and the viscous dissipation, characterized by the Brinkman number, are examined via the the friction factor, the Nusselt number, and the bulk fluid temperature for duct aspect ratios ranging from 1. to 0. 2. The results indicate that when viscous dissipation is present, the heat transfer from the heated surface of the duct is not significantly increased as the aspect ratio decrease (i. e., the area of heat transfer increases); however, with a decreasing duct aspect ratio the rate of increase of the bulk fluid temperature with axial distance is significant. Also, the product of the Fanning friction factor and the Reynolds number will not be significantly increased with decreasing aspect ratio for a shear thinning fluid. Consequently, the use of a duct aspect ratio near 1 will provide the best overall design for cooling ducts used in electronics <b>coldplate</b> heat removal systems when the flow is hydrodynamically developed and thermally developing. © 1992...|$|E

The method is based on first principles, the conservation laws for mass and momentum, and does not require any empirical inputs. Although {{it is necessary to}} use numerical means to extract results from the model, the solution task is accomplished by the use of a spreadsheet, without the need for complex software or large computer assets. The validation of the method was achieved by comparison of key results with those from a numerically exact simulation. The comparison included both local results and global results. For the local results, the accuracy of the analytical model was found to be in the 1 % range, while the global results from the model were accurate to about 4 %. The investigated manifold was a case study drawn from a problem involving thermal management of electronic equipment, in which an array of coldplates discharged spent air into the manifold.

40|$|Computer {{simulations}} can be intensive as is {{the case}} in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The computational cost can become prohibitive when using these simulations with multiobjective design optimization. One way to address this issue is to replace a computationally intensive simulation by an approximation which allows for a quick evaluation of a large number of design alternatives as needed by an optimizer. This dissertation proposes an approach for multiobjective design optimization when combined with computationally expensive simulations for heat exchanger design problems. The research is performed along four research directions. These are: (1) a new Online Approximation Assisted Multiobjective Optimization (OAAMO) approach with a focus on the expected optimum region, (2) a new approximation assisted multiobjective optimization with global and local metamodeling that always produces feasible solutions, (3) a framework that integrates OAAMO with multiscale simulations (OAAMOMS) for design of heat exchangers at the segment and heat exchanger levels, and (4) applications of OAAMO combined with CFD for shape design of a header for a new generation of heat exchangers using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). The approaches developed in this thesis are also applied to optimize a <b>coldplate</b> used in electronic cooling devices and different types of plate heat exchangers.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis {{is to improve the}} operational reliability of a power module and increase the efficiency of its associated cooling system by integrating the design of the cooler as part of the module. Power modules are increasingly used in a variety of applications ranging from aircraft and mass transport systems, to motor control and power conversion in the home. Reliability of the power module is very important in aerospace applications where the highest levels of safety and robustness are required while keeping the volume and mass of the module as low as possible. Certain parts of the power module such as the solder layer beneath the silicon device and the substrate are prone to failure with thermal cycling. The layer of thermal grease between the baseplate of the module and the heatsink significantly increases the thermal resistance between the electronic devices and the coolant fluid. The power module can be constructed so that some of the interfaces within the module which are prone to failure are improved or completely removed from the assembly greatly reducing the thermal resistance from junction to ambient. The research identified cooling methods which are able to cope with the increasingly high heat fluxes produced by power electronic devices. Jet impingement cooling was selected for testing and further development. An initial series of tests confirmed that liquid jet impingement can be used to generate high heat transfer coefficients for the efficient cooling of power modules. Results from experimental tests showed that directly cooling the substrate tile with jet impingement resulted in the devices being cooled more effectively compared to the commonly used serpentine <b>coldplate</b> and a direct-baseplate cooled jet impingement system. It was postulated that more efficient cooling can be achieved by targeting the hotspots on the substrate beneath each device with a carefully designed impingement array. A test apparatus was constructed to test a variety of jet impingement arrays to confirm the hypothesis. A second test apparatus was constructed to characterise the performance of the jet arrays in more detail using a thermal imaging camera to monitor the surface temperature of a single device. An optimal jet configuration was found for the efficient cooling of a single device. The work concluded that an improvement in efficiency and reliability can be gained by constructing power modules with integrated jet impingement arrays direct-substrate cooling the hotspots beneath the devices.
