But I, having chanced upon {{a certain}} M. de la Vrillière, a courtier of Vilmorin's stamp, with whom I had some slight acquaintance, and his purse being heavier than his wits, I spent a passing {{profitable}} evening in his company. This pretty gentleman hailed my advent with a delight that amazed me, {{and suggested that}} we should throw a main together to kill time. The dice were found, and so clumsily did he use them that in half an hour, playing for beggarly crowns, he had lost twenty pistoles. Next he lost his temper, and with an oath pitched the cubes into the fire, swearing that they were toys for children and that I must grant him his révanche with cards. The cards were furnished us, and with a fortune that varied little we played lansquenet until long past midnight. The fire died out in the grate, and the air grew <b>chill,</b> <b>until</b> at last, with a violent sneeze, La Vrillière protested that he would play no more.|$|E

40|$|UMR AGAP - équipe AFEF - Architecture et fonctionnement des espèces fruitièresPrediction of {{the timing}} of spring phenological events such as bloom and leaf-out has {{important}} uses in agricultural and ecological management and modeling. However, after decades of model comparison there remains no consensus model to predict the date of spring phenological events in perennial temperate trees across species and locations. This lack of consensus {{may be due to}} over-fitting resulting from high model complexity, use of parameters that have not been adequately validated, or omission of parameters that are sound biological indicators of dormancy breaking. The aim {{of this study was to}} construct spring phenology candidate models with biologically-based parameters and starting values to test hypotheses regarding chill accumulation duration and the impact of pre-bloom conditions. Bloom data for three cultivars of Prunus dulcis (almond) from three decades in California were analyzed. Across all three cultivars, models which accumulated <b>chill</b> <b>until</b> approximately 75 % of the heat requirement had been met, and did not integrate pre-bloom conditions, were substantially supported by the data. This suggests cold temperatures affect dormancy breaking well after the chilling requirement has been met and bud break timing is not substantially impacted by environmental conditions just prior to bud break. Fitting spring phenology using biologically based starting values estimated from bud break records may allow for the development of improved predictive models and improved approximations of critical phenological thresholds...|$|E

50|$|Chills is {{a feeling}} of coldness {{occurring}} during a high fever, but sometimes is also a common symptom which occurs alone in specific people. It occurs during fever due {{to the release of}} cytokines and prostaglandins as part of the inflammatory response, which increases the set point for body temperature in the hypothalamus. The increased set point causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold or <b>chills</b> <b>until</b> the new set point is reached. Shivering also occurs along with chills because the patient's body produces heat during muscle contraction in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point. When it does not accompany a high fever, it is normally a light chill. Sometimes a chill of medium power and short duration may occur during a scare, especially in scares of fear, commonly interpreted like or confused by trembling.|$|R

A total of 12 tests were conducted. Models of the test facility fill and vent systems, as well as the tank, were constructed. The objective of achieving tank fill in 5 minutes was met during the test series. However, liquid began to accumulate in the tank before it was chilled.

40|$|The green mirid bug Apolygus lucorum is a {{regional}} pest of multiple crops in northern China, and the survival {{and development of}} diapausing eggs during winter {{plays an important role}} in the population dynamics of this species. The effect of water on the survival and development of A. lucorum eggs was investigated using laboratory-induced diapause. Diapausing eggs were exposed to various humidity regimes under three conditions: (1) termination of diapause with exposure to warm long-day (WLD) conditions (i. e., 26 ± 1 °C and 75 ± 5 % relative humidity (RH) under a photoperiod of 16 hours light and 8 hours dark), (2) termination of diapause by chilling at 4 °C, or (3) during the post-diapause stage, i. e., from transfer to WLD conditions after <b>chilling,</b> <b>until</b> the hatching of nymphs. The results indicate that water availability is crucial for the post-diapause resumption of development of A. lucorum. However, exposure to excessive moisture was detrimental, as indicated by a decrease in diapause termination rate and a prolonged pre-hatching period of diapausing eggs, compared to limited moisture conditions. This implies that both too dry and too humid environmental conditions would suppress survival and postpone hatching of overwintered A. lucorum eggs, and might explain why this pest has not caused severe damage in either southern or western China where the respective climates are very humid or dry...|$|R

40|$|The polycythemia {{observed}} at high altitudes and in {{certain forms of}} pulmonary and congenital heart disease {{has led to the}} acceptance of the view that anoxia is an erythropoietic stimulus. In polycy-themia vera, however, the oxygen saturation of the arterial blood {{has been found to be}} normal. Ob-servers have, therefore, sought in the bone marrow itself for evidence of anoxia in this disease. Rezni-koff et al. (1) demonstrated changes in the capil-laries and arterioles in the bone marrow of patients with polycythemia vera and postulated decreased blood flow with subsequent anoxia as the erythro-poietic stimulus. Chemical evidence of such an-oxia has as yet not been obtained. It has likewise been maintained that marrow anoxia is the stimulus to red cell production in anemia, as for example, after hemorrhage. Re-cently, however, Grant and Root (2, 3) have de-termined the percentage saturation and oxygen tension of bone marrow blood in dogs made anemic by bleeding and found no significant difference from the control animals. These considerations led us to a study of the oxygen content in bone marrow blood in various diseases in man, adapting the method of Grant and Root. After the studies to be reported in this paper had been completed, the work of Berk, Burchenal, Wood, and Castle (4) on the same subject was published.

40|$|The {{level of}} three major polypeptides of 65, 60, and 14 kD {{increased}} {{in response to}} chilling unit accumulation in floral buds of a woody perennial, blueberry (Vaccinium, section Cynaococcus). The level of the polypeptides increased most dramatically within 300 h of chilling and decreased to the prechilling level with the initiation of budbreak. Cold-hardiness levels were assessed for dormant buds of Vaccinium corymbosum and Vaccinium ashei after different <b>chilling</b> treatments <b>until</b> the resumption of growth. These levels coincided {{with the level of}} the chilling-responsive polypeptides. Like some other previously described cold-induced proteins in annual plants, the level of the chilling-induced polypeptides also increased in leaves in response to cold treatment; the chilling-induced polypeptides were heat stable, resisting aggregation after incubation at 95 degrees C for 15 min. By fractionating bud proteins first by isoelectric point (pI) and then by molecular mass, the pI values of the 65 - and 60 -kD polypeptides were found to be 7. 5 to 8. 0 and the pI value of the 14 -kD polypeptide was judged to be 8. 5. Purification of the 65 - and 60 -kD polypeptides, followed by digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C and sequencing of selected fragments, revealed similarities in amino acid composition between the 65 - and 60 -kD polypeptides and dehydrins.

40|$|RENEWED {{interest}} in the etiology of endocarditis lenta has been a natural by-product {{of the availability of}} a series of agents with therapeutic promise. The success attendant upon the use of penicillin in treating Streptococcus viridans endocarditis lenta gave further impetus to similar attacks upon other etiologic backgrounds. Among these, Hemophilus influenzae and para-influenzae invited particular attention by reason of their sensitivity to streptomycin. The incidence of Hemophilus influenzae and para-influenzae endocarditis is probably less common than Thayer's 2. 94 per cent. 1 In 1940 Craven, Poston and Orgain 2 collected only 36 instances of this condition from the literature, to which they added two patients. Rose, 8 Hunter and Duane 4 and Martin and Spink 5 likewise emphasized its rarity. By reason of this circumstance and the remark-able clinical response to streptomycin this case record is posted: A 37 year old white farmer was admitted to the Wisconsin General Hospital, September 30, 1946, complaining of chills and fever. In the spring of 1945 the patient had noticed the gradual onset of malaise and easy fatigue. In about six weeks chills made their appearance.

Limited studies reported the application of this process in aquacultural products (Espinosa et al., 2016; Shakila et al., 2009), such as trout fillets (Gonzalez-Fandos et al., 2004), 2009) and carp (Can, 2011) {{and there are no}} reports on the opportunities to apply such process to molluscs. The aim of the present research was to test the effect of the application of the SVCC technique on fresh mussel microbiological characteristics. Commercial Mediterranean mussels (M. galloprovincialis) were individually inoculated with 100 µl suspension of Pseudomonas spp. (107 UFC/mL), packaged in a Oriented Polyamide/Polypropylene (OPA/PP, Orved S. p. A., Musile di Piave, VE, Italy) pouch and heat-sealed before being submitted to heat treatment in a steam oven (Lanoix Ali S. p. A., Treviso, Italy). After treatment, mussel pouches were immediately chilled at 3 °C. Six different time temperature combinations (75 / 85 / 95 °C for 10 and 30 min), were tested in triplicate (3 specimens/group) and compared to raw and inoculated mussels. Total aerobic bacterial count (TBC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), anaerobic sulphite-reducing clostridia, Pseudomonas spp. and pH were determined. All time/temperature combinations resulted in a substantial reduction of the Pseudomonas spp. population (< 1 log CFU/g) both in raw (4. 9 log CFU/g) and experimentally inoculated (5. 7 log CFU/g) mussels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of elevated carcass temperature in combination with rapidly declining pH or with postrigor muscle on turkey breast meat quality. Two groups of twelve turkey carcasses with similar ultimate pH values were selected based on 15 min postmortem (PM) breast muscle pH (rapid-glycolyzing (RG), pH 6. 0). One side of each carcass was held near 40 °C and immersion <b>chilling</b> was delayed <b>until</b> 110 min PM (DC), while the other side was chilled at 20 min PM (IC). Raw breast meat quality was assessed using measurements of colour and protein extractability, while quality characteristics of cooked product were assessed using cook yield and torsion gelometry. The extractability and degradation of 10 specific proteins was monitored using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Additionally, holding postrigor turkey breast meat at 40 °C was evaluated as a model for mimicking changes due to rapid PM glycolysis. Sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein extractability was reduced for breast samples from RG and DC carcasses as well as for postrigor meat held at 40 °C (P < 0. 05). All colour values ('L*a*b*') increased for DC ground breast meat. Strain at fracture for breast meat gels was lower for RG samples. Both stress and strain at fracture and cook yield were reduced for DC breast meat gels. The reduction in meat quality measurements was additive for RG samples that were delay-chilled. Densitometry of Western blot analyses revealed that the extractability of glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, and M-protein was reduced for RG or DC samples. Increased myosin degradation was observed for samples from either RG or DC carcasses with up to 20 % of myosin degraded in RG/DC samples. Nebulin degradation was also more extensive in RG samples than for controls. Heating postrigor breast increased myosin degradation, however, differences in the banding pattern of myosin fragments compared to samples from RG carcasses were observed. These results provide conclusive evidence that rapid PM glycolysis and delayed chilling have detrimental effects on turkey breast meat quality. The association of postmortem protein degradation with meat of reduced quality merits further investigations into the relationship between postmortem proteolytic activity and meat quality...|$|R

A whole day was passed in fruitless attempts to obtain fire, by various processes. Friction did not succeed; it probably never does with the thermometer at zero. Sparks could be obtained, but by this time everything was stiff with the frost. The food already cooked was soon as hard as bullets, and it was found that, on the second night, brandy that was exposed was converted into a lump of ice. Not only did the intensity of the cold increase, but everything, even to the human system, seemed to be gradually congealing, and preparing to become converted into receptacles for frost.

40|$|Gypsophisa has {{recently}} received considerable attention as a commercially produced cut flower in Japan, {{as well as}} in European countries and United State. However, non-uniformity of growth and failure to bloom have been serious problems in early forcing from autumn to winter. Although long-day is considered the primary environmental factor required to induce flowering, plants grow vigorously after exposure to winter chilling. This study was commenced to examine the difference in chilling requirement among 'Bristol Fairy' and how temperature govern the growth and flowering of gypsophila. 1. Flower bud initiation and development of Gypsophila paniculata L. 'Bristol Fairy' grown under field conditions were observed by means of a scanning electron microscope. In plants which were exposed to a sufficient amount of chilling during the previous winter, flower bud initiation took place when the average stem length was 18 cm. Subsequently, differentiation of sepals and petals occurred. Stamen primordia in the terminal floret were initiated around 30 April. Between 5 and 10 May, when shoots were in the visible bud stage, the pistil primordium appeared in the terminal floret. Following differentiation of floral organs, the style elongated and the petaloid stamens appeared. The petals and petaloid stamens expanded in succession which led to the dehiscing of the sepals, resulting in anthesis of the terminal floret on 30 May. In plants which were exposed to a limited amount of chilling, the flower bud initiation was delayed. It did not take place in buds located from middle to basal nodes on the main stem. However, after the apical meristem enlarged, differentiation and development of the floral organs in the terminal floret progressed at the same rate irrespective of the amount of exposure to previous chilling. 2. Twenty eight plants of 'Bristol Fairy' which showed different growth and flowering behavior, were selected. The influences of exposure to chilling on growth and flowering of these vegetative lines and cultivars were compared, by exposing them to different durations of natural chilling in winter. Flowering responses widely varied among selections. Some lines, such as line 11 and 20, hardly bloomed even when plants were exposed to natural <b>chilling</b> <b>until</b> 1 February. Each vegetative line responded to chilling similarly throughout three years. The non-uniformity of growth and failure to bloom in early forcing seem {{to be the result of}} these differences in chilling requirements among vegetive lines. The growth characteristics without exposure to previous chilling also varied among vegetative lines. The chilling requirements of cultivars became less in the following order, > 'Diamond' and 'Bristol Fairy' > 'Flamingo' and 'Red Sea'. From the results of statistical analysis, it was evaluated that range from 0 ℃ to 10 ℃ is most effective as chilling and high temperature above 15 ℃ nullifies chilling effects. Consequently, the differince in durations of chilling exposure required for flowering under natural conditions may be strongly influenced not only by the amount of chilling but also by the amount of high temperature above 15 ℃ to which plants were exposed during day time. 3. Application of 300 ppm 6 -benzylaminopurine (BA) promoted flower initiation and advanced blooming by about half a month in a heated plastic house under long-day conditions in 'Bristol Fairy' line 04, 08 and 13, but not in line 20. BA treatment also promoted flowering in line 08 and 13 even when grown in an unheated plastic house under natural daylength. However, this promotive effect of BA was not obvious when it was applied to the plants which were exposed to a sufficient chilling. BA seems to mostly substitute for chilling for the induction of flowering, and consequently plants treated with BA overcame unfavorable growing conditions. Gibberellic acid (GA_ 3) did not promote flower initiation in any lines. 4. To determine effects of high temperature on rosette formation and flower malformation, plants at different developmental stages were exposed to high temperatures after exposure to previous winter chilling. Initial exposure of vegetative shoots to high temperature (30 ℃ from 600 to 1800 and 25 ℃ at night) from 31 March to 10 April resulted in resette formation in those plants which require long durations of winter chilling such as 'Perfecta' and 'Bristol Fairy' line 20. Rosette formation occurred even when these plants were grown under optimum conditions. About 50 % of the 'Diamond' and 'Bristol Fdairy' line 03 shoots formed resettes after exposure to the high temperature; these cultivars require a relatively lengthy exposure to winter chilling to satisfy their rest requirements. Conversely, 'Flamingo', 'Red Sea' and 'Bristol Fairy' line 08 which require a little chilling did not form rosettes but bloomed. Exposure to the high temperature immediately after the onset of flower bud initiation resulted in shorter flower stalks and fewer nodes with inflorescences on the main stem. Flower malformation was induced when shoots were exposed to the high temperature around 30 April when stamen initiation in the terminal floret was occurring. Anatomical studies revealed that the flower malformation was related to an abnormally extended period of transformation of stamens to petaloid structures prior to anthesis. Meristematic activities of the stamen primordia were prolonged after an exposure to high temperature at this stage of floret formation. Consequently, cluster-like petaloid stamens formed around the meristematic tissue that resulted in increased number of petals. Malformed flowers occurred more frequently in cultivars and vegetative lines which require longer durations of chiling. These results show that the exposure to high temperature neutralizes the chilling effects for reproductive growth and induces the formation of rosette. Both rosettes and malformed flowers may be expressions of the transition from the reproductive growth (anther) to a vegetative growth (petal) at the meristematic level, as a result of exposure to high temperature. Prolonged vegetative growth was observed when plants were exposed to chilling in combination with high day temperature at 15 ℃ or 25 ℃. Therefore, high temperature above 15 ℃ during chilling exposure also nullifies its promotive effects for flowering. 5. Four vegetative lines of 'Bristol Fairy' were grown under natural conditions in autumn. Shoots of line 09 and 13 initiated flower bud. In contrast, shoots of line 04 and 20 formed resette. However, rosette formation was not accompanied by decreased new root growth. Line 13 and 20 were grafted on their own root and reciprocally, produced the scion/stock combinations of 13 / 13, 13 / 20, 20 / 13 and 20 / 20. The grafted plants were then exposed to chilling which was sufficient to promote flowering for ungrafted line 13 rooted cuttings but insufficient for those of line 20. The onset of shoot elongation was delayed and the percentage of blooming plants was decreased on 13 / 20, 20 / 13 and 20 / 20 graft combinations. Shoot elongation of 13 / 20 combinations was delayed nearly 6 weeks as compared with that of 13 / 13 plants. Plants of line 04 showed rapid growth after their shoot and root were chilled. All the plants with their shoot unchilled and root chilled bloomed during the chilling treatment. In this case, removal of the flower stalks after the chilling treatment resulted in rapid growth and high percentage of blooming in lateral shoots which had not been chilled. This suggests that the chilling effects were translocated from root to shoot and retained in basal nodes. These results indicate that the chilling roots have the great influence on shoot growth and consequent flowering in gypsophila. 6. In order to construct a forcing schedule with three floral flushes, effects of chilling exposure and BA application on the flowering were investigated, using 'Red Sea' and 'Bristol Fairy' selections. For the 1 st flush in November, foliar spray of 100 - 300 ppm BA was effective for advancing flowering time in 'Bristol Fairy'. Although the percentage of blooming in line 13 gradually decreased as the final pinching became later, plants treated with BA before 30 September showed 100 % blooming. However earlier flowering accompanied the occurrence of flower malformation. Cut flowers obtained from BA applied plants were shorter and less in volume. Exposure of rooted cuttings to chilling at 2 ℃ for 40 or 55 days before planting reduced days to bloom and improved cut flower quality. When rooted cuttings previously exposed to chiling for 40 days were planted on 15 September and applied 100 ppm BA on 30 September, cut flowers with sufficient length and volume were harvested in the mid to late November. Duration of exposure to natural chilling for more than 50 days (800 hr below 10 ℃) after the lst flush was required for vigorous shoot growth in line 09. Application of 300 ppm BA in combination with natural chilling also promoted the flowering. The 2 nd flush was harvested in mid April. The 3 rd flush was harvested from late June to early July, being 1 month later than natural flowering time. On the basis of these data, a forcing schedule with three floral flushes per one year was constructed by selecting vegetative lines with less chilling requirements, such as 'Red Sea' and 'Bristol Fairy' line 09 and 13, and by applying previous chilling exposure and foliar spray of BA...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Horticulture)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. Commercial {{production}} of sweet cherries has recently increased in South Africa, {{with more than}} 400 ha planted by 2006. Cherry, a high chilling fruit variety, is however not suited for the mild winter climate of South Africa. This was recognizable through common observed symptoms of delayed foliation and poor fruit set. In addition, cherry is exposed to long and hot summers in the postharvest period. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate cherry cultural practices that can manipulate (reduce) the trees chilling requirement under South African conditions. Cultural practices where aimed at increasing reserves (nitrogen, cytokinin and carbohydrates) in the tree. In addition, bud dormancy progression of cherry buds was quantified to determine the bud dormancy progression pattern under mild winter conditions. This was achieved through sampling of cherry shoots from different cherry production areas which was then forced in the growth cabinets. A model was developed to identify possible factors and groupings that can explain the cherry bud dormancy pattern. A model, comprising two joined straight lines, was fitted in order to characterize bud dormancy behaviour for sweet cherry cultivars under mild winter conditions. All cherry cultivars followed the expected pattern of entrance and exit from dormancy. Factor analysis showed that factors related to the entrance into dormancy primarily characterize bud dormancy behaviour. Bud dormancy patterns were also a function of environmental conditions within a year as shown by cluster analysis. In addition, buds entered dormancy in mid-summer and remained dormant <b>until</b> <b>chilling</b> accumulation commenced. Bud dormancy release was generally extended over a three to five-month period for all cultivars. Prior to spring budburst exit of both lateral and terminal buds occurred rapidly. Data indicate that there is no ecodormant phase for cherry under the prevalent climatic conditions in South Africa. Further experimentation was aimed at increasing reserves within the trees through cultural practices. In the nitrogen trials, fertilization in the postharvest period had no significant effect on field budburst or bud dormancy progression in one-year-old shoots. Time of flowering was advanced in N treatments during 2007 only. Yield was not significantly increased. Therefore, in this trial, N fertilization in the postharvest period did not significantly reduce the chilling requirement of mature sweet cherry trees under mild winter conditions. Application of particle films (Surround® and Raynox®) or ethylene inhibitors (Retain®) in the summer did not reduce the heat stress the trees experienced. Treatments had no significant effect on carbon assimilation, stomatal conductance, leaf surface temperature, fluorescence, bud dormancy, budburst, flowering and fruit set. Cytokinins sprays (benzyladenine) in autumn did not affect bud dormancy progression, spring budburst or flowering. Hydrogen cyanamide application in spring significantly advanced budburst, time to full bloom and increased yield. Promalin® and Retain®, however, had no significant effect on budburst, flowering or yield. It is therefore evident that cherry, due to its unexpected bud dormancy behaviour and its inability to be significantly influenced by several cultural practices, adapts poorly to South African climatic conditions through not reducing its chilling requirement significantly...|$|R
