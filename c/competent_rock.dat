50|$|One {{possible}} {{extension of}} this theory {{to match with}} the compressive stress theory (outlined below) is as follows (Goodman, 1989): The exhumation of deeply buried rocks relieves vertical stress, but horizontal stresses can remain in a <b>competent</b> <b>rock</b> mass since the medium is laterally confined. Horizontal stresses become aligned with the current ground surface as the vertical stress drops to zero at this boundary. Thus large surface-parallel compressive stresses can be generated through exhumation {{that may lead to}} tensile rock fracture as described below.|$|E

Artificial rock samples were fabricated by cementing sand and glass beads with sodium silicate binder. During uniaxial compression tests, the rock samples showed stress-strain behavior which was more similar to that of soils than <b>competent</b> <b>rocks,</b> exhibiting large permanent deformations with frictional slip. The mechanical behavior of the samples approached that of <b>competent</b> <b>rocks</b> as the amount of binder was increased. For very weak samples, acoustic waves propagating in these rocks showed very low velocities of less than 1000 m/sec for compressional waves. A borehole made within this weakly cemented rock exhibited a unique mode of failure that is called ''anti-KI mode fracture'' in this paper. The effect of cementation, grain type, and boundary conditions on this mode of failure was also examined experimentally...|$|R

The method requires that the hanging wall and often the footwall be of <b>competent</b> <b>rock</b> as the stulls provide the only artificial support. This type of stope has been used up to a depth of 3,500 feet (1,077 m) and at intervals up to 12 feet (3.7 m) wide. The 1893 mining disaster at Dolcoath mine in Cornwall was caused by failure of the stulls holding up a huge weight of waste rock.|$|E

50|$|Rock mass {{classification}} schemes {{are designed}} to account {{for a number of}} factors influencing the strength and deformability of a rock mass (e.g. joint orientations, fracture density, intact strength), and may be used to quantify the competence of an outcrop or particular geologic material.

The term rock mass incorporates the influence of both intact material and discontinuities on the overall strength and behavior of a discontinuous rock medium. While it is relatively straightforward to test the mechanical properties of either intact rock or joints individually, describing their interaction is difficult and several empirical rating schemes (such as RMR and SMR) are available for this purpose.|$|E

50|$|As {{shown in}} the visual analogy for {{detachment}} folds in fig 4, folds are found in rock strata above the decollement (paper: incompetent) while rock strata below it (table: competent, if it deforms it will fracture) remains undeformed, as shortening strain is concentrated at the rock strata above decollement. In a setting in which overlapping strata acquires contrasting competency, a decollement (interface between paper and table) is usually found along strata in <b>competent</b> <b>rock</b> unit (such as sandstone) or along the interface of competent and incompetent rock unit (such as an evaporite). A fold acquires higher amplitude, longer wavelength and broader width when rock strata above the decollement are subjected to shortening stress parallel to, or at a low angle to the strata. Apart from stress parameters, contrast of competency across strata and variation of displacement along the decollement are the main factors contributing to fold geometry and three dimensional growth pattern.|$|E
5000|$|A note of caution: A {{number of}} sigmoidal {{equations}} {{have been proposed}} that give rock mass modulus {{as a function of}} intact modulus and a rock mass rating. These equations may give a good estimate of modulus given the correct input data, however it is difficult to obtain reliable intact strength or intact modulus values from laboratory tests on samples from highly disturbed rock masses. Because of this limitation, something that is commonly done in practice is to base intact modulus values on test results done on good samples of intact rock from locations with <b>competent</b> <b>rock,</b> using either laboratory measurements of intact modulus or on an assumed ratio between intact strength and modulus for a particular rock type. This ignores the possibility that the material in zones with poor rock will often be highly weathered, and it ignores the possibility that even without weathering a zone of poor rock may represent rock which simply has a lower intact strength, and that is why it became disturbed while zones of stronger rock on the same project did not.|$|E

30|$|A {{fundamental}} paradox {{exists in}} employing target property differences {{to explain the}} observed crater density differences between melt pools and normal ejecta. Plescia and Spudis (2014) believed that the irregularly shaped small craters on the melt pools are self-secondaries that were formed on the still-molten melt pools. However, the target property difference scenario regarded melt pools as <b>competent</b> <b>rocks</b> that have much larger cohesion and smaller porosity than normal ejecta (Williams and Pathare 2015; van der Bogert et al. 2017). Nevertheless, even assuming that craters formed on melt pools are 2 times smaller than those on normal ejecta deposits assuming same impactors, the large crater density difference still exists (Xiao 2016; Zanetti et al. 2017).|$|R

We used an accelerometer with flat frequency response to 1000 Hz to record data at spacings of approximately 0. 25 to 0. 5 m along mine walls. First arrival times from the seismic data were used to produce P-wave velocity tomograms. The tomograms show transition from low velocity zones to velocity associated with <b>competent</b> <b>rock.</b> We interpret the low velocity zones to indicate residual fracturing from blasting.

The latter are not confined to the lithic rocks, but extend also to the clayey substratum, which is also highly tectonised, thus causing complex landslides, prevalently showing lateral spreading deformations, concentrated along the cliff margins.

50|$|In geology {{competence}} {{refers to}} the degree of resistance of rocks to either erosion or deformation in terms of relative mechanical strength. In mining 'competent rocks' are those in which an unsupported opening can be made. <b>Competent</b> <b>rocks</b> are more commonly exposed at outcrop as they tend to form upland areas and high cliffs or headlands, where present on a coastline. Incompetent rocks tend to form lowlands and are often poorly exposed at the surface. During deformation competent beds tend to deform elastically by either buckling or faulting/fracturing. Incompetent beds tend to deform more plastically, although it is the 'competence contrast' between different rocks that is most important in determining the types of structure that are formed. The relative competence of rocks may change with temperature, such as in metamorphosed limestones, which are relatively competent at low metamorphic grade but become highly incompetent at high metamorphic grade.|$|R

Nevertheless, it shows that deep underground structures in <b>competent</b> <b>rocks</b> are safer than surface structures, openings at shallow depth, and openings in fractured rocks, when subjected to earthquakes and subsurface blasts. Flow test results indicate that wet cement seals are less permeable than Charcoal granite. Sealing performance is severely degraded when cement seals are allowed to dry.

The calibration of borehole strainmeters using the solid Earth tides (or surface waves) means that it includes local structures, somewhat similar to a station correction in seismology. So, in contrast with data that are “absolute” (e.g., as GPS for instance), the borehole data are corrected for local structures. Moreover the instrumental sensitivity of the strainmeter is frequency independent over the range of concern.

On the eastern slope of Monte Gomito (located in the adjacent Torrente Motte valley) the same geomorphological features shown by the Rio delle Pozze valley DGSDs have been surveyed.

At elevated gravity, {{it is possible to}} match various dimensionless similarity parameters which were shown to govern large scale impacts. Observations of crater growth and target flow fields have provided detailed and critical tests of a complete and unified scaling theory for impact cratering. Scaling estimates were determined for nonporous targets. Scaling estimates for large scale cratering in rock proposed previously by others have assumed that the crater radius is proportional to powers of the impactor energy and gravity, with no additional dependence on impact velocity. The size scaling laws determined from ongoing centrifuge experiments differ from earlier ones in three respects. First, a distinct dependence of impact velocity is recognized, even for constant impactor energy.

Microbeads differ from quartz sand in grain shape and in low angle of internal friction. In this study, we compared the structural characteristics of microbeads and sand wedges. To obtain a better picture of their mechanical behavior, we determined the physical and frictional properties of microbeads using polarizing and scanning electron microscopy and ring-shear tests, respectively. We built shortening experiments with different basal frictions and measured the thickness, slope and length of the wedges and also the fault spacings. All the microbeads experiments revealed wedge geometries that were consistent with previous {{studies that have been}} performed with sand. However, the deformation features in the microbeads shortened over low to intermediate basal frictions were slightly different. Microbeads produced different fault geometries than sand as well as a different grain flow. In addition, they produced slip on minor faults, which was associated with distributed deformation and gave the microbeads wedges the appearance of disharmonic folds. We concluded that the glass microbeads may be used to simulate relatively <b>competent</b> <b>rocks,</b> like carbonates, which may be characterized by small-scale deformation features...|$|R
