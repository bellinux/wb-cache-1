40|$|Goldfish {{were trained}} to perform an operant {{response}} {{in order to obtain}} food, thereby allowing the food intake to be accurately determined. The normal daily food intake was established for each fish before it was given a sham operation or bilateral hypothalamic lesions. It was then observed over a period of up to 60 days. Lesions of the lateral areas of the hypothalamus were found to cause <b>cessations</b> <b>of</b> operant feeding of up to 60 days duration, and <b>cessations</b> <b>of</b> feeding on manually presented food of up to 35 days. Lesions of the anterior-medial areas were followed by <b>cessations</b> <b>of</b> operant feeding of up to 26 days. The post-lesioning food intake of fish lesioned in the posterior-medial area was {{similar to that of the}} control fish. No increases in operant feeding were observed after lesioning. The results are considered to be consistent with a genuine aphagia induced by lesions of the lateral hypothalamus...|$|R

5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes.

5|$|JNA and Croatian sources {{disagree}} on events immediately following {{arrival of the}} JNA in Dalj. While the JNA claimed it requested a <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> the fire only to be refused by the defenders of the police station, Croatian sources claim the JNA demanded the unconditional surrender of {{the police and the}} ZNG, and were refused by the Croatian force. Both versions agree that the combat resumed until approximately 10a.m., when three tank main gun rounds, fired by the JNA, hit the police station. While the JNA reported there were no Croatian policemen or ZNG troops captured alive, contradicting its own report stating that the Croatian force located outside the police station accepted <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> hostilities, the Croatian sources claim that those who surrendered were killed after their capture. Overall, 39 were killed in the fighting for the police station in Dalj—20 policemen, 15 ZNG troops and four civil defencemen.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is to {{evaluate}} the smoking <b>cessation</b> therapy <b>of</b> the working team of the Cancer Association and Lung Association of the State of Zurich. Roughly 1 / 3 of all 913 participants of the therapy from 1984 to July 1990 {{have responded to the}} survey. Of these 1 / 3, more than a quarter did not smoke any more one year after the therapy. An antismoking program with a 1 -year smoking <b>cessation</b> rate <b>of</b> 20 to 30 % is considered successful in professional circles. The smoking <b>cessation</b> rate <b>of</b> all 913 therapy participants is probably below the 27 % obtained in as much as the share of the successful ones among those replying, by experience is bigger than the share of those failling. Also the more precise inquiry in the first 7 therapies of 1990 confirms these findings. There the rate of success is barely 15 % after 1 to 1 1 / 2 year. It cannot be ascertained whether the smoking <b>cessation</b> rate <b>of</b> all therapy courses is that high or only at the time after the program restructurations at the beginning of 1990. Only a precise achievement control can guarantee a consequent and continuous therapy evaluation within the next years...|$|R

Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas.

This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} algorithms that assist {{physicians in}} the task of visually inspecting polysomnographic recordings to diagnose Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome. To this end, the algorithms generate visual metaphors that simplify the identification and characterization of several pathological events that occur in polysomnographic recordings: reductions and complete <b>cessations</b> <b>of</b> respiratory effort-measured both from thoracic movement and from abdominal movement- and snoring measured through a microphone which records ambient noise. These algorithms and the visual metaphors they give support to have been implemented in a desktop tool. The tool has been validated by a physician using five different polysomnographic recordings, with satisfactory results...|$|R

5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold.
