50|$|Whenever a <b>command</b> <b>character</b> is {{seen any}} text {{accumulated}} in the parser should be flushed. Since text {{might need to}} be flushed {{when there is no}} command pending, there is a null command known as the ETX command in the C0 command set.There are also two special commands, the Reset and DelayCancel. These must be parsed with lookahead. A Delay command issued previously can be canceled at any time with a DelayCancel command, so once a Delay is seen a decoder must look ahead for a DelayCancel, and only look for a DelayCancel. A Reset command on the other hand is sent to break out from an unknown decoder state and all data before it must be ignored.|$|E
5000|$|Input from a {{terminal}} never really [...] "ends" [...] (unless {{the device is}} disconnected), but {{it is useful to}} enter more than one [...] "file" [...] into {{a terminal}}, so a key sequence is reserved to indicate end of input. In UNIX the translation of the keystroke to EOF is performed by the terminal driver, so a program does not need to distinguish terminals from other input files. By default, the driver converts a Control-D character {{at the start of a}} line into an end-of-file indicator. To insert an actual Control-D (ASCII 04) character into the input stream, the user precedes it with a [...] "quote" [...] <b>command</b> <b>character</b> (usually Control-V). AmigaDOS is similar but uses Control-\ instead of Control-D.|$|E

50|$|A small, but {{significant}} change in gameplay are the Spirit <b>Commands,</b> <b>character</b> abilities akin to magic spells. All characters retain their set of six Spirit Commands when fighting alone, but when placed into a squad, a seventh Spirit Command is available, known as the Twin Command. This Twin Command, unique to each character, takes SP (Spirit Points) from both characters in the squad, and is generally {{more powerful than the}} other Spirit Commands available to them. This makes Original Generations the first game in the franchise to break the six Spirit Command limit.|$|R

5|$|Mysteries of Westgate is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that is based}} on the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, and uses the d20 System rules, which are based on determining the results of most tasks, such as attacks, by performing the equivalent of rolling a 20-sided die. The player begins the game by either importing their character from Neverwinter Nights 2 or creating a new one that starts at character level 8. Each character has a race (such as human or elf) and a class (such as fighter or wizard), which determine the character's main abilities. Mysteries of Westgate has gameplay similar to the original Neverwinter Nights 2 and uses the same systems for gameplay elements, such as character levels, combat, and magic. The gameplay takes place primarily from an overhead perspective in a three-dimensional environment. The player moves and <b>commands</b> <b>characters</b> with the mouse.|$|R

50|$|At {{first she}} {{was greeted by}} emir Bashir Shihab II, {{but over the years}} she gave {{sanctuary}} to hundreds of refugees of Druze inter-clan and inter-religious squabbles and earned his enmity. In her new setting, she wielded almost absolute authority over the surrounding districts. Her control over the natives was enough to cause Ibrahim Pasha, when about to invade Syria in 1832, to seek her neutrality, and this supremacy was maintained by her <b>commanding</b> <b>character</b> and by the belief that she possessed the gift of divination. She kept up a correspondence with important people and received curious visitors who {{went out of their way}} to visit her. Finding herself deeply in debt, her pension from England was used to pay off her creditors in Syria. She became a recluse and her servants began to steal her possessions because she was becoming senile. She would not receive visitors until dark and then would only let them see her hands and face. She wore a turban over her shaven head.|$|R
60|$|Alfieri and Schiller {{were again}} {{unconscious}} {{competitors in the}} history of Mary Stuart. But the works before us give a truer specimen of their comparative merits. Schiller seems to have the greater genius; Alfieri the more <b>commanding</b> <b>character.</b> Alfieri's greatness rests on the stern concentration of fiery passion, under the dominion of an adamantine will: this was his own make of mind; and he represents it, with strokes in themselves devoid of charm, but in their union terrible as a prophetic scroll. Schiller's moral force is commensurate with his intellectual gifts, and nothing more. The mind of the one is like the ocean, beautiful in its strength, smiling in the radiance of summer, and washing luxuriant and romantic shores: that of the other is like some black unfathomable lake placed far amid the melancholy mountains; bleak, solitary, desolate; but girdled with grim sky-piercing cliffs, overshadowed with storms, and illuminated only by the red glare of the lightning. Schiller is magnificent in his expansion, Alfieri is overpowering in his condensed energy; the first inspires us with greater admiration, the last with greater awe.|$|R
