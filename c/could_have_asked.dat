5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for more (he was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E
500|$|The episode premiered to near {{universal}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave it 9.6/10, {{and thought}} it was [...] "one of the most balanced and well-executed episodes of the series, Fringe fans get action, suspense, emotion, and best of all, some revelations!... This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off. Pretty interesting stuff. It's nice to finally have a reason to point at for Walter's craziness".|$|E
2500|$|Raeder {{was pleased}} with L端tjens. He {{described}} his operation in the Atlantic as [...] "beyond reproach. He invariably judged the situation accurately and he met with deserved success." [...] Raeder's glowing endorsement was likely caused by L端tjens' rigid adherence to his commander-in-chief's instructions. The Seekriegsleitung was more critical. It acknowledged the restrictions placed upon L端tjens but thought L端tjens <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for greater freedom of action after the encounter with Ramillies. The staff officers believed Hoffman's tactical assessment of the situation had been correct.|$|E

2500|$|Not all {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Federalist No. 70 justifies {{the role that}} the President has played {{in the war on terror}} up to this point. Some scholars contend that President Bush's foreign policy decisions exceeded his presidential powers granted by the Constitution. Further, critics of the Bush Administration argue that any executive, as envisioned by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 70, must act within the limits imposed by other provisions of the United States Constitution [...] and that the concept of the unitary executive does not allow the president to work outside laws passed by Congress, even when they conflict with national security interests. These critics argue that President Bush <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> Congress to amend existing law or retroactively obtain warrants for surveillance and that he violated the constitution when he did not. President Obama has been similarly criticized for operating outside the law, despite statements at the beginning of his presidency which showed a desire to limit the use of signing statements to expand executive power.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Keith went to Paris, {{where he}} had relatives. [...] He {{spent the better part}} of a year living hand to mouth by selling the {{personal}} items he had brought with him, mostly horse furnishings. Although he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> any of his relatives for assistance, but, as he explained in his unfinished memoirs, [...] "...I [...] was then either so bashful or vain, that I wou'd [...] not own the want I was in." [...] Eventually he received a gift of 1000 livres from Mary of Modena, mother of the Pretender and this, plus some support from home and an allowance from James enabled him to spend the rest of the year at the university. In 1717, he received a commission as colonel of cavalry and was ordered to prepare to go to Scotland again, but the plan, contingent upon support from the Charles XII of Sweden, was discovered and thwarted, and he continued at the university. [...] Later that year, in June, he met Peter I of Russia, and offered the Tsar his sword, being, as Keith considered it [...] "high time ...to quitte [...] the Academy and endeavor to establish myself somewhere..." [...] The Tsar apparently saw no need for the sword of a youth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to have Ibrahim {{burned at the stake}} was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, Nimrod. The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim's hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel Jibril came to him and said: [...] "O Ibrahim! Is there anything you wish for?" [...] Ibrahim <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, [...] "Allah is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs." [...] The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. Allah then gave an order to the fire, [...] "O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." [...] A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Ibrahim came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: [...] "Amazing! Ibrahim's God has saved him from the fire!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{received}} a Grammy Award nomination for the category Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in 1996. The then 21-year-old Jon B. stated {{he felt the}} nomination was [...] "an honor he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{pointed out}} to him concisely, and keeping {{my eyes on the}} door of the hotel, that he and his wife were the only bond with the land Captain Anthony <b>had.</b> Who else <b>could</b> he <b>have</b> <b>asked?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> {{a better}} person,' {{answered}} Jack cheerfully. And signing {{to him to}} sit down with him under a tree, he set {{the table in front of}} them, and struck it three times, crying: ...|$|R

60|$|Indeed, what {{question}} <b>could</b> he <b>have</b> <b>asked?</b> The falsehoods he had uttered had woven {{themselves into}} a rope about his neck, and he stood before his brother officers now in an agony of shame, a man discredited, as he believed.|$|R
60|$|The {{volunteer}} messengers <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for {{a better}} night. When the day {{had come to an}} end the storm burst with no inconsiderable fury, and it was safe to predict that it would not clear away before sunrise.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps Scrooge {{could not}} have told anybody why, if anybody <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> him; {{but he had a}} special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You mistake me as usual,' she said, {{in a low}} tone. 'I am {{not going}} to consult you on that matter, because I have done all you <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for without {{consulting}} you. I take no part in the play to-night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> Mr. Redgauntlet {{to do so}} much,' {{said the}} young nobleman, willingly {{accepting}} the hand which Redgauntlet offered. 'I know no man living from whom I could take so much reproof without a sense of degradation as from himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{suddenly}} {{threw her}} arms round his neck, kissed him passionately, and whispered, with her lips at his ear: [...] "Oh, Ernest, forgive me! <b>Could</b> I <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> you to marry me for my money if I had not taken refuge in a disguise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she would, sir. After you {{had gone}} up to the Hall yesterday, I went up to see her, as I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> you {{to let me go}} at once, if I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> found some one to take my place. She would be glad to come, sir; and I am sure she will suit you." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{gratitude}} {{they expressed}} for our kindly using {{the two young}} women I have mentioned, was a token of generous principles; and our men told us, {{that they would have}} given them whatever they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked,</b> that was in their power to bestow.|$|E

6000|$|Of course, {{there was}} no {{possibility}} of being able permanently to conceal Dr. Bauerstein's arrest from her. It would be announced in every newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If only Poirot had been accessible, I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> his advice. What possessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Honor dear,' he said pleadingly, {{yet with}} authority, 'pray {{let me talk}} to you. There are things which I wish very much to say; indeed, without which I <b>could</b> hardly <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for this indulgence. It is for your own sake, and that of the place and people.' ...|$|R

60|$|He met {{her gaze}} without wavering, and, {{though he was}} not aware of this, his eyes had a {{question}} in them. It was one he <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> directly even if he had wished, but remembering that Anita was to live in that city he took a bold course.|$|R
60|$|This was so kind, and so {{completely}} what I desired, that I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> nothing more; and I accepted his visit in his barge, which I {{thought would be}} enough, but was afraid that, if more came, our men might be alarmed, and take arms before I was ready; so we agreed upon that, and, if I desired more help, I should hang out a signal, viz., a red ancient, on the mizen top.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why was it his duty?" [...] I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her that. I had impulses to {{take hold}} of her suddenly, as she calmly passed me in classe, to stretch out my hand and grasp her fast, and say, [...] "Stop. Let us hear the {{conclusion}} of the whole matter. Why is it his duty to go into banishment?" [...] But Madame always addressed some other teacher, and never looked at me, never seemed conscious I could have a care in the question.|$|E
