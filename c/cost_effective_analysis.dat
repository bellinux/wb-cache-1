Using the model, sediment analysis and estimates of sedimentation rates, we estimate changes in estuarine denitrification and intertidal carbon and nutrient storage and associated value of habitat created under a scenario of extensive managed realignment. We then use this information, together with engineering and land costs, to conduct a cost benefit analysis of the managed realignment. This demonstrates that over a 50 - 100 year timescale {{the value of the}} habitat created and carbon buried is sufficient to make the large scale managed realignment <b>cost</b> <b>effective.</b> The <b>analysis</b> reveals that carbon and nutrient storage plus habitat creation represent major and quantifiable benefits of realignment.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThere is wide {{variation}} in the techniques deployed to diagnose tuberculosis in the UK, with little agreement on which tools or strategies are <b>cost</b> <b>effective.</b> This <b>analysis</b> therefore comprehensively evaluated the cost effectiveness of currently available diagnostic strategies for routine diagnosis of TB in the NHS. MethodsThe analysis compared strategies consisting of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, culture and microscopy. A decision tree was used to estimate costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from a UK health service perspective. The sensitivity and specificity of each test determined the true and false positive and negative results in patients suspected of having active tuberculosis. These results led to either early, correct diagnosis or delayed diagnosis and the associated costs and QALYs. The presence of active tuberculosis combined with {{the side effects of}} treatment was associated with reduction in quality of life. Costs included were test costs, drug costs and the management of tuberculosis. Drug costs were based on generic UK list prices. Uncertainty in the model was explored through probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Results/conclusionsThe <b>cost</b> <b>effective</b> strategy at threshold of £ 20, 000 per QALY was a strategy using only sputum microscopy and culture routinely, meaning Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques are not <b>cost</b> <b>effective</b> at baseline. When the prevalence of tuberculosis was increased, however, nucleic acid amplification became <b>cost</b> <b>effective</b> at the same threshold. Aside from the prevalence, the results were shown to be robust.
