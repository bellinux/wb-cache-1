40|$|Background: With {{a growing}} sphere of {{influence}} in the modern world, online social media serves as a readily accessible interface for communication of information. Aesthetic medicine {{is one of many}} industries increasingly influenced by social media, as evidenced by the popular website, “RealSelf,” an online community founded in 2006 that compiles ratings, reviews, photographs, and expert physician commentary for nearly 300 <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments.</b> Objective: To investigate the current preferences of patients regarding cosmetic non-surgical, surgical, and dental treatments on RealSelf and in the documented medical literature. Methods: On a single day of data collection, all <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> or procedures reviewed on the RealSelf website were tabulated, including name, percent “worth it” rating, total number of reviews, and average cost. Patient satisfaction rates documented in the current medical literature for each <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> or procedure were also recorded. Statistical t-testingcomparing RealSelf ratings and satisfaction rates in the literature was performed for each category—non-surgical, surgical, and dental. Results: The top ten most-commonly reviewed non-surgical treatments, top ten most-commonly reviewed surgical procedures, and top 5 most-commonly reviewed dental treatments, along with documented satisfaction rates in the medical literature for each treatment or procedure were recorded in table format and ranked by RealSelf “worth it” rating. Paired t-testing revealed that satisfaction rates documented in the literature were significantly higher than RealSelf “worth it” ratings for both non-surgical <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> (p= 0. 00076) and surgical cosmetic procedures (p= 0. 00056), with no statistically significant difference for dental treatments. Conclusions: For prospective patients interested in <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> or procedures, social media sites such as RealSelf may offer information helpful to decision-making as well enable <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> providers to build reputations and expand practices. “Worth it” ratings on RealSelf may, in fact, represent a more transparent view of <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> or procedural outcomes relative to the high satisfaction rates documented in medical literature.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} etiologies {{and clinical}} characteristics of corneal opacities leading patients to seek <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments.</b> Methods: The medical records of 401 patients who presented for cosmetic improvement in corneal opacities between May 2004 and July 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The following parameters were analyzed: age, gender, cause of corneal opacity, time {{course of the}} corneal disease, associated diseases, prior and current <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments,</b> visual acuity, location and depth of the corneal opacity, {{and the presence of}} either corneal neovascularization or band keratopathy. A single practitioner examined all patients. Results: The most common causes of corneal opacity were ocular trauma (203 eyes, 50. 6 %), retinal disease (62 eyes, 15. 5 %), measles (38 eyes, 9. 5 %), and congenital etiologies (22 eyes, 5. 5 %). Prior treatments included iris colored contact lenses (125 eyes, 31. 1 %) and corneal tattooing (34 eyes, 8. 46 %). A total of 321 of 401 eyes underwent <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> for corneal opacities. The most common treatment performed after the primary visit was corneal tattooing (261 eyes, 64. 92 %). Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the causes and clinical characteristics of patients presenting for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> of corneal opacities rather than for functional improvement.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the damage induced by cosmetic processes on human hair {{is very important for}} the cosmetic industry, constituting the first step to prevent hair deterioration and to develop new products. The electrophoretical fractionation (SDS-PAGE) of hair proteins leads to a specific electrophoretical pattern, whose regions {{can be attributed to the}} morphological hair components. In the present study, assessing the status of human hair and its changes imparted by cosmetic processes is realised through gel-electrophoretical fractionation of hair proteins. The basis of the study is represented by the fact that all cosmetic processes influence the morphological components of the hair fibre and their proteins and that the modifications of the proteins are specific, a characteristic type and degree of damage being induced by each <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment.</b> Under standardised conditions the soluble proteins are extracted as S-carbamidomethylated derivatives, subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the resulting gels are stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. The densitograms obtained by densitometric measurements of the stained gels are digitised and subjected to cluster analysis, a method of multivariate statistics able o identify the similarities between the digitised protein profiles. The <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> are applied on a commercial, European mixed hair sample. Besides oxidative and reductive treatments, carried out as single and multiple treatments, at different treatment duration, styling procedures such as hot curling are performed. The influence of the contact with swimming pool and sea water is also investigated. Cumulative effects of cosmetic processes on hair proteins are studied applying combined <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments.</b> The results obtained using the analysis of the electrophoretical patterns for cosmetically treated samples are compared, for selected cases, with the results of traditional methods for assessing hair damage such as amino acid analysis, tensile strength measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. Cluster analysis performed separately for the keratin intermediate filament proteins and for the keratin-associated proteins allows the identification of the morphological components affected by a certain <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> and the comparative evaluation of the induced damage degrees. A database of characteristic changes of the electrophoretical protein pattern is built by the analysis of hair samples subjected to standard <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments,</b> in conformity with the usage instructions. This database is subsequently used for evaluating the effects of any other non-standard <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatment</b> on the morphological components of the hair fibre. UV-irradiation and cosmetic processes have cumulative influence on hair proteins. The enlargement of the application area for the developed method is suggested by the efficacy evaluation of a series of hair sunscreens applied on hair samples subjected to UV-irradiation...|$|R

In a neo-liberal economy, when an individual is evaluated through continuous self-improvement, body becomes a symbol of wealth and classed lifestyle. Within this cultural logic, heroic body work and investment in bodily capital are understood as self-improvement and work towards a better self. Russia has recently moved to the logic of global consumer capitalism introducing new classed symbolic hierarchies of body and gender. This research aims to analyze the use of anti-age <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> in the context of a new symbolic reordering of gender in capitalist Russia. The study draws on the analysis of interviews with Russian cosmetologists and clients undergoing anti-age <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> and ethnographic fieldwork in the beauty salons. Using the framework of ‘governmentality’, ‘body work’ and ‘emotion management’, I show how the global circulation of neo-liberal post-feminist values is domesticated in Russia through classed body practices. Anti-age <b>cosmetic</b> <b>treatments</b> become a classed ‘technology of the self’, which transforms the self with the help of expert-cosmetologists in the expectation of life changes, higher life chances and improvement of status. Emotion work and emotion management become an important part of the project of self-governance. The meta-discourse of choice is the main trope in talking about one’s own decisions to undergo anti-age treatments, which presents new challenges for the feminist critique of such body practices...|$|R
