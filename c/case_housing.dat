In {{the large majority}} of 1998 & later applications of the 4L60E were 2 piece cases (i.e., a removable bell housing). Both transmissions are the same internally. The non-PWM (1993-1994) style 4L60Es are not interchangeable with PWM-style (1995 and later) 4L60Es. Also in 1996, GM changed the 3-2 solenoid to a different style which makes it not interchangeable with any previous models.|$|E

Further, there is no state policy which commands that groups of people may live under the same roof in any section of a municipality they choose."

40|$|Abstract. This is {{the first}} of three papers {{describing}} a model of housing demand. The present paper sets out the theoretical framework for the model, which is based on a number of recent theories in economics. The main interest in the research lies in the development of urban models for obtaining information directly relevant to the analysis of costs and benefits for alternative urban programs, in this <b>case</b> <b>housing</b> programs. The research for the housing model, therefore, is concerned with housing services, their relative demand prices, and demand equations for these services. The second paper, "A residential model: 2. Implicit prices for housing services", contains results for demand prices for housing characteristics as services estimated by multiple regression analysis, using data for selling price and housing characteristics from the town of Reading, Berkshire. The research described in the third paper, "A residential model: 3. Demand equations for housing services", includes results for the wide differences in prices for similar housing between tenure groups, and for demand equations for housing services at three levels of aggregation as a function of household attributes of income, social status, stage in family cycle, and household size. ...|$|E
40|$|The 30 th {{anniversary of}} the Fair Housing Act is a {{bittersweet}} occasion for Hispanics. 1 It represents an important milestone in the Nation’s journey toward the ideal of equal oppor-tunity for all. However, {{a review of the}} legislation’s history reveals that, for too long, housing discrimination against the Hispanic community has been unjustifiably ignored. In this article, we review briefly the importance of fair housing to the Hispanic commu-nity, discuss emerging research documenting the scope and degree of housing discrimina-tion against Latinos, describe recent developments in Federal enforcement of the Act on behalf of Hispanics, and conclude with a few recommendations. Many working-class and low-income Latinos face severe problems in obtaining “safe, sanitary, and decent ” housing. Recent research shows that Hispanics are more likely than other Americans to live in substandard housing and to experience overcrowding. The percentage of Latinos with “worst <b>case</b> <b>housing</b> needs” 2 has risen dramatically in recent years. The link between low income and housing deprivation is well-established. Indeed, Hispanics now have the dubious distinction of being the poorest of Americans. Thirty percent of Latinos live below the Federal poverty level compared with 29 percent o...|$|E

40|$|Federal rental {{assistance}} {{programs are not}} funded adequately to serve all, or even most, eligible households. As a result, millions of households are on Public Housing Authority (PHA) waiting lists to receive a Housing Choice Voucher or a unit in a public housing development. Applicants typically wait years before being offered assistance, and many PHAs have closed their waiting lists to new applicants. Although this problem is longstanding and widely acknowledged, very {{little is known about}} the characteristics and experiences of households on waiting lists for rental assistance. A 2009 survey of nearly 1, 000 nonelderly, nondisabled rental assistance applicants, selected from a nationwide sample of 25 PHAs, provides new information on these households. The survey shows that households that apply for and receive housing assistance differ significantly from households that the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development considers as having worst <b>case</b> <b>housing</b> needs (WCN). Specifically, most rental assistance applicants did not spend more than one-half of their income on housing, primarily because they reduced their housing costs by living with family or friends or by receiving some form of government subsidy. Applicants frequently reported other housing-related problems not included in the WCN measure, such as homelessness, overcrowding, and certain housing quality problems. In addition, many applicants appear to apply for rental assistance to form their own households rather than continue living with family or friends. These findings have implications for our understanding of housing needs and the function of rental {{assistance programs}} in addressing those needs...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies have}} linked human {{exposure}} to pollutants with adverse health effects. Passenger exposure in public transport systems contributes an important fraction of daily burden of air pollutants. While there is extensive literature reporting {{the concentrations of}} pollutants in public transport systems in different cities, there are few studies systematically addressing the heterogeneity of passenger exposure in different transit microenvironments, in cabins of different transit vehicles and in areas with different characteristics. The present study investigated PM 2. 5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2. 5 μm), black carbon (BC), ultrafine particles (UFP) and carbon monoxide (CO) pollutant concentrations in various public road transport systems in highly urbanized city of Hong Kong. Using a trolley <b>case</b> <b>housing</b> numerous portable air monitors, we conducted a total of 119 trips during the campaign. Transit microenvironments, classified as 1). busy and secondary roadside bus stops; 2). open and enclosed termini; 3). above- and under-ground Motor Rail Transport (MTR) platforms, were investigated and compared to identify the factors that may affect passenger exposures. The pollutants inside bus and MTR cabins were also investigated together with a comparison of time integrated exposure between the transit modes. Busy roadside and enclosed termini demonstrated the highest average particle concentrations while the lowest {{was found on the}} MTR platforms. Traffic-related pollutants BC, UFP and CO showed larger variations than PM 2. 5 across different microenvironments and areas confirming their heterogeneity in urban environments. In-cabin pollutant concentrations showed distinct patterns with BC and UFP high in diesel bus cabins and CO high in LPG bus cabins, suggesting possible self-pollution issues and/or penetration of on-road pollutants inside cabins during bus transit. The total passenger exposure along selected routes, showed bus trips had the potential for higher integrated passenger exposure compared to MTR trips. The present study may provide useful information to better characterize the distribution of passenger exposure pattern in health assessment studies and the results also highlight the need to formulate exposure reduction based air policies in large cities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Sustainable {{consumption}} and the sustainable {{use of resources}} {{is a growing concern}} as negative environmental impacts such as carbon emissions, overuse of natural resources, and degradation of non-renewable resource stocks continue to rise. Disproportionate consumption by Northern countries and particularly the United States is the cause of both negative environmental impacts and environmental justice problems. Therefore changing consumption practices of the North is seen as a necessary solution. Unfortunately, most strategies to reduce consumption in the North have failed. Questions remain about what sustainable consumption looks like and how it might be implemented. This dissertation examines the sustainable consumption practices of urban communities, in Seattle, Washington, USA Through ethnographic case studies and the quantitative analysis of consumption in two intentional communities, this research examines factors that led those communities to consume more sustainably. Intentional communities are groups of people, including unrelated adults, who share their lives (and in this <b>case</b> <b>housing)</b> according to a shared set of values and goals. The communities in this study lived in single-family housing and shared the values and goals of environmental sustainability and social justice. Quantitative methods included weighing garbage, surveying consumption, and analyzing utility bills. Most notably the communities were able to reduce their consumption by 70 - 75 % of US averages through choices made in waste reduction, water consumption, and miles driven. Ethnographic research methods included semi-structured and unstructured interviews, and participant observation such as attending community meetings and events and participating in the labor structure of the communities. This dissertation demonstrates that intentional communities, as common property institutions, are effectively generating social structures that facilitate sustainable lifestyles through four major strategies: 1) adopting an alternative habitus and building more sustainable cultural capital; 2) creating new institutions, most significantly common property institutions; 3) working together to provide systems of provisioning through collective economics; and 4) founding individual, collective, and institutional practices on a very specific set of beliefs and values, or worldview, that emphasizes egalitarianism, social justice, and the environment. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that a biocentric paradigm alone is insufficient to produce sustainable practices...|$|E
