A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E

5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise.

After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E

5|$|Carpenter, in {{this fight}} with others of his small {{regiment}} at Fairfield, stood against two of the crack brigades of Stuart's cavalry. The 6th Cavalry's stand {{was considered one of}} the most gallant in its history and helped influence the outcome the battles being fought around Gettysburg. While the 6th Cavalry regiment was cut to pieces, it fought so well that its squadrons were regarded as the advance of a large body of troops. The senior officer of those brigades was later criticized severely for being delayed by such an inferior force. Had the 6th Cavalry regiment not made their stand, the two brigades of Virginians <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> serious problems to the Union rear areas.|$|E
5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E
5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced seismicity. Alternatively, earthquakes <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|Speer's {{supporters}} {{maintained a}} continual call for his release. Among those who pledged support for Speer's sentence to be commuted were Charles de Gaulle, U.S. diplomat George Ball, former U.S. High Commissioner John J.

Willy Brandt {{was a strong}} advocate of Speer's, supporting his release, sending flowers to his daughter {{on the day of}} his release, and putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against Speer, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> his property to be confiscated. A reduced sentence required the consent of all four of the occupying powers, and the Soviets adamantly opposed any such proposal. Speer served his full sentence, and was released at midnight on October1, 1966.|$|E
5|$|The book , co-written by {{the three}} bodyguards fired the {{previous}} year, was published on August 1. It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse. Genetic analysis of a hair sample in 2014 found evidence of genetic variants that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> his glaucoma, migraines and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, his drug abuse had led to falls, head trauma, and overdoses that most likely had damaged his brain.|$|E

5|$|The {{precipitate}} {{action of}} the Hospitallers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> Richard's whole strategy to unravel. However, he recognised that the counterattack, once started, had to be supported by all his army and ordered the signal for a general charge to be sounded. Unsupported, the Hospitallers and the other rear units involved in the initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the enemy. The Frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for the knights to pass through and the attack naturally developed in echelon from the rear to the van. To the soldiers of Saladin's army, as Baha al-Din noted, the sudden change from passivity to ferocious activity {{on the part of}} the Crusaders was disconcerting, and appeared to be the result of a preconceived plan.|$|E
5|$|From May 1980 {{to early}} 1981 he acted as {{editor for the}} {{magazine}} POL. In 1982, {{he moved to the}} neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him that his high profile and ability to overshadow others <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain. His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sites were}} chosen to {{study the effects of}} cane toads on the {{northern}} quoll, one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of Kakadu National Park. The other site was located {{at the north end of}} the park. In addition to these two sites, there was a third site located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane toads would not interact with the northern quoll population. Monitoring of the quoll population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane toads arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane toads, the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of the park, as there were no northern quolls caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park is compelling not only because of the timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as there were no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> such a rapid decline. The most obvious piece of evidence which supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane toads caused the local extinction of the northern quoll is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane toads, showed no signs of decline.|$|E
