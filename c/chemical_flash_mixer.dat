5000|$|The Cleveland open-cup {{method is}} one of three main methods in {{chemistry}} for determining the flash point of a petroleum product using a Cleveland open-cup apparatus, also known as a Cleveland open-cup tester. [...] First, the test cup of the apparatus (usually brass) is filled to a certain level with a portion of the product. Then, the temperature of this chemical is increased rapidly and then at a slow, constant rate as it approaches the theoretical flash point. The increase in temperature will cause the chemical to begin to produce flammable vapor in increasing quantities and density. The lowest temperature at which a small test flame passing over the surface of the liquid causes the vapor to ignite is considered the <b>chemical's</b> <b>flash</b> point. This apparatus may also be used to determine the chemical's fire point which is considered to have been reached when the application of the test flame produces at least five continuous seconds of ignition.|$|R

40|$|Gun muzzle blast {{and flash}} {{phenomena}} are of importance {{since they are}} associated with the formation of large overpressures and intense muzzle flash. About 30 % of the chemical energy released from the propellant used in a conventional gun is converted into kinetic energy of the projectile: The remaining energy is mainly contained in the propellant gas-particle mixture which escapes from the muzzle of the gun in a few milliseconds. The sudden discharge produces a blast wave because of the rapid displacement of air originally surrounding the gun. In addition, these gases are generally fuel-rich and mix with air turbulently entrained from the surroundings. Combustion of this mixture causes gun muzzle flash, usually associated with the formation of a secondary blast wave. The design of solid propellant charges, gun performance, muzzle attachments and <b>chemical</b> <b>flash</b> suppressants is guided by the need to keep the above hazards to safe limits. In this paper, blast and flash phenomena are chara cterized using data of recent investigations and showing illustrative examples of their development...|$|R

The {{first phase of the}} project, having capacity of 17, 500 t:/day was commissioned in June 2001 The second phase was commissioned in June 2007 and it has a capacity of 72, 000 m:/day. In phase I the treatment process in the plant consists of Coagulation and Flocculation,Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF), Rapid Sand Filtration, Post Chlorination,ph Correction and Sludge Treatment. The treatment process for the phase II is the same, except for pre- chlorination and addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) at the <b>flash</b> <b>mixer.</b> The scheme serves the Ampara Township, too. The first recorded water quality issue of coloured water, bad smell and taste were raised by consumers in the year 2004. From 2004, sporadic complaints from consumers were received and steps were taken to flush the pipelines periodically. The regular water quality tests had not revealed the cause for the problem and a series of studies have been carried out and various reports have been submitted. However, the water quality issues still persist. Therefore, four numbers of trials were carried out for collecting the samples to identify the reason for the colour problem with following conditions at the various location of the treatment processes such as the rapid mixing, before DAF,after DAF(floated water), filtered and treated water. > With pre chlori nation and with PAC, > With pre chlori nation and without PAC, > With out pre chllorination and with PAC > With out chlorination without PAC Water samples were collected at various location of the treatment processes like, rapid mixing, before DAF,after DAF(floated water), filtered and treated water.

40|$|Water is {{precious}} for every living being. It covers almost 75 % of the earth's surface, t Only about 3 % {{of the water}} on earth exists as fresh-water {{and most of it}} is not easily available to men. Freshwater sources are polluted by activities of men, animals and by natural disasters. Water pollution is dominated by industrial and domestic wastes through channels and drains. Treating this water to meet standards of drinking quality is a huge task and a costly process. ^ Many countries face the problem of providing safe drinking water rapidly when faced with disaster situations like thousands of refugees as a result of civil disturbances, or natural disasters such as tsunami-related events, earthquakes, landslides, droughts or in an event of floods. The main issue is to construct water treatment plants which are heavy concrete structures in a shorter period of time in a limited land space. •The R & D section of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (N. W. S. & D. B) has designed and fabricated a moveable water treatment plant using locally available materials and expertise within an affordable capital cost. Three of these mobile type water treatment plants have being installed in Pugoda, Mahiyangana and Allauwwa. This type of water treatment plants can dismantle into separate sections. They are fabricated steel tanks as middle stages of water treatment plant array. These sections can be transported to another place, re-assembled and re-located. The Pugoda plant has a mechanical <b>flash</b> <b>mixer</b> and three speed mechanical tapered flocculators. Flocculating is done by four paddle rotors rotated by geared motors in three speeds in three adjacent tanks. These paddle wheels (rotors) are mounted on a horizontal axis * inside the tank. The two ends of axel are sealed and supported by two end bearings housed beside the tank steel wall. This arrangement of the paddle wheels gives many operational and maintenance difficulties when dismantling the bearings and water seals. Very frequently chemically mixed water leaks through the water seals and bearings. This leads to reduce productivity by reducing bearing life, equipment safety and increasing down time, power requirement and operational cost. It needs a substantial quantity of water to remove the sludge in the bottom bed by washing them out. The objective of this special study is to study the ways and means of improving the present installation arrangements of flocculator paddle wheels and to propose an alternative arrangement eliminating above operational difficulties. Objective is to find an efficient alternative mechanical flocculator system to be used in package-type water treatment plants. This report discusses about conventional water treatment arrangement, a brief study of floe forming phenomena, specification of the mobile water treatment plant, flocculator types and other arrangement types of mechanical flocculators used elsewhere in the world. The report includes theoretical aspects of power requirement for rotating paddles. The study also proposes a vertical arrangement of flocculating. This is by fabricating frame and a plate to mount the gear box and motor. This frame is fitted on to the top frame of the tank. The axes of the paddle wheel is supported by two bearings, one is top of the channel section and the other is submerged in the water. The housing shall be fixed to fabricated plate to bottom of tank. The bearing shall be water resistant type and fully water tight by seals. The advantages expected from this arrangement are to prevent water leaks, long life of seals, bearings and couplings and to reduce operational and maintenance difficulties thus reducing operational costs and reducing the amount of sludge washing water...|$|R

40|$|Flash {{point is}} an {{important}} property of chemical compounds that is widely used to evaluate flammability hazard. However, {{there is often a}} significant gap between the demand for experimental flash point data and their availability. Furthermore, the determination of flash point is difficult and costly, particularly for some toxic, explosive, or radioactive compounds. The development of a reliable and widely applicable method to predict flash point is therefore essential. In this paper, the construction of a quantitative structure - property relationship model with excellent performance and domain of applicability is reported. It uses the largest data set to date of 9399 chemically diverse compounds, with flash point spanning from less than - 130 °C to over 900 °C. The model employs only computed parameters, eliminating the need for experimental data that some earlier computational models required. The model allows accurate prediction of flash point for a broad range of compounds that are unavailable or not yet synthesized. This single model with a very broad range of <b>chemical</b> and <b>flash</b> point applicability will allow accurate predictions of this important property to be made for a broad range of new materials...|$|R

Lack of adequate water treatment and delivery infrastructure, high operational costs and poor maintenance are some of the factors contributing to the problem. Many developing countries also have large population clusters in cities and inadequate sanitation services, which increase the risk of water- borne disease outbreak. Incorporating renewable energy sources for treatment and distribution of potable water may be the key to developing sustainable water supply systems to reduce water- borne diseases in developing countries. This study focused on evaluating the potential of using distributed solar for a 4. 5 million gallons per day (MGD) existing {{drinking water}} treatment plant (DWTP), located in Sindh, Pakistan. The DWTP utilized a conventional treatment train, consisting of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection processes to treat water obtained from the Indus River.

The reclamation are mostly reused as cement material, brick manufacture and cultivate soil. Moreover, sintering of lightweight aggregate is one way of the reclamation. This study took sludge from the six water treatment plants as material to make lightweight aggregate. Before the test of sintered lightweight aggregate, we analyzed fundamental properties including the composing and physical character of the sludge. The chemical composition of six water treatment sludge were similar and major composition included SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3; besides, it could be situated at C. M. Riley three-phase diagram. The result of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) was in line with standard. According to physical character, the specific gravity of six sludge were similar to general soil and all sludge were silt or clay which have plasticity and fine diameter. After the sintered test at the laboratory, we found the best sintered temperature and produced the sintered lightweight aggregate having pellet density below 1. 8 g/cm 3 and water absorption below 20 ％, which passed the requirement of the general lightweight aggregate. By changing the preheated temperature, we could discover that the sludge from Hsinch, Linnei, Kaotan, Chengcing lake water treatment plant could make the lightweight aggregate for structural and non-structural application in the same time, in the other hand, the sludge from Shinshan and Banxin only made lightweight aggregate for non-structural application. This study discovered the sludge from the six water treatment plants could be the material of sintered lightweight aggregate. 淨水場自河川、水庫或地下水取得源水後，經由廠內混凝、膠凝、沉澱及過濾等淨水處理程序，其處理過程中為降低濁度或去除污染物常添加藥劑混凝（PAC），但同時也產生大量的淨水污泥，而淨水污泥屬於公告事業廢棄物不可隨意棄置，因此大量淨水污泥處理問題為此時有待解決之課題。淨水污泥資源化再利用已成為發展趨勢，台灣現今淨水污泥多做為水泥原料、培養土、紅磚等再利用方式，而燒製成輕質骨材亦為一種再利用方式。 本研究採集國內 6 座淨水場污泥做為原料，對淨水污泥再製輕質骨材之可行性進行研究。於燒製試驗前，先對淨水污泥之組成性質及物理性質進行分析。化學成分分析上， 6 場淨水污泥化學成分均相似，主體成分為SiO 2 、Al 2 O 3 及Fe 2 O 3 ，且皆位於C.

Our aim is to mimic the interaction between tyrosineZ and a basic histidine residue, namely His 190 in PSII, and also to use the dpa ligands for coordination of manganese. Two different routes for the synthesis of the compound 4 are presented. Its structure was fully characterized by 1 H NMR, COSY, NOESY, 13 C NMR, IR, and mass spectrometry. 1 H NMR and NOESY gave evidence {{for the existence of}} intramolecular hydrogen bonding in 4. The interaction between the ruthenium and the substituted tyrosine unit was probed by steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements as well as by <b>chemical</b> oxidation. <b>Flash</b> photolysis and EPR measurements on 4 in the presence of an electron acceptor (methylviologen, MV 2 +, or cobalt pentaminechloride, Co 3 +) showed that an intermolecular electron transfer from the excited state of Ru(II) in 4 to the electron acceptor took place, forming Ru(III) and the methylviologen radical MV+ or Co 2 +. This was followed by intramolecular electron transfer from the substituted tyrosine moiety to the photogenerated Ru(III), regenerating Ru(II) and forming a tyrosyl radical. In water, the radical has a g value of 2. 0044, indicative of a deprotonated tyrosyl radical. In acetonitrile, a radical with a g value of 2. 0029 was formed, which can be assigned to the tyrosine radical cation. In both solvents the electron transfer is intramolecular with a rate constant kET > 1 × 107 s- 1. This is 2 orders of magnitude greater than the one for a similar compound 3, in which no dpa arm is attached to the tyrosine unit. Therefore the hydrogen bonding between the substituted tyrosine and the dpa arms in 4 is proposed to be responsible for the fast electron transfer. This interaction mimics the proposed His 190 and tyrosineZ interaction in the donor side of PS II...|$|R
40|$|Fast burning rocket {{propellants}} {{based on}} ammonium perchlorate (AP) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) binders have been formulated and basically characterized in aluminized and non aluminized versions. The thermodynamic performance of PDMS bound propellants {{is limited by}} the evaporation point of silicon dioxide (crystobalite at 2863 K), which is formed during the combustion. The maximum specific impulses calculated with an expansion ratio of 70 : 1 are I-SP = 2340 N s/kg (238 s) for AP/PDMS and Isp = 2430 N s/kg (247 s) for AP/Al/PDMS formulations. With a tri-modal AP-fraction of 200 mum, 30 mum and 2 mum it was possible to achieve processable propellants with 83 % and 84 % solid loading. They give burning rates close to 60 mm/s at 10 MPa and pressure exponents between 0. 5 and 0. 6 in the range of 7 - 25 MPa. The thermodynamic specific impulse of these systems was calculated to I-SP = 2319 N s/kg (236 s) for AP/PDMS and I-SP = 2403 N s/kg (245 s) for AP/Al/PDMS formulations at 70 : 1 expansion ratio. Measurements of the glass transition point by DMA and TMA detected a time dependent partial crystallization of the used PDMS close to T-G in the temperature range from - 44 degreesC to - 60 degreesC.

Recently we have successfully transformed both volatile liquids and nonvolatile liquids and solids into syngas with no carbon formation in autothermal catalytic reactors with residence times of ~ 10 milliseconds. In the proposed research program we explore the mechanisms of these processes and their extensions to other biomass sources and applications by examining different feeds, catalysts, flow conditions, and steam addition to maximize production of either syngas or chemicals. We will systematically study the catalytic partial oxidation in millisecond autothermal reactors of solid biomass and the liquid products formed by pyrolysis of solid biomass. We will examine alcohols, polyols, esters, solid carbohydrates, and lignocellulose to try to maximize formation of either hydrogen and syngas or olefins and oxygenated chemicals. We will explore molecules and mixtures of practical interest as well as surrogate molecules that contain the functional groups of biofuels but are simpler to analyze and interpret. We will examine spatial profiles within the catalyst and transient and periodic operation of these reactors at pressures up to 10 atm to obtain data from which to explore more detailed mechanistic models and optimize performance to produce a specific desired product. New experiments will examine the {{conversion of}} syngas into biofuels such as methanol and dimethyl ether to explore the entire process of producing biofuels from biomass in small distributed systems.

40|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1977, intrinsically conducting polymers have been studies for {{applications such as}} electronic devices, sensors and actuators[1 - 3]. Polyaniline (PAni) {{is an example of}} a stable conducting polymer and can be classified as an ‘adaptive material’ in that it can be switched between two or more forms (each with their own distinct characteristics) using an external stimulus. In contrast to a classical metallic conductor or a polymeric insulator, PAni can be switched reversibly between an insulating emeraldine base form and a conducting emeraldine salt. More recently, interest has developed in the area of nanostructured polyaniline[4 - 6]. These one-dimensional objects combine the advantages of an organic conductor and a high surface area material, thus making them suitable for a diverse range of applications such as <b>chemical</b> sensors, <b>flash</b> memory and electro-optic devices[7 - 9]. Here we present how polyaniline nanofibres can be successfully functionalised with both amine and carboxylate groups. The modified nanofibres maintain their ability to switch between diffferent forms displaying distinctly different optical properties (as shown by Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy), thus making them suitable for adaptive sensing applications. The attachment of functional groups to polyaniline nanofibres provides a route for manipulating the surface chemistry of nanofibres. While interesting materials in themselves, these functionalised nanofibres are also attractive as molecular scaffolds for building yet more innovative derivatives that nonetheless retain the basic underlying nanostructure and intrinsic characteristics of PAni. That we have demonstrated the ability to regulate the extent of side-chain attachment to one-dimensional objects, in a safe and simple manner, represents a step forward in the area of adaptive nano-structured materials. Functionalisation can be controlled using a simple, scalable and inexpensive technique[10 - 11]. [1] C. O. Baker, B. Shedd, P. C. Innis, P. G. Whitten, G. M. Spinks, G. G. Wallace, R. B.

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{capacity of}} MSSV pyrolysis {{has been used}} to extend the structural characterisation of aquatic natural organic matter (NOM). NOM can contribute to various potable water issues and is present in high concentrations (> 5 mg L- 1) in many Australian source supplies. NOM can also impede the filtration performance of ultrafiltration or other membranes used in the increasingly popular practices of desalination and wastewater treatment. Characterisation studies that provide a detailed understanding of the origins, structural features and reactivity of NOM in source waters will help predict its impact on potable supplies and allow targeted treatment. MSSV pyrolysis GC-MS analyses were conducted on XAD fractions of NOM from selected rivers, reservoirs, ground waters and biologically treated waste waters. The analytical sensitivity of the MSSV Py approach was demonstrated by the detection of high concentrations and complex distributions of pyrolysates. These included many additional products to those detected by corresponding flash pyrolysis GC-MS analysis, which is often limited by excessive degradation or poor chromatographic resolution of pyrolysates of high structural polarity. Nevertheless, flash pyrolysis did lead to several unique products from some samples, reflecting the complementary nature of the two methods. Despite the high product concentrations detected by MSSV pyrolysis of NOM, primary structural fragments are prone to further alteration due to the confined nature and extended (e. g. 72 hr) application of the moderate thermal conditions (e. g. 300 °C). This approach has not been widely applied to the characterisation of recent or immature OM. Consequently, the mechanistic formation of many NOM pyrolysates is poorly understood, seriously limiting interpretation of their source and significance. As articulated in CHAPTER 1, these issues are specifically addressed by the present research, which aims to extend the application of MSSV pyrolysis to the characterisation of NOM and related environmental organic materials rich in intact biochemical inputs. To {{gain a better understanding of}} product formation pathways, several samples, including soil leachates, the organic foulant of ultra filtration membranes and a suite of standards representing potential biochemical precursors of NOM were separately analysed by MSSV Py. The effect of thermal conditions on product distributions was also addressed by analysis of a small sub-set of the samples at several different temperatures (260 – 330 °C for 72 hours). The capacity of MSSV Py to convert functionalised biochemical precursors into hydrocarbon products more amenable to GC resolution was initially demonstrated by the conversion of bacterial hopanepolyols of several surface and ground water NOM fractions, a bacterial isolate and biomass growth from an ultrafiltration membrane into corresponding hopane biomarkers as described in CHAPTER 2. The significance and integrity of the hopane distribution of the MSSV data was assessed by analyses of the same samples by flash pyrolysis and the advanced analytical techniques of hydropyrolysis (HyPy) GC-MS and liquid chromatography (LC) -MS with atmospheric pressure <b>chemical</b> ionisation. <b>Flash</b> pyrolysis showed no evidence of hopanes. In comparison to the distributions of intact biohopanoids detected by LC-MS, the microbial hopane biomarker signatures detected by MSSV Py and HyPy were generally consistent, although HyPy did produce higher concentrations of ββ−diastereoisomers and higher MW fragments indicating a lower degree of structural alteration. Hopane products were detected in very low concentrations in the NOM samples, hence bacterial contribution may be more conveniently detected with biological methods (e. g., microbial arrays, bacterial counts). Nevertheless, MSSV pyrolysis represents a simple, low cost analytical method able to confirm the occurrence of diagnostic bacterial biomarkers in complex environmental settings, such as source waters and surrounding catchments, and may be a useful screening method prior to more involved characterisation possible with LC-MS. Moreover, this application represents an elegant demonstration of the capacity of MSSV pyrolysis to provide new information concerning functionalised biological precursors which have historically proved difficult to analyse by GC(MS). Additional source diagnostic molecular features detected by MSSV Py of the membrane biofoulant included sterane biomarkers of eukaryote triterpenoids (i. e. steroids), n-alkanes of fatty acids and C 16 -C 19 phenylalkanes indicative of common surfactants used to clean the membranes. The vastly improved molecular characterisation of the polar lipid constituents of membrane foulants, including the identification of industrial chemicals used in cleaning processes, suggests that this analytical capacity might also be applicable to monitoring the fate of organic constituents through the entire potable water system, from source through treatment and distribution to tap. Unlike the established bacterial hopanoid source of hopane biomarkers, the origins of most of the major products from MSSV pyrolysis of the NOM samples are not clear. Subsequent chapters were separately dedicated to a detailed investigation of several of the major product classes. CHAPTER 3 focused on the alkyl aromatic pyrolysates of NOM. The multitude of potential precursors of alkyl substituted benzenes and polycyclic aromatics (e. g. naphthalenes, phenanthrenes) significantly limits their diagnostic potential, nevertheless they represented a major proportion (20 – 50 % of total GC amenable pyrolysate signal) of the MSSV, and to a lesser degree, the flash pyrolysates of the HPO fractions of several NOM samples. The more highly substituted alkyl aromatics (and heteroatom products) of potentially greater source diagnostic value were better preserved by MSSV Py. Distinctive distributions of alkyl aromatics were detected by MSSV Py of the HPO fractions of several surface waters and a lysimetric plate collected ground water. All samples showed high alkyl benzene (AB) concentrations, whilst the ground water showed higher alkyl naphthalene (AN) concentrations than the surface waters. Correlation of several isopropyl substituted benzenes indicative of plant resin terpenoids in a bark sample, suggested these may be a significant source of the alkyl aromatics products of NOM. Furthermore, several higher plant derived polycyclic aromatic terpenoid biomarkers (e. g. cadalene, eudalene, retene and dehydroabietins) were also identified in the NOM fractions. Allochthonous and autochthonous sourced terpenoids have been proposed to be significant precursors of aquatic NOM; however diagnostic flash pyrolysis information about these types of contributors is typically limited. HPO fractions of two waste waters also showed consistently high concentration of alkyl aromatics, reflecting the general recalcitrance of their precursors to biological treatment. The distributions of these products differed from the natural surface and ground waters. Resistant aliphatic biomolecules derived from algal and bacterial biomass, susceptible to cyclisation and aromatization during MSSV Py, were tentatively assigned as the source of these distinctive pyrolysates. MSSV pyrolysis proved particularly sensitive to detection of heteroatom containing products of the NOM samples, and O products (25 – 50 %) and S products (1 – 5 %) were the focus of CHAPTER 4. The alkyl (≤ C 4) phenols (APs) of the HPO fractions of the humic rich Gartempe and Uruguay rivers accounted for ca. 40 % of the total product signal. Similarly high concentrations of APs were detected by MSSV Py of a lignin standard, demonstrating the laboratory simulated thermal transformation of methoxy phenolic structures into alkyl phenols. The high concentrations of APs and low concentrations of methoxyphenol biomarkers of lignin typically detected in NOM (e. g. by flash pyrolysis, 13 C NMR) suggests that a similar structural change may also be diagenetically mediated. The detection of APs, therefore, may be a more sensitive indicator of lignin input than guiaicyl or syringyl based biomarkers. The polyphenol structural units of selected tannin standards did not survive MSSV Py treatment, so are not likely responsible for the AP MSSV pyrolysates of the NOM samples. The HPO fraction of the waste waters showed similarly high concentrations of APs and alkyl aromatics (as discussed in Chapter 3), suggesting these products are recalcitrant to biological treatment. The Naintré waste waters also contained additional higher MW C 4 - 10 alkyl substituted phenols not detectable by flash pyrolysis. Several of these products were indicative of industrial chemicals of potential health concern. The TPI and COL fractions showed significant concentrations of alkyl furans which along with cyclic ketones were present in much lower abundance than APs in the HPO fractions. These products were attributed to carbohydrate sources following correlation with mono- and polysaccharide standards including glucose, cellulose and chitin. Trace or low relative abundances of these products in the biologically treated wastewaters reflects their vulnerability to mineralization. The HPO fractions of the NOM samples also showed low concentrations of alkyl benzofurans, similar distributions of which were detected in the SRFA standard, suggesting these are more stable polysaccharide metabolites, but still prone to further biodegradation as evident by only trace concentrations detected in the waste waters. Whilst MSSV provided increased access to several S-structural constituents of NOM, their relatively low concentrations and as yet undefined structural origins remain a challenge to source characterisation. Nevertheless, similar alkyl thiophene (AT) distributions were also generated from an S-containing amino acid standard. Notably higher concentrations of S-products in|$|R
