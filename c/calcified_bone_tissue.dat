40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the capacity of}} a clonal osteogenic cell line MC 3 T 3 -E 1, established from newborn mouse calvaria and {{selected on the basis}} of high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the confluent state, to differentiate into osteoblasts and mineralize in vitro. The cells in the growing state showed a fibroblastic morphology and grew to form multiple layers. On day 21, clusters of cells exhibiting typical osteoblastic morphology were found in osmiophilic nodular regions. Such nodules increased in number and size with incubation time and became easily identifiable with the naked eye by day 40 - 50. In the central part of well-developed nodules, osteocytes were embedded in heavily mineralized bone matrix. Osteoblasts were arranged at the periphery of the bone spicules and were surrounded by lysosome-rich cells and a fibroblastic cell layer. Numerous matrix vesicles were scattered around the osteoblasts and young osteocytes. Matrix vesicles and plasma membranes of osteoblasts, young osteocytes, and lysosome-rich cells showed strong reaction to cytochemical stainings for ALP activity and calcium ions. Minerals were initially localized in the matrix vesicles and then deposited on well-banded collagen fibrils. Deposited minerals consisted exclusively of calcium and phosphorus, and some of the crystals had matured into hydroxyapatite crystals. These results indicate that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells have the capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and osteocytes and to form <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tissue</b> in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} an inorganic bovine-derived hydroxyapatite bone substitute (Osteo graph ®) mixed with the same biomaterial coated with a synthetic peptide (P- 15) analogue of collagen (PepGen P- 15 ®). This blend of bone replacement materials was used for sinus floor augmentation. Assessments were carried out by using histology methods, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and microanalysis (EDX). Ultrastructural and analytical features of the interfaces between the graft material and the peri-biomaterial tissues were evaluated six months after implantation. Our findings clearly show that newly-formed crystallites first develop at the surface of implanted crystals. Histological investigations revealed new bone tissue linking biomaterial particles together. TEM assessments pointed out that lamellar bone was generally separated from the graft material by a layer of woven bone measuring between 1 and 1. 5 μm in thickness. Although <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tissue</b> was observed in direct contact with bone filling particles, the presence of mineralized granular material around implanted particles was also noticed. No characteristic periodic stria tion of mineralized collagen was evident within that mineralized structure. Chemical analyses (TEM-EDX) realized at different locations of newly formed mineralized granular substance along the interface revealed average Ca/P ratios ranging between 1. 02 and 1. 63. The different, concomitantly occurring, aforementioned structural features of the interfaces strongly suggested that the host responses to the used biomaterial blend resulted from dynamic osseointegration phenomena related to various interfacial mechanisms. Nevertheless, the biological response to the bone graft material appeared clinically and histologically satisfactory. </span...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{ultrastructure}} of <b>bone</b> <b>tissue</b> around implants of pure titanium {{inserted into the}} tibia in 4 patients with arthrosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Three main appearances of the interface were noted.

Secondly, a close contact was also seen between the implant and osteoid, the newly formed collagenous matrix being either uncalcified or calcifying. Thirdly, a loose extracellular matrix with fibrillar and nonfibrillar materials was sometimes observed between bone mineral and implant. There was no inflammatory reaction at the interface.

This study identifies fetal skeletal malformations {{that affect}} <b>calcified</b> and non-calcified <b>bone</b> <b>tissue</b> {{as a result}} of gestational zinc deficiency in rats, and it assesses the effect of maternal ZD in fetal bone calcification. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (180 - 250 g) were fed 1) a control diet (76. 4 micrograms Zn/g diet) ad libitum (group C), 2) a zinc-deficient diet (0 microgram/g) ad libitum (group ZD), or 3) the control diet pair-fed to the ZD rats (group PF). On day 21 of gestation, laparotomies were performed. Fetuses were weighed, examined for external malformations, and stained in toto with a double-staining technique for the study of skeletal malformations. Maternal and fetal tissues were used for Zn, Mg, Ca, and P determinations. Gross external malformations were present in 97 % of the ZD fetuses. No external malformations were found in fetuses from groups C and PF. Ninety-one percent of cleared ZD fetuses had multiple skeletal malformations, whereas only 3 % of the fetuses of group PF had skeletal defects; no skeletal malformations were found in fetuses from group C. Some of the skeletal malformations described in the ZD fetuses, mainly affecting non-calcified bone, were not mentioned in previous reports, thus stressing the importance of using double-staining techniques. Examination of stained fetuses and counting of ossification centers revealed important calcification defects in ZD fetuses.

Recently, Edil 3 has {{been implicated in}} various biological processes, including angiogenesis and cellular differentiation. It can inhibit inflammatory bone destruction. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the role of Edil 3 in osteoblast differentiation and its underlying molecular mechanisms. In wild-type mice, high expression levels of Edil 3 mRNA were observed in isolated calvaria and tibia/femur bones. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Edil 3 protein was localized along periosteum and <b>calcified</b> regions surrounding <b>bone</b> <b>tissues.</b> When murine calvaria-derived MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were cultured in osteogenic medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, Edil 3 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased. Treatment with Edil 3 protein in growth media increased expression levels of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin gene and phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Edil 3 treatment with osteogenic medium induced mineralization. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody against α 5 β 1 and MEK inhibitor U 0126 inhibited Edil 3 -enhanced osteogenic marker gene expression and mineral deposition. Edil 3 increased protein expression levels of transcription factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2). Edil 3 -induced Runx 2 protein expression was suppressed by pretreatment with U 0126.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} a possible mechanism {{to explain the}} presence of aluminium lines within fully <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> in aluminium-related osteomalacia. METHODS: Fifty five bone cases shown by bone biopsy to be aluminium-related osteomalacia were studied. In 38 specimens aluminium lines were identified within <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> {{by means of the}} Aluminon stain and a characteristic form of patchy mineralisation was seen within thickened osteoid seams. Five representative examples were analysed quantitatively by histomorphometry and electronprobe X-ray microanalysis and compared with five cases of vitamin D deficiency-related osteomalacia which also had patchy mineralisation. RESULTS: The patchy calcification occupied 40 +/- 8 % (mean +/- SEM) of the osteoid and consisted of small focal deposits (less than 40 microns diameter), often (52 %) around osteoid osteocytes (probably an underestimate of the association), and larger areas that extended to the aluminium lines at the underlying mineralisation front. Small and large mineralisation nuclei were seen ultrastructurally in the patchy calcification. Quantitative electronprobe X-ray microanalysis showed that calcium concentrations and calcium:phosphorus ratios in the mineralisation nuclei and in the superficial layer of the fully <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> of the aluminium-related osteomalacia cases were significantly less than values measured at similar sites in the vitamin D deficiency-related osteomalacia cases. Furthermore, aluminium could not be detected by means of this technique at the mineralisation front or along cement lines in these specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Calcification can occur in thickened osteoid seams in osteomalacia. It can begin around osteoid osteocytes as small deposits that enlarge within the osteoid and extend to the underlying mineralisation front or cement line where aluminium lines may become trapped. Complete calcification of osteoid could account for the presence of aluminium lines within fully <b>calcified</b> <b>bone.</b> The Aluminon stain appears to be a more sensitive method for the detection of aluminium in bone than electronprobe X-ray microanalysis...|$|R

The objectives of this work were as follows: (1) to clone the full-length cDNA of BMP- 2 in a marine fish model, (2) analyze its gene expression during development, in adult tissues and in cell lines, and (3) identify protein conserved features of vertebrate BMP- 2. Using a combination of RT- and 5 ′-RACE-PCR, a 1653 -bp fragment corresponding to Sparus aurata BMP- 2 cDNA (SaBMP- 2) was amplified. Levels of SaBMP- 2 gene expression were estimated using quantitative real-time PCR and shown to be strongly increased (150 -fold induction) at gastrulation, thus suggesting a key role for BMP- 2 in fish development. Tissue distribution of SaBMP- 2 mRNA revealed highest levels in the <b>calcified</b> <b>tissues</b> <b>bone,</b> caudal fin and scales and in liver. BMP- 2 was also found to be highly expressed in S. aurata bone-derived cell lines VSa 13 and VSa 16 and to be up-regulated (more than 10 -fold induction) in mineralized VSa 13 chondrocyte-like cells. Using bioinformatic tools and all vertebrate protein sequences available, conserved features of BMP- 2 were characterized. The mature protein was shown to be highly conserved across 20 species indicating that BMP- 2 function has been conserved throughout evolution, a finding that is {{in agreement with the}} widely accepted view of the important role played by BMPs in vertebrate development...|$|R

40|$|The {{replacement}} of the <b>calcified</b> cartilage by <b>bone</b> <b>tissue</b> during the endochondral ossification of the mandibular condyle is dependent of the resorbing activity of osteoclats. After partial resorption, calcified cartilage septa are covered by a primary bone matrix secreted by osteoblasts. Osteoadherin (OSAD) is a small proteoglycan present in bone matrix but absent in cartilage during the endochondral ossification. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effect of alendronate, a drug known to inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts, on the endochondral ossification of the mandibular condyle of young rats, by evaluating the distribution of osteoclasts and the presence of OSAD in the bone matrix deposited. Wistar newborn rats (n = 45) received daily injections of alendronate (n = 27) or sterile saline solution as control (n = 18) from the day of birth until the ages of 4, 14 and 30 days. At the days mentioned, the mandibular condyles were collected and processed for transmission electron microscopy analysis. Specimens were also submitted to tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) histochemistry and ultrastructural immunodetection of OSAD. Alendronate treatment did not impede the recruitment and fusion of osteoclasts at the ossification zone during condyle growth, but they presented inactivated phenotype. The trabeculae at the ossification area consisted of cartilage matrix covered by a layer of primary bone matrix that was immunopositive to OSAD at all time points studied. Apparently, alendronate impeded the removal of calcified cartilage and maturation of bone trabeculae in the mandibular ramus, while in controls they occurred normally. These findings highlight for giving attention to the potential side-effects of bisphosphonates administered to young patients once it may represent a risk of disturbing maxillofacial development.
