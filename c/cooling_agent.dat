2500|$|The Topeka, Kansas shops of the Santa Fe Railway built five {{experimental}} refrigerator cars employing {{liquid nitrogen}} as the <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> in 1965. A mist induced by liquified nitrogen was released throughout the car if the temperature rose above a pre-determined level. Each car carried [...] of refrigerant and could maintain {{a temperature of}} minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (30°C). During the 1990s, a few railcar manufacturers experimented {{with the use of}} liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) as a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent.</b> The move was in response to rising fuel costs, and was an attempt to eliminate the standard mechanical refrigeration systems that required periodic maintenance. The CO2 system can keep the cargo frozen solid as long as 14 to 16 days.|$|E
2500|$|The laws of {{thermodynamics}} {{indicate that}} absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because {{the temperature of the}} substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> asymptotically, and a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero. The kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed.|$|E
2500|$|Dry ice, {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "cardice" [...] (chiefly by British chemists), is the solid form of carbon dioxide. It is used primarily as a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent.</b> Its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice and not leaving any residue (other than incidental frost from moisture in the atmosphere). It is useful for preserving frozen foods where mechanical cooling is unavailable.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{and other}} {{automobiles}} produce waste heat (in the exhaust {{and in the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>agents).</b> Harvesting that heat energy, using a thermoelectric generator, can increase the fuel efficiency of the car.

2500|$|A {{refrigerator}} car (or [...] "reefer") is a refrigerated boxcar (U.S.), a {{piece of}} railroad rolling stock designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Refrigerator cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars (commonly used for transporting fruit), neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. Reefers can be ice-cooled, come equipped with any one {{of a variety of}} mechanical refrigeration systems, or utilize carbon dioxide (either as dry ice, or in liquid form) as a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent.</b> Milk cars (and other types of [...] "express" [...] reefers) may or may not include a cooling system, but are equipped with high-speed trucks and other modifications that allow them to travel with passenger trains.|$|E
2500|$|The Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch (SFRD) briefly {{experimented with}} dry ice as a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> in 1931. The {{compound}} was readily available and {{seemed like an}} ideal replacement for frozen water. Dry ice melts at [...] (versus [...] for conventional ice) and was twice as effective thermodynamically. Overall weight was reduced {{as the need for}} brine and water was eliminated. While the higher cost of dry ice was certainly a drawback, logistical issues in loading long lines of cars efficiently prevented it from gaining acceptance over conventional ice. Worst of all, it was found that dry ice can adversely affect the color and flavor of certain foods if placed too closely to them.|$|E
2500|$|Top icing is the {{practice}} of placing a [...] to [...] layer of crushed ice on top of agricultural products that have high respiration rates, need high relative humidity, and benefit from having the <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> sit directly atop the load (or within individual boxes). Cars with pre-cooled fresh produce were top iced just before shipment. Top icing added considerable dead weight to the load. Top-icing a [...] reefer required in excess of [...] of ice. It had been postulated that as the ice melts, the resulting chilled water would trickle down through the load to continue the cooling process. It was found, however, that top-icing only benefited the uppermost layers of the cargo, and that {{the water from the}} melting ice often passed through spaces between the cartons and pallets with little or no cooling effect. It was ultimately determined that top-icing is useful only in preventing an increase in temperature, and was eventually discontinued.|$|E

Refrigerator cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars, {{neither of which}} are fitted with cooling apparatus. They can be ice-cooled, or use one {{of a variety of}} mechanical refrigeration systems, or utilize carbon dioxide as a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent.</b> In the 1860s, slaughtered cattle from the Great Plains were preserved in barrels of salt. Regular box cars were loaded with ice in another effort to preserve fresh meat that had limited success. Generally, it was found more economical {{in the early days of}} refrigeration to cool the cars with ice or frozen brine which was periodically replenished at icing stations along rail routes. In 1857, the first shipment of refrigerated beef was made from the Chicago stockyards to the East Coast in an ordinary box car packed with ice. Finally in 1867, the first patent (U.S. Patent #71,423) for a specialized refrigerator car was issued to its inventor, J.B. Sutherland of Detroit, Michigan.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{results from the}} {{microbiological}} examination of foods {{is affected by the}} quality of the sample taken and the provision of effective transport systems which prevent temperature deterioration of the samples during transit. This project has investigated and evaluated the factors which affect transportation of food samples for microbiological analysis e. g. type of transport container, <b>cooling</b> <b>agents,</b> insulation agents and the influence of the sample load. The effect of these variables was determined using two calibrated, multi-channel temperature logging systems. This will lead to the evaluation of temperature logging devices for use in routine sampling. Results from these studies have been used to assess the existing guidelines in Code of Practice No 7 :Sampling for Analysis or Examination. The use of a Thermos 2700 cool box or a Coleman 28 Quart cool box with a modified insulated lid proved to be the best transport container.

40|$|Electric power {{performs}} a very indispensable {{role in our}} daily life. For economic growth of countries continuous sprinting of industries is an essential part. For nonstop running of these industries, ceaseless availability of electric power is an essential requirement.

The only limiting factor is the efficiency of the solar system. Because on STP the PV panel gives maximum output power at 250 C. The electrical efficiency of PV cell is adversely affected by the significant increase of cell OPT during absorption of solar radiation. To overcome the temperature increase of the panel we can use different <b>cooling</b> <b>agents</b> like water, air, oil, gases and liquids but here air and water has been used as <b>cooling</b> <b>agents.</b> Due to higher heat absorption capacity of water as compared to air, output power of the panel was found higher than air.

As a result, many have turned to clandestine recycling operations of e-waste in slums outside large French cities. At these sites, e-waste is broken into various types of metals, such as aluminum, copper, iron, and lead. Copper is extracted from cables by burning them in open fires, while car batteries are melted down for lead and refrigerators are sent through car crushers without removing <b>cooling</b> <b>agents,</b> which can release up to four tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere per unit.|$|R

50|$|Motor oil {{may also}} serve as a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent.</b> In some constructions oil is sprayed through a nozzle inside the {{crankcase}} onto the piston to provide cooling of specific parts that undergo high temperature strain. On the other hand, the thermal capacity of the oil pool has to be filled, i.e. the oil has to reach its designed temperature range before it can protect the engine under high load. This typically takes longer than heating the main <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> — water or mixtures thereof — up to its operating temperature. In order to inform the driver about the oil temperature, some older and most high-performance or racing engines feature an oil thermometer.|$|E
