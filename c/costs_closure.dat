40|$|Abstract There {{has been}} a steady {{increment}} in economic growth in Uganda and as the economy is on the rise, the demand for energy also increases. Hydro power energy production has been growing in Uganda {{as a result of}} the different types of dams created in Uganda along the River Nile. Uganda has been trying to reach the target of electricity capacity so as to ensure that her people get the energy required to improve on their livelihoods. Uganda as a whole has different energy sources but in this thesis, Bujagali dam will be at the center of the focus. Looking at the social and environmental impacts made upon its construction in Jinja. The main objective of this thesis was therefore to show how the livelihoods of the people dwelling in the neighborhood and the environment were affected by the construction of the dam. The livelihoods of the people before the construction of the dam were reviewed in regard to their social life as well as the environment from past literature provided. The different aspects in which the people and environment were affected after the construction of the dam were also reviewed through different interviews with the residents of Bujagali.    There were both positive and negative effects, socially, environmentally and economically due to the construction of the Bujagali. The positive social effects were: provision of land for farming, provision of employment opportunities for the residents, increase in tourism at the dam, the falls and the cultural centers, community development including education, health facilities, skill training, water supply and power supply while the negative effects were loss of land, cultural loss, and less access to different points of the river for fishing purposes for the residents. The positive environmental effects were increase in fish species, more health and safety awareness, and thermal plants closure hence less green house gases effects on the ozone layer, the noise levels effects due to the dam construction, were of no consequence as they were in the required standard.   The negative environmental effects were majorly water levels fluctuation that affects the head of water which in turn affects the capacity of power produced at the dam and air quality of the area during and after the construction of the dam especially air emissions. The positive economic effects were: increment of power to the national grid, lower electricity <b>costs,</b> <b>closure</b> of thermal plants as they were expensive to run and maintain and reduction of load shedding. The negative effect was the financial loan that the government of Uganda obtained to construct the dam that has to be paid back. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to study}} the pricing issue of deposit {{insurance}} with explicit consideration of bankruptcy <b>costs</b> and <b>closure</b> policies. Full coverage from deposit insurance is imposed by many regulators to stabilize the banking system in the current financial crisis, despite of the potential moral hazard problems. We argue that bankruptcy cost {{is an important factor}} in pricing deposit insurance, especially when the insured institution is insolvent. Applying the isomorphic relationship between deposit insurance and put option, we first derive a closed-form solution for the pricing model with bankruptcy <b>costs</b> and <b>closure</b> policies. Then, we modify the barrier option approach to price the deposit insurance in which the bankruptcy cost is set as a function of asset return volatility and more realistic closure policies considering possible forbearance can be accounted for. The properties of the models are supported by numerical simulations and are consistent with the risk-based pricing scheme.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy Manual DOE M 435. 1 - 1, “Radioactive Waste Management Manual,” {{requires}} that performance assessments demonstrate that releases of radionuclides {{to the environment}} are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Quantitative cost benefit analysis of radiation protection options is one component of the ALARA process. This report summarizes a quantitative cost benefit analysis of closure cover thickness for the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site (RWMS) on the Nevada Test Site. The optimum cover thickness that maintains doses ALARA is shown to be the thickness with the minimum total <b>closure</b> <b>cost.</b> Total <b>closure</b> <b>cost</b> {{is the sum of}} cover construction cost and the health detriment cost. Cover construction cost is estimated based on detailed <b>cost</b> estimates for <b>closure</b> of the 92 -acre Low-Level Waste Management Unit (LLWMU). The health detriment cost is calculated as the product of collective dose and a constant monetary value of health detriment in units of dollars per unit collective dose. Collective dose is the sum of all individual doses in an exposed population and has units of person-sievert (Sv). Five discrete cover thickness options ranging from 2. 5 to 4. 5 meters (m) (8. 2 to 15 feet [ft]) are evaluated. The optimization was subject to the constraints that (1) options must meet all applicable regulatory requirements and that (2) individual doses be a small fraction of background radiation dose. Total <b>closure</b> <b>cost</b> is found to be a monotonically increasing function of cover thickness for the 92 -ac LLWMU, the Northern Expansion Area, and the entire Area 5 RWMS. The cover construction cost is orders of magnitude greater than the health detriment cost. Two-thousand Latin hypercube sampling realizations of the relationship between total <b>closure</b> <b>cost</b> and cover thickness are generated. In every realization, the optimum cover thickness is 2. 5 m (8. 2 ft) for the 92 -ac Low-Level Waste Management Unit, the Northern Expansion Area, and the entire Area 5 RWMS. The conclusions of the optimization are found to be insensitive to all input parameters, the monetary value of the health detriment over a range of values from $ 200, 000 to $ 15, 000, 000 per person-Sv, and the period of integration of collective dose.

30|$|The {{estimated}} I- 35 E southbound lane closure {{and traffic}} impact cost was $ 720  k/day. Due to the extended traffic closure needs for the post-tensioned bent cap alternative, the total traffic <b>closure</b> <b>cost</b> was estimated as $ 8.6 million for this alternative, {{as opposed to}} only $ 720  k for the composite alternative.

40|$|This study investigates hazards {{that have}} the {{potential}} to close the Desert Road, which is part of New Zealand's major north-south link, State Highway 1. It provides a case study for the application of risk assessment methodology to the evaluation of road networks. The hazards that are investigated include snow and ice conditions, volcanic eruptions and lahars, seismic events, and traffic accidents. All of these hazards {{have the potential to}} close the Desert Road. For each of the hazards, a stochastic model is developed to determine the probability of the hazard occurring and the resulting road closure duration. The vulnerability of alternative routes through the Central North Island to these hazards are also evaluated. A traffic assignment model, SATURN, is used to predict the disruption caused by closures of the Desert Road and its alternative routes, quantifying the economic <b>cost</b> of <b>closures</b> to the New Zealand economy. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to find the probability distribution of the average annual <b>cost</b> of <b>closures</b> due to each hazard. Mitigation options that may either reduce the probability of closure occurring, or reduce the duration of closures, are investigated. The new risk of closure with the mitigation in place is compared to the existing risk of closure, to find the probability distribution of the benefit-cost ratio for each mitigation. A computer based risk optimisation program is described that can help select the portfolio of mitigation options that will optimise the risk reduction attained for a given expenditure...|$|R

40|$|Involuntary {{job loss}} in {{administrative}} data is commonly identified {{by focusing on}} mass-layoffs or plant closures. However, such events usually do not happen without prior knowledge, which potentially leads to selection in the labor turnover of distressed firms. We find that workers separating from closing plants up to 2 quarters before closure are associated with significantly lower displacement costs and on average significantly higher pre-closure earnings levels as opposed to ultimately displaced workers. Furthermore, our results indicate that displaced workers with high pre-closure earnings experience significantly lower reductions in future employment probabilities. These findings suggest that compositional differences cause estimated displacement costs to differ between early leavers and ultimately displaced workers.
