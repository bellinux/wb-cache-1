5000|$|In early December 2007, Dr. Karen Petric, the district's Superintendent, {{announced}} {{that she wanted to}} retire early due to security reasons. She cited death threats from a former employee as the reason she was requesting a $250,000 retirement package nearly 2 years early. On December 17, 2007, a reporter for ABC affiliate WISN <b>covering</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> accompanied by a camera crew, was able to gain unhindered access to the high school building because none of the doors she used were locked or monitored.|$|E
5000|$|On July 25, 2016, Anne Applebaum, {{columnist}} for the Washington Post, writes that [...] "… {{with the exception of}} a few people on Twitter and a handful of print journalists, most of those <b>covering</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> especially on television, are not interested in the nature of the hackers, and they are not asking why the Russians apparently chose to pass the emails on to WikiLeaks at this particular moment, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. They are focusing instead on the content of what were meant to be private emails..." [...] She goes on to describe in detail other Russian destabilization campaigns in Eastern European countries.|$|E
50|$|After {{earning a}} master's degree in {{environmental}} journalism from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Blum {{returned to the}} Fresno Bee, where she became an award-winning environmental reporter. She {{was the first to}} report on the startling incidence of severely deformed waterfowl at the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge, where poor management of irrigation runoff had polluted the wetland with toxic levels of the element selenium. Her work for the Fresno Bee put the mid-sized paper ahead of much larger regional rivals, including the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times in <b>covering</b> <b>this</b> major environmental <b>story.</b>|$|R

50|$|Interest in the Arab spring had a {{different}} tone around the world. In South Korea, for example, there was political coverage {{that focused on the}} causes of the Arab Spring but never really went into in depth analysis. This important difference is between the United States vested interest in the country compared to other countries across the globe. South Korea, an ever-increasing world power, has very little use in <b>covering</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> Most of the newspapers took tones that reflected a possible sentiment similar to what people would feel in China and in North Korea but never really sought far to compare the two. Political coverage in these far reaching parts of the globe was dim {{because of the lack of}} national interest in these states.|$|E
5000|$|Two of Bear Stearns' {{hedge funds}} {{collapsed}} in June 2007 {{and needed to}} be bailed out, putting Marin {{at the center of the}} news. The New York Times, <b>covering</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> discovered that Marin had a blog, entitled [...] "Whim of Iron," [...] and publicized this fact on June 28, 2007. The blog had mostly innocuous entries, chiefly concerning his critiques of movies, his travel to Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, and how he lost weight after bariatric surgery. It also stated that in dealing with the crisis over Bear Stearns' hedge funds he felt like Leonidas and the Spartans fighting off the Persians in 300. Twenty-four hours later Marin was relieved from his major duties at Bear Stearns and shunted aside to a job as an advisor.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2013, David Fogarty, former Reuters {{climate change}} {{correspondent}} in Asia, resigned after {{a career of}} almost 20 years with the company and wrote about a [...] "climate of fear" [...] which resulted in [...] "progressively, getting any climate change-themed story published got harder" [...] following comments from then deputy editor-in-chief Paul Ingrassia {{that he was a}} [...] "climate change sceptic". In his comments, Fogarty stated that [...] "Some desk editors happily subbed and pushed the button. Others agonised and asked a million questions. Debate on some story ideas generated endless bureaucracy by editors frightened to take a decision, reflecting a different type of climate within Reuters—the climate of fear," [...] and that [...] "by mid-October, I was informed that climate change just wasn't a big story for the present. …Very soon after that conversation I was told my climate change role was abolished." [...] Ingrassia, currently Reuters' managing editor, formerly worked for The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones for 31 years. Reuters responded to Fogarty's piece by stating that [...] "Reuters has a number of staff dedicated to <b>covering</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> including a team of specialist reporters at Point Carbon and a columnist. There has been no change in our editorial policy." ...|$|E

40|$|How {{should the}} news media prepare for and cope with a {{potential}} bioterrorist attack? In this Fred Friendly Seminar, Professor Michael Dorf of the Columbia University School of Law and 12 panelists role-play a hypothetical scenario that begins in a city hospital where a spike in a flu-like illness causes the ER staff to confront a chilling possibility: {{that it is not}} the flu at all, but something far worse. What should the ER do with the overflow of patients? Send them home? What if they are contagious? When does bioterrorism become a possible cause? When should the health department be contacted? When will the public find out, and what will their reaction be? What is the job of the journalists <b>covering</b> <b>this</b> <b>story?</b> Should they report the story when the health department is uncertain of the diagnosis but rumors are flying and the public is clamoring for information? A lively panel wrestles with these and a host of other dilemmas. Panelists include Douglas Clifton, editor of The Plain Dealer (Cleveland); Jerome Hauer, former acting assistant secretary for public health emergency preparedness at the Department of Health and Human Services; Joseph Henderson, associate director of terrorism preparedness at the CDC; Seattle Chief of Police R. Gil Kerlikowske; Paula Madison, president and general manager of KNBC-TV, in L. A.; Boston Mayor Thomas Menino; Lewis Nelson, M.
