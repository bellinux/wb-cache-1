5000|$|In 1849, James Allen Hardin {{traveled}} the Applegate-Lassen Trail. While {{north of the}} Black Rock, he found ore {{that at the time}} he thought was lead. He returned to camp with thirty or forty pounds and found that it easily melted. They made bullets out of a portion, left a portion at the camp and kept a portion. The portion that remained at camp was later found and eventually assayed to be a <b>carbonate</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> and silver. [...] Hardin smelted a portion of the rock down to a button that many thought to be silver. Hardin sent the button to San Francisco in 1850, where it was lost in the fire of 1850 (possibly the San Francisco Fire of 1851?). In the meantime, Hardin had settled in Petaluma, California. In 1858, an expedition was launched to find the mine. As with many stories of a lost mine, nothing was found, though there was a rush and the town of Hardin City was created.|$|E

The main provision was to set minimum wages in certain trades with the history of low wages, because of surplus of available workers, the presence of women workers, or the lack of skills. At first it applied to four industries: chain-making, ready-made dresses. paper-box making, and the machine-made lace and finishing trade. About 70 per cent of their 200,000 workers were women. [...] It was later expanded to coal mining and then to other industries with preponderance of unskilled manual labour by the Trade Boards Act 1918, and by 1924 to farm labourers.|$|E

These salts are all poorly soluble in water. Among the halides, the iodide is less soluble than the bromide, which, in turn, is less soluble than the chloride.|$|R
40|$|The {{sub-vertical}} carbonate-silica veins {{filling the}} Bow Ridge Fault, where exposed in Trench 14 {{on the east}} side of Yucca Mountain, carry a lead isotopic signature that can be explained in terms of local sources. Two isotopically distinguishable [...] silicate and <b>carbonate</b> [...] fractions <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> are recognized within the vein system as well as in overlying surficial calcrete deposits. The acid-insoluble silicate fraction is contributed largely from the decomposing Miocene volcanic tuff, which forms the wall rock of the fault zone and is a ubiquitous component of the overlying soil. Lead contained in the silicate fraction approaches in isotopic composition that of the Miocene volcanic rocks of Yucca Mountain, but diverges from it in some samples by being more enriched in uranogenic isotopes. The <b>carbonate</b> fraction <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> in both vein and calcrete samples resides dominantly in the HCl- and CH{sub 3 }COOH-soluble calcite. HCl evidently also attacks and removes lead from silicate phases, but the milder CH{sub 3 }COOH dissolution procedure oftentimes identifies a significantly more radiogenic lead in the calcite. Wind-blown particulate matter brought to the area from Paleozoic and Late Proterozoic limestones in surrounding mountains may be the ultimate source of the calcite. Isotopically more uniform samples suggest that locally the basaltic ash and other volcanic rock have contributed most <b>of</b> the <b>lead</b> to both fractions of the vein system. An important finding of this study is that the data does not require the more exotic mechanisms or origins that have been proposed for the veins. Instead, the remarkably similar <b>lead</b> isotopic properties <b>of</b> the veins to those of the soil calcretes support their interpretation as a surficial, pedogenic phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Lead is {{a common}} {{pollutant}} found in soil. The characteristics <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> contaminated soil may vary depending on various sources <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> pollutants and different soils. In this research, samples were collected from soils contaminated by <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> different sources including discarded slag, lead smelting plant and gunnery firing range for conducting characteristic analyses. The samples were also subject to washing using seven different cleaning agents including acids such as HNO 3 and HCl, cationic exchangers such as AlCl 3, FeCl 3, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2, as well chelating agent such as EDTA- 4 Na to study the efficiency of these agents <b>of</b> removing <b>leads</b> <b>of</b> various bindings in the contaminated soil.

40|$|Bacteria {{are able}} to induce {{carbonate}} precipitation although the participation of microbial or chemical processes in speleothem formation remains a matter of debate. In this study, the origin <b>of</b> <b>carbonate</b> depositions such as moonmilk, an unconsolidated microcrystalline formation with high water content, and the consolidation <b>of</b> <b>carbonate</b> precipitates into hard speleothems were analyzed. The utilized methods included measurements of the composition of stable isotopes in these precipitates, fluorimetric determinations of RNA/DNA ratios and respirometric estimations in Altamira Cave. Results from isotope composition showed increases of the δ 18 O and δ 13 C ratios from moonmilk {{in the very first}} stages of formation toward large speleothems. Estimates of RNA/DNA ratios suggested an inactivation of microorganisms from incipient moonmilk toward consolidated deposits <b>of</b> calcium <b>carbonate.</b> Respiratory activity <b>of</b> microorganisms also showed a significant decrease in samples with accumulated calcite. These results suggest that bacterial activity induces the conditions required for calcium carbonate precipitation, initiating the first stages of deposition. Progressive accumulation <b>of</b> <b>carbonate</b> <b>leads</b> towards a less favorable environment for the development of bacteria.

40|$|Abstract: Lead Zirconate {{ceramics}} are technically and commercially important piezoelectric materials. It is an antiferroelectric ceramic. The antiferroelectric (AFE) to ferroelectric transition, {{under the}} application of a strong electric field, leads to significant energy storage for a dc field. This feature of PbZrO 3 makes it a candidate material for energy storage applications. In the present study, the synthesis <b>of</b> the <b>lead</b> zirconate from water-soluble salts of Pb and Zr (chlorides) is done by homogeneous precipitation via urea decomposition. The gradually pH increase obtained by the decomposition of urea, with the steady supply of OH-andCO 3 2 - ions, typically leads to the precipitation <b>of</b> metal hydroxyl <b>carbonates</b> <b>of</b> controlled particle morphology. The X-ray diffraction and Scanning electron microscopy were performed for the confirmation <b>of</b> the obtained <b>Lead</b> Zirconate precipitate.
