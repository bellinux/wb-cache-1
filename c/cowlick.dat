By the end of the year, Alfalfa {{was one of the main}} characters, while Harold had been relegated to the background. Although Carl was an experienced singer and musician, his character Alfalfa was often called upon to sing off-key renditions of popular songs, most often those of Bing Crosby. Alfalfa also sported a <b>cowlick.</b>|$|E
25|$|North Fork Tangascootack Creek {{begins in}} a valley in eastern Beech Creek Township. The creek flows east-northeast, {{receiving}} the tributaries Left Branch Puncheon Run and <b>Cowlick</b> Run from the left. The creek then enters Bald Eagle Township, where its valley gets deeper. In western Bald Eagle Township, it receives the tributary Mill Branch from the left. As the creek continues in the same direction, it passes by several strip mines. Further on, the creek turns sharply north and then sharply east, eventually receiving the tributary Boiler Run, again from the left. After picking up Buckhorn Hollow, its final tributary, from the left, it turns south. A short distance later, it enters Tangascootack Creek.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{handing out}} candy bars during his lectures is a {{reference}} to the third season episode, [...] "Business School", where Michael passed out chocolate bars during his speech to a business school classroom. Michael expresses regret for insulting Tony Gardner, the heavyset man who briefly transferred from the Stamford branch of Dunder Mifflin to the Scranton branch, who Michael drives to quit by trying to lift onto a table for an orientation demonstration in the third season episode, [...] "The Merger". Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua, New Hampshire, where Holly works, and Utica, New York, where Karen works. Michael said he can only prepare for his lectures by listening to [...] "silence or Sam Kinison", an American stand-up comedian known for his extreme and vulgar sense of humor. Michael said he learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the lyrical oath of loyalty to the United States flag, by setting the lyrics to the rhythm of [...] "Old McDonald Had a Farm", a children's song about the various animals on a farm. During one lecture, Michael and Pam both do impressions of the protagonist from Forrest Gump, the 1994 film starring Tom Hanks as a mentally handicapped man. Michael also uses the title from the films Good Morning, Vietnam (at his Nashua lecture by saying [...] "Good morning, Vietna...shua!") The Princess Bride, Gone with the Wind and Jerry Maguire in his lectures. Holly's computer has a screensaver with images of Ed Grimley, the nerdy character with a <b>cowlick</b> played by comedian Martin Short in the comedy shows SCTV and Saturday Night Live.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cowlicks</b> {{are more}} obvious in straight, thick hair. In people with straight, coarse hair the scalp will {{show in the}} center of the whorl because the light penetrates to the scalp. Both men and women have <b>cowlicks,</b> which can be covered by longer hair so the whorl is not visible.|$|R
50|$|The Abyssinian is a {{breed of}} guinea pig that is {{relatively}} common {{as both a}} pet and show animal. The Abyssinian is set apart from other breeds of guinea pig by its coat, which is marked with radially growing swirls or <b>cowlicks</b> of hair referred to as rosettes.|$|R
5000|$|A hair whorl is a {{patch of}} hair [...] in a {{circular}} direction around a visible center point. Hair whorls occur in most hairy animals, on the body {{as well as on}} the head. Hair whorls, also known as crowns, swirls, trichoglyphs, or <b>cowlicks,</b> can be either clockwise or counterclockwise in direction of growth.|$|R
2500|$|Santorum {{grew up in}} Berkeley County, West Virginia, and Butler County, Pennsylvania. In West Virginia, {{his family}} lived in an {{apartment}} provided by the Veterans Administration. Santorum attended elementary school at Butler Catholic School {{and then went on}} to the Butler Senior High School. [...] He was nicknamed [...] "Rooster", supposedly for both a <b>cowlick</b> strand of hair and an assertive nature, particularly on important political issues. After his parents transferred to the Naval Station Great Lakes in northern Illinois, Santorum attended the Roman Catholic Carmel High School in Mundelein, Illinois, for one year, graduating in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Mitchell — an importuning but lovable, freckle-faced five-and-a-half-year-old {{boy with}} a famous blond <b>cowlick</b> and a penchant for mischief. His long-suffering parents can only shake their heads and try to explain their son's antics to others. Despite this, they really do love him very much. Dennis's wide-eyed curiosity, his well-meaning {{attempts}} to help, his innocent, matter-of-fact bluntness, his youthful energy and enthusiastic nature always seem to lead to trouble wherever he goes (most often at Mr. Wilson's expense). He wears a blue/black striped shirt, tennis shoes, and red overalls with pockets that are sometimes filled with snakes, frogs, or his slingshot. He hates carrots and baths, loves root beer (especially with cookies), ketchup, water pistols, his teddy bear [...] "Teddy", getting into fights with other boys his age, mud puddles, and TV Westerns (especially those starring Cowboy Bob), and has occasionally been depicted wearing a cowboy costume. Dennis has a poster and an autographed picture of Cowboy Bob as well. In fact, {{he is such a}} fan that once a week he goes to the local theater to watch a Cowboy Bob western. A favorite TV show of Dennis's is [...] "Uncle Earl." [...] Among the running gags: Dennis has a soft spot for kittens and puppies, which he is always taking home to feed; Dennis loves loud instruments—such as horns and drums; Dennis ruins Christmas songs with shouts of cowboy songs or annoys adults by shouting out loud. Whenever Dennis is in the local department store trying out toys, such as tricycles, he ends up breaking them and his parents have to buy them. In fact Dennis nearly causes kindergarten teachers, Librarians [...] department store Christmas Santas, department store saleswomen, Drugstore salesmen, Hardware store salesmen, shoe salesmen, barbers, and the local post office workers to have nervous breakdowns when he comes around. Dennis also believes in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus; another running gag is Dennis on Christmas Eve dreaming that he meets Santa Claus, and causing chaos for everyone else.|$|E
6000|$|It {{cannot be}} pretended that Alice was quite {{pleased with the}} way her friends took her engagement, or rather {{the way in which}} they spoke of Dan. It seemed to her that she alone, or she chiefly, ought to feel that {{sweetness}} and loveliness of which every one told her, as if she could not have known it. If he was sweet and lovely to every one, how was he different to her except in degree? Ought he not to be different in kind? She put the case to Miss Cotton, whom it puzzled, while she assured Alice that he was different in kind to her, though he might not seem so; the very fact that he was different in degree proved that he was different in kind. This logic sufficed for the moment of its expression, but it did not prevent Alice from putting the case to Dan himself. At one of those little times when she sat beside him alone and rearranged his necktie, or played with his watch chain, or passed a critical hand over his <b>cowlick,</b> she asked him if he did not think they ought to have an ideal in their engagement. [...] "What ideal?" [...] he asked. He thought it was all solid ideal through and through. [...] "Oh," [...] she said, [...] "be more and more to each other." [...] He said he did not see how that could be; if there was anything more of him, she was welcome to it, but he rather thought she had it all. She explained that she meant being less to others; and he asked her to explain that.|$|E
50|$|A hair whorl is a {{patch of}} hair growing in the {{opposite}} direction {{of the rest of the}} hair. Hair whorls can occur on animals with hairy coats, and are often found on horses and cows. Locations where whorls are found in equines include the stomach, face, stifle and hocks. Hair whorls in horses are also known as crowns, swirls, trichoglyphs, or <b>cowlicks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ed Grimley is an {{excessively}} <b>cowlicked,</b> hyperactive manchild who {{is obsessed}} with banal popular culture, particularly Wheel of Fortune and its host, Pat Sajak. He also loves to play the triangle, which for him consists of playing a recorded musical piece, striking the triangle once, and then wildly dancing to the recording. His catchphrases include [...] "I must say", [...] "totally decent", [...] "makes me completely mental," [...] and [...] "give me a break".|$|R
5000|$|The fair {{featured}} in several {{works from the}} period. In Armijn Pane's 1940 novel Belenggu (Shackles), the male lead Tono discovers that his mistress, Yah, is also his favourite kroncong singer during a competition at Gambir. Ismail Marzuki wrote the song [...] "Kr. Pasar Gambir dan Stambul Anak Jampang" [...] ("Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the <b>Cowlicked</b> Child") to describe {{the atmosphere of the}} fair; the song has since been recorded by several other artists, including Chrisye.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed so}} long since they had met that the change in Alice did not strike him as strange or as too rapidly operated. They met with the fervour natural after such a separation, {{and she did not}} so much assume as resume {{possession}} of him. It was charming to have her do it, to have her act as if they had always been engaged, to have her try to press down the <b>cowlick</b> that started capriciously across his crown, and to straighten his necktie, and then to drop beside him on the sofa; it thrilled and awed him; and he silently worshipped the superior composure which her sex has in such matters. Whatever was the provisional interpretation which her father and mother pretended to put upon the affair, she apparently had no reservations, and they talked of their future as a thing assured. The Dark Ages, as they agreed to call the period of despair for ever closed that morning, had matured their love till now it was a rapture of pure trust. They talked as if nothing could prevent its fulfilment, and they did not even affect to consider the question of his family's liking it or not liking it. She said that she thought his father was delightful, and he told her that his father had taken the greatest fancy to her at the beginning, and knew that Dan was in love with her. She asked him about his mother, and she said just what he could have wished her to say about his mother's sufferings, and the way she bore them. They talked about Alice's going to see her.|$|E

Manifestations {{similar to those}} seen in the FG syndrome include severe constipation, tall, broad foreheads, hypotonia, and <b>cowlicks</b> of the hair line, but no individual patient had all {{the features of the}} syndrome and none had macrocephaly. The facial appearance was distinctive but different from that seen in the FG syndrome. The cases are presented in order to discuss the phenotypic limits of the FG syndrome and to consider the need to separate other distinct but similar entities...|$|R
5000|$|A {{large number}} of Marzuki's songs have been rerecorded and {{released}} in different genres, including pop music and keroncong, such as"Kr. Pasar Gambir dan Stambul Anak Jampang" [...] (Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the <b>Cowlicked</b> Child) which was covered by Chrisye on the album Dekade with arrangement by Erwin Gutawa. Several of his songs, including [...] "Gugur Bunga", [...] "Melati di Tapal Batas", [...] "Selendang Sutra", [...] "Pahlawan Muda", [...] "Rayuan Pulau Kelapa", and [...] "Waktu Malam", are considered compulsory and taught in schools.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people find}} cowlicks irritating {{as they often}} {{conflict}} with the desired hairstyle. There {{are several ways to}} tame an unruly <b>cowlick.</b> For most people, a combination of the right hairstyle, length, product used, and styling technique can overcome the appearance. For people who are more concerned about <b>cowlick</b> management, more drastic measures may be used. Electrology, waxing, and even cosmetic surgery can be used to more permanently correct the <b>cowlick.</b> However, many people have also used their cowlicks to their advantage, especially for those having cowlicks at the hairline which can make it easier to style a pompadour.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{thickness}} of the hair and the desired volume, topping may include thinning which can be accomplished by a variety of methods including thinning shears method, slithering with regular barber shears or the push back method with regular shears or thinning shears. The hair to be thinned may be held with the fingers or comb.Whorls, <b>cowlicks,</b> and irregularities of the scalp can be addressed by shear point tapering techniques. Only a few hairs are cut in the problem areas using just the tips of the shears, over comb. Topping as well as siding may also be achieved with razor cutting techniques.|$|R
50|$|The {{resultant}} scar from hairline advancement {{is typically}} hidden by regrowth of hair, {{in some cases}} with <b>cowlicks,</b> the scar can be seen. In such cases hair transplants can totally disguise the scar. In males with progressive baldness, the surgical scar may become more visible as balding advances. Hair thinning from “shock loss” can occur and is usually temporary. Infections are rare. Follicular unit hair transplants can be done as an alternative treatment although the results take up to 2 years to get enough hair length and density to compare with the near instantaneous results of the hairline lowering operation.|$|R

Unlike {{the rest of the}} cast, Shadow's design remains mostly unchanged, other than having several <b>cowlicked</b> quills and a taller, slimmer build like Sonic, and his head quills are less spread out. He first appears in the episode, [...] "It Takes a Village to Defeat a Hedgehog", when Eggman tries to convince him to join his army of villains, but Shadow refuses him and decides to challenge Sonic alone, but also attempts to defeat Eggman as well for using him.|$|R

5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} occur in many breeds, {{which have been}} {{developed}} since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with <b>cowlicks,</b> or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.|$|R
50|$|It is a hay-like grass {{found in}} the upper areas of {{brackish}} coastal salt marshes. It is a slender and wiry plant that grows in thick mats 30-60 cm high, green in spring and summer, and turns light brown in late fall and winter. The stems are wispy and hollow, and the leaves roll inward and appear round. Because its stems are weak, the wind and water action can bend the grass, creating {{the appearance of a}} field of tufts and <b>cowlicks.</b> Like its relative smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora, saltmeadow cordgrass produces flowers and seeds on only one side of the stalk. Flowers are a deep purple from June to October and turn brown in the winter months.|$|R
50|$|Fisher {{originally}} {{changed the}} appearance of Palooka to fit each reigning real-life champ - until the coming of African-American Joe Louis in the 1930s, at which time {{the image of the}} <b>cowlicked</b> blond Palooka remained unchanged. Though his adventures were mostly low-key, he was pumped up by a supporting cast led by girlfriend Ann Howe, boxing manager Knobby Walsh, his mute orphan sidekick Little Max, Smokey, his black valet and later sparring partner and lovable giant Humphrey Pennyworth, a smiling blacksmith who wielded a 100-pound (45 kg) maul. Like Ozark Ike McBatt in baseball, Joe Palooka was intended to exemplify the sports hero in an age when uprightness of character was supposed to matter most. The character was part of an effort among top newspaper cartoonists to sell WWII-era Series E bonds to the public as a wartime financing initiative.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>cowlick</b> is {{a section}} of hair that stands {{straight}} up or lies at an angle {{at odds with the}} style in which the rest of an individual's hair is worn. Cowlicks appear when the growth direction of the hair forms in (against) the spiral pattern. The term [...] "cowlick" [...] originates from the domestic bovine's habit of licking its young, which results in a swirling pattern in the hair. The most common site of a human <b>cowlick</b> is in the crown, but they can show up anywhere. They also sometimes appear in the front and back of the head.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{long-term}} population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted {{debate on the}} generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ~ 25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, <b>cowlicks,</b> and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led to {{the reduction in the}} prevalence of the defects previously associated with inbreeding depression. Although the timescale for this inbreeding depression is larger than of those more immediate Allee effects, it has significant implications on {{the long-term}} persistence of a species.|$|R
500|$|In 2001 Chrisye {{released}} the studio album Konser Tur 2001 (Concert Tour 2001), which included two new songs and several old ones. The music video {{for one of}} the new songs, [...] "Setia" [...] ("Loyal"), was controversial owing to its portrayal of a woman in tight clothing. Soon afterwards, Chrisye decided to cover some of what he considered the most important Indonesian songs since the country's independence in 1945, ranging from songs from the 1940s like Ismail Marzuki's [...] "Kr. Pasar Gambir & Stambul Anak Jampang" [...] ("Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the <b>Cowlicked</b> Child"), to the late 1990s such as Ahmad Dhani's [...] "Kangen" [...] ("Longing"). It also featured a song written exclusively for the album by Pongky of Jikustik and two duets with Sophia Latjuba. The album, Dekade (Decade), was released in 2002; by October 2003 it had sold 350,000 copies. On 15 December 2002 Chrisye participated in the Bali for the World– Voices of Stars concert at Kartika Beach Plaza to raise funds for the victims of the bombings on 12 October; other acts involved included Melly Goeslaw, Gigi, Slank, and Superman is Dead. On 12 July 2004 Chrisye held a third concert, Dekade, at Plenary Hall. The concert, with a set that contained numerous classics included in Dekade, featured duets with Sophia Latjuba and several of the original performers, such as Fariz RM with [...] "Sakura" [...] and A. Rafiq with [...] "Pengalaman Pertama" [...] ("First Experience"); Gutawa's orchestra again provided the music.|$|R
