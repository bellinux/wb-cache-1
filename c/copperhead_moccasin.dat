50|$|The World of Reptiles is the zoo's oldest public {{building}} still used for public exhibits, {{designed in the}} late 1950s and {{opened to the public}} in 1962. The building is home to hundreds of snakes, lizards, turtles, tortoises, frogs, toads, and salamanders from around the world. Exhibited species include black mamba, king cobra, and reticulated python. Georgia native species include eastern diamond-backed rattlesnake, timber rattlesnake, <b>copperhead,</b> water <b>moccasin,</b> Carolina pygmy rattlesnake, bog turtle, and gopher tortoise.|$|R
50|$|Up {{until the}} 20th century, Siesta Key was {{virtually}} vacant and {{was referred to}} as Clam Island, Little Sarasota Island, or Sarasota Key. The Island was not connected to the city of Sarasota in any way, so {{the only way to get}} to and from the island was by boat. It had deep vegetation, snakes of all varieties (including all of the venomous ones found in the United States - rattlesnakes, <b>copperheads,</b> water <b>moccasins</b> and coral snakes), sand fleas, wildcats and wild boars.|$|R

5000|$|There are six {{species of}} venomous snake in Florida: Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake, Southern <b>Copperhead,</b> Cottonmouth/Water <b>Moccasin,</b> Timber Rattlesnake, Dusky Pigmy Rattlesnake, and Coral Snake. Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnakes, Dusky Pigmy Rattlesnakes, and Coral Snakes are found {{across the entire}} state of Florida. The Southern Copperhead is {{typically}} only found in the Panhandle of Florida, whereas the Timber Rattlesnake is found in northeastern and north central parts of the state, with few sightings in the panhandle. There are two species of Cottonmouth/ Water Moccasin found in Florida: the Florida Cottonmouth and the Eastern Cottonmouth. The Florida Cottonmouth is found throughout the state, while the Eastern Cottonmouth is found only in {{the western edge of the}} panhandle of Florida.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{majority}} of patients seeking medical treatment for snakebites do not suffer from severe envenomation. However, no guidelines exist for ordering coagulation markers in patients with minimal or moderate envenomation, nor in {{those who do not}} receive antivenom. In this study, we sought to determine whether it was possible to limit the practice of ordering coagulation studies to those patients suffering severe envenomation, rattlesnake envenomation, or both. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all cases of crotalid snakebite presenting to an adult emergency department (ED) from April 1998 to June 2006. Each chart was abstracted for patient’s age, gender, type of snake (if known), severity of envenomation at initial presentation, coagulation test results, whether antivenom was administered, and whether the patient was admitted. Results: Over an approximately 8 -year period, 131 snakebite cases presented that met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 (26. 7 %) had some type of coagulation marker abnormality. Limiting coagulation testing to patients suffering severe envenomation or rattlesnake envenomation would have resulted in failure to identify 89 % or 77 %, respectively, of the 35 patients who were found to have at least 1 abnormal coagulation marker. Conclusion: Our study failed to identify a subset of patients that could be defined as low risk or for whom coagulation marker testing could be foregone. This study suggests that coagulation tests should be routinely performed on all patients presenting to the ED with complaints of envenomation by <b>copperheads,</b> <b>moccasins,</b> or rattlesnakes. Further clarification of when coagulation markers are indicated may require a prospective study that standardizes snake identification and the timing of coagulation marker testing.

50|$|Waterwood {{is home to}} a {{stunning}} variety of flora and fauna. The following animals have been observed in the area: white-tailed deer, split-fin minnow, honeybee, great horned owl, bluejay, black rat snake, water <b>moccasin,</b> <b>copperhead</b> snake. Waterwood is also home to many species of semi-aquatic shrubs, including blue-lance and river crowns. The area is full of trees drowned during the swamp's forming. The trees have fallen to form bridges traversing the entire area. The trees decaying in the swamp's water results in the water taking in on a color similar to dark tea. The water is also rich in nutrients, allowing it to support a large population of microscopic life forms.|$|R
50|$|Crotalidae {{polyvalent}} immune fab, {{sold under}} the brandname CroFab, {{is a type}} of snake antivenom, indicated for minimal or moderate North American Crotalid (Rattlesnake, <b>Copperhead</b> and Cottonmouth/Water <b>moccasin)</b> snake envenomation. It was developed by the Venom Immunochemistry, Pharmacology and Emergency Response (VIPER) Institute, University of Arizona, and commercialized by BTG plc (formerly Protherics PLC). Crotalid snakebites can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on the size and type of snake, the amount of venom injected and the location of the bite. This in turn determines the number of vials of CroFab that are required by the patient. Untreated, the snake venom can cause severe pain and tissue damage that can result in the loss of a limb or even death. Prompt (within six hours of snake bite) treatment with CroFab is recommended.|$|R
40|$|Sixty-seven {{patients}} {{hospitalized for}} poisonous snakebite between 1975 and 1990 were managed by elevation, tetanus prophylaxis, intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and often by a limited excision of the bite {{site in the}} Emergency Department, with sequential laboratory studies as needed. Antivenin was used for systemic envenomation, and 23 of the 67 patients (34 %) received 133 vials. Thirteen of the twenty-three patients (56 %) had adverse reactions to the antivenin. Two significant observations arose. First age was an indicator. Eleven of eighteen patients 12 years or younger (61 %) received antivenin, whereas 12 of 49 patients older than 12 years (24 %) received antivenin (p = 0. 0085, Fisher's exact test). Second species of snake was an indicator. Sixty-two snakes were identified (93 %). Of 39 rattlesnake (Crotalus and Sistrurus) bites, 20 patients received antivenin (53 %), but of 23 <b>copperhead</b> and water <b>moccasin</b> (Agkistrodon) bites, only three patients (12. 5 %) received antivenin (p = 0. 0025). Antivenin may be indicated for use in systemic rattlesnake envenomation, especially in younger patients...|$|R
50|$|In the U.S. {{the only}} {{approved}} antivenom for pit viper (rattlesnake, <b>copperhead</b> and water <b>moccasin)</b> snakebite {{is based on}} a purified product made in sheep known as CroFab. It was approved by the FDA in October, 2000. U.S. coral snake antivenom is no longer manufactured, and remaining stocks of in-date antivenom for coral snakebite expired in the Fall of 2009, leaving the U.S. without a coral snake antivenom. Efforts are being made to obtain approval for a coral snake antivenom produced in Mexico which would work against U.S. coral snakebite, but such approval remains speculative. In the absence of antivenom, all coral snakebite should be treated in a hospital by elective endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation until the effects of coral snake neurotoxins abate. It {{is important to remember that}} respiratory paralysis in coral snakebite can occur suddenly, often up to 12 or more hours after the bite, so intubation and ventilation should be employed in anticipation of respiratory failure and not after it occurs, when it may be too late.|$|R
50|$|Whitetail {{deer are}} the largest {{indigenous}} mammals found in the Southeast, {{with the exception of}} small, isolated populations of black bear and the endangered Florida panther. Many small mammals inhabit this region including raccoons, fox squirrels, eastern gray squirrels, foxes, cottontail rabbits, armadillos and opossums. Bobwhite and wild turkey are the main game bird that {{can be found in the}} region. Other very common birds found in the Southeast are mourning doves, pine warbler, cardinal, summer tanager, Carolina wren, ruby-throated hummingbird, blue jay, hooded warbler, eastern towhee, and tufted titmouse. Many non-game migratory birds and migratory waterfowl are common as well. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is also native to the region. Numerous species of reptiles and amphibians can be found here as well, such as the American alligator, common and alligator snapping turtles, fence and glass lizards, and salamanders. The forest snake species found include cottonmouth <b>moccasin,</b> <b>copperhead,</b> rough green snake, rat snake, coachwhip, and speckled kingsnake. Manatees are found in estuaries and channels throughout the state. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many tropical fish species.|$|R
