Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic.

The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.|$|E
500|$|During the Paris cholera {{outbreak}} of 1832, {{large quantities of}} so-called <b>chloride</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and by doing so, effectively deodorised the Latin Quarter of Paris. These [...] "putrid miasmas" [...] were thought by many to cause the spread of [...] "contagion" [...] and [...] "infection" [...] – both words used before the germ theory of infection. <b>Chloride</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> was used for destroying odors and [...] "putrid matter". One source claims <b>chloride</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> was used by Dr. John Snow to disinfect water from the cholera-contaminated well that was feeding the Broad Street pump in 1854 London, though three other reputable sources that describe that famous cholera epidemic do not mention the incident.

Transmission of health care associated pathogens generally occurs via the contaminated hands of health care workers. Hand hygiene has long been {{considered one of the most}} important infection control measures to prevent health care-associated infections. For generations, hand washing with soap and water has been considered a measure of personal hygiene. As early as 1822, a French pharmacist demonstrated that solutions containing <b>chlorides</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> or soda could eradicate the foul odor associated with human corpses and that such solutions could be used as disinfectants and antiseptics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of data regarding hand washing and hand antisepsis in healthcare settings. In addition, it provides specific recommendations to uphold improved hand-hygiene practices and reduce transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to patients and personnel in healthcare settings. This article also makes recommendations and suggests the significance of hand health hygiene in infection control...|$|R
