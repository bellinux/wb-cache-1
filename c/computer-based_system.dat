[...] His T-shirts {{featuring}} the derisive term were quoted in a New York Times article. Murders had indeed peaked that year and the department sent three officers to New York City to study the Fixing Broken Windows crime-prevention program implemented by then Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Chief William Bratton. The officers returned to implement a new policing strategy, the Computer Optimized DEployment - Focus On Results (CODEFOR). A <b>computer-based</b> <b>system,</b> the strategy involves every unit of the MPD from patrol to special units to identify and concentrate policing on hot spots of crime. As technology has improved, the department continued to collect and increase reliance on statistical and data-based information.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} the belief <b>system</b> underlying <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development, {{by reference to}} an analogy with a model of scientific research due to Kuhn. Kuhn's model describes 'scientific communities', each united by an underlying many-faceted belief system, the 'disciplinary matrix', which forms a constellation of commitments shared {{by the members of}} these communities. A scientific community is compared here with the community of <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> developers and its sub-groups. The division of the developers of <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development methods and tools into schools based on paradigmatic differences is paralleled with Kuhn's view of a scientific discipline at the early, pre-science, stage. The use of a <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development method in practice, and informal <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development activities, are paralleled with Kuhnian normal science, working within the paradigm of the discipline and of the techniques employed. This parallel provides a framework for structuring the explicit and implicit assumptions and models which form the craft knowledge underlying <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development theory and practice. Following a search for elements of the disciplinary matrix in the theory of <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development, as described in textbooks, and in its practice through interviews with developers, the results of action research and reports of systems development failures, it is concluded that the analogy with Kuhn's view of scientific activity is justifiable, and that articulation and examination of the implications of the analogy can reveal useful information to assist in describing and improving <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development. The results of this search are presented in terms of the specific beliefs and models identified. It is suggested that, as future research, the Kuhn-based model of <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> development should be extended into a detailed investigation into the effects of individual elements of the disciplinary matrix, either individually or in combination, on the mind set of the <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> developer...|$|R

We measure the integrity preservation ability of the system by measuring the change of structural integrity of the graph representing the system while it is exposed to random node removal according to the assumed fault distribution. We show how to use such measures to measure the integrity reservation of <b>computer-based</b> <b>systems</b> and in this way indirectly their fault tolerance. We discuss the application of the proposed method {{in the context of a}} real world example, the Linux operating system.
