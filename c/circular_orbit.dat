40|$|We {{compute the}} proper time Lyapunov {{exponent}} for charged Myers Perry black hole spacetime and investigate the instability of the equatorial circular geodesics (both timelike and null) via this exponent. We also show that {{for more than four}} spacetime dimensions (N ≥ 3), there are no Innermost Stable <b>Circular</b> <b>Orbits</b> (ISCOs) in charged Myers Perry black hole spacetime. We further show that among all possible <b>circular</b> <b>orbits,</b> timelike <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> have longer orbital periods than null <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> (photon spheres) as measured by asymptotic observers. Thus, timelike <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> provide the slowest way to orbit around the charged Myers Perry black hole.

40|$|We study {{motion of}} charged {{particles}} {{in the field of}} a rotating black hole immersed into an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, focusing on the epicyclic quasi-circular orbits near the equatorial plane. Separating the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> into four qualitatively different classes according to the sign of the canonical angular momentum of the motion and the orientation of the Lorentz force, we analyse the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> using the so called force formalism. We find the analytical solutions for the radial profiles of velocity, specific angular momentum and specific energy of the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> in dependence on the black hole dimensionless spin and the magnetic field strength. The innermost stable <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> are determined for all four classes of the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits.</b> The stable <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> with outward oriented Lorentz force can extend to radii lower than the radius of the corresponding photon circular geodesic. We calculate the frequencies of the harmonic oscillatory motion of the charged {{particles in the}} radial and vertical directions related to the equatorial <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> and study the radial profiles of the radial, ω_, vertical, ω_, and orbital, ω_, frequencies, finding significant differences in comparison to the epicyclic geodesic circular motion. The most important new phenomenon is existence of toroidal charged particle epicyclic motion with ω_∼ω_ >> ω_ that could occur around retrograde <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> with outward oriented Lorentz force. We demonstrate that for the rapidly rotating black holes the role of the 'Wald induced charge' can be relevant. Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula.

5|$|Isaac Newton derived this theorem in Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, first {{published}} in 1687. In Proposition 43, he showed that the added force must be a central force, one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance r between the particle and a point fixed in space (the center). In Proposition 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing {{that it was an}} inverse-cube force, one that varies as the inverse cube of r. In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that the particle moved in nearly <b>circular</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E

5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared {{light from the}} planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The <b>circular</b> <b>orbit</b> of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148.

5|$|There is one known {{planet in}} the orbit of WASP-44: WASP-44b. The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass of 0.889 Jupiters. Its radius is 1.14 times that of Jupiter.

With an orbital inclination of 86.02º, WASP-44b has an orbit that exists almost edge-on to its host star with respect to Earth. WASPA-44b's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.036, indicating a mostly <b>circular</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E

5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant <b>circular</b> <b>orbit</b> into an {{eccentric}} orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and swollen, moving off the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight <b>circular</b> <b>orbit</b> some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from the center of the planet's <b>circular</b> <b>orbit</b> about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E

In accordance with the data, HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, {{but it has not}} been directly observed long enough to know definitively.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine would generate a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's semi-major axis, with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a <b>circular</b> <b>orbit</b> at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, and left a significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass planetesimal disk remaining in what they called the Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E
