5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} single-party socialist federal {{unit of the}} SFR Yugoslavia, ruled by the Communists, but enjoying a degree of {{autonomy}} within the federation. In 1967, Croatian authors and linguists published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language demanding greater autonomy for Croatian language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring, and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E

5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E

5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} other parties abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, American Foreign Service officer Warren M. Robbins {{collected}} African figures, masks, books, {{and textiles}} from German antique shops. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., in 1960, he purchased {{a house on}} Capitol Hill and opened his collection for viewing. Robbins, without museum, arts, or fundraising experience, believed that the collection could advance interracial <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> improve national respect for {{a major component of}} black cultural heritage. Starting in 1963, he expanded his Capitol Hill house museum into adjacent townhouses, including the former house of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The collections eventually occupied nine townhouses and over a dozen other properties near the Supreme Court Building.|$|E
5|$|Rebellion {{broke out}} in late June 1848, after Frățias members came to adopt a single project {{regarding}} the promise of land reform. This resolution, which had initially caused dissension, was passed into the revolutionary program upon pressures from Nicolae Bălcescu and his supporters. The document itself, destined to {{be read as a}} proclamation, was most likely drafted by Heliade Rădulescu, and Bălcescu himself was possibly responsible for most of its ideas. It called for, among other issues, national independence, <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, responsible government, a five-year term of office for Princes and their election by the Assembly, freedom of the press, and decentralization.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler won {{the special}} federal {{election}} of 1932.

After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> within weeks the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau opened. The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power; subsequently, his government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations following a national referendum, and began military rearmament.|$|E

5|$|The Redskins {{controversy}} began receiving {{more attention}} in 2013, {{starting with a}} symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A broader range of persons spoke in favor of change or open discussion, including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. Statements {{in support of a}} name change by <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades.|$|E
5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
