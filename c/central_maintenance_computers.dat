40|$|A systems view is {{necessary}} to detect, diagnose, predict, and mitigate adverse events during the flight of an aircraft. While most aircraft subsystems look for simple threshold exceedances and report them to a <b>central</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>computer,</b> the vehicle integrated prognostic reasoner (VIPR) proactively generates evidence and takes {{an active role in}} aircraft-level health assessment.

25|$|The 747-400's {{glass cockpit}} {{features}} CRT displays which show flight instrumentation along with engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) diagnostics. The flight engineer station on previous 747s {{is no longer}} installed, and the new displays and simplified layout results in a two-thirds reduction of switches, lights, and gauges versus the Classic 747. Other new systems include an advanced Honeywell flight management computer (FMC) which assists pilots in calculating optimal altitudes and routes along with a Rockwell-Collins <b>central</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>computer</b> (CMC) which automates troubleshooting tasks.|$|R

Starting with detection and tracking of damage using active interrogation by elastic waves, {{we discuss the}} damage estimation in an SHM system as a Member System within Honeywell’s <b>Central</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Computer</b> (CMC) IVHM. The additional SHM data integration described includes: spatio-temporal filtering, damage reporting, and generation of the BIT fault reports in the CMC Member System format.

40|$|Honeywell's <b>Central</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Computer</b> Function (CMCF) and Aircraft Condition Monitoring Function (ACMF) {{represent}} the state-of-the art in integrated vehicle health management (IVHM). Underlying these technologies is a fault propagation modeling system that provides nose-to-tail coverage and root cause diagnostics. The Vehicle Integrated Prognostic Reasoner (VIPR) extends this technology to interpret evidence generated by advanced diagnostic and prognostic monitors provided by component suppliers to detect, isolate, and predict adverse events that affect flight safety. This report describes year one work that included defining the architecture and communication protocols and establishing the user requirements {{for such a}} system. Based on these {{and a set of}} ConOps scenarios, we designed and implemented a demonstration of communication pathways and associated three-tiered health management architecture. A series of scripted scenarios showed how VIPR would detect adverse events before they escalate as safety incidents through a combination of advanced reasoning and additional aircraft data collected from an aircraft condition monitoring system. Demonstrating VIPR capability for cases recorded in the ASIAS database and cross linking them with historical aircraft data is planned for year two...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnalytic redundancy-based fault {{diagnosis}} technique (ARFDT) {{is applied to}} onboard maintenance system (OMS). The principle of the proposed ARFDT scheme is to design a redundancy configuration using ARFDT to enhance the functions of redundancy management and built in test equipment (BITE) monitor. Redundancy configuration for dual-redundancy and analytic redundancy is proposed, in which, the {{fault diagnosis}} includes detection and isolation. In {{order to keep the}} balance between rapid diagnosis and binary hypothesis, a filter together with an elapsed time limit is designed for sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) in the process of isolation. Diagnosis results would be submitted to <b>central</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>computer</b> (CMC) together with BITE information. Moreover, by adopting reconstruction, the designed method not only provides analytic redundancy to help redundancy management, but also compensates the output when both of the sensors of the same type are faulty. Our scheme is applied to an aircraft's sensors in a simulation experiment, and the results show that the proposed filter SPRT (FSPRT) saves at least 50 % of isolation time than Wald SPRT (WSPRT). Also, effectiveness, practicability and rapidity of the proposed scheme can be successfully achieved in OMS...|$|R

2500|$|The MTA has {{two major}} [...] "central {{maintenance}} facilities" [...] (CMFs) that serve the New York City area. The Grand Avenue <b>Central</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Facility [...] is {{adjacent to the}} Grand Avenue Depot in Maspeth, Queens, and the Zerega Avenue <b>Central</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Facility is located at 750 Zerega Avenue in the Bronx. Both maintenance facilities {{are responsible for the}} major reconstruction of buses in need of repair including engine rebuilding, transmission shops, and shops for body components on New York City Transit Authority's bus fleet, as well as repainting of buses. The facilities also include several employee workshops for surface transportation training and institutional instruction. In addition, Zerega Avenue CMF is responsible for registry of new buses in the fleet. The two facilities were conceived as part of the 1995-1999 and 2000-2004 MTA Capital Programs. The Zerega Avenue facility was opened in 2001, while the Grand Avenue facility was opened in 2007 along with the bus depot.
