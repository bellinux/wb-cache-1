5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} <b>case</b> <b>should</b> have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's <b>case</b> <b>should</b> not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
5|$|A long-running {{dispute between}} the Archbishops of Canterbury and York flared up under Anselm's successor, Ralph d'Escures. Canterbury, {{traditionally}} the senior of the two establishments, had long argued that the Archbishop of York should formally promise to obey their Archbishop, but York argued that the two episcopates were independent within the English Church and that no such promise was necessary. Henry supported the primacy of Canterbury, to ensure that England remained under a single ecclesiastical administration, but the Pope preferred the case of York. The matter was complicated by Henry's personal friendship with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, and the King's desire that the <b>case</b> <b>should</b> not {{end up in a}} papal court, beyond royal control. Henry badly needed the support of the Papacy in his struggle with Louis of France, however, and therefore allowed Thurstan to attend the Council of Rheims in 1119, where Thurstan was then consecrated by the Pope with no mention of any duty towards Canterbury. Henry believed that this went against assurances Thurstan had previously made and exiled him from England until the King and Archbishop came to a negotiated solution the following year.|$|E
30|$|The testing {{plan should}} define scope, testing {{procedure}} and its acceptance criteria. The process and testing <b>cases</b> <b>should</b> have personnel, {{hardware and software}} specification, test data source and schedule. Furthermore, the attributes for testing <b>cases</b> <b>should</b> have id, name, testing target, relevance with other functions, priority, and testing scenario, expected results.

5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a victim in this <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E
25|$|Sir John Fortescue was of {{the opinion}} that anyone who came forward to {{volunteer}} to give testimony in a <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be tried for maintenance, since he should have waited to be issued a writ of subpoena.|$|E
25|$|Stevens {{did not go}} so far as {{to suggest}} that the death penalty was {{inherently}} inappropriate under these circumstances but stated that the <b>case</b> <b>should</b> have been remanded to the Court of Appeals for a determination of the validity of the Baldus study.|$|E

25|$|Justice Stewart wrote a {{dissenting opinion}} {{that said that}} the <b>case</b> <b>should</b> not have been heard by the Supreme Court because the case was moot, as Powell had already been seated in the 91st Congress {{by the time the}} case was appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} motions {{filed in}} October 2006, {{argued that the}} <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be dismissed because the government took too much time between arresting Padilla and charging him. In essence, the argument was that for constitutional speedy trial purposes, the arrest took place prior to his detention as an enemy combatant and not when he was transferred to civilian custody.|$|E
25|$|Justice Robert H. Jackson, dissenting, {{would have}} gone even farther, {{suggesting}} that the entire <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be dismissed for coming too close to being {{an investigation into the}} truth of a religious conviction. He would have held unconstitutional a jury determination of whether the defendants' religious beliefs were sincere, as well as whether they were true.|$|E

25|$|The Solon {{case was}} {{initially}} {{referred to the}} Palmer Inquiry, which {{was set up to}} inquire into the unlawful detention of Cornelia Rau in an immigration facility. Senator Vanstone decided that the <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be inquired into separately, and instructed the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, to hold an investigation. The Ombudsman appointed Neil Comrie, former Commissioner of the Victoria Police, to conduct the investigation.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Campbell {{was granted}} {{leave to appeal}} against his {{conviction}} {{on the grounds that}} evidence of his obsession with Jones, and of his interest in schoolgirls, should have been excluded at his trial and on the further grounds that one of the jurors, the next-door neighbour of a police officer involved in the <b>case,</b> <b>should</b> have been discharged. The appeal was dismissed in 2005 by the Court of Appeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{final two}} points that the Court {{addressed}} were that of court composition {{and the ability}} for the case to be heard on its merits. Specifically, the Court decided on whether the district court hearing this <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be composed of three judges or just one, whether a decision of such court could be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, and if, in fact, the district court could hear and decide on the case based on issues of merit rather than issues of standing.|$|E

25|$|Captain Winter {{and first}} officer Luppis survived and were placed {{under house arrest}} in Pula. Both of them were {{eventually}} found responsible for the disaster in a trial before Admiralty court. Nevertheless, {{it is known that}} both of them worked in the 1920s as skippers for the Lloyd Adriatico, during which time they also commanded transatlantic liners. Details from their trial and the verdict are unknown because the events were under war censorship, but also because it was believed that everything about the <b>case</b> <b>should</b> stay hidden from general public for morale reasons.|$|E

25|$|While the {{majority}} of legal texts were written before the 9th century, a few were written later. The Middle Irish text, The Distribution of Cró and Dibad deals with extracting fines from a killer and dividing a dead man's property. Additionally, the legal text Cóic Conara Fugill(the Five Paths of Judgment) was originally written during the earliest period but received a number of subsequent recensions afterward. The text deals with how a court <b>case</b> <b>should</b> proceed based on {{the substance of the}} intended argument. It is not clear, however, what distinctions are made in this text.|$|E

25|$|He {{pleaded guilty}} to seven charges of {{attempted}} murder. The prosecution intended to accept Sutcliffe's plea after four psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia but the trial judge, Mr Justice Boreham, demanded an unusually detailed explanation of the prosecution reasoning. After a two-hour representation by the Attorney-General Sir Michael Havers, a 90-minute lunch break and another 40minutes of legal discussion, the judge rejected the diminished responsibility plea and the expert testimonies of the psychiatrists, insisting that the <b>case</b> <b>should</b> {{be dealt with by}} a jury. The trial proper was set to commence on 5 May 1981.|$|E
25|$|Rather, Frankfurter said, the {{constitutional}} and the interpretative issues were ripe for review. Frankfurter {{pointed out that}} during oral argument before the Supreme Court, the federal government claimed that the district court had misread and misinterpreted its claims. The district court, Frankfurter said, had three times argued {{that the government had}} admitted that Section 304 abridged rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. However, that was not the admission of the government, federal attorneys said. If the court had misinterpreted the government's position, Frankfurter concluded, the <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be remanded for further proceedings rather than adjudicated. However, since a majority has seen fit to grant certiorari, Frankfurter reluctantly agreed to concur in the majority opinion.|$|E
25|$|About 100million {{bacteria}} must typically be ingested {{to cause}} cholera {{in a normal}} healthy adult. This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors). Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having {{the highest rates of}} infection. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or children who are malnourished, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected. Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's <b>case</b> <b>should</b> be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.|$|E
