In tabulating machines, for example, pressing the operate key would trip a single revolution <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> process the most recently entered number. [...] In typesetting machines, pressing any key selected a particular character and also engaged a single rotation <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> cycle the mechanism to typeset that character. [...] Similarly, in teleprinters, the receipt of each character tripped a single-revolution <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> operate one cycle of the print mechanism.|$|R

50|$|Slipping the <b>clutch</b> (sometimes {{referred}} <b>to</b> as feathering the clutch) is a {{term used}} by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> achieve some movement of the car. It's called slipping because the clutch plate will slip against the flywheel surface when such an action is performed. Slipping the <b>clutch</b> is known <b>to</b> be hard on the <b>clutch</b> surface due <b>to</b> the sliding friction created.|$|R

50|$|The THM400 was {{the first}} three-speed, Simpson-geared {{automatic}} <b>to</b> use overrunning <b>clutches</b> for both first and second gear reaction, a feature that eliminated the need to coordinate the simultaneous release of a band and application of a <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> make the 2-3 gear change. Owing to this feature, {{as well as the}} use of a large, multi-plate <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> provide second gear reaction, the THM400 is able to withstand very high input torque and an enormous number of shifting cycles, as would be encountered in frequent stop-and-go driving. As a result, it has met with considerable success in commercial vehicle applications.|$|R

40|$|Rekluse Motorsports of Boise, ID has {{sponsored}} an MBE senior project to design an interactive display for their aftermarket dirt bike clutches. They {{would like a}} free standing structure that runs off electricity so emissions are not a concern inside at trade shows. The purpose is to the show the expansion and engagement of the <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> display the unique features. The user {{should be able to}} experience what sets a Rekluse clutch apart from other aftermarket <b>clutches.</b> <b>To</b> meet this request, a kiosk style display has been designed and will be built to meet their needs. The display features a CRF 450 dirt bike engine, handle bars with clutch lever, brakes and throttle. The standard clutch cover will be removed and replaced with a clear one so clutch function is visible. The throttle will input to an electric motor that will spin a crank gear <b>to</b> spin <b>clutch.</b> Once the user provides enough throttle for the <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> engage, a drive wheel on the output shaft will spin to simulate the drive wheel on an actual bike. As a result, the user will experience the same feel of the Rekluse <b>clutch</b> without having <b>to</b> be on a bike to test drive it...|$|R

He made an excuse of getting greenbacks for some English bank-notes, and then he said casually that he {{supposed}} there would be no chance of having his room on the lower deck changed for something a little less intimate with the sea. The purser was not there to take the humorous view, but he conceived that March wanted something higher up, {{and he was able to}} offer him a room of those on the promenade where he had seen swells going in and out, for six hundred dollars. March did not blench, but said he would get his wife to look at it with him, and then he went out somewhat dizzily to take counsel with himself how he should put the matter to her. She would be sure to ask what the price of the new room would be, and he debated whether to take it and tell her some kindly lie about it, or trust to the bracing effect of the sum named in helping restore the lost balance of her nerves. He was not so rich that he could throw six hundred dollars away, but there might be worse things; and he walked up and down thinking. All at once it flashed upon him that he had better see the doctor, anyway, and find out whether there were not some last hope in medicine before he took the desperate step before him. He turned in half his course, and ran into a lady who had just emerged from the door of the promenade laden with wraps, and who dropped them all and <b>clutched</b> him <b>to</b> save <b>herself</b> from falling.|$|R
50|$|One-way sprag {{clutches}} {{have also}} been used for the same purpose, but are generally not adjustable for disengagement force. Early Honda Shadow models used a design wherein a sprag <b>clutch</b> is connected <b>to</b> just half of the clutch friction plates, allowing the <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> slip during heavy backloading sufficiently to prevent rear-wheel lockup, while still allowing moderate engine compression braking with the remaining friction plates.|$|R

5000|$|Sources {{differ on}} the P.7s engine; it is {{described}} {{both as an}} Isotta-Fraschini Special V6 rated at [...] and as an Isotta-Fraschini AS-5 of [...] The engine was connected both to a two-bladed automatic variable-pitch tractor propeller by a long metal shaft and by another shaft to a smaller marine propeller, {{similar to those used}} on motorboats, mounted beneath the aircraft's tail. To take off, the pilot would start the engine with the flight propeller feathered and the normal carburettor air intake closed and use a <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> engage the tail propeller and get the aircraft moving through the water. The two hydrofoils, mounted beneath the fuselage on struts just forward of the wings similar {{to the way in which}} floats were mounted on floatplanes, would cause the P.7 to rise out of the water almost immediately. After the aircraft had risen on its hydrofoils and the flight propeller had cleared the water, the pilot would open the carburettor air intake, again employing the <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> disengage the marine propeller, and use another <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> engage the flight propeller, which automatically would switch from feathered to flight pitch. Driven by its flight propeller, the aircraft then would engage in a conventional takeoff, riding on its submerged hydrofoils until it reached takeoff speed.|$|R
