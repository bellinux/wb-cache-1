These three programs had made contributions to <b>community</b> <b>health</b> since the mid-1990s, focusing on topics including health care delivery and preventive health systems, careful planning for and measurement of progress toward defined <b>community</b> <b>health</b> goals, and broad community engagement in resolving systemic challenges to <b>community</b> <b>health</b> and social well-being.|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} shift in patient care from the acute hospital setting to the community. Nurses play an essential role {{as part of the}} <b>community</b> <b>health</b> care workforce; however, {{only a limited number of}} baccalaureate nursing students tend to choose a career in <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing after graduation. There is currently a gap in knowledge surrounding nursing students’ perception of a career in <b>Community</b> <b>Health</b> Nursing and the issues influencing their career choice upon graduation. Purpose: To explore issues that influence career choice in <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing from the perspective of baccalaureate nursing students. Research Methodology: The study was guided by a descriptive qualitative research approach. Individual semi-guided interviews and focus groups were conducted with 11 nursing students and a group of key stakeholders to share their thoughts on pursuing a career in <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing and the factors that enabled or hindered their decision making. Thematic analysis of the interview and focus group data generated relevant themes. Findings: Five major themes were revealed from study. These are 1) defining <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing, 2) the clinical practicum experience, 3) stereotypes of <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing, 4) societal trends and expectations, and 5) issues influencing career choice in <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing. Discussion and Implications: The personal and contextual factors influencing the perceptions and attitudes of students towards pursuing <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing were discussed. Existing literature was integrated into the discussion of the many factors that both motivated and hindered baccalaureate nursing students from pursuing <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing. The underrepresentation of new graduates in <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing calls for directed efforts by <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing organizations and the university to improve the situation. Conscientious efforts need to be made to provide students with knowledge and information surrounding the roles of <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nurses and the opportunities for nursing students and nurses in <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing settings. Conclusion: There is a need to increase awareness about <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing in order for nursing students to understand the importance and impact it has on the <b>health</b> status of <b>communities</b> and healthcare delivery infrastructure. Nursing education programs would be an ideal platform for this awareness-raising and facilitate student nurses decision to pursue <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing as a career...|$|R

40|$|Future nursing {{roles in}} the {{community}} will be influenced by current initiatives to achieve Health For All by strengthening <b>community</b> <b>health.</b> During a national consultation process on strengthening <b>community</b> <b>health</b> services, informal workshops involving com-munity members were held in several rural and urban communities in Manitoba (Canada). Data obtained during this process were analysed using the framework of caring communities (First National <b>Community</b> <b>Health</b> Action Conference, Bradford, United Kingdom, 1986). Two major issues with implications for future roles of <b>Community</b> <b>Health</b> Nurses emerged from the data. These were: fi) who will determine the nature of <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing practice? and (ii) to whom will <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nurses be accountable? Implica-tions {{for the practice of}} <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing, the education of <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nurses, and the future direction of {{research in the area of}} <b>community</b> <b>health</b> are identified. The authors conclude that successful resolu-tion of these issues would advance <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nursing's role in strengthening communities. Key words: accountability; <b>community</b> <b>health</b> nurse; programme planning In the years since the publication of Achieving Health for All: A Framework for Health Promo-tion (Epp, 1986), considerable attention has been given to the health challenges, health promotion mechanisms and implementation strategies iden-tified in the framework.

This study explores variations in costing parameters pertinent to deployment of <b>community</b> <b>health</b> volunteers across different contexts outlining considerations for costing program scale-up. Methods The study used quasi experimental study design and employed both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore <b>community</b> <b>health</b> unit implementation activities and costs and compare costs across purposively selected sites that differed socially, economically and ecologically. Data were collected from November 2010 to December 2013 through key informant interviews and focus group discussions. We interviewed 16 key informants (eight District <b>community</b> <b>health</b> strategy focal persons, eight frontline field officers), and eight focus group discussions (four with <b>community</b> <b>health</b> volunteers and four with <b>community</b> <b>health</b> committee) and 560 sets of monthly cost data. Cost data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel. Qualitative data were transcribed and coded using a content analysis framework. Results Four critical elements: attrition rates for <b>community</b> <b>health</b> volunteers, geography and population density, livelihood opportunity costs and benefits, and social opportunity benefits, drove cost variations across the three sites. Attrition rate was highest in peri-urban site where population is highly mobile and lowest in nomadic site. More households were covered by <b>community</b> <b>health</b> workers in the peri-urban area making per capita costs considerably less than in the nomadic settings where long distances had to be covered to reach sparsely distributed households. Livelihood opportunity costs for <b>Community</b> <b>Health</b> Volunteers were highest in nomadic setting, while peri-urban ones reported substantial employability benefits resulting from training. Social opportunity benefits were highest in rural site. Conclusions Results show that costs of implementing <b>community</b> <b>health</b> strategy varied due to different area contextual factors in Kenya. This study identified four critical elements that drive cost variations: attrition rates for <b>community</b> <b>health</b> volunteers, geography and population density, livelihood opportunity costs and benefits, and social opportunity benefits.
