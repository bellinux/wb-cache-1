While most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed it was intended for adult audiences. The company willingly submitted it to a ratings system, and included a password-protected <b>censoring</b> option within the game to tone down the graphic content.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the <b>censoring,</b> director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of {{nothing of the sort}} having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game.|$|E
5|$|The city of Mumbai's police {{commissioner}} called for <b>censoring</b> of the fast-paced rash driving {{scenes in the}} film due to fears that it would inspire Indian youths to ride their motorcycles rashly, resulting {{in an increase in}} the number of road accidents.

Dhoom 2, however, inspired the robbery of a man by his nephew, who wore clothing similar to Hrithik's in the film while committing the crime.|$|E

5|$|The {{frequent}} crashes of {{the retail}} Windows versions infuriated many reviewers; Game Revolution censured Interplay for focusing on <b>censoring</b> the game for marketing purposes instead of testing for and fixing the software bugs before release. Several reviewers could not connect to multiplayer games due to failed connections or bugs. The reviewers who managed to play online, commented the games were fun, although they were occasionally disconnected or lagged. GamesFirst lamented the lack of dedicated low ping servers, and several reviewers declared that the computer versions of the game was flawed for not implementing an in-game save feature.|$|E

Though it had been released years prior to its examination by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures, the film was approved without need any modifications or <b>censoring.</b>|$|E

5|$|A 1983 {{industry}} crash, {{caused by}} the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted {{a higher degree of}} regulation by future console manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently <b>censoring</b> blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.|$|E

The MPs, consisting of one member and one alternate from the Liberal, Conservative and Bloc parties, determines what is relevant to the allegations of abuse. An independent panel of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly, in some cases <b>censoring</b> documents that may threaten national security, international relations, or soldiers in Afghanistan. This panel consists of Frank Iacobucci, fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner. Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the panel to determine whether to allow the MPs to see them.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and {{both positive and negative}} outcomes; while the government no longer played a part in <b>censoring</b> publications, and the monopoly of the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the Company now unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing printing presses, producing cheaper books than the London booksellers. The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly cheaper than those British printers could produce.|$|E

5|$|By 1932, {{there was}} an {{increasing}} movement for government control. By mid-1934 when Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia called for a Catholic boycott of all films, and Raymond Cannon was privately preparing a congressional bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans which would introduce Government oversight, the studios decided they had had enough. They re-organized the enforcement procedures giving Hays and the recently appointed Joseph I. Breen, a devout Roman Catholic, {{head of the new}} Production Code Administration (PCA), greater control over censorship. The studios agreed to disband their appeals committee and to impose a $25,000 fine for producing, distributing, or exhibiting any film without PCA approval. Hays had originally hired Breen, who had worked in public relations, in 1930 to handle Production Code publicity, and the latter was popular among Catholics.* Jeff & Simmmons, pg. 55.* Ross, pg. 270. Joy began working solely for Fox Studios, and Wingate had been bypassed in favor of Breen in December 1933. Hays became a functionary, while Breen handled the business of <b>censoring</b> films.|$|E
5|$|Smyth sent {{an outline}} and rough {{draft of the}} report to Groves for {{approval}} in August 1944, followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters, leaving only the final chapter to be completed. Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts, and made several criticisms. They {{felt that it was}} too technical for general readers, did not mention the names of enough participants, and dwelt too much on the activities at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned, as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches. After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this, Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman. Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides, Paul C. Fine from the University of Texas, and William Shurcliff from Harvard University. They had the dual task of editing and <b>censoring</b> the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} what was then known as Scary Movie went on sale on a Friday in June1995, but {{received}} no bids. By the following Monday, the script had become {{the subject of a}} significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Morgan Creek Productions. Producer Cathy Konrad read the script and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films — then a part of Miramax — were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre. Konrad brought the script to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, he brought it to Weinstein's attention. Studios began {{to drop out of the}} bidding as the price of the script increased, and the final two bidders were Oliver Stone, who was at the time working under Cinergi Pictures, and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films. Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce Scary Movie immediately and without significantly <b>censoring</b> the violence in the script. Craven read the script before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct. However, by the time Craven read the script, it had already been sold.|$|E
