5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|The Sprouses began acting {{at the age}} {{of eight}} months {{following}} a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. The twins first appeared in a commercial for diapers, switching on-screen time every few seconds. As with many twins, the two have often played the same role, due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> filmed in a day. Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed. Beginning at eight months old, the two played a single character, Patrick Kelly, on the ABC series Grace Under Fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E
5|$|The Family Edition, {{like the}} prior version, {{includes}} parental controls {{and the information}} filtering feature. Parental controls come {{with a list of}} objectionable sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated every two weeks by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. <b>Children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A parental controls profile can be set up for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time.|$|E

25|$|Development remains uneven, {{with many}} highly prosperous areas far outpacing deeply impoverished regions where parents have great {{difficulty}} attaining enough income {{to ensure their}} <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sent to school, despite the already-low education fees.

25|$|Within the {{municipality}} {{there are six}} primary schools. There are also two private schools, which conduct classes in English. The British School Bern, for ages 3–12, is in Gümligen. International School of Berne is also in Gümligen. The community also has 4 Kitas (Kindertagesstätte), or preschool daycare centers, where <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> taken care of even before they are of age for regular kindergarten.

25|$|Pain in {{or around}} the hip and/or limp in <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> due to {{a large number of}} conditions. Septic {{arthritis}} (a bacterial infection of the joint) is the most important differential diagnosis, because it can quickly cause irreversible damage to the hip joint. Fever, raised inflammatory markers on blood tests and severe symptoms (inability to bear weight, pronounced muscle guarding) all point to septic arthritis, but a high index of suspicion remains necessary even if these are not present. Osteomyelitis (infection of the bone tissue) can also cause pain and limp.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} this {{experiment}} several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals that young <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, but {{especially}} London, during the 1970s and the 1980s {{the teaching and}} playing of cricket was dying in schools funded by the state, for many complex reasons and by 1990 only 20 {{out of more than}} 800 such schools in London were playing the game. The teaching of cricket has declined throughout England in recent years, but the issue is compounded in London as there are few local teams with their own grounds on which <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> taught. To counter this lack of interest, CKC was set up by two Yorkshiremen William Greaves and Hayden Turner, who have a passion for cricket, and were concerned at its decline.|$|E
25|$|The time {{commitment}} of exclusive breastfeeding {{is also an}} economic constraint. The time required per week to breastfeed rather than bottle-feed or feed solids to <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a significant burden for women without other childcare or who need to spend this time doing paid work. However, some {{evidence suggests that the}} long-term benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the short-term costs. In the United States, workplace policy surrounding breastfeeding and parental leave often does not reflect these benefits. In addition, women are often unable to risk the loss of their jobs or loss of income due to breastfeeding adherence, so bottle-feeding is the best solution for the short-term.|$|E

25|$|Overall, studies {{investigating}} whether cognitive function in already iron-deficient <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> improved with iron supplements have produced mixed results, possibly because deficiency in critical growth periods may cause irreversible damage. However, several studies with better design have shown substantial benefits. One {{way to prevent}} iron deficiency is to give specific supplementation to children, for example as tablets. However, this is costly, distribution mechanisms are often ineffective, and compliance is low. Fortification of staple foods (cereals, flour, sugar, salt) to deliver micronutrients to children {{on a large scale}} is probably the most sustainable and affordable option, even though commitment from governments and the food industry is needed. Developed nations fortify several foods with various micronutrients.|$|E
25|$|The {{pointing}} gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is {{a foundation}} building-block of human communication. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the responses {{to a range of}} pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference in the performance of 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. These findings suggest that dogs demonstrating a similar level of performance as 2-year-old <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.|$|E
25|$|A {{perpetrator}} {{found guilty}} {{by the court}} is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others. The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain {{the origins of the}} abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.|$|E
