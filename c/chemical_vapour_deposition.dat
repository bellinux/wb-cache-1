25|$|Supercritical fluids {{can be used}} {{to deposit}} {{functional}} nanostructured films and nanometer-size particles of metals onto surfaces. The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in <b>chemical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate limited regime, providing stable and uniform interfacial growth. This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under <b>chemical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable interfacial growth features such as dendrites. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than atomic layer deposition, the best other tool for particle coating at this size scale.|$|E
25|$|Some {{grades of}} {{titanium}} based pigments {{as used in}} sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and pearlescent cosmetics are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – {{in order to have}} glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products. In addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers. In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800°C or other industrial deposition methods such as <b>chemical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> on substrates such as mica platelets or even silicon dioxide crystal platelets of no more than 50µm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with <b>chemical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{discovered in}} 1991 and after their developed in various fields, the first theory of boron nitride nanotubes predicted in 1994 and experimentally synthesized by arc-discharge method in 1995. In recent years, most works {{focused on the}} synthesis of boron nitride nanotubes. Boron nitride nanotubes have a structure {{similar to that of}} carbon nanotubes, whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, boron nitride nanotubes are an electrical insulator with a wide band gap of ~ 5. 5 eV (same as in diamond), which is independent of tube chirality and morphology. In this paper, similarities and differences between structural parameters and properties of boron nitride nanotubes with carbon nanotubes are particularly compared and are expected to be as desirable for application as carbon nanotubes. All these properties develop the solid basis for their future technological applications. [5] All well-founded techniques of CNTs growth, such as arc-discharge [6, 7], laser ablation [8, 9], and <b>chemical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>depositions</b> [10] are used to synthesize BNNTs. BNNTs can be produced by ball milling of amorphous boron, mixed with a catalyst: iron powder, under NH 3 atmosphere. Later annealing at ~ 1100 °C in nitrogen flow transforms most of the product into BN. [11, 12] This review gives an introduction to the BNNTs and compares with CNTs, presents the purpose and significance of this direction {{in the light of the}} general nanotube/nano sheet developments.

2500|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>Vapour</b> <b>Deposition</b> (CVD). This {{was a major}} {{development}} area at Fulmer. A wide range of metals and inorganic compounds were deposited. [...] Examples are: tungsten coating of graphite rocket nozzles for ablation resistance, boron nitride crucibles for melting gallium arsenide, alumina coatings on carbon fibres for reinforcement of aluminium, zinc sulphide infra-red radomes for heat-seeking missiles. Fulmer's profound understanding of subhalide disproportionation led its chemists to devise {{a process in which}} halide vapour, pulsed at low partial pressure could be used to put uniform oxidation resistant coatings of aluminium or chromium on gas turbine blades. This was especially difficult because the coated surface had to include the insides of the blades' long narrow cooling passages – [...] 2mm diameter and 180mm long for example. In 1975 Fulmer hosted the fifth International Conference on Chemical Vapor Deposition.|$|E
2500|$|Nanocellulose {{can also}} be used to make aerogels/foams, either {{homogeneously}} or in composite formulations. Nanocellulose-based foams are being studied for packaging applications in order to replace polystyrene-based foams. Svagan et al. showed that nanocellulose has the ability to reinforce starch foams by using a freeze-drying technique. The advantage of using nanocellulose instead of wood-based pulp fibers is that the nanofibrills can reinforce the thin cells in the starch foam. Moreover, it is possible to prepare pure nanocellulose aerogels applying various freeze-drying and super critical [...] drying techniques. Aerogels and foams can be used as porous templates. Tough ultra-high porosity foams prepared from cellulose I nanofibrill suspensions were studied by Sehaqui et al. a wide range of mechanical properties including compression was obtained by controlling density and nanofibrill interaction in the foams. Cellulose nanowhiskers could also be made to gel in water under low power sonication giving rise to aerogels with the highest reported surface area (>600m2/g) and lowest shrinkage during drying (6.5%) of cellulose aerogels. In another study by Aulin et al., the formation of structured porous aerogels of nanocellulose by freeze-drying was demonstrated. The density and surface texture of the aerogels was tuned by selecting the concentration of the nanocellulose dispersions before freeze-drying. <b>Chemical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> of a fluorinated silane was used to uniformly coat the aerogel to tune their wetting properties towards non-polar liquids/oils. The authors demonstrated that it is possible to switch the wettability behaviour of the cellulose surfaces between super-wetting and super-repellent, using different scales of roughness and porosity created by the freeze-drying technique and change of concentration of the nanocellulose dispersion. Structured porous cellulose foams can however also be obtained by utilizing the freeze-drying technique on cellulose generated by Gluconobacter strains of bacteria, which bio-synthesize open porous networks of cellulose fibers with relatively large amounts of nanofibrills dispersed inside. Olsson et al. demonstrated that these networks can be further impregnated with metalhydroxide/oxide precursors, which can readily be transformed into grafted magnetic nanoparticles along the cellulose nanofibers. The magnetic cellulose foam may allow for a number of novel applications of nanocellulose and the first remotely actuated magnetic super sponges absorbing 1gram of water within a 60mg cellulose aerogel foam were reported. Notably, these highly porous foams (>98% air) can be compressed into strong magnetic nanopapers, which may find use as functional membranes in various applications.|$|E

The influence of preparation induced surface micro roughness and un stoichiometric oxides on the resulting the surface charge, energetic distribution Dit E, and density Dit,min of rechargeable states was studied by simultaneous, spec tro scopic ellipsometry SE measurements on polished Si 111 and Si 100 substrates. Based on previous findings and new research, {{a study of}} conventional and newly developed wet chemical oxidation methods was established, correlating the interactions between involved oxidizing and etching solutions and the initial substrate morphology to the final surface conditioning. It is shown, which sequences of wet chemical oxidation and oxide removal, have to be combined {{in order to achieve}} atomically smooth, hydrogen terminated surfaces, as well as ultra thin oxide layers with low densities of rechargeable states on flat, saw damage etched, and textured Si substrates, as commonly applied in silicon device and solar cell manufacturing. These conventional strategies for wet chemical pre treatment are mainly based on concentrated solutions. Therefore, special attention was put on the development of more environmentally acceptable processes, utilizing e. g. hot pure water with low contents of oxygen or hydrochloric acid, and of ozone, working at ambient temperatures. According to our results, these methods could be a high quality and low cost alternative to current approaches with liquid chemicals for the preparation of hydrophobic Si substrate surfaces and ultra thin passivating oxide layers.

Point-of-care (POC) device in biosensor format are recognised {{as a valuable}} tool in diagnostics field. However there are number of limitations such as non-specific binding, sensitivity, cost, and fabrication challenges. Hence, new formats of POC platforms are required to improve overall performance of the devices. The fabrication and evaluation of surfaces including carboxylic acid and amino deposition by both wet chemistry and Plasma Enhanced <b>Chemical</b> <b>Vapour</b> <b>Depositions</b> (PECVD) are discussed in detail in this thesis. The recipes and production methods as well as morphological, structural and functional characterisation of deposited films are investigated using a panel of different techniques. This thesis presents that through appropriate surface treatment, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) can be oxidised using simple methods to form a carboxylic acid surface to enable the covalent attachment of biomolecules for bioassay development. Although spin coating PMMA is a relatively well-known process, to date {{there has been no}} direct comparison of the different oxidation methods to activate the surface, nor has oxidised spin coated PMMA been used as a platform for DNA hybridisation or immunoassays. Here, a comparison of the stability, functionality and fabrication process of spin coating and surface activating a thin film of PMMA on a variety of underlying substrates is described. This research reports on the conditions under which amino-modified ssDNA immobilisation onto carboxylic acid surfaces using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) linkers leads to binding at multiple anchoring sites, i. e. back bone (BB) binding; the effects of such binding on overall hybridisation efficiency are described. An alternative conjugation method, click chemistry (CC), is shown to improve {{the quantity and quality of}} target binding by enabling direct covalent attachment of probe oligonucleotides to the surface without BB binding.

The Co/Al 2 O 3 catalysts showed better activity and selectivity in carbon nanotubes synthesis than Fe/Al 2 O 3 and Fe-Co/Al 2 O 3 catalysts.

The catalysts were characterized by TEM, XRD, and nitrogen adsorption. It was shown that iron and cobalt are in oxide form. Metal-support interactions and metal oxide particle size are influenced by the nature of the precursor and this nature is an important factor for the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Moreover, a correlation has been found between the metal oxide particle sizes, the diameter of the carbon nanotubes, and the catalytic activity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
