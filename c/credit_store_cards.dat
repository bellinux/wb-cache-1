50|$|In a short time, other {{countries}} adopted the EFTPOS technology, but these systems too {{were limited to}} the national borders. Each country adopted various interbank co-operative models. In New Zealand, Bank of New Zealand started issuing EFTPOS debit cards in 1985 with the first merchant terminals being installed in petrol stations. In Australia, in 1984 Westpac {{was the first major}} Australian bank to implement an EFTPOS system, at BP petrol stations. The other major banks implemented EFTPOS systems during 1984, initially with petrol stations. The banks' existing debit and credit cards (but only allowed to access debit accounts) were used in the EFTPOS systems. In 1985, the banks started to link their EFTPOS systems to provide access for all customers across all EFTPOS devices. Cards issued by all banks could then be used at all EFTPOS terminals nationally, but debit cards issued in {{other countries}} could not. Prior to 1986, the Australian banks organized a widespread uniform credit card, called Bankcard, which had been in existence since 1974. There was a dispute between the banks whether Bankcard (or credit cards in general) should be permitted into the proposed EFTPOS system. At that time several banks were actively promoting MasterCard and Visa <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>Store</b> <b>cards</b> and proprietary cards were shut out of the new system.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} attitudes towards everyday tracking and recording technologies (e. g., <b>credit</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>store</b> loyalty <b>cards,</b> <b>store</b> video cameras). This work focuses on both institutional and end-user tracking and recording technologies. In particular, this paper describes (1) an empirical interview and survey study of everyday institutional tracking and recording technologies and (2) an analysis of these empirical data against a framework originally used to describe tension points for end-user tracking and recording technologies. Results from the study demonstrate that people can be highly concerned with information privacy while simultaneously reporting significantly less concern {{regarding the use of}} everyday technologies that have the capabilities to collect, process, and disseminate personal information. The empirical results and theoretical analysis identify and begin to explain this dissonance. Furthermore, we provide extensions to the analytic framework for capture and access technologies to address differences, similarities, and interplay between institutional and end-user tracking and recording technologies. The results of this paper contribute to the fields of personal and ubiquitous computing by providing significant insight relevant to the evaluation, design, deployment, and adoption of new tracking and recording technologies...|$|R

5000|$|Rebecca Bloomwood {{lives in}} a flat in fashionable Fulham, London, that is owned by her best friend Suze's wealthy, aristocratic parents. Becky works as a {{financial}} journalist for the magazine Successful Savings, a job she dislikes. [...] Becky admits to knowing very little about personal finance, and is thousands of pounds in debt due to her uncontrollable spending on designer homeware, clothes and beauty products. The book emphasises that her cycle of debt is not easily broken, as, even as she is thousands of pounds in debt, Becky still receives letters offering her <b>credit</b> and department <b>store</b> <b>cards.</b> She often rationalises her overspending, for instance by referring to items as an 'investment' or necessary.

40|$|Consumer credit {{borrowing}} – using <b>credit</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>store</b> <b>cards</b> {{and personal}} loans – {{is an important}} and routine part of many of our lives. But what happens when these everyday forms of borrowing go ‘bad’, when people start to default on their loans and when they cannot, or will not, repay? It is this poorly understood, controversial, but central part of both the consumer credit industry and the lived experiences of {{an increasing number of}} people that this book explores. Drawing on research from the interior of the debt collections industry, as well as debtors' own accounts and historical research into technologies of lending and collection, it examines precisely how this ever more sophisticated, globally connected market functions. It focuses on the highly intimate techniques used to try and recoup defaulting debts from borrowers, {{as well as on the}} collection industry’s relationship with lenders. Joe Deville follows a journey of default, from debtors’ borrowing practices, to the intrusion of collections technologies into their homes and everyday lives, to the collections organisation, to attempts by debtors to seek outside help. In the process he shows how to understand this particular market, we need to understand the central role played within it by emotion and affect. By opening up for scrutiny an area of the economy which is often hidden from view, this book makes a major contribution both to understanding the relationship between emotion and calculation in markets and the role of consumer credit in our societies and economies. This book will be of interest to students, teachers and researchers in a range of fields, including sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, economics and social psychology...|$|R

5000|$|A {{tape head}} {{is a type}} of {{transducer}} used in tape recorders to convert electrical signals to magnetic fluctuations and vice versa. They {{can also be used to}} read credit/debit/gift cards because the strip of magnetic tape on the back of a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>stores</b> data the same way that other magnetic tapes do. Cassettes, reel-to-reel tapes, 8-tracks, VHS tapes, and even floppy disks and modern hard drive disks all use the same principle of physics to store and read back information. The medium is magnetized in a pattern. It then moves at a constant speed over an electromagnet. Since the moving tape is carrying a changing magnetic field with it, it induces a varying voltage across the head. That voltage can then be amplified and connected to speakers in the case of audio, or measured and sorted into '1's and zeroes in the case of digital data.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Payments through cards {{have become}} very popular in today’s world. All {{businesses}} now have options to receive payments through this instrument, moreover most organizations <b>store</b> <b>card</b> information of its customers {{in some way to}} enable easy payments in future. Credit card data is a very sensitive information and theft of this data is a serious threat to any company. Any organization that <b>stores</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> data needs to achieve payment card industry (PCI) compliance, which is an intricate process where the organization needs to demonstrate that the data it stores is safe. Recently there has been a paradigm shift in treatment of the problem of storage of payment card information. In this new paradigm instead of the real credit card data a token is stored, this process is called “tokenization”. The token resembles the credit/debit card number but is in no way related to it. This solution relieves the merchant from the burden of PCI compliance in several ways. Though tokenization systems are heavily in use, to our knowledge, a formal cryptographic study of this problem has not yet been done. In this paper we initiate a study in this direction. We formally define the syntax of a tokenization system, and several notions of security for such systems. Finally, we provide some constructions of tokenizers and analyze their security in the light of our definitions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Theft of <b>stored</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> {{information}} {{is an increasing}} threat to e-commerce. We propose a dynamic virtual credit card number scheme that reduces {{the damage caused by}} stolen credit card numbers. A user can use an existing credit card account to generate multiple virtual credit card numbers that are either usable for a single transaction or are tied with a particular merchant. We call the scheme dynamic because the virtual credit card numbers can be generated without online contact with the credit card issuers. These numbers can be processed without changing any of the infrastructure currently in place; the only changes will be at the end points, namely, the card users and the card issuers. We analyze the security requirements for dynamic virtual credit card numbers, discuss the design space, propose a scheme using HMAC, and prove its security under the assumption that HMAC is a PRF. Key words: e-commerce, credit card theft...|$|R

30|$|Other {{research}} has shown a link between compulsive buying and credit card use (McElroy et al. 1994; O’Guinn and Faber, 1989; Roberts, 1998). An opportunity exists for retailers who offer <b>store</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> to help compulsive buyers reduce or avoid over-spending. Retailers can help to educate customers {{about the risks of}} compulsive shopping habits through a marketing campaign. For example, a “Shop Responsibly” campaign will raise customers’ awareness of their shopping motivations and their bad shopping habits. Having a campaign like this could also positively affect the company’s image. Customers will see the retailer as a socially responsible firm that puts customers first. This can increase customers’ brand loyalty and brand attachment. For another example, including information about compulsive buying in the envelope containing the monthly billing might reach compulsive buyers at a critical time when they are considering the effects of their buying binges. Information provided could be a website address (e.g., Shulman, 2015) or a telephone number where compulsive buyers can get help for their problem.|$|R
