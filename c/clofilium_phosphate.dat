40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>clofilium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and bretylium tosylate on ventricular defibrillation threshold. Dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to repeated fibrillation-defibrillation episodes. Defibrillation thresholds were determined at 15 -min intervals using underdamped 5 - 6 msec sinusoidal current shocks, from 30 min before drug injection to 120 min after injection. Eight dogs were given <b>clofilium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (0. 34 mg/kg, iv). Another 10 dogs were given bretylium tosylate (10. 0 mg/kg, iv). Both drugs lowered defibrillation threshold from 15 - 90 min after injection. The maximum clofilium effect was a 31 % decrease in threshold current and a 54 % decrease in threshold energy. The greatest decrease in defibrillation threshold produced by bretylium was 16 % for current and 31 % for energy. These drug induced changes in defibrillation threshold are of potential clinical benefit, if they occur in human subjects at doses that are effective for control of ventricular arrhythmias...|$|E
