5000|$|Kyto: A dragon who {{has been}} caged {{for as long as}} anyone can remember. He is very sneaky and once, when Mother Dove's egg broke, he had to make it whole again with a trade of Captain Hook's double <b>cigar</b> <b>holder,</b> the golden hawk's feather, a mermaid's comb, and Rani's wings.|$|E
5000|$|Among his better-known {{routines}} are [...] "Cordeen School," [...] {{about an}} accordion teacher who sells {{a lot of}} accordions, but whose students never seem to learn much, [...] "The Mustang Ranch," [...] about legalized prostitution in Nevada, {{and a number of}} piano-based gags (such as [...] "tuning the piano stool," [...] and using the business-end of a plumber's helper, stuck {{to the side of the}} piano, as a <b>cigar</b> <b>holder).</b> Among his better known jokes is the story of the pig with the wooden leg.|$|E
5000|$|Hook is {{described}} as [...] "cadaverous" [...] and [...] "blackavised", with [...] "eyes which were of {{the blue of the}} forget-me-not" [...] ("save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly") and long dark curls resembling [...] "black candles". In many pantomime performances of Peter Pan, Hook's hair is a wig, and is accompanied by thick bushy eyebrows and moustache. The hook is fixed to his right hand (often changed to the left hand in film adaptations) and is used as a weapon. He is also described as having a [...] "handsome countenance" [...] and an [...] "elegance of ... diction" [...] - [...] "even when he is swearing". Barrie describes [...] "an attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts". Hook's <b>cigar</b> <b>holder</b> enables him to smoke two cigars at once. Barrie also stated in [...] "Captain Hook at Eton" [...] that he was, [...] "in a word, the handsomest man I have ever seen, though, at the same time, perhaps slightly disgusting". Although Hook is callous and bloodthirsty, Barrie makes it clear that these qualities make him a magnificent pirate and [...] "not wholly unheroic".|$|E
50|$|<b>Cigar</b> <b>holders</b> {{are also}} known as cigar stands and are used to keep the cigars out of ashtrays. Also, <b>cigar</b> <b>holders</b> may refer to a tube in which the cigar is held while smoked. These are mostly used by women, and rarely by men.|$|R
5000|$|... {{meerschaum}} pipes: tobacco {{pipes and}} <b>cigar</b> <b>holders</b> with characteristic shapes and highly artistic carving ...|$|R
5000|$|Tobacciana {{associated}} with cigars include cigar tubes, <b>cigar</b> boxes, <b>cigar</b> <b>holders</b> (also known as [...] "cigar mouthpieces"; cf. cigarette <b>holder),</b> <b>cigar</b> cutters (including cigar scissors or shears), cigar cases, and humidors.|$|R
60|$|The Candidate {{introduced}} them all as battle horses, battle axes, battle leaders, standard bearers, flag-holders, and so forth. If he had {{introduced them}} as hat-racks or <b>cigar</b> <b>holders,</b> {{it would have}} been nearer the mark.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than actual}} smoking equipment, many other items are {{associated}} with smoking; cigarette cases, cigar boxes, lighters, matchboxes, cigarette <b>holders,</b> <b>cigar</b> <b>holders,</b> ashtrays, silent butlers, pipe cleaners, tobacco cutters, match stands, pipe tampers, cigarette companions and so on. Some examples of these have become valuable collector items and particularly ornate and antique items can fetch high prices.|$|R
50|$|Lon Chaney, Sr. and Renée Adorée {{were cast}} in the 1927 film. Cheekbones and lips were built up with cotton and collodion, the ends of <b>cigar</b> <b>holders</b> were {{inserted}} into his nostrils, and the long fingernails were constructed from stripes of painted film stock. Chaney used fishskin to fashion an Oriental cast to his eyes and grey crepe hair was used to create the distinctive Fu-Manchu moustache and goatee.|$|R
25|$|Morgan, who had {{attended}} the Titanic's launching in 1911, {{had a personal}} suite aboard the ship with his own private promenade deck and a bath equipped with specially designed <b>cigar</b> <b>holders.</b> He was reportedly booked on the ship's maiden voyage but instead canceled the trip and remained at the French resort of Aix-les-Bains to enjoy his morning massages and sulfur baths. His last-minute cancellation has fueled speculation among conspiracy theorists that he knew her fate.|$|R
50|$|In {{his film}} version, for the hundred-year-old look, Chaney build up his cheekbones and lips with cotton and rigid collodion. His {{nostrils}} were stuffed with cotton and {{the ends of}} <b>cigar</b> <b>holders,</b> and his long fingernails were constructed from strips of painted film stock. Fish skin was used to affect an epicanthal fold to his eyes and grey crepe hair was used to create his mustache and goatee. The make-up procedures took from four to six hours to apply.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{exhibition}} {{features the}} [...] "Beyond Tobacco" [...] exhibit {{which is in}} time with Ayala Corporation’s 180th anniversary. Beyond Tobacco presents the rich economic history of the Philippines and its deep relationship with Spain {{during and after the}} Tobacco Monopoly in the 19th century by its large collection of artifacts, memorabilia, maps, and photographs of the Compañia General de Tobacos de Filipinas (also known as Tabacalera). Artifacts such as tobaccos, <b>cigar</b> <b>holders,</b> and other paraphernalia are shown in the exhibit. Maps of huge tobacco plantations chiefly in Luzon are also displayed, including photos of the factory before and after being bombed during the Japanese occupation. Furthermore, paintings by Fernando Amorsolo and books written by Jaime Gil de Biedma and other biographers are on display. The exhibit was curated by Professor Martin Rodrigo of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (also known as Pompeu Fabra University) in Barcelona, Spain.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} uniforms and guns, when {{entering}} the Franz Joseph Hall visitors immediately notice the 34 uniform presentations of the Imperial and Royal Army painted by Oskar Brüch for the Budapest Millennium Exhibition in 1896. A {{section of the}} hall {{is devoted to the}} 1878 occupation campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the command of Joseph Philippovich von Philippsberg. The central display cabinet in the hall shows the technical innovations of the army prior to 1914, such as the model of a chain-driven combat vehicle (Burstyn tank) that was never actually built, the first powerful machine-gun of the Imperial and Royal Army (Schwarzlose) and the model of a field kitchen. Also on display are examples of the beginnings of military aviation, such as models of the Etrich Taube, the Lohner Pfeilflieger, and the M 1896 k.u.k. military balloon. The highlight of the exhibition is certainly the display cabinet with the personal items of Emperor Franz Joseph. These are the only ones accessible to the public, and they include his campaign and gala surcoats, his medals, <b>cigar</b> <b>holders,</b> and pince-nez. The next items on display here are the magnificent uniforms of the Arcièren Imperial Guards, a strong contrast to the uniforms of the Imperial and Royal Army before the outbreak of World War I on the opposite side. Certainly of particular significance are the personal utensils of the Chief of General Staff of the k.u.k. Army, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf.|$|R
5000|$|On the Carlton DVD {{commentary}} for {{the first}} episode, Gerry Anderson noted that perhaps the programme's most dated aspect was its tobacco and alcohol consumption, although in the 1980 of real-life England and America there was still plenty of smoking indoors and many executives had bars in their offices. Straker has a futuristic home bar in his office, which dispenses whisky, bourbon, vodka, etc., from which Col. Freeman partakes fairly regularly. While he himself does not drink, Straker is regularly seen smoking in SHADO headquarters, his tobacco of choice being either a cigarette or {{what appears to be}} a slim panatela <b>cigar,</b> complete with <b>holder.</b> And despite the high-tech milieu and enclosed environments, smoking is seen throughout the show, as it often was in 1970s British television drama. As a consequence, some of the sequences in the bunker of SHADO HQ are seen through a slight smoky fog. Similarly many of the medical staff smoke whilst on duty, and smoking is even permitted on board the closed environment of the Skydiver, where Capt. Carlin is shown idly flicking through magazines with a cigarette in hand. Most striking of all, Moonbase personnel also light up frequently.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the degree to which}} cigar smokers inhale when they smoke cigars. A second objective was to assess the level of association between self-reported inhalation and ob-servable cigar particle deposition in the lung. We hypothesized that cigar smokers with a history of cigarette smoking would show a greater amount of smoke deposition than would cigar smokers with no history of cigarette smoking. We conjectured that self-reported cigar smoke inhalation would be a reliable predictor of observable smoke particle deposition in the lung. Methods: Twenty-four male cigar smokers were recruited to participate in the study. Twelve of the participants were current or past regular cigarette smokers, and the remaining 12 partic-ipants had no history of cigarette smoking. The volunteers com-pleted an anonymous questionnaire commenting on the fre-quency of their current cigarette and cigar use as well as {{the degree to which they}} inhale when they smoke cigars. Volunteers smoked a <b>cigar</b> through a <b>holder</b> that permitted <b>cigar</b> smoke to mix with a radioaerosol of 99 mTc-labeled sulfur colloid particles. The total radioactivity administered to each volunteer was 100 MBq. Lung ventilation scanning was subsequently performed. Results: Total lung counts showed that volunteers inhaled the cigar smoke to varying degrees, although 100 % of nonsmokers and 58 % of smokers in the study reported that they never or rarely inhaled when they smoked cigars. With respect to total lung counts, smokers as a group inhaled less than their non-smoking counterparts; however, this difference reflected a trend in the data and did not reach statistical significance. Conclu-sion: Contrary to the widely held belief that cigar smokers do not inhale when they smoke cigars, we concluded that cigar smoke is inhaled regardless of self-reported inhalation and smoking history.
