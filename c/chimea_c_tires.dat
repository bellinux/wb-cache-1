The {{test method}} for <b>C</b> 1 <b>tire</b> snow grip {{performance}} based on European ECE R 117 is analyzed; {{the test and}} evaluation process and test ability for <b>C</b> 1 <b>tire</b> snow grip performance has already been established. The feasibility research of the implementation of <b>C</b> 1 <b>tire</b> snow grip performance has been done, which provides the necessary technical reserve for products performance development of domestic tire enterprises, drawing test and evaluation standards, tire performance matching and EU certification. Preface In recent years, china tire has already been accepted because of its high ratio of performance and price. But with the reinforcing deeply about EU tire legislation, China tires into the EU market is facing more and more high threshold. ECE R 117 was issued by ECE in September of 2011 [1], which firstly puts forward the request about the snow grip performance of C 1 and <b>C</b> 2 snow <b>tires.</b> This regulation has also requested that all kinds of C 1 and <b>C</b> 2 snow <b>tires</b> which want to enter EU market must pass the snow grip test of ECE R 117 before printing the “Alpine Symbol ” on the tire side since November 1 st, 2012.

It obviously needs a BI that support organization to declare any production constraints that currently or already occurred in such as tire curing industry. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) {{is used as}} a quantitative productivity measurement and become the base of company continuous improvement and evaluation. The objectives of this study are to identify critical parameters of production line in effectiveness measurement and machine utilization, analyze the requirement of information system as an Android based mobile BI System and to integrate the design into a mobile system. System requirement analyzed each interdependent measure in the real world of complexity by using BPMN 2. 0. These measures are part of dashboard components in the proposed BI. The acquired data from a National forefront tire industry shows the OEE in three ratio measurement of availability, performance, and quality with 78 %, 82. 5 % and 99. 8 % of scorecard respectively. In order to determine the status of production, the deployment of k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) gives 67. 5 % of accuracy rate. The critical parameters identification results to 8 (eight) significant constraints, which calculated using distance-based RELIEF attribute selection.

40|$|Anti-blocking system (ABS) brake {{controllers}} pose unique {{challenges to}} the designer: a) For optimal performance, the controller must operate at an unstable equilibrium point, b) Depending on road conditions, the maximum braking torque may vary over a wide range, <b>c)</b> The <b>tire</b> slippage measurement signal, crucial for controller performance, is both highly uncertain and noisy, d) On rough roads, the tire slip ratio varies widely and rapidly due to tire bouncing, and e) The braking system contains transportation delays which limit the control system bandwidth. A digital controller design was chosen which combines a fuzzy logic element and a decision logic network. The controller identifies the current road condition and generates a command braking pressure signal, based on current and past readings of the slip ratio and brake pressure. The controller detects wheel blockage immediately and avoids excessive slipping. The ABS system performance is examined on a quarter vehicle model with nonlinear elastic suspension. The parallelity of the fuzzy logic evaluation process ensures rapid computation of the controller output signal, requiring less time and fewer computation steps than controllers with adaptive identification. The robustness of the braking system is investigated on rough roads and {{in the presence of}} large measurement noise. This paper describes design criteria, and the decision and rule structure of the control system. The simulation results present the system 2 ̆ 7 s performance on various road types and under rapidly changing road condition...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that, rather than maximizing energy intake subject to constraints, many animals attempt to regulate intake of multiple nutrients independently. In the complex diets of {{animals such as}} herbivores, the consumption of nutritionally imbalanced foods is sometimes inevitable, forcing trade-offs between eating too much of nutrients present in the foods in relative excess against too little of those in deficit. Such situations are not adequately represented in existing formulations of foraging theory. Here we provide the necessary theory to fit this case, using an approach that combines state-space models of nutrition with Tilman's models of resource exploitation (Tilman 1982, Resource Competition and Community Structure, Princeton: Princeton University Press). Our approach was to construct a smooth fitness landscape over nutrient space, centred on a 'target' intake at which no fitness cost is incurred, and {{this leads to a}} natural classification of the simple possible fitness landscapes based on Taylor series approximations of landscape shape. We next examined how needs for multiple nutrients can be assessed experimentally using direct measures of animal performance as the common currency, so that the nutritional strategies of animals can be mapped on to the performance surface, including the position of regulated points of intake and points of nutrient balance when fed suboptimal foods. We surveyed published data and conducted an experiment to map out the performance landscape of a generalist leaf-feeding caterpillar, Spodoptera littoralis.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the mothers lived experience and perception towards 24 -hour Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) during hospitalization of their preterm babies. A qualitative design was used and phenomenological methods used to collect data. Nine in-depth unstructured interviews were with purposely-selected participants. The meaning of their experience was analyzed using Collaizzi’s (1978) steps to phenomenological data analysis. Data analysis revealed major three themes: (a) “it is a bond between me and my child” (b) nurse-parent interaction, and (<b>c)</b> “it is <b>tiring</b> and exhaustive”. However, the study found that all the mothers in spite of exhaustion, reported some high level of satisfaction with KMC because it allowed them to be closer to their babies. hence giving them the opportunity to observe their growth and become fully involved in the care. KMC was additionally noted have provided a comforting and warm environment for the babies, thus enabling them to grow faster and this in turn increased maternal satisfaction. Recommendation was made regarding further research preferably quantitative study to establish relationship between production of breast milk and the use of KMC. The principle of 24 -hour KMC should also be incorporated and emphasized in all levels of educational training as this practice has been found to have numerous benefits both to the mothers and to their preterm babies...|$|R
40|$|Effective Road Profile (ERP) Control is a {{relatively}} new simulator control strategy which shows a great deal of promise in reducing automotive suspension and structural testing times, thus shortening the product development cycle. The key to ERP is a linearly approximated tire model consisting of a characteristic stiffness of the spring elements within the model (K), characteristic damping coefficient of damper elements within the model, (<b>C),</b> and the <b>tire</b> modal mass (MMTM). The tire parameters can be purchased as a data set from MTS Systems Corporation for approximately 6000 US per tire. This thesis offers an alternate method of obtaining the tire characteristics. A rigid two-part frame was installed within the pit of a four-post road test simulator. This frame was assembled around one hydraulic actuator with the test tire secured above the actuator pan. The hydraulic actuator was then used to input a drive file into the tire to produce a tire response file. From that tire response file, radial displacement and radial force are required for tire characterization. The Tire Characterization tool within RPCRTM Pro was used to calculate K, C, and MMTM as defined above. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|Several factors work {{together}} to resist slippage in a layered asphaltic pavement system: mechanical interlock; interfacial adhesion; and tensile, compressive, and shear strength of the uppermost layer. Nevertheless, slippage has been observed on several commerical airfields and even on a few highways, particularly in areas of high shear stress. Generally, the crack is formed by the horizontal displacement of an asphalt concrete surface relative to the adjacent underlying structural layer. A typical slippage crack is crescent sha 2 ed with the arched ends pointed in the direction opposite that of tire motion (Figure i). When a slippage crack of this configuration is observed in a pavement, all of the following have most likely occurred: a. The shear stress produced by the braking tire was {{in excess of the}} shear strength of the interface. b. The tensile strength of the overlay was exceeded, producing a crack behind the braking <b>tire.</b> <b>c.</b> The shear strength of the overlay was exceeded, producing a crack {{along the side of the}} braking tire. d. The compressive strength of the overlay was exceeded, producing a shoved area in front of the braking tire. Increased interest in using fabric membranes in airport overlay applications has raised the question: How does a fabric affect the interfacial shear strength between the old pavement and new overlay? Since interfacial shear strength is one of four possible contributors to slippage, this report discusses this effect for one particular membrane- MirafiB 140 fabric.
