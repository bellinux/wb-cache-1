25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is too stupid to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E
500|$|The Dark Blues {{had turned}} to Ferguson to play for and manage the team because of his {{reputation}} as the most authoritarian captain in the game. He was an honest and upstanding citizen {{in a time when}} not many ballplayers <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> However, he was also a domineering, dictatorial captain with a violent streak. [...] Team discipline did improve in his first season, but his overbearing ways proved divisive, causing the team to bicker amongst themselves. Ferguson's temper would flare up often, even when the team was winning. The Chicago Tribune reported that if anyone on the Hartford nine committed an error, [...] "Ferguson [...] swear until everything looks blue." [...] He was particularly rough on second baseman Jack Burdock, who {{on more than one occasion}} heard his captain publicly threaten [...] "to ram his fist down Burdock's throat." [...] Some players tolerated his behavior; others, however, refused to comply. Shortstop Tom Carey and center fielder Jack Remsen did not hesitate to yell back, while Burdock and pitcher Candy Cummings, on the other hand, often sulked. The situation in Hartford came to a head after a tough loss to the Red Stockings, a game in which Ferguson had committed several errors. Hartford's main pitcher, Tommy Bond, suggested that Ferguson was [...] "crooked". Ferguson denied the charge, and Bond quickly retracted his statement, claiming that he said it in anger. Bond then requested that he be able to leave the team because he could not play for Ferguson, a request that was granted by league president Morgan Bulkeley, a former owner of the Dark Blues.|$|E

40|$|Roman ludi circenses {{are well}} known, {{especially}} chariot-racing, which was extremely popular during the Roman Empire.

2500|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times {{found the}} film [...] "baggy, draggy, oddly timed and strangely off the mark" [...] and that [...] "Mr. Carter {{knows how to}} grab your {{attention}} visually, but the amalgam of trashy thriller clichés that he has compiled with Frank Spotnitz, another series regular, creates its own deadening effect". Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, likewise said, [...] "What plot there is plays like a PG-13 Se7en: body parts, gruesomeness, gloom and doom, but hey, not too much, and don't worry, there's nothing deeply upsetting", and while praising the cinematography, music and Gillian Anderson's performance, believes, [...] "It seems unlikely that this franchise will reach The X-Files X". Jason Anderson of Canada's CBC News called the film [...] "muddled" [...] with a [...] "hurried and half-baked" [...] climax, and said, [...] "Beyond the pleasure of seeing Duchovny and Anderson back in action and back on form," [...] the film [...] "offers little to either the longtime fans or newcomers". Jan Stuart from the Los Angeles Times commented, [...] "The X-Files was a load of malarkey. But it was thoughtful malarkey and compulsively watchable.

We surpass the Germans, who, like ourselves, have as distinctly excelled in the modern novella as they have fallen short in the novel.

40|$|Mithraism {{is one of}} {{the most}} mysterious {{religions}} in the World. In fact, it was a mystery, a cult where initiates were supposed to remain silent about it to the profanes.

We <b>could</b> <b>say</b> almost <b>the</b> <b>same</b> about Arthuriana and some of its most important characters: they are a mystery in History, Folklore and Literature. However, British author Bernard Cornwell has mixed up both mysteries into one in his thrilling and mind-boggling trilogy The Warlord Chronicles, published between 1996 and 1998. This kaleidoscopic trilogy retells Arthur's deeds and mi series from the moment his nephew Mordred is born until his final departure to Camlann, through the eyes of his best friend, Derfel Cadarn, a Mithraist. Derfel shows how Christianity triumphs over the rest of the pagan religions, most of the times with no fair play. The aim of this paper is to show how some of the actions in the trilogy symbolise the death of Paganism, the mystery of Mithras included, and the final triumph of Christianity...|$|R

This research attempted to examine whether the knowledge workers and data workers derive job satisfaction mainly from intrinsic rewards or extrinsic rewards and the relationship between job satisfaction and commitment among the knowledge workers and data workers. To achieve the objectives three hypotheses were developed for testing. The study concluded that knowledge workers derive greater job satisfaction from intrinsic rewards tlxan extrinsic rewards while data workers derive greater job satisfaction from extrinsic rewards than intrinsic rewards the study also concluded that satisfaction followed by intrinsic rewards is more correlated with the level of commitment than job satisfaction followed by extrinsic rewards for knowledge workers category, but <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for data workers category.

40|$|Thomas Hobbes was, rather famously, a nominalist. The core of that nominalism is {{the belief}} that the only {{universal}} things are universal names: there are no universal objects, or universal ideas. Hobbes’s nominalism prompted notable objections from his contemporaries. Leibniz referred to Hobbes as an ultranominalist, someone who went well beyond the position of previous nominalists, and he and other contemporaries objected that Hobbes’s nominalist views would have the consequence that people <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing in different languages. Hobbes’s nominalism is prominent enough that it is regularly mentioned in accounts of his philosophy, but there is relatively little extended discussion of this topic in the secondary literature. 1 However, despite the brevity of Hobbes’s treatments of the issue, and the seeming clarity of his central view that universal names are the only universals, a variety of questions do arise. This paper has three main sections. The first and longest looks at what Hobbes’s views about universal names were, how they evolved over time, and how Hobbes argued for them. The remainder of the paper investigates Hobbes’s view further by looking at two objections to it, one from the seventeenth century and the other from the twentieth. Thus the second section examines a criticism made by several of Hobbes’s contemporaries, that Hobbes’s view could not account for people <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing in different languages. Then the third section looks at a more recently popular criticism of Hobbes, that hi...|$|R

The pro-Israel rally included Hollywood actor and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Councilman Jack Weiss, Congressman Howard Berman (D), County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, Wiesenthal Institute Head Rabbi Marvin Hier, Israeli General Consul Ehud Danoch, candidate for Calif.

[...] The speakers at the rally harshly condemned Hizbullah, Hamas, Iran and Syria, and stressed Israel's right to self-defense.

Certainly one could spot Beethoven's ideas, whirling past like pieces of flotsam on the surging orchestral tide." [...] He continued, [...] "As always, Lindberg's turbo-charged musical machine invited us {{to sit back and}} enjoy the ride, but this time it was just too obvious the machine was running on empty. The sumptuous water-fall of Debussyan harmonies seemed entirely devoid of ideas (apart from Beethoven's, that is). Richard Strauss once said he 'wanted to compose as the cow gives milk'. Lindberg <b>could</b> now <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> except that in his case the milk is curdled." [...] David Nice of The Arts Desk was similarly critical of the piece, remarking: Unless the Beethoven references are plain, it seems like megalomania to advertise your new work as a complement to the Ninth. Other than the final change of direction towards where Beethoven's symphony so radically starts, the only sounds audibly homaged in the Lindberg premiere were those of early 20th century French scores, ravishingly delivered by the London Philharmonic strings in multi-divided chords. Where Boulez moved on from that coloristic starting point, Lindberg seemed mired in anachronism. First trumpeter Paul Beniston's opening top line was brilliant and arresting as usual, and Jurowski kept an immaculately-prepared performance rhythmically taut and instrumentally well balanced. But who Lindberg really is these days, and what if anything he had to say with this insubstantial curtain-raiser, remained open to question.|$|R
