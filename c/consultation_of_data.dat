Results:The initial database has been loaded with two sets of data: a first set of data originating from an Affymetrix-based retinal profiling performed in an RPE 65 knock-out mouse model of Leber's congenital amaurosis. A second set of data generated from a Kinexus microarray experiment done on the retinas from the same mouse model has been added.

Thanks to them, electronic devices are increasingly present in our lives in many forms: Mobile phones, music players and managers have become the essential of modern life. Access to information anywhere at any time is increasingly a daily challenge of embedded system technology. Following an innovative idea, this paper describes an embedded system that can query any database through SMS commands to extend the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to mobile networks early generations. Based on a UNIX embedded system, {{the result of this}} work can serve as a standard consultation of databases through SQL-SMS Gateway which converts an SMS command in an SQL query.

We proposed a HTA approach for considering the introduction of a new vaccine that could potentially have a great impact on the population’s health, using as an example the vaccine against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). This approach could be of great interest when the decision making process involves choices regarding new vaccines. We developed a HTA approach for assessing all of the aspects involved in the introduction of vaccines against HPV in Italy, considering the following issues: - epidemiological evaluation of HPV infection and related pathologies through the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> banks and the scientific literature; - evaluation of health care resources utilisation by people suffering from the infection/ related diseases, through the consultation of hospital archives; - systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials on HPV vaccination effectiveness and safety; - mathematical modelling and economic evaluation of the vaccination using a cost-effectiveness analysis; - evaluation of the impact of vaccination on the Health System [organisational aspects, vaccine surveillance, relationship between different decisional levels (national, regional) ]; - analysis of the ethical, social (acceptability, availability, accessibility, information) and legislative aspects of vaccination. A HTA report on the new vaccine could represent an new important tool to support the choice of decision makers in order to better inform the allocation of economic resources and maximize healthcare services, since it takes into account not only the burden and the epidemiology of the disease, and the economic evaluation of different scenarios, but also the social, legal and bioethical aspects.

General {{practice as}} a complex system: a novel analysis <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>data.</b> Family Practice 2005; Pages 1 – 6 of 6. Background. Complex systems have specific properties of robustness and self organisation which arise from interacting components within the overall system and which govern the system’s behaviour. These are typically associated with a power law distribution of event sizes. Commentators have suggested that health systems are complex, {{but there has been}} limited quantitative investigation of this issue. Objectives. To test the hypothesis that consultation patterns in primary care follow a power law distribution typical of a complex system. Methods. Analysis of 142 050 episodes of non-pathological back pain in routinely collected New Zealand national <b>data.</b> Calculation <b>of</b> the distribution of the duration and number <b>of</b> GP <b>consultations</b> for each illness episode. Secondary analysis of a published UK dataset <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> rates for 44 000 patients in four general practices. Results.

Research into dictionary use should also raise more awareness for user- orientation in general and should provide methodological reflection to enlighten the increasingly important usage statistics for online dictionaries. Another goal should be to look behind the scenes of collaborative dictionaries in order to provide background data to classify their relevance in relation to dictionaries elaborated by lexicographic experts.

40|$|Johan Galtung {{coined the}} concept of «triangle of violence» to explain the {{dynamics}} of the generation of violence in social conflicts. According to this author, violence is like an iceberg in which the visible violence (or direct violence) is only a part of the conflict, with other more invisible types of violence such as structural violence and cultural violence. Understanding violence, in this case against women, means taking into account the three types of violence. Likewise, in the feminist theory, the presence of a specific type of violence to which women are exposed by their gender and which concerns injuries, physical, sexual, psychological or economic distress was made explicit. From this point of view, violence against women is understood as part of a system of domination or, more specifically, as dominance practices established by men. The purpose of the text presented hereafter is to describe and analyze the various types of violence against women in relation with the uneven situation of women in society. The methodology used has required the <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> secondary <b>data</b> obtained from official resources, as well as the development of indicators which show the violence experienced by women {{from the perspective of the}} «triangle <b>of</b> violence», regarding <b>data</b> in relation with direct, structural or cultural violence.

Thus, changing from a traditional non-governmental organisation (NGO) to a social enterprise seems to be the only ‘bail-out’ for NPOs should they wish to sustain and maintain their activities. This study investigated the possibility of utilising change management as a tool for NGOs wishing to transition from traditional to social enterprises. The objective was to assess how change management models initially developed for profit/business organisations, could effectively be applied in NPOs. In order to assess the suitability of these models, the study used two types of research methods. The first was theoretical and took the form of a literature review. The second was empirical and was held in the field (experimental).

40|$|Background: Task {{delegation}} {{is viewed}} as an important policy instrument to counter foreseen future shortages in GP capacity in the Netherlands. Therefore, a national programme to introduce practice nurses in general practice was launched in 1998 by the National Association of General Practice. In 2001 more than one third of general practices in the Netherlands had a practice nurse for on average 8 hours per week per fulltime working GP. Main task of these practice nurses is providing checkups of diabetes patients and COPD patients. Empirical evidence whether the introduction of practice nurses effectively reduced GP workload and therefore contributed to solving future capacity problems fails up to now. Aim: To provide empirical evidence whether the introduction of practice nurses reduced GP’s workload in terms <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>consultations.</b> Methods: <b>Data</b> are analyzed for the period 1999 to 2002 of the National Information Network in General Practice (LINH) a computerized medical record registration network of more than 100 practices. <b>Consultations</b> <b>of</b> GP’s, practice assistants and practice nurses are registered on a continuous basis in this network. Diagnosis is available from 2001 onwards. <b>Consultation</b> frequencies <b>of</b> GP’s, practice assistants and practice nurses are compared one year before and one year after introduction of the practice nurse. Further comparison with practices without practice nurses took place. Results: The number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> <b>of</b> practice nurses is small compared to GP and practice assistant consultations: on average less than 2 %. The <b>consultation</b> rate <b>of</b> general practitioners and practice assistants did not change significantly. Conclusions: The introduction of practice nurses will not deliver a significant solution to future GP capacity problems. Important {{reason for this is}} that the tasks of practice nurses are limited to diabetes and COPD care. Other research shows that this led to gains in quality of care: checkups take place more consistently and patients are informed better.

For example: migraine or severe headache, the chronic condition with the highest prevalence, was observed via self report in 18. 3 of the cases and in 3. 7 percent presented the condition at the GP’s office. Odds ratios for educational level were 1. 4 (p<. 01) and 1. 3 (p<. 01) respectively, indicating that migraine has a higher prevalence in the lowest educational group.
