5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} <b>current</b> <b>system</b> to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC <b>current</b> <b>system</b> that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating <b>current</b> <b>system</b> he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E
5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of a covered platform with no station building, was created for the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the <b>current</b> <b>system</b> where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's a Small World attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actors were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the <b>current</b> <b>system</b> in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter <b>current</b> <b>system,</b> is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|Public Act51 of 1951 amended and {{clarified}} the <b>current</b> <b>system</b> {{of jurisdiction}} over {{roads in the}} state. The existing tri-level system was maintained, splitting road jurisdiction between the state, counties and cities, as well as subdividing each level into several classifications. Further legislation redefined the exact distribution, but Act51 {{set up a system}} to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source, currently the Michigan Transportation Fund. Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased. Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition, they were increased during the following decade to deal with increasing traffic. The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements.|$|E
