The presence of this hunter-gatherer community may have been {{to take advantage of the}} local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons.

40|$|Abstract. Sewage sludge (SS) {{contains}} deleterious constituents that strongly inhibited seed germination. Pretreatment {{methods of}} composting, leaching and <b>carbonizing</b> were thus evaluated {{to alleviate the}} phytotoxicity. All the pretreatments improved germination rate, root length and germination index of radish seeds. The best performances were presented by composting pretreatment and the pretreatment of <b>carbonizing</b> plus leaching. Composting greatly alleviated phytotoxicity of SS and improved seed germination, however, it also showed stunted root length and germination index compared with the soil control. The adverse effects of composted SS on seed germination were completely eliminated by leaching, while <b>carbonizing</b> {{had little effect on}} reversing the stunt. These results indicated that the most effective pretreatment method to alleviate phytotoxicity of SS were composting plus leaching...|$|R
5|$|About 8500 {{different}} marcoremains {{have been}} found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, caudal vertebrae and teeth. The caudal vertebrae have been identified as being from a titanosaur closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation has a good representation of <b>carbonized</b> plants, mostly known from branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty of material, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are known from Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is known from the formation, and is known from a fair amount of elements. Only two theropods have been identified, both Dromaeosauridae indet., one dromaeosaurine and one velociraptorine.|$|E

2500|$|An {{excess of}} {{acetylene}} creates a <b>carbonizing</b> flame. This flame {{is characterized by}} three flame zones; the hot inner cone, a white-hot [...] "acetylene feather", and the blue-colored outer cone. This {{is the type of}} flame observed when oxygen is first added to the burning acetylene. The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being the length of the inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately [...] The reducing flame is typically used for hard facing operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to <b>carbonize</b> it. The <b>carbonizing</b> flame will tend to remove the oxygen from iron oxides which may be present, a fact which has caused the flame to be known as a [...] "reducing flame".|$|R

50|$|The {{manufactured}} bamboo flooring {{commonly found}} in North American markets is very highly processed. A Bamboo flooring is typically made by slicing mature bamboo poles or culms into strips. These culms are crosscut to length and then sliced into strips depending on the width desired. The outer skin and nodes are removed. To remove starch and sugars the strips of bamboo are boiled in a solution of boric acid or lime. The bamboo is then dried and planed. Natural bamboo color is similar to beech wood. If a darker color similar to oak is desired, the bamboo goes through a <b>carbonizing</b> process of steaming under controlled pressure and heat. The <b>carbonizing</b> process can reduce the floor's final hardness significantly compared to non-carbonized bamboo, rendering it softer than some pines and softer than more common red oak.|$|R
