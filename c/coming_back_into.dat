5|$|The damage Vertu {{had taken}} {{early in the}} combat {{rendered}} Lhermitte unable to continue the action, and his ship gradually {{fell out of the}} line to the south. Captain Pierre Julien Tréhouart turned Cybèle away too, using sweeps to reach Vertu and take the ship under tow. With Vertu secured and Arrogant slowly <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> range, Sercey ordered his squadron to turn away to the north at 10:55, the last shots fired at long range from Victorious at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Business in {{the area}} of the road {{increase}} before US 206 widens to four total lanes and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-80 and the southern terminus of Route 183. At this point, the road continues north into Netcong as Route 183 while US 206 heads west along I-80, a six-lane freeway that continues into Mount Olive Township. The freeway continues northwest, running through a small corner of Netcong before <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Mount Olive Township and interchanging with US 46. Immediately after US 46, the highway passes over New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line before turning north and reaching a trumpet interchange where US 206 splits from I-80. Following this split, US 206 is a four-lane freeway that heads northeast, crossing under Waterloo Valley Road and an abandoned railroad line before coming to an interchange with International Drive.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-season break, McManus left City to join Frickley Athletic. Instead, Powell signed Jimmy Gooch from Preston North End as his replacement. Gooch, aged 32, {{was more}} {{experienced}} than Smith and so {{took over as}} first-choice goalkeeper {{at the start of}} the 1953–54 season playing the first 20 games. Smith was called up to the first-team in November for a 1–1 draw with Hartlepools United. He remained in the side and played all but two games for the rest of the season, <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the team for the final league game of the season against Gateshead as City finished fifth. He kept 11 clean sheets, which included equalling a club best five in consecutive matches as City won a record nine straight games, during which they conceded just one goal.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 2008, first City's keeper Donovan Ricketts {{was blocked}} from <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the country {{following}} a Jamaica call-up, before City lost 2–1 at Rochdale, following a late winning goal from Rochdale's Adam Le Fondre. City returned to winnings ways four days later, when Eddie Johnson scored the only {{goal of a}} 1–0 victory over Morecambe. Johnson scored for a second successive game, three days later to secure a 1–1 draw with Barnet in a rearranged game at Valley Parade. A second successive draw on 12 April, this time 2–2 against Brentford, meant that City could no longer reach the play-offs, ensuring that they would again be playing in League Two during 2008–09. A late goal from Joe Colbeck on 19 April prevented a third successive draw and gave City a 2–1 victory over Grimsby Town. Colbeck was named the club's player of the season at the annual award ceremony on 23 April, but was sent off in the club's final home of the season against Milton Keynes Dons. Bradford were already 2–0 behind when Colbeck was dismissed, and despite a goal from Omar Daley, they lost 2–1, which crowned Milton Keynes as the league champions.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the Scottish Disruption in 1843, the {{minister}} led the congregation out of the church to worship in the open, rather than accept the principle of Patronage (whereby a congregation could not choose its own minister, but was forced to accept the patronage of the local Laird). The church went through successive church unions to belong in turn to the Free Church of Scotland, United Free Church before <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Church of Scotland in 1929.|$|E
25|$|A few escaped, {{at least}} for a while.

25|$|The opening {{match was}} between Rey Mysterio and Montel Vontavious Porter for MVP's WWE United States Championship. Mysterio used his quickness and aerial {{techniques}} {{to be on}} the top. Mysterio wrestled a good match by sending MVP who crashed on the arena floor and then he executed a hurricanrana on MVP. Mysterio got into the ring to break the referee's 10 count and MVP also got up at 8 count but he simply walked out instead of <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the ring after he climbed on the ring apron. MVP was counted out and thus he retained the title because a title does not change hands by countout. After the match, Mysterio threw MVP back into the ring and executed the 619 on MVP.|$|E

25|$|In 1780, what is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} the first hat shop in Danbury was established by Zadoc Benedict (although hat making existed in Danbury before the Revolution); it had three employees, and they made 18 hats weekly. By 1800, Danbury was producing 20,000 hats annually, more than any other city in the U.S. Due to the fur felt hat <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> style for men and increasing mechanization in the 1850s, by 1859 hat production in Danbury had risen to 1.5 million annually. By 1887, thirty factories were producing 5 million hats per year. Around this time, fur processing was separated from hat manufacturing when the P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company (1884) on Oil Mill Road and the White Brothers' factory began operation.|$|E
25|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the German forces, the palace {{was used as a}} depot for artworks <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the area. The neighbouring Catherine Palace had been looted and mostly destroyed. For a time it was planned to restore the interiors of the Alexander Palace, but this decision was reversed. As interest in Nicholas II and his family was discouraged by the Soviet regime, so too was interest in the palace that had been their residence. The new plan was to create a museum to Pushkin. With the exception of the heavily damaged Reception and New Study, the private rooms of the imperial family were altered to plain exhibition halls. The museum plan was then shelved, and the palace was handed over to the Soviet Navy. Many of the palace's former collections still existed, but were relocated to other museums such as the Pavlosk Palace. The Alexander Palace was seen as little more than an enhancement to the beautiful Alexander Park.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the final}} two-week {{international}} break, Southampton returned to St Mary's on 30 March to face Chelsea {{for the third}} time in the season, ahead of the visitors' FA Cup replay just two days later. Despite a number of key injuries, including captain Adam Lallana and playmaker Gastón Ramírez, Southampton started the game at a high tempo, with Jay Rodriguez coming close early on after a long run through the Chelsea defence. Rodriguez eventually did open the scoring for the hosts in the 23rd minute, linking up well with Steven Davis to slot calmly past Petr Čech to put the Saints ahead. Ten minutes later John Terry equalised with a header from a corner, although the hope for the visiting side did not last long as a Rickie Lambert free kick on his 500th career league appearance just two minutes later put the home side back in the lead going into half time. Goalkeeper Artur Boruc was taken off at the break and replaced by Kelvin Davis, who later made a number of key saves to deny Chelsea from <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the match. Despite high pressure from the visitors towards the end of the game, Southampton held on and moved up to 12th in the table following Everton's win later in the day.|$|E

50|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} that the competition was not proving popular with spectators, and club directors began to talk of further change. The Scottish Football League itself seemed to have an ambiguous attitude to the competition, failing to have the trophy engraved before the first final. In May 1976, a motion forwarded by Albion Rovers to have a 39-game Division One and Two calendar, effectively ending the Spring Cup, was overwhelmingly <b>backed,</b> <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> force {{for the start of the}} 1976-77 season.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} looking down from his window upon these things, when a band of men with torches, ladders, axes, and many kinds of weapons, poured into the yard, and {{hammering}} at his door, inquired {{if there were any}} prisoner within. He left the window when he saw them <b>coming,</b> and drew <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the remotest corner of the cell; but although he returned them no answer, they had a fancy that some one was inside, for they presently set ladders against it, and began to tear away the bars at the casement; not only that, indeed, but with pickaxes to hew down the very stones in the wall.|$|R
500|$|HMS Warrior is [...] long between perpendiculars and [...] long overall. She has {{a beam of}} [...] and a draught of [...] The ship {{displaces}} [...] and has a tonnage of 6,109 tons burthen.

The ends of the hull are subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads and decks into 92 compartments, and the hull has a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{responded by}} saying: [...] "Everybody has {{the freedom to}} make a judgement. In the last 20 minutes of every game last season, we were never behind. That means we had already done the job before." [...] He insisted the draws did not reflect on his team's {{negative}} tactics, but [...] "because of other teams <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the game". On the issue of Patrick Vieira's anticipated move to Real Madrid, Wenger told reporters the player would remain at Arsenal. Wenger acknowledged his team were short on experience {{as a result of}} selling players and missing Vieira, Sol Campbell and Thierry Henry, who all were injured. He considered this to be a disadvantage, but argued [...] "...the younger ones have to be given a chance. They all have to take some responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Right Here (Departed)" [...] {{was directed by}} Little X and filmed in Los Angeles, California in August 2008. Loosely inspired by the art direction of Francis Lawrence's 2007 science fiction film I Am Legend, it depicts Norwood as an angel, who is crossing over to the intermediate state and <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> her family and friend's lives, comforting them just with her singing.

After a failed attempt at taking the house by force when they are repelled by a crossbow, Norman orders that their existing hole be turned into a tunnel and be extended next door. After buying some more time, Jessie and Willis meanwhile, continue digging. Not long after Lyle and Harry break through in their tunnel but come up instead in Jessie's swimming pool, with the water <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> through <b>into</b> the basement.
