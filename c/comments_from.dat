5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E

However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.|$|E

5|$|Influential {{players and}} journalists belittled the 1894 match {{both before and}} after it took place. Lasker's {{difficulty}} in getting backing may have been caused by hostile pre-match <b>comments</b> <b>from</b> Gunsberg and Leopold Hoffer, who had long been a bitter enemy of Steinitz. One of the complaints was that Lasker had never played the other two members of the top four, Siegbert Tarrasch and Mikhail Chigorin – although Tarrasch had rejected a challenge from Lasker in 1892, publicly telling him to go and win an international tournament first. After the match, some commentators, notably Tarrasch, said Lasker had won mainly because Steinitz was old (58 in 1894).|$|E
