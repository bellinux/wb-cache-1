The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM <b>Customs</b> <b>investigation,</b> a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.|$|E

DHS conducts joint regional training and operational exercises for both Pakistani and Afghan border officials, including international border interdiction training and cross-border financial investigation training.

40|$|AbstractOrganisational {{culture and}} {{leadership}} {{has been of}} interest to scientists as well as managers for several decades. A well-built and managed organisational culture can create a significant competitive advantage for a company. Studying and understanding organisational culture is based on culture science in general and {{it is characterised by}} an inter-disciplinary approach; this brings methods and knowledge together, especially in sociology, psychology, economics and management. Staff leadership is a priority task for all managers in the organisation, no matter what level of hierarchy they operate at. Its performance is linked to both successes and failures of the entire organisation and all of their employees. It is clear that the success of a manager in leading people is judged by work performance and team results, created from their subordinates. Managers must affect them so that the internal processes of the organisation lead to a high level of productivity of the resources used by an organisation, to ensure high quality products and services offered by an organisation and to reduce the costs of the organisation. This requirement can be met by the managers only if they manage to convince all their co-workers to perform work tasks efficiently and highly effective as well as with pleasure. A manager must not only be a good specialist, but must also be a good psychologist, to know the impact of social aspects on the behaviour of the working group, and above all they must have the personal charisma - leadership skills. The best way a manager can lead workers is to effect the behaviour of collaborators by their own example. This article aims to describe the current theoretical basis for the issue of organisational culture and on the basis of <b>custom</b> <b>investigation</b> to seek the answer to the research question of the inter-dependence of organisational culture and leadership...|$|R
