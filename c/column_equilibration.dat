50|$|After the biphasic {{solvent system}} has been chosen a batch of is {{formulated}} and equilibrated in a separatory funnel. This step is called pre-equilibration of the solvent system. The two phases are separated. Then the column is filled with stationary with a pump. Next, the column is set an equilibration conditions, such as the desired rotation speed, and the mobile phase is pumped through the column. The mobile phase displaces the {{a portion of the}} stationary phase until <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> is achieved and the mobile phase elutes from the column. The sample may be introduced into the column {{at any time during the}} <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> step or after equilibration has been accomplished. After the volume of eluant surpasses the volume of the mobile phase in the column, the sample components will begin to elute. Compounds with a partition coefficient of unity will elute when one column volume of mobile phase has passed through the column since the time of injection. The compound can then be introduced to another stationary phase to help increase the resolution of results. The flow is stopped after the target compound(s) are eluted or the column is extruded by pumping the stationary phase through the column. An example of a major application of countercurrent chromatography is to take an extremely complex matrix such as a plant extract, perform the countercurrent chromatography separation with a carefully selected solvent system, and extrude the column to recover all of the sample. The original complex matrix will have been fractionated into discrete narrow polarity bands, which may then be assayed for chemical composition or bioactivity. Performing one or more countercurrent chromatography separations in conjunction with other chromatographic and non chromatographic techniques has the potential for rapid advances in compositional recognition of extremely complex matrices.|$|E

The automated 2 -step (cation exchange and size exclusion) purification protocol for untagged hCypA results in final purity and yields of ⩾ 93 % and ∼ 5 mgL− 1 of original cell culture, respectively, in under 12 h, including all primary sample processing and <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> steps. The novel automated 4 -step (anion exchange, desalt, heparin-affinity and size exclusion, in linear sequence) purification protocol for untagged hPCNA results in final purity and yields of ⩾ 87 % and ∼ 4 mgL− 1 of original cell culture, respectively, in under 24 h, including all primary sample processing and <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> steps. This saves in excess of four full working days when compared to the traditional protocol, producing protein with similar final yield, purity and activity. Furthermore, it limits a time-dependent protein aggregation, a problem with the traditional protocol that results in a loss of final yield. Both automated protocols were developed to use generic commercially available pre-packed columns and automatically prepared minimal buffers, designed to eliminate user and system variations, maximize run reproducibility, standardize yield and purity between batches, increase throughput and reduce user input to a minimum. Both protocols represent robust generic methods for the automated production of untagged hCypA and hPCNA...|$|E
40|$|Intervent {{dilution}} chromatography separates interacting macromolecules by subjecting them to {{a dynamic}} {{environment in which the}} association constant is continuously varied. The dynamic environment is produced by using the sieving properties of a gel to repeatedly propel the molecular complex across an intervent boundary. Behind the boundary, at high intervent concentrations, the complex dissociates; ahead of the boundary, the component molecules are separated by adsorption processes. By selective adjustment of the intervent composition of the sample and the conditions of <b>column</b> <b>equilibration,</b> the process is adapted to a particular need. This report describes the chromatographic concept and shows how parameters are adjusted to obtain the desired separation.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to induce chloride cell (CC) proliferation on the gill lamellae of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and to evaluate the consequences for respiratory function. Chronic elevation of hormone levels was used to induce CC proliferation; fish were injected with a combination of cortisol (8 mg kg � 1 intramuscularly every day for 10 days) and ovine growth hormone (2 mg kg � 1 intraperitoneally every second day for 10 days). The extent of CC proliferation was quantified using scanning electron microscopy and a two-dimensional analysis. An extracorporeal preparation in combination with environmental hypoxia was used to assess the effects of CC proliferation on respiratory function. Arterial blood was routed from the coeliac artery through an external circuit in which pH (pHa), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO∑) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO∑) were monitored continuously. Environmental hypoxia was imposed by gassing a water <b>equilibration</b> <b>column</b> supplying the experimental chamber with N 2.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, high pH anion {{exchange}} chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAED/PAC) has gained increasing acceptance as {{the method of}} choice for analysis of neutral sugars commonly occurring in woods, pulps, and other lignocellulosics. This paper describes modified chromatographic conditions and discusses other critical factors that improve the precision and efficiency of this application. The method involves a controlled loading of acetate onto the <b>column</b> prior to <b>equilibration</b> with water and injection of sample. In-line solid-phase extraction is used to remove hydrophobic substances that {{have the potential to}} foul the analytical column. Critical operational parameters for the successful application of the method include a metal-free flowpath and a consistent application of anions with sample. Resolution of rhamnose is achieved while maintaining the resolution of xylose and mannose. Simplified sample pretreatment allows a ca. five-fold increase in sample through-put compared with gas chromatography of derivatized sugars or to partition chromatography. Run times are less than half those of the widely used hydroxide reverse gradient method for HPAEC/PAD analysis of wood sugars.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Interest in temperature as a modifier in HPLC separations has increased markedly recently due to miniaturisation, new stable hybrid stationary phases {{and the use of}} superheated water as an eluent. However, for decades temperature has generally been regarded as a parameter that should be kept constant in LC separations for retention reproducibility but there is now a mountain of journal papers supporting the use of this variable. Currently, the limit of implementation usually arises from the lack of LC ovens on the market capable of high temperature applications. This {{led to the development of}} a resistively heated LC oven which allowed rapid reproducible heating/cooling patterns of RP <b>columns</b> thus reducing <b>equilibration</b> times and realising high sample throughput. The main objective was to drive temperature programming to a new extreme by rapid column heating akin to GC rather than LC, the emphasis being to produce much sharper peaks very rapidly. It was hoped that temperature gradients could replace solvent gradients and extend the applicability of temperature-programming for hyphenation to other forms of detection. New column materials were sought and tested against high speed temperature gradients. This coupled with micro-column technology should reduce analysis time and appreciably limit the amount of solvent waste currently being generated by conventional LC techniques. The column heating was achieved by two system components, the oven and the eluent pre-heater unit both based on resistive heating. Post-column cooling prior to detection minimised baseline disturbances imposed by a temperature gradient and enabled the use of detection modes such as MS, RI and ELSD as well as UV spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|An extracorporeal {{circulation}} {{in combination with}} a stop–flow technique was used to characterize the acid–base disequilibrium in the arterial blood of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss during environmental hypoxia, hyperoxia or hypercapnia. Arterial blood was routed from the coeliac artery through an external circuit in which pH (pHa), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO•) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO•) were monitored continuously. The stop–flow condition was imposed by turning off the pump which drove the external loop. Water PO • or PCO • was adjusted to give the experimental conditions by bubbling N 2, O 2 or CO 2 through a water <b>equilibration</b> <b>column</b> supplying the fish. During normoxia, the arterial blood exhibited a positive acid–base disequilibrium of approximately 0. 04 pH units; that is, pH increased over the stop–flow period by 0. 04 units. The extent of the imbalance was increased significantly by hypoxia (final PaO•= 2. 7 – 3. 7 kPa; DpH= 0. 05 units). In fish exposed to hyperoxia (final PaO•= 47 – 67 kPa), {{the direction of the}} disequilibrium was reversed; pHa declined by 0. 03 units. During hyperoxia, CO 2 excretion was impaired by 63 % and the PCO • of postbranchial blood was higher than that of prebranchial blood. It is therefore conceivable that a reversal of the normal, outwardly directed, diffusion gradient for CO 2 accounted for the negative disequilibrium; CO 2 uptake at the gills would drive plasma CO 2 /HCO 32 /H+ reactions towards CO 2 hydration and H+ formation. During hypercapnia, fish exhibited a twofold increase in the positive pH disequilibrium (DpH= 0. 06 units). The results of this study confirmed the existence of an acid–base disequilibrium in the arterial blood of rainbow trout and clearly demonstrated that the extent and/or direction of the disequilibrium are influenced by the respiratory status of the fish...|$|R

Our earlier studies demonstrated that HB inhibits nucleotide exchange on β-tubulin, and this, together with the results presented here, indicated the HB site is located on β-tubulin. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we determined complementary conformations of HB and β-tubulin that delineated in atomic detail binding interactions of HB with only β-tubulin, with no involvement of the α-subunit in the binding interaction.

40|$|Background: Paratuberculosis remains today a major global {{problem in}} animal health, {{especially}} for dairy cattle. However, {{the diagnosis of}} its etiologic agent, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), still lacks sensitivity {{because of the lack}} of available antigens. Little is known about the virulence factors for this pathogen. In this study we have developed a method to produce and purify the heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), a major adhesin of Mycobacteria, from a culture of Map. Findings: For this extremely slow-growing Mycobacterium, a culture was established in a 3 -liter bioreactor. Using the bioreactor the amount of the Map biomass was increased 5 -fold compared to a classical culture in flasks. The map-HBHA was purified from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose chromatography on HiTrap columns. Binding of map-HBHA onto heparin-Sepharose can be reduced in the presence of salt. Consequently, all steps of sample preparation and <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> were carried out in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7. 2). The map-HBHA was eluted by a linear NaCl gradient. High resolution mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the native form of map-HBHA has posttranslational modifications, including the removal of the initiation methionine, acetylation of the alanine residue at the N-terminal extremity and the presence of methylated lysines in the C-terminal domain of the protein. Conclusions: An optimized culture of Map in a bioreactor was established to purify the native map-HBHA from...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) column is capable of enrichment/pre-concentration of trace impurities in the mobile phase during the <b>column</b> <b>equilibration,</b> prior to sample injection and elution. These impurities elute during gradient elution and result in significant chromatographic peaks. Three types of purified water were tested for their impurity levels, and hence their performances as mobile phase, in HPLC followed by total ion current (TIC) mode of MS. Two types of HPLC-grade water produced 3 - 4 significant peaks in solvent blanks while LC/MS-grade water produced no peaks (although peaks were produced by LC/MS-grade water also {{after a few days}} of standing). None of the three waters produced peaks in HPLC followed by UV-Vis detection. These peaks, if co-eluted with analyte, are capable of suppressing or enhancing the analyte signal in a MS detector. As it is not common practice to run solvent blanks in TIC mode, when quantification is commonly carried out using single ion monitoring (SIM) or single or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM or MRM), the effect of co-eluting impurities on the analyte signal and hence on the accuracy of the results is often unknown to the analyst. Running solvent blanks in TIC mode, regardless of the MS mode used for quantification, is essential in order to detect this problem and to take subsequent precautions.

30|$|However, it {{had several}} problems, such as {{cross-reactivity}} of metabolites and low precision, {{and so it}} was considered that plasma concentrations of olopatadine measured by RIA needed to be confirmed by an alternative method. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry has been applied for the determination of a number of compounds in biological fluids (Zhu et al. 2011). Other assay methods for olopatadine and its metabolites in human plasma by HPLC with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry were reported (Fujimaki et al. 2006; Fujita et al. 1999). Varghese et al. (2011) have used 0.1 % orthophosphoric acid (pH 4.5) with triethylamine/acetonitrile (75 : 25) for the determination of olopatadine hydrochloride. Triethylamine should be avoided as its addition to the mobile phase requires longer <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> times, which is not advisable for the routine use of the developed method. It occasionally introduces additional problems such as erratic baselines and poor peak shape and complicates the preparation of the mobile phase (Synder et al. 1997). A complicated buffer is a component of the mobile phase for the HPLC method, which includes monobasic potassium phosphate (6.8 g), 1 -pentane sulphonic acid sodium salt monohydrate (1.28 g) and triethylamine (3 mL), and the pH is adjusted to 3.0 with orthophosphoric acid (Rele and Warkar 2011). Thus, both the above methods cannot be useful for routine analysis as tedious mobile phase composition and problem arise from triethylamine.|$|E
40|$|Reversed phase {{gradient}} elution is {{the method of}} choice for pharmaceuticals analysis since it allows reducing the analysis time while improving both {{the quality of the}} separation and the detection limits. The current trends are towards faster separations which can be achieved thanks to equipments withstanding ultra-high pressures and/or high temperatures. Under such conditions, gradient separations can be carried out within a few minutes or even a few tens of seconds. A long equilibration time in addition to the gradient time can be therefore very detrimental. In this work, we investigated {{the extent to which the}} gradient equilibration time can be reduced and which parameters mainly affect the retention variability of ionizable compounds when using volatile buffers. We first found out an excellent repeatability between run-to-run experiments whatever the equilibration time and the operating conditions. We then pointed out the key operating parameters which allow achieving reproducible runs when varying the equilibration time between runs. With a view of reducing the equilibration time, the effects of various conditions were examined. The latter include the type of additive for mobile phase pH adjustment, the initial eluent composition, the type of stationary phase, the temperature and the flow-rate. Although much remains to be understood about the equilibration process, our study allows making progress in the knowledge of this phenomenon. Based on the present results, a beneficial effect of both temperature and flow-rate was highlighted and operating conditions leading to faster <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> are suggested...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain the}} best {{compromise}} between peak capacity and analysis time in one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2 D) liquid chromatography (LC), column technology and operating conditions were optimized. The effects of gradient time, flow rate, column temperature, and column length were investigated in one-dimensional reversed-phase (RP) gradient nano-LC, {{with the aim}} of maximizing the peak per unit time for peptide separations. An off-line two-dimensional LC approach was developed using a micro-fractionation option of the autosampler, which allowed automatic fractionation of peptides after a first-dimension ion-exchange separation and re-injection of the fractions onto a second-dimension RP nano-LC column. Under the applied conditions, which included a preconcentration/desalting time of 5 min, and a <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> time of 12. 5 min, the highest peak capacity per unit time in the 2 D-LC mode was obtained when applying a short (10 min) first-dimension gradient and second-dimension RP gradients of 20 min duration. For separations requiring a maximum peak capacity of 375, one-dimensional LC was found to be superior to the off-line strong cation-exchange/×/RPLC approach in terms of analysis time. Although a peak capacity of 450 could be obtained in one-dimensional LC when applying 120 -min gradients on 500 -mm long columns packed with 3 -μm particles, for separations requiring a peak capacity higher than 375 2 D-LC experiments provide a higher peak capacity per unit time. Finally, the potential of off-line 2 D-LC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection is demonstrated with the analysis of a tryptic digest of a mixture of nine proteins and an Escherichia coli digest...|$|E

The availability of this antigen offers the possibility to study the structure of the protein and to examine its role in pathogenicity, in particular to better understand the specific interactions of Map with the intestinal tissue. The map-HBHA obtained in its native immunogenic form may also be useful to improve the diagnostic test, especially for the development of a new T-cell-based interferon gamma release assays. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nucleation {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{understood}} aspects of crystallogenesis. In the case of macromolecule nucleation, this understanding is further hampered by uncertainty over what precisely is being discussed. We define the process of solute self-association (aggregation, oligomerization, interaction, clustering, etc.) whereby n-mers (n > or = 2) having a crystallographic or nascent crystallographic arrangement leading to the critical nucleus reversibly form in the solution, {{to be part of the}} nucleation process. This reversible self-association process is a fundamental part of the nucleation process, and occurs as a function of the solute concentration. In the case of chicken egg white lysozyme, a considerable body of experimental evidence leads us to the conclusion that it also forms the crystal growth units. Size exclusion chromatography is a simple and direct method for determining the equilibrium constants for the self-association process. A Pharmacia FPLC system was used to provide accurate solution flow rates. The column, injection valve, and sample loop were all mounted within a temperature-controlled chamber. Chromatographically re-purified lysozyme was first dialyzed against the <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> buffer, with injection onto the column after several hours pre-incubation at the running temperature. Preliminary experiments, were carried out using a Toyopearl HW- 50 F column (1 x 50 cm), equilibrated with 0. 1 M sodium acetate, 5 % sodium chloride, pH 4. 6, at 15 C. Protein concentrations from 0. 1 to 4 mg/ml were employed (C(sub sat) = 1. 2 mg/ml). The data from several different protein preparations consistently shows a progressively decreasing elution volume with increasing protein concentration, indicating that reversible self-association is occurring. The dotted line indicates the monomeric lysozyme elution volume. However, lysozyme interacts with the column matrix in these experiments, which complicates data analysis. Accordingly, we are testing silica-based HPLC columns in an effort to eliminate this problem and substantially reduce the column volume and experimental run time. The results and data analysis from these and subsequent experiments will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Un{{targeted}} {{and targeted}} metabolomics approaches are sharing a similar fundamental workflow dividable in: a. extraction (sample preparation), b. separation or not (LC, GC, CE, direct infusion, etc), c. detection (MS and/or NMR), and d. data analysis (chemometrics). Since targeted methods {{are used for}} many decades, their applications in all the above fields are further advanced and the knowledge for method development is well established. The global or holistic or untargeted techniques are rather new, {{and so there are}} still a lot of debates about the experimental design and validation. Actually, researchers develop their methods based in the experiences obtained by the targeted field. Most of the efforts are directed to the detection, mainly due to the late advantages of mass spectrometry; and to the data analysis, because datasets are very attractive for researcher working in high chemometrics, programming, and statistics; while sample preparation should always be the simplest possible. Up to now, the knowledge about separation part (expecially Hilic methods) is poor. In order to develop a holistic method, we took in consideration a targeted one, recently published for the quantitative profiling of 135 grape polar primary metabolites via hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) UPLC-MS/MS (Gika et al 2012 JCA), and we adapted it for untargeted analysis. Since the targeted method was developed for the separation and quantification of a big number of polar metabolites belonging in various groups such as sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, bioamines, amino acids, etc; we decide to maintain the general chromatographic conditions (column, gradient, flow rate, column oven temperature, eluents and salt type and concentration of the eluents). Also the extraction protocol for the holistic analysis of grape polar metabolites was optimized lately (Theodoridis et al. 2012 Metabolomics). The studied parameters in this work, for the further LC part development, without losing any of its original advantages, were: 1. standardization of the eluents preparation, 2. sample dilution, 3. the number of injections needed for a new <b>column</b> <b>equilibration</b> before use, 4. and the number of injections for a good system stability. Most of these parameters are rarely taken in consideration while developing a targeted method, but are crucial for the repeatability, chromatographic alignment and stability of any untargeted method...|$|E

Pro separaci byly použity dvě sériově zapojené monolitní kolony Chromolith Speed ROD RP- 18 e, 50 x 4, 6 mm a Chromolith Performance RP- 18 e, 100 x 3, 0 mm. Ke zlepšení separační účinnosti a odstranění rušivých proteinů séra byla před sériové zapojení kolon přidána předkolona Chromolith Guard RP- 18 e, 10 x 4, 6 mm. Neopterin a tryptofan byly detekovány fluorescenčním detektorem. Pro detekci neopterinu byla použita excitační vlnová délka 353 nm a emisní 438 nm, tryptofan byl detekován při excitační vlnové délce 245 nm a emisní 404 nm. Detekce kreatininu a kynureninu byla prováděna pomocí {{diode array}} detektoru při vlnových délkách 235 nm pro kreatinin a 230 nm pro kynurenin. Mobilní fází byl 15 mmol/l fosfátový pufr o pH 4, 51 s průtokem 1 ml/min v čase 0 - 3 minuty, poté byl průtok skokově zvýšen na 2, 3 ml/min. Celková doba analýzy byla 9, 5 minuty. Nástřik vzorku na kolonu byl 1 µl. Metoda byla vypracována a validována se standardy stanovovaných analytů a pomocí lidského krevního séra.

For separation of analytes two monolithic columns (Chromolith Speed ROD RP- 18 e, 50 x 4. 6 mm and Chromolith Performance RP- 18 e, 100 x 3. 0 mm) were connected together. In front of this connection Chromolith Guard RP- 18 e, 10 x 4. 6 mm disc for better separation and serum proteins elimination was used. Neopterin and tryptophan were monitored using fluorescent detection. Neopterin was monitored at 353 nm excitation and 438 nm emission wavelength, for tryptophan 245 nm excitation and 404 emission wavelength was used. The detection of creatinine and kynurenine was carried out with help of diode array detector at wavelength 235 nm for creatinine and 230 nm for kynurenine. As the mobile phase 15 mmol/l phosphate buffer at pH 4. 51 was used with the flow rate 1 ml/min in time 0 - 3 minutes, then the flow rate was changed to 2. 3 ml/min. The total time of analysis was 9. 5 minutes including the <b>column</b> <b>equilibration.</b> The injection volume of sample was 1 µl.
