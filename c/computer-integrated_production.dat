40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{automated}} control {{systems of the}} <b>computer-integrated</b> <b>production.</b> The purpose of the work: the investigation and search for {{the ways of the}} efficiency increase of the computer-integrated productions functioning due to the improvement of the methods of solving the problems of planning and control with the character of structure of the parameters set {{in the course of the}} multi-level decomposition of these problems. For the first time, it has been proved, that the diagram of break of the ordered parameters set form the distributive grid. The quantitative evaluation of the diagrams of decomposition, and the algorithms of its generation have been developed. The program complex has been developed for solving the problems operative control CIM, allowing to reduce the time of solving or to increase the increase the dimension of the problems, to be solved, by the order. The program complex of solution of the problems of control CIM has been introduced in service. The problems of the production planning and optimization of the operative control, the problem of the debts intertest have been solved.

40|$|This paper investigates {{changes in}} the process control of a vehicle {{assembly}} plant which had been modernized from a principally manual procedure to one that uses programmable automation extensively. Process control {{is defined as the}} information flow and decision-making required to perform basic process operations. We investigate the effects of implementing a <b>computer-integrated</b> <b>production</b> system on the amount and types of process control decision-making and on the distribution of process control decision-making between humans and machines. After automation, the emphasis on decisions regarding product quality specifications increased and the emphasis on decisions related to flexibility in handling a variety of product options decreased. Decisions concerning product quality specifications, as well as timing and synchronization of tasks, were usually performed by automated equipment, while decisions relating to the flexibility of the process remained, to a large extent, under manual control. Whereas humans made nearly 75 % of the decisions required to assemble and weld a vehicle body in the principally manual system, humans made fewer than 10 % of similar decisions in the automated system...|$|E
40|$|Demands made on {{companies}} for quicker, more flexible and more cost-effective order processing {{can be met}} by means of computer-aided work processes which take {{the needs of the}} human being into account and are enhanced by supporting technology and based on concepts for <b>computer-integrated</b> <b>production.</b> These concepts have seldom been implemented so far in companies in the capital goods and mechanical engineering sectors with order-related one-off production. Hence, the aim of this project was to develop ergonomic CIM concepts for one-off production, involving staff from various organisational sectors and levels of hierarchy. For this purpose, employees were trained in problem-solving and mediating techniques. After examining and analysing the status quo, subjects for further processing were defined for which in-house working groups were set up. In these groups, various solutions and ideas for the improvement of order processing were discussed. These include the improvement or development of new work processes, methods of work organisation as well as technical and organisational working aids. For example, concepts for integrating upstream activities into the preliminary sectors were elaborated. The human, technical and economic aspects of the various concepts were evaluated by the working groups by means of a method which was developed and modified {{in the course of the}} project. The problem-solving and evaluation methods tested in the project are suitable for the processing of all kinds of participant and/or group-oriented tasks and were judged favourably by the staff and superiors involved. Other companies with order-related one-off production can also profit from the experiences described in the report. (orig.)

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{power for the}} machine tools was still {{supplied}} by a mechanical belt, which was powered by a central steam engine. In {{the course of the}} 20th century electric motors took over the power supply of the machine tools. In {{the second part of the}} 20th century, automation started with numerical control (NC) automation, and computer numerical control (CNC). Further integration of information technology into machine tools lead to beginning of <b>computer-integrated</b> manufacturing. <b>Production</b> design and production became integrated into CAD/CAM, and production control became integrated in enterprise resource planning.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{one aspect}} of human interaction with computer-integrated systems, that of fault diagnosis or troubleshooting. The complexity (and attendant unreliability) of the new manufacturing systems has meant that fault diagnosis has become an increasing proportion and {{an integral part of}} operators' jobs. Establishing and maintaining high levels of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency is important for a variety of reasons. One is that equipment downtime is expensive, another is that errors of diagnosis might, under some circumstances, be a threat to both safety and quality. As yet there has been little research into human fault diagnosis in CIM. This paper draws on research from other industries, such as power generation and chemical production and explores the application of that work to fault-finding in <b>computer-integrated</b> discrete <b>production</b> systems. The focus is on the factors that influence individual fault-finding behaviors and efficiencies. Where possible, the aim is to identify critical human-machine interaction design principles and to highlight research questions yet to be addressed in contemporary manufacturing environments, with respect to the diagnosis of system failure...|$|R
