5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} {{asked why}} an apparently unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place. According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play</b> by illustrating for the far right that gay people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E
5|$|W. W. Thomas, {{superintendent}} of the Springfield public-school system, believed that home-ownership and citizenship responsibilities {{were a part of}} education and was a key instigator of the project. He involved students in the governmental duties associated with the project, which used the manager-commission form of government to run the lilliputian city. Concepts such as women’s suffrage and political ambition <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play.</b> A 14-year-old orphaned girl was elected Tiny Town's mayor and a 15-year-old boy became its city manager, defeating sixteen other nominees in a political campaign.|$|E
5|$|During its brief history, the AAFC, {{who would}} merge into the NFL for the 1950 season, used an {{identical}} playoff format to the NFL from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 (its last year), the AAFC would merge its two conferences {{when one of}} its teams folded, and use a four-team playoff system. In 1948, the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play</b> when the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record; {{they were in the}} same conference as the 14–0 Cleveland Browns, who would go on to win the Western Conference and then the AAFC's championship game against the 7–7 Buffalo Bills (AAFC).|$|E

5|$|This dual rule {{eventually}} {{failed and}} the two waged a new civil war further diminishing {{what was left of}} Byzantium's integrity in the eyes of her troublesome neighbors. John VI Cantacuzenus emerged triumphant once again and replaced the now exiled John V Palaeologus with his son Matthew Cantacuzenus as junior co-emperor. However, the Turks, under Osman I's son, Orhan I, now <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play</b> by capturing the fort of Kallipolis (Gallipoli) in 1354 and gaining access to the European mainland. The arrival of the seemingly unbeatable Ottoman soldiers surrounding Constantinople caused a panic in Constantinople, capitalized by John V who, {{with the assistance of the}} Genoese, staged a coup and ousted John VI Cantacuzenus in November 1354. As a result, John VI would later become a monk.|$|E
5|$|By July 1941, Morshead {{had become}} {{convinced}} that his troops were becoming tired. Their health was deteriorating and, {{in spite of}} his efforts, their morale and discipline were slipping. He informed Generals Blamey and Auchinleck that they should be relieved. Auchinleck arranged for the 18th Infantry Brigade to be relieved by the Polish Carpathian Brigade so that it could rejoin the 7th Division in August but baulked at relieving the 9th Division. At this point, political considerations <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play.</b> The newly installed government of Prime Minister John Curtin in Australia, on Blamey's advice, took up the matter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who protested that the relief would cause a postponement of Operation Crusader. As it turned out, the operation had to be postponed anyway. In October 1941, Morshead and most of the 9th Division was replaced by the British 6th Division. The 9th Division moved to Syria to serve as an occupation force, as well as resting, re-equipping and training reinforcements.|$|E

25|$|The {{scenario}} {{changed with}} the years.

The Revolutionaries can thus {{be said to have}} come to an end by 1936. The Jugantar officially merged with the Congress on 9 September 1938.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the constitutional basis for establishing an institution for women, several other factors <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play.</b> First, there was an extensive need for qualified public school teachers, a career path assumed to be especially attractive to women. Also, there was overwhelming evidence that {{the public school system}} in North Carolina was among the worst in the nation. For example, the average national expenditure per student enrolled in the public schools was $17.62, but North Carolina spent only $3.36 per student. Similarly, the average national length of the school year was 135 days, but it was only 60 days in North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Order of precedence: {{even without}} showy display, {{a group of}} people walking forward may be said to form a {{procession}} if their order and placement clearly visualize a hierarchy or symbiotic relationship. For instance, one's nearness to the king or others of high rank had important political connotations when the royal family walked to or from chapel services at the palace of Versailles. Similarly, precedence <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play</b> when the grandest Edwardian parties progressed from the sitting room to the dining room, and the stylized movement and hierarchy of marching military units clearly sets up a formal procession.|$|E

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 15th century, several factors <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play</b> that had a major impact on the global wine market. The Venetian traders were losing their supply of sweet wine from the lands of Cyprus, Greece, Romania and Hungary to the {{emerging}} dominance of the Ottoman Empire. War with France had lost the English their access to the wines of Bordeaux. Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on this, the Spanish Duke of Medina Sidonia made several moves to put Sherry into the forefront of the world's wine market. In 1491, the export tax on wine was abolished for both Spanish and foreign vessels coming into Sanlúcar. In 1517, English merchants were given preferential merchant status-including {{the right to bear arms}} in the region.|$|E
25|$|Other mineral {{resources}} that were traded included iron magnetite ore and manganese Jacobsite ore, which <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play</b> {{later in the}} Cucuteni-Trypillia culture's development. These minerals were used to create the black pigment that decorated the beautiful ceramic pottery of this culture, and came from two sources: 1) Iacobeni, Suceava County, Romania for the iron magnetite ore, and 2) Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine for the manganese Jacobsite ore, located in the farthest eastern periphery of the Cucuteni-Trypillia geographical region, along the Dnieper River. However, no traces of the manganese Jacobsite ore {{have been found in}} pigments used on artifacts from the western settlements on {{the opposite end of the}} region. This indicates that, although there was a trade network established, it was still rudimentary.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{off as a}} {{literary}} club in Adelaide, South Australia in 1938, the Jindyworobak movement was supported by many Australian artists, poets, and writers. Many were fascinated by Indigenous Australian culture and the Outback, and desired to improve the white Australian's {{understanding and appreciation of}} them. Other features <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play,</b> among them white Australia's increasing alienation from its European origins; the Depression of the 1930s which recalled the economic troubles {{of the end of the}} 19th century; an increasingly urban or suburban Australian population alienated from the wild Australia of the Outback etc.; the First World War and the coming of World War II and also the coming of early mass market media in the form of the radio, recordings, newspapers and magazines. Sense of place was particularly important to the Jindyworobak movement.|$|E

25|$|By 1939 the TPV {{was deemed}} ready, after 47 {{technically}} different and incrementally improved experimental prototypes {{had been built}} and tested. These prototypes used aluminium and magnesium parts and had water-cooled flat twin engines with front-wheel drive. The seats were hammocks hung from the roof by wires. The suspension system, designed by Alphonse Forceau, used front leading arms and rear trailing arms, connected to eight torsion bars beneath the rear seat: a bar for the front axle, one for the rear axle, an intermediate bar for each side, and an overload bar for each side. The front axle was connected to its torsion bars by cable. The overload bar <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play</b> when the car had three people on board, two {{in the front and}} one in the rear, to support the extra load of a fourth passenger and fifty kilograms of luggage.|$|E
25|$|Opportunities for leisure {{activities}} increased dramatically as real wages {{continued to grow}} and hours of work continued to decline. In urban areas, the nine-hour workday became increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours, encouraging the movement toward an eventual eight-hour workday. Helped by the Bank Holiday Act of 1871, which created a number of fixed holidays, a system of routine annual vacations <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play,</b> starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class. Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays. Middle-class Victorians used the train services to visit the seaside, Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as Worthing, Brighton, Morecambe and Scarborough began turning them into major tourist centres, and people like Thomas Cook saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008, a new {{variable}} <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>play.</b> Previously, {{applicants to}} most colleges {{were required to}} submit all scores, with some colleges that embraced Score Choice retaining the option of allowing their applicants {{not to have to}} submit all scores. However, in 2008, an initiative to make Score Choice universal had begun, with some opposition from colleges desiring to maintain score report practices. While students theoretically now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score one wishes to send) to the college of their choice, some colleges and universities, such as Cornell, ask that students send all test scores. This had led the College Board to display on their web site which colleges agree with or dislike Score Choice, with continued claims that students will still never have scores submitted against their will. Regardless of whether a given college permits applicants to exercise Score Choice options, most colleges do not penalize students who report poor scores along with high ones; many universities, such as Columbia and Cornell, expressly promise to overlook those scores that may be undesirable to the student and/or to focus more on those scores that are most representative of the student's achievement and academic potential. College Board maintains a list of colleges and their respective score choice policies that is recent as of November 2011.|$|E
