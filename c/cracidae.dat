5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in <b>Cracidae)</b> possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
60|$|Gallinaceous {{birds of}} many genera {{likewise}} show an eminent capacity for breeding under captivity. This is particularly {{the case with}} pheasants, yet our English species seldom lays more than ten eggs in confinement; whilst from eighteen to twenty is the usual number in the wild state. (18/48. Mowbray on 'Poultry' 7th edition page 133.) With the Gallinaceae, as with all other orders, there are marked and inexplicable exceptions {{in regard to the}} fertility of certain species and genera under confinement. Although many trials have been made with the common partridge, it has rarely bred, even when reared in large aviaries; and the hen will never hatch her own eggs. (18/49. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen. des Pigeons' etc. 1813 tome 3 pages 288, 382; 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 12 1843 page 453. Other species of partridge have occasionally bred; as the red-legged (P. rubra), when kept in a large court in France (see Journal de Physique' tome 25 page 294), and in the Zoological Gardens in 1856.) The American tribe of Guans or <b>Cracidae</b> are tamed with remarkable ease, but are very shy breeders in this country (18/50. Rev. E.S. Dixon 'The Dovecote' 1851 pages 243-252.); but with care various species were formerly made to breed rather freely in Holland. (18/51. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen. des Pigeons' etc. tome 2 pages 456, 458; tome 3 pages 2, 13, 47.) Birds of this tribe are often kept in a perfectly tamed condition in their native country by the Indians, but they never breed. (18/52. Bates 'The Naturalist on the Amazons' volume 1 page 193; volume 2 page 112.) It might have been expected that grouse from their habits of life would not have bred in captivity, more especially as they are said soon to languish and die. (18/53. Temminck 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' etc. tome 2 page 125. For Tetrao urogallus see L. Lloyd 'Field Sports of North of Europe' volume 1 pages 287, 314; and Bull. de la Soc. d'Acclimat.' tome 7 1860 page 600. For T. scoticus Thompson 'Nat. Hist. of Ireland' volume 2 1850 page 49. For T. cupido 'Boston Journal of Nat. Hist.' volume 3 page 199.) But many cases are recorded of their breeding: the capercailzie (Tetrao urogallus) has bred in the Zoological Gardens; it breeds without much difficulty when confined in Norway, and in Russia five successive generations have been reared: Tetrao tetrix has likewise bred in Norway; T. scoticus in Ireland; T. umbellus at Lord Derby's; and T. cupido in North America.|$|E
5000|$|The family <b>Cracidae</b> was {{introduced}} (as Craxia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.
