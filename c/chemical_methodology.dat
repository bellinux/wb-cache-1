Computationally driven material design has attracted increasing interest to accelerate the search for optimal conjugated photovoltaic materials, and the exploration of <b>chemical</b> <b>methodologies</b> is highly desirable in pushing the efficiency further towards the theoretical limit. Based on the motif of donor–acceptor polymers, over 50 comparable polymers were constructed and investigated, derived from an easily accessible thiophene–quinoxaline alternating polymer donor showing power conversion efficiency up to 7 %. We performed a systematic density functional theory (DFT) study on the heteroatom effects of combining fluorine, nitrogen and chalcogen substitutions onto the donor/acceptor units as well as the effect of extending π-conjugation in the donor moiety, in order to gain insights into how structural modifications to the conjugated backbone can affect the molecular structure and electronic properties of a conjugated polymer. It is found that the trends in the energy levels and band gaps of these polymers correlate well to their structural modifications. Finally, by examining the systematically evaluated data in the energy diagram, we proposed three important ways of energy level modulation, showing potential <b>chemical</b> <b>methodologies</b> that can be applicable to further modify and optimize existing polymer backbones. Especially such energy level modulation can be applied to meet the particular requirements of different device architectures (including tandem and ternary solar cells) on the donor components, such as a prominent photocurrent or photovoltage combined with a high efficiency, to further maximize the overall performance of organic photovoltaics.

" Compound collections based on such new synthetic methods can provide small-molecule probes of proteins and/or pathways whose functions are not fully understood. We describe the identification, characterization, and evolution of two such probes. In one example, a pathway-based screen for DNA damage checkpoint inhibitors identified a compound, MARPIN (ATM and ATR pathway inhibitor) that sensitizes p 53 -deficient cells to DNA-damaging agents. Modification of the small molecule and generation of an immobilized probe were used to selectively bind putative protein target(s) responsible for the observed activity. The second example describes a focused library approach that relied on tandem multicomponent reaction methodologies to afford a series of modulators of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) molecular chaperone. The synthesis of libraries based {{on the structure of}} MAL 3 - 101 generated a collection of chemotypes, each modulating Hsp 70 function, but exhibiting divergent pharmacological activities.

Organic photovoltaics offer such an option to convert solar energy into electricity based on solution-processed, lightweight, large-area, and potentially flexible devices. The current challenges for organic photovoltaics remain to further improve efficiency as well as durability and cost-effectiveness, to compete with traditional silicon-based solar cells.
