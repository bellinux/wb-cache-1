5|$|Grand River Avenue <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east into Livingston County through Fowlerville to Howell. In Howell, Grand River Avenue meets Hartland Road {{which carries}} M-59; the highway also met M-155 in downtown, {{which at the}} time {{provided}} access to the Howell State Hospital. In the approach to Brighton, Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I-96 freeway. US16 merged onto the freeway, and I-96/US16 met the northern end of the US23 freeway. I-96/US16 continued east into Oakland County through Wixom and Novi.|$|E

5|$|MD7 crosses North East Creek {{and enters}} the town of North East, where the highway is known as Cecil Avenue. The highway intersects MD272, which follows a one-way pair, Main Street {{southbound}} and Mauldin Avenue northbound. MD7 leaves the town and passes through a forested area with scattered residences. The route passes through an S-curve during which it <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north side of the}} Amtrak Northeast Corridor. On {{the north side of the}} bridge is a stub of old alignment, MD7H. MD7 continues east, passing Old Elk Neck Road before turning north and reaching its eastern terminus at US40. The roadway continues beyond the intersection as MD279 (Elkton Road).|$|E
5|$|After Crowhurst Bridge, {{which carries}} the Burwash to Stonegate road over the river, the railway <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south bank. By Etchingham railway station, the River Limden joins from the north, the A265 road crosses, and the River Dudwell joins from the southwest. Both the railway {{and the river}} turn to the south to reach Robertsbridge. Another tributary, which flows to the {{northwest}} from near a gypsum mine at Brightling, turns {{to the south and}} runs parallel to the Rother before joining it in Robertsbridge. There is a network of channels, as the River Darwell joins the river, and there was formerly a mill nearby. The mill was called Hodson's Mill, and was part of Mill Farm. It burnt down in 1902, and the Georgian farmhouse was subsequently demolished. The only original farm building still standing is part of an oasthouse, dating from the late eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{second of}} Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is}} nothing more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making his way across the islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E

5|$|Just before Godnow Swing Bridge, the {{northern}} soak drain <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north side of}} the railway. As the canal approaches Ealand there are some large lakes to the north, which are now used for sailing. Crowle Bridge carries the A161 road over the railway and the canal, and Crowle railway station is sandwiched between the canal and the North Soak Drain. A little further east are the remains of Crowle railway bridge. It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the canal, and consisted of four arches built from bricks, with a central swinging section, to allow keels to sail along the canal. The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966, because stators from Keadby Power Station were too heavy to be transported over the A161 road bridge. The stators were carried by road to Ealand, loaded onto the railway, and crossed the bridge to Belton, where they were transferred back to a road vehicle. The process became unnecessary when Lindsey County Council rebuilt the A161 bridge in 1970, and the railway bridge was demolished in 1972.|$|E
5|$|SR57 {{begins at}} the Orange Crush {{interchange}} near downtown Orange, where it meets the northwest–southeast Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the east–west Garden Grove Freeway (SR22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major bottleneck, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{west side of the}} Santa Ana River, continuing north through suburban portions of Anaheim and passing next to Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SR57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SR57 briefly passes through Placentia and Fullerton, providing access to California State University, Fullerton. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) near the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SR57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, right {{on the edge of the}} San Gabriel Valley.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Round held First Division club Cardiff City in snowy {{conditions}} at Ninian Park. Vale won 2–0, and their victory was {{aided by the}} fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with a handshake and a smile. Cardiff placed a £25,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared to pay more than £25,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away.|$|E

5|$|The next lock is Compton Lock, {{the only}} one built on a river section. It is also called Compton Place Lock or Twyford Lock, and the extra flow {{compared}} to other locks may explain the erosion that has taken place, resulting in a circular area of water between {{the upper and lower}} gates. Just above Shawford Bridge, the river and navigation diverged, with Shawford Mill just below the junction. The building still stands. The bridge is a modern construction, and is located at a point where the towpath <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western bank. Just to the south is a weir at the site of Shawford Single Gates, which probably ensured the mill had an adequate head of water. The village of Twyford lies to the east, and the Twyford Drain splits, with the western channel rejoining the river below the mill, and the eastern channel continuing as a relief channel. There are two more locks on the navigation, called Malm Lock and College Mead Lock, before the navigation rejoins the river. By the junction is the intake for Otterbourne Water Treatment Works.|$|E
5|$|If {{not for the}} {{presence}} of Haflinger stallions at a stud farm in Stadl-Paura in Upper Austria after World War I, the Haflinger might well not exist in Austria today. Despite these stallions, the Haflinger breeding programs were not on solid footing in Austria, with governmental focus on other Austrian breeds and private breeding programs not large enough to influence national breeding practices. During this time, the breed was kept alive through <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hucul, Bosnian, Konik and Noriker breeds. In 1919 and 1920, the remaining stallions were assigned throughout Austria, many to areas that had hosted private breeding farms before the war. In 1921, the North Tyrolean Horse Breeders' Cooperative was formed in Zams, and in 1922, the first Haflinger Breeders' Show was held in the same location. Many extant Austrian Haflinger mares were considered to be of too low quality to be used as brood mares, and every effort was made to import higher-quality brood mares from the South Tyrol herds now in Italy. In 1926, the first studbook was established in North Tyrol. In the late 1920s, other cooperatives were established for Haflinger breeders in Weer and Wildschönau, and were able to gain government permission to purchase 100 Haflinger mares from South Tyrol and split them between North Tyrol, Upper Austria and Styria. This single transaction represented one third of all registered mares in South Tyrol, and many others were sold through private treaty, leaving the two regions comparable in terms of breeding-stock populations. In 1931, another breeders' cooperative was established in East Tyrol in Austria, and Haflinger breeding spread throughout the entire Tyrolean province.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940, the award was re-instituted by Compulsory Law 2646/11-11-1940 (ΦΕΚ Α’/13-11-1940). Until the fall of Greece to the Germans in April 1941, 240 Gold Crosses (11 of them repeat awards) and 300 Silver Crosses were awarded. The awards were continued by the collaborationist government during the Axis Occupation, with two Commander's <b>Crosses</b> (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> war flags of the 6th and 34th Infantry Regiments), 1,922 Gold Crosses (179 as repeat awards) and 4,635 Silver Crosses (3 as repeat awards) issued in the 1941–1944 period, most of them posthumously. The Greek government in exile awarded 96 Gold Crosses (9 as repeat awards) and 92 Silver Crosses to Greek and various Allied officers. Following Liberation in October 1944, awards continued for the operations in the Balkans and the Middle East during World War II, with six Commander's <b>Crosses</b> (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> battalion war flags of the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade, the war flags of the Hellenic Army Academy and the Sacred Band and to King George II), 1,225 Gold Crosses and 1,382 Silver Crosses awarded in 1945–1946.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{line between}} Boston and Skegness <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north bank, and then follows {{the course of}} the river to below Wainfleet All Saints. The next bridge is Clough's Bridge, {{carrying}} a minor road over the main channel. Just before it, the old course of the Lymn leaves the straight channel of the Steeping River. It is no longer connected to the Steeping River, but is maintained as a drainage ditch by the Internal Drainage Board (IDB). Warth's Bridge and Thorpe Culvert Bridge follow, both roads leading to Thorpe Culvert railway station. Thorpe Culvert pumping station, owned by the IDB, is located just before the second bridge, and after it, the Wainfleet Relief Channel turns off, passing under the railway almost immediately. There are two more bridges as the main channel crosses Wainfleet Common, Bycroft's Bridge and Crow's Bridge. Crow's Bridge has an elliptical arch constructed of red bricks, and was designed by the engineer John Rennie in 1812. Salem Bridge carries the B1195 road to Wainfleet railway station, and the A52 road <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of Wainfleet All Saints. The channel is now also called Wainfleet Haven, and both names are used to describe it until it reaches the sea.|$|E

Reaching the summit, Dante <b>crosses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demonic world and catches Arkham (who has assumed Sparda's demonic form). Overwhelmed by power, Arkham transforms into a blob-like creature who battles Dante. During the fight Vergil reappears, and the brothers work together to expel Arkham from the demonic world; weakened, Arkham lands on the tower (where Mary kills him). In the demonic world, Dante and Vergil fight for ownership of the Force Edge and the amulet halves. After his defeat Vergil remains as the portal closes, vanishing into the darkness with his half of the amulet.|$|E
