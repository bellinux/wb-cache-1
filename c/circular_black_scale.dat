40|$|The {{olive tree}} may be {{attacked}} by several insect pests, especially the <b>black</b> <b>Scale,</b> which {{is associated with}} this plant throughout its cycle, could limit the production due to leaf drop and poor fruit set. This study aims to evaluate {{the behavior of the}} predatory stinkbug Podisus nigrispinus Dallas (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in olive <b>black</b> <b>scale.</b> Females of P. nigrispinus were placed in Petri dishes, individually, receiving only water in cotton balls for five days. After this, were offered to females of the predator, individuals of <b>black</b> <b>scale</b> in different stages (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd immatures instar) or adults, fixed in olive leaves. The predatory behavior of females of P. nigrispinus was observed continuously for 12 hours.
