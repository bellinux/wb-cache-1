To achieve this, the so-called positional candidate gene approach is gaining in importance. This approach is based on the genetic localization of a trait using genetic linkage analysis. Subsequent <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> of the trait locus with the gene-rich maps of the human and the mouse may reveal candidate genes for the trait in question. <b>Comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> revealed that autosomal dwarfism in the chicken (adw) is located in a chromosomal region that is conserved between chicken, human and mouse. In the mouse the phenotype [...] "Pygmy", similar to chicken adw is also located in that region. The Pygmy mouse phenotype arises from the inactivation of the High Mobility Group I-C (HMGCI-C). In the human the HMGCI-C gene is also located in the same conserved chromosomal segment. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of chicken metaphase chromosomes using the chicken HMGI-C gene as a probe, showed that the chicken HMGI-C gene is indeed located in the region of the adw locus.

Comparing genomes of fully sequenced model fish species with those of farmed fish species through <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> offers shortcuts for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detections and for studying genome evolution through the identification of regions of conserved synteny in teleosts. Here a <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> study is presented by radiation hybrid (RH) mapping genes of the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata, a non-model teleost fish of commercial and evolutionary interest, as it represents the worldwide distributed species-rich family of Sparidae. Results An additional 74 microsatellite markers and 428 gene-based markers appropriate for <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> studies were mapped on the existing RH map of Sparus aurata. The anchoring of the RH map to the genetic linkage map resulted in 24 groups matching the karyotype of Sparus aurata. Homologous sequences to Tetraodon were identified for 301 of the gene-based markers positioned on the RH map of Sparus aurata. Comparison between Sparus aurata RH groups and Tetraodon chromosomes (karyotype of Tetraodon consists of 21 chromosomes) in this study reveals an unambiguous one-to-one relationship suggesting that three Tetraodon chromosomes correspond to six Sparus aurata radiation hybrid groups. The exploitation of this conserved synteny relationship is furthermore demonstrated by in silico mapping of gilthead sea bream expressed sequence tags (EST) that give a significant similarity hit to Tetraodon.

This project was initiated to generate additional BAC end sequences and demonstrate their applications in <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> in catfish. Results We reported the generation of 43, 000 BAC end sequences and their applications for comparative genome analysis in catfish. Using these and the additional 20, 000 existing BAC end sequences as a resource along with linkage mapping and existing physical map, conserved syntenic regions were identified between the catfish and zebrafish genomes. A total of 10, 943 catfish BAC end sequences (17. 3 %) had significant BLAST hits to the zebrafish genome (cutoff value ≤ e - 5), of which 3, 221 were unique gene hits, providing a platform for <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> based on locations of these genes in catfish and zebrafish.

Results We combined data from multiple COSII studies, and other <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> studies performed in tomato, potato, eggplant, pepper and diploid Nicotiana species, to deduce the features and outcomes of chromosomal evolution in the Solanaceae over the past 30 million years. This includes estimating the rates and timing of chromosomal changes (inversions and translocations) as well as deducing the age of ancestral progenitor species and predicting their genome configurations. Conclusions The Solanaceae has experienced chromosomal changes at a modest rate compared with other families and the rates are likely conserved across different lineages of the family. Chromosomal inversions occur at a consistently higher rate than do translocations. Further, we find evidences for non-random positioning of the chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints.

Finally, by utilizing multiple genome comparisons we were able to reconstruct the most likely genome configuration for a number of now-extinct progenitor species that gave rise to the extant solanaceous species used in this research. The results from this study provide the first broad overview of chromosomal evolution in the family Solanaceae, and one of the most detailed thus far for any family of plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|Published: June 30, 2016 A common {{approach}} for developing diagnostic tests for influenza virus detection {{is the use}} of mouse or rabbit monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies against a target antigen of the virus. However, <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> of the target antigen using antibodies from different animal sources has not been evaluated before. This is important because identification of antigenic determinants of the target antigen in different species plays a central role to ensure the efficiency of a diagnostic test, such as competitive ELISA or immunohistochemistry-based tests. Interest in the matrix 2 ectodomain (M 2 e) protein of avian influenza virus (AIV) as a candidate for a universal vaccine and also as a marker for detection of virus infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA) is the rationale for the selection of this protein for <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> evaluation. This study aimed to map the epitopes of the M 2 e protein of avian influenza virus H 5 N 1 using chicken, mouse and rabbit monoclonal or monospecific antibodies. Our findings revealed that rabbit antibodies (rAbs) recognized epitope 6 EVETPTRN 13 of the M 2 e, located at the N-terminal of the protein, while mouse (mAb) and chicken antibodies (cAbs) recognized epitope 10 PTRNEWECK 18, located at the centre region of the protein. The findings highlighted the difference between the M 2 e antigenic determinants recognized by different species that emphasized the importance of <b>comparative</b> <b>mapping</b> of antibody reactivity from different animals to the same antigen, {{especially in the case of}} multi-host infectious agents such as influenza. The findings are of importance for antigenic mapping, as well as diagnostic test and vaccine development.

40|$|International audienceGiven two <b>comparative</b> <b>maps,</b> that is two {{sequences}} of markers each representing a genome, the Maximal Strip Recovery problem (MSR) asks to extract a largest sequence of markers from each map {{such that the}} two extracted sequences are decomposable into non-intersecting strips (or synteny blocks). This aims at defining a robust set of synteny blocks between different species, which {{is a key to}} understand the evolution process since their last common ancestor. In this paper, we add a fundamental constraint to the initial problem, which expresses the biologically sustained need to bound the number of intermediate (non-selected) markers between two consecutive markers in a strip. We therefore introduce the problem -gap-MSR, where is a (usually small) non-negative integer that upper bounds the number of non-selected markers between two consecutive markers in a strip. We show that, if we restrict ourselves to <b>comparative</b> <b>maps</b> without duplicates, the problem is polynomial for = 0, NP-complete for = 1, and APX-hard for 2. For <b>comparative</b> <b>maps</b> with duplicates, the problem is APX-hard for all 0...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{construction}} of a 1. 5 -Mb-resolution radiation hybrid map of the domestic cat genome. This new map includes novel microsatellite loci and markers derived from the 2 X genome sequence that target previous gaps in the feline–human <b>comparative</b> <b>map.</b> Ninety-six percent of the 1793 cat markers we mapped have identifiable orthologues in the canine and human genome sequences. The updated autosomal and X-chromosome <b>comparative</b> <b>maps</b> identify 152 cat–human and 134 cat–dog homologous synteny blocks. Comparative analysis shows the marked change in chromosomal evolution in the canid lineage relative to the felid lineage since divergence from their carnivoran ancestor. The canid lineage has a 30 -fold difference in the number of interchromosomal rearrangements relative to felids, while the felid lineage has primarily undergone intrachromosomal rearrangements. We have also refined the pseudoautosomal region and boundary in the cat and show that it is markedly longer than those of human or mouse. This improved RH <b>comparative</b> <b>map</b> provides a useful tool to facilitate positional cloning studies in the feline model...|$|R
