2500|$|Don Nicholson (May 28, 1927 - January 24, 2006) was an American drag racer from Georgia. He raced in the 1960s and '70s {{when there}} were few {{national}} events. The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) estimates he won 90 percent of his match races. As of 2002, he held {{the record for the}} most number of categories in which he reached a final round (won or took second at an event): Funny Car, Pro Stock, Super Stock, Competition Eliminator, Stock, and Street. He was nicknamed [...] "Dyno Don" [...] after {{he was one of the}} first drivers to use a <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> on his cars in the late 1950s, a skill that he learned while working as a line mechanic at a Chevrolet car dealer.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as a rolling road, measures power delivered {{to the surface of the}} [...] "drive roller" [...] by the drive wheels. The vehicle is often parked on the roller or rollers, which the car then turns, and the output measured thereby.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Super Chevy Magazine {{conducted}} a <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> {{test of a}} well documented, production-line, stock but well-tuned L-72 [...] "COPO" [...] Camaro, and recorded a peak 287 SAE net HP (214 kW) at the wheels, demonstrating the substantial difference between 1960s-era SAE [...] "gross" [...] horsepower ratings versus post-1972 SAE [...] "net".|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of an engine dynamometer, power is {{measured}} at the engine's flywheel. Also, with a <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> or rolling road, power output is measured at the driving wheels. This accounts for energy or power loss through the drive train inefficiencies and weight thereof as well as gravitational force placed upon components therein.|$|E

The original testing was done in cars on the road but as technology developed the testing was moved to <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> with environmental controls to improve consistency.|$|R
5000|$|Modern roller-type chassis dyno systems use the [...] "Salvisberg roller", which {{improves}} traction and repeatability, {{as compared}} to the use of smooth or knurled drive rollers. <b>Chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> can be fixed or portable, and can do much more than display RPM, horsepower, and torque. With modern electronics and quick reacting, low inertia dyno systems, it is now possible to tune to best power and the smoothest runs in real time.|$|R

To test {{standing}} {{wave of the}} tire, constructed the simulation model by ABAQUS software for radial tire running rapidly on the automotive <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers,</b> meanwhile assembled the automotive <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers,</b> high-speed camera and actual radial tire together. The experiment indicated that the critical speed of simulation tire is 255. 83 km/h, actual tire 268. 5 km/h, the difference is 4. 95 %, Consistency is very good for simulation result and actual tire testing. When the vehicle is running rapidly to the special speed, the tire will bring {{standing wave}}, while distortion of the tire largen, the temperature rise rapidly, material performance decline quickly, the tire will be destroyed at short notice. Now the method of critical speed research of the tire included analytical method, experimentation and finite element simulation, the analytical method is that constructed theory model of the tire[1], for example Sakai Hideo researched critical speed of radial tire on the equation of girder vibration by loop girder model of elasticity radicle[2].

5000|$|Car testers {{are most}} {{familiar}} with the <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> or [...] "rolling road" [...] installed in many workshops. This measures drive wheel brake horsepower, which is generally 15-20% less than the brake horsepower measured at the crankshaft or flywheel on an engine dynamometer.

50|$|Supports chassis based exhaust {{emissions}} testing of motorcycles, ATVs, UTVs, passenger vehicles and light duty trucks. Small to medium size motorcycle and ATV testing is performed on a Horiba <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> {{with a single}} axle 20 inch diameter smooth roll. Large motorcycle, UTV, passenger vehicle and light duty truck testing is performed on an AVL 2 axle All Wheel Drive (AWD) <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> with 48 inch diameter smooth rolls. The AWD dynamometer can be operated in front wheel drive, rear wheel drive or AWD modes. Both chassis dynamometers are AC motoring and meet EPA requirements for chassis based exhaust emission and Deterioration Factor Service accumulation testing. Exhaust emissions are measured using a 2013 model year AVL iGem i60 CVS dilute emissions bench. The bench is capable of measuring tailpipe {{exhaust emissions}} produced by gasoline and diesel engines. The AWD dynamometer Test Cell temperature can be set for vehicle testing between 20F (-6C) and 100F (38C).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> {{according}} to the target application - for example, emissions measurement, miles accumulation <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> (MACD), Noise-Vibration-Harshness (NVH or [...] "Acoustic") Application, Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing, end of line (EOL) tests, performance measurement and tuning. Another basic division is by type of vehicle - motorcycles, cars, trucks, tractors or {{the size of the}} roller - mostly 25", 48", 72", but also any other. Modern dynamometers used for development are mostly one roller to the wheel construction and the vehicle wheel is placed the top of the roller. Older constructional solutions are two roller per wheel and vehicle is place between these rollers - this design solution is cheaper and simpler, however, due to the requirements for accuracy and strict limits is no longer used for the development of new vehicles, but only as a test dynamometer {{at the end of the}} line or to measure the performance of the engine without dismantling, or performance tuning in [...] "garage" [...] companies.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the MOBINET-project, dealing with mobility in cities, a passenger car was equipped with on-board exhaust gas measurement devices. In the city of Munich more than 20 hours of measurements of limited exhaust components were conducted. It is shown that the driving parameters velocity and velocity times acceleration observed in real-world-driving are not reflected by common driving cycles of <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers.</b> Comparison of measured exhaust figures with simulations by the state-of-the-art model COPERT III revealed discrepancies of up to one order of magnitude. These discrepancies are most important to nitrogen oxides. Emissions of nitrogen oxides can be reduced by measurements of traffic jam prevention more efficiently than hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, which are emitted mainly during cold starts...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. The force {{resisting}} the straight-line motion {{of a road}} vehicle on a flat track consists of mechanical resistance and aerodynamic drag. It is necessary to measure these component forces over the speed range of the vehicle to obtain data for performance calculations and for the accurate calibration of modern <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> used in fuel economy and exhaust emission tests. Continuous measurement of wheel torque, vehicle speed, airspeed and direction enables estimates {{to be made of}} the various drag forces that bring the vehicle to rest during a coastdown test. The data are analysed using a sophisticated parameter optimization routine to determine the numerical values of the coefficients in a mathematical model of the total road load. Repeatability of the results are assessed by calculating the uncertainties in the values obtained from a number of track tests. A brief description of the on-vehicle data acquisition and processing system is given, and the advantages of an advanced test and analytical process are demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to limits, test procedure has certain finer points too. For instance, the mass emission test measurements done in g/km on a <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> requires a loading of 100 kg weight in {{addition to}} unloaded car weight in Europe. In India, BS-III norms require an extra loading of 150 kg weight to achieve the desired inertia weight mainly due to road conditions here.|$|E
50|$|Selected test {{vehicles}} are “run in” for about 6,000 km before testing. The vehicle is then {{mounted on a}} <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> programmed {{to take into account}} the aerodynamic efficiency, weight and rolling resistance of the vehicle. A trained driver runs the vehicle through standardized driving cycles that simulate trips in the city and on the highway. Fuel consumption ratings are derived from the emissions generated during the driving cycles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chassis</b> <b>dynamometer</b> {{information}} from well documented stock examples reinforces that estimate. Similarly, {{this level of}} acceleration performance is on par {{with that of a}} production line stock, 2013+ V6/ speed manual transmission Accord (278 SAE Net HP), which shares a similar curb weight. It should be noted that a Holman and Moody specially prepared [...] "stripper", which carried no sound deadener, undercoating, or any optional factory equipment, was used as the introductory press car in 1968.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis has {{examined}} how {{the understanding of}} different driving tasks {{can be used to}} develop a suitable powertrain model {{to be used in the}} Sim III simulator at VTI. Studies performed in the simulator have been statistically analyzed using parameters commonly used to describe driving patterns in drive cycles. It has been shown that the studies can be divided into three driving tasks: "High constant velocity", "High velocity with evasive maneuver", and "Mixed driving". Furthermore, a powertrain model from a former master thesis has been further developed. The new model utilizes a 3 D torque map that takes engine speed, accelerator pedal position and gear as input. Using measurements, from the <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> laboratory at LiU, that resembles the derived driving tasks, it has been shown that the performance of the new model has significantly increased for high velocity driving and during maximum acceleration. However, when using the clutch at low speeds and gears the model still performs poorly and needs further development...|$|R

40|$|One aim of MOBINET was the {{reduction}} of traffic congestions in Munich. For the rating of the consequences with respect to air chemistry and hygiene engineering, emission maps are indispensable {{for the evaluation of}} traffic flow measures. The contribution of FZ Juelich was the development of emission maps for passenger cars equipped with latest exhaust gas treatment technology. As a function of the current driving parameters, the output yields the instantaneous exhaust emission of a single car. Therefore, model calculations of traffic emissions by means of micro-scale traffic flow models in Munich need parameterisation of exhaust emissions. The emission maps are based on on-board measurements in real Munich traffic using more than 70. 000 second-by-second data of CO_ 2, CO, NO, NO_ 2 and of NMHC. Another important issue was the comparison of real-world emission behaviour and emissions measured at a <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers,</b> i. e. the question if real-world emission behaviour is better represented by a specially designed driving cycle or by emission maps derived from the on-board measurements.

50|$|By modifying {{these values}} while {{monitoring}} the exhausts using a wide band lambda probe {{to see if}} the engine runs rich or lean, the tuner can find the optimal amount of fuel to inject to the engine at every different combination of RPM and throttle position. This process is often carried out at a dynamometer, giving the tuner a controlled environment to work in. An engine dynamometer gives a more precise calibration for racing applications.

40|$|Carbonyls from {{gasoline}} powered light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and heavy-duty diesel powered vehicles (HDDVs) {{operated on}} <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> were measured using an annular denuder-quartz filter-polyurethane foam sampler with O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine derivatization and chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Two internal standards were utilized based on carbonyl recovery, 4 -fluorobenzaldehyde for _C 8 compounds. Gas- and particle-phase emissions for 39 aliphatic and 20 aromatic carbonyls ranged from 0. 1 ? 2000 ?g/L fuel for LDVs and 1. 8 - 27000 mu g/L fuel for HDDVs. Gas-phase species accounted for 81 - 95 {{percent of the}} total carbonyls from LDVs and 86 - 88 percent from HDDVs. Particulate carbonyls emitted from a HDDV under realistic driving conditions were similar to concentrations measured in a diesel particulate matter (PM) standard reference material. Carbonyls accounted for 19 percent of particulate organic carbon (POC) emissions from low-emission LDVs and 37 percent of POC emissions from three-way catalyst equipped LDVs. This identifies carbonyls as one of the largest classes of compounds in LDV PM emissions. The carbonyl fraction of HDDV POC was lower, 3. 3 - 3. 9 percent depending upon operational conditions. Partitioning analysis indicates the carbonyls had not achieved equilibrium between the gas- and particle-phase under the dilution factors of 126 - 584 used in the current study...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{the lung}} {{toxicity}} and bacterial mutagenicity of seven samples from gasoline and diesel vehicle emissions were reported previously [1]. Filter and vapor-phase semivolatile organic {{samples were collected}} from normal and high-emitter gasoline and diesel vehicles operated on <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> on the Unified Driving Cycle, and the compositions of the samples were measured in detail. The two fractions of each sample were combined in their original mass collection ratios, and the toxicity of the seven samples was compared by measuring inflammation and tissue damage in rat lungs and mutagenicity in bacteria. There was good agreement among the toxicity response variables in ranking the samples and demonstrating a five-fold range of toxicity. The relationship between chemical composition and toxicity was analyzed {{by a combination of}} principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression (PLS, also known as projection to latent surfaces). The PCA /PLS analysis revealed the chemical constituents co-varying most strongly with toxicity and produced models predicting the relative toxicity of the samples with good accuracy. The results demonstrated the utility of the PCA/PLS approach, which is now being applied to additional samples, and it also provided a starting point for confirming the compounds that actually cause the effects...|$|R
40|$|Fossil fuel run {{diesel engines}} are being favored in light, medium and heavy duty {{applications}} as they exhibit higher fuel conversion efficiencies. Direct injection diesels are still facing challenges to obtain trade-off between oxides of nitrogen and particulate emissions. There are sophisticated strategies such as common rail direct injection, particulate filters with associated sensors and actuators but limited to expensive comfort vehicles. In the present experimental study, a mechanically operated simple component, variable timing fuel injection cam, is designed for a 510 Â cc automotive type naturally aspirated, water-cooled, direct injection diesel engine. Modifications in the fuel injection cam and gear train are carried out to suit the existing engine configuration. Variable speed tests are carried out for testing the efficacy of component on both engine and <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> for performance and emissions. It is observed that the engine which is already retarded could further be retarded with variable timing fuel injection cam. Significant reductions in NOx and smoke emission levels are achieved. Combined effect of VIC with 7 % EGR could reduce CO by about 88 %, HCÂ +Â NOx by 37 % and PM emissions by 90 %.

50|$|In {{addition}} to being {{used to determine the}} torque or power characteristics of a machine under test, dynamometers are employed {{in a number of other}} roles. In standard emissions testing cycles such as those defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, dynamometers are used to provide simulated road loading of either the engine (using an engine dynamometer) or full powertrain (using a <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometer).</b> In fact, beyond simple power and torque measurements, dynamometers can be used as part of a testbed for a variety of engine development activities, such as the calibration of engine management controllers, detailed investigations into combustion behavior, and tribology.|$|E
50|$|Porsche {{introduced}} a refreshed 928 S into the European market in 1980 model year, {{although it was}} summer of 1982 and MY 1983 before the model reached North America. Externally, the S wore new front and rear spoilers and sported wider wheels and tires than the older variant, but the main change for the 928 S was under the hood, where a revised 4.7 L engine was used. European versions debuted with 300 PS (221 kW/297 hp), and were upgraded to 310 PS (228 kW/306 hp) for 1984 model year, though it is rumored proven on <b>chassis</b> <b>dynamometers</b> that they typically made around 330 hp. From 1984 to 1986, the S model was called S2 in UK. These cars used Bosch LH-Jetronic fuel injection and purely electronic Bosch ignition, the same systems used on the later 32-valve cars, though without the pollution controls. North American-spec 1983 and 1984 S models used, among other differences, smaller valves, milder camshafts, smaller diameter intake manifolds, and additional pollution equipment {{in order to meet}} emissions regulations, and were limited to 234 hp (174 kW/230 PS) as a result. Due to low grade fuel 16V low compression S engine was made for Australian market in 1985 model year. It had 9.3:1 compression ratio pistons instead of normal 10.4:1 but used same large intake, high lift cams, large valves etc. of other S engines.|$|R
