25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E
500|$|Russell Crowe {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} a different role in the film before Sharon Stone asked that the actor try for the lead male role. [...] "When I saw Romper Stomper (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," [...] Stone reasoned. [...] "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. He reminds me of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like." [...] On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as [...] "sort of like the fourth Stooge." ...|$|E
500|$|City's matchwinner Hamilton and {{his manager}} Kamara shared the {{headlines}} in the national newspapers. Hamilton said after the game: [...] "To score for my hometown team at Wembley {{has got to be}} one of the best feelings ever." [...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> can get it here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and I was delighted to be part of them. It was a real blessing to my life. To play at Wembley was a dream fulfilled." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{doctors said}} it was all due to the {{pressure}} of the show and the diet I was eating. Hours later I was getting a boardroom grilling from Sir Alan after the wedding task. I was shaking with nerves <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> was about to throw up all over Sir Alan and his sidekicks, Nick and Margaret." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hutton Inquiry, {{a public}} {{inquiry into the}} {{circumstances}} surrounding his death, ruled that he had committed suicide and that Kelly had not in fact {{said some of the}} things attributed to him by Gilligan. Baker said that Hutton had [...] "blatantly failed {{to get to the bottom}} of matters", and that [...] "the more I look into it the less <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> am by the explanation and the more unanswered questions appear which ought to have been addressed properly by the Hutton inquiry or by the coroner." ...|$|E

2500|$|Garðar {{spent six}} months at a Hertfordshire private school in England when he was aged nine and 11. He insists that {{there was never any}} {{pressure}} on him to become a singer. [...] "At home, mum was always playing piano and dad was singing. I'd listen to dad's records of other tenors and whole operas but I also had a huge pile of Bon Jovi, Queen and Shakin' Stevens albums. I absolutely loved Prince and when I was 10 I was <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be a pop star. Then I got bitten by the acting bug." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burton said, [...] "I've never studied acting or {{anything}} because I've been so lucky with MTV. I'm <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> {{got the chance}} to be on One Tree Hill because I did a guest thing on Dawson's Creek as myself, when the cast appeared at the MTV Beach House." [...] She added, [...] "And my only scene was with Chad Michael Murray (Lucas Scott). So, now The Chad and I are reunited. How bizarre is that?" [...] With regard to what her life is like as an actress, Burton said, [...] "Actors like to think their lives are very difficult, but they're not. Yeah, you're running around a lot. But I used to work in a supermarket and in a bar. That was hard. This is fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{was born}} on New Year's Eve 1937, in Margam, a suburb of Port Talbot, Glamorgan. His parents were Annie Muriel (née Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. He stated his father’s working class values have always underscored his life. “Whenever I get a feeling that I may be special or different, I think of my father and I {{remember}} his hands – his hardened, broken hands". His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan. In a 2002 interview he stated: [...] "I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. I grew up absolutely <b>convinced</b> <b>I</b> was stupid." [...] In desperation, his parents sent him off to boarding school, where the headmaster {{told him he was}} [...] "hopeless" [...] and he developed a [...] "sheer contempt for authority." [...] He stumbled into acting at 17 with a YMCA group (his one line: [...] "").|$|E

60|$|As {{the days}} went by, however, I {{began to grow}} <b>convinced.</b> <b>I</b> saw with my own eyes, there in that prison, things {{unbelievable}} and monstrous.
