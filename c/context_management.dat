40|$|Managing context {{information}} in forensic casework aims to minimize task-irrelevant information while maximizing the task-relevant information that reaches the examiner. A {{design and implementation}} of <b>context</b> information <b>management</b> (CIM) is described for forensic firearms examination. Guided by a taxonomy of different sources of context information, a flow-chart was constructed that specifies the process of casework examination and <b>context</b> information <b>management.</b> Due {{to the risk of}} bias, another examiner may need to be involved when <b>context</b> information <b>management</b> is unsuccessful. Application of <b>context</b> information <b>management</b> does not make a subjective examination objective, but can limit the risks of bias with a minimal investment of time and resources...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} concept of contextual {{ambidexterity}} in manufacturing contexts. We maintain that the more a plant adopts an organizational context that combines stretch and discipline (performance <b>management</b> <b>context)</b> and support and trust (social context) the higher its level of contextual ambidexterity will be. We test our hypotheses on the High Performance Manufacturing database using SEM. Findings show that both social <b>context</b> and performance <b>management</b> <b>context</b> {{have a positive effect}} on contextual ambidexterity measured as interaction between improvement and innovation. When contextual ambidexterity is measured as absolute difference between innovation and improvement, only performance <b>management</b> <b>context</b> contributes to contextual ambidexterity...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Context</b> <b>Management</b> {{is often}} {{combined}} with Single Sign On {{applications in the}} healthcare environment, but the two are discrete functions. Single Sign On is the process that enables the secure access of disparate applications by a user through use of a single authenticated identifier and password. <b>Context</b> <b>Management</b> augments this by then enabling the user to identify subjects once (e.g., a patient) and have all disparate systems into which the user is granted access to [...] "tune" [...] to this patient simultaneously. As the user further identifies particular [...] "subjects" [...] of interest (e.g., a particular visit), those applications containing information about the selected subject will then automatically and seamlessly to the user [...] "tune" [...] to that information as well. The end result for the user is an aggregated view of all patient information across disparate applications.|$|E

It supports both stream and datagram semantics with security guarantees (e. g., data origin authenticity, data integrity and data confidentiality). It {{is designed to}} resemble the Berkeley sockets interface so that security can be easily retrofitted into existing socket programs with only minor modifications. SNP is built on top of GSS-API, thus making it relatively portable across different authentication mechanisms conforming to GSSAPI. SNP hides the details of GSS-API (e. g., credentials and <b>contexts</b> <b>management),</b> the communication sublayer {{as well as the}} cryptographic sublayer from the application programmers.
