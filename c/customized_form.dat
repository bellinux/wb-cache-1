The static query forms {{are not able}} to satisfy various ad-hoc queries on those types of databases. Through <b>customize</b> <b>forms</b> user can modify but he must be familiar with the database schema. Hence it proposes an interactive query form which is able to generate query forms at runtime. The generation of a query form is an iterative process until the user is satisfied. At each iteration, the system generates clusters to represent results and the user can choose the cluster then the attributes will be choose by the system and it will calculate F-measure of those attributes and update the query form by adding those components. It utilizes the expected F-Measure for measuring the goodness of a query form...|$|R

25|$|The {{important}} point of Monier's {{idea was that}} it combined steel and concrete {{in such a way}} that the best qualities of each material were brought into play. Concrete is easily procured and shaped. It has considerable compressive or crushing strength, but is somewhat deficient in shearing strength, and distinctly weak in tensile or pulling strength. Steel, on the other hand, is easily procurable in simple forms such as long bars, and is extremely strong. But it is difficult and expensive to work up into <b>customized</b> <b>forms.</b> Concrete had been avoided for making beams, slabs and thin walls because its lack of tensile strength doomed it to fail in such circumstances. But if a concrete slab is reinforced with a network of small steel rods on its undersurface where the tensile stresses occur, its strength will be enormously increased.|$|R

This systematic review investigated how researchers defined ‘participation’ and the language used in participation intervention research. Method: Nine health and education databases were searched for intervention studies {{of children with disabilities}} that included a participation outcome. Quantitative data were extracted using a <b>customized</b> <b>form,</b> and participation text data were extracted verbatim. Themes were derived using a thematic coding approach. These participation themes were applied to the outcome measures used in the included studies to compare participation language with the methods used to quantify participation changes. Results: Of the 2257 articles retrieved, 25 were included in this review. Five participation themes and nine subthemes were developed. Two themes, attendance and involvement, were directly related to the participation construct. Three additional themes described related concepts: preferences, activity competence, and sense of self. Interpretation: Attendance and involvement seem to describe the essence of the participation concept. The related themes may provide important avenues to enhance participation outcomes. This review highlighted the need for researchers to define the construct under investigation clearly and select measures carefully, as measurement choice is the mechanism through which the concept is operationalized in research.

Cyclus is a fuel cycle simulator specifically designed to combat the lack of adaptability of previous generations of simulators. This is accomplished through an agent-based infrastructure and treating time discretely. The Cyclus kernel was developed to allow for models, called archetypes, of differing fidelity and function depending on need of the users. To take advantage of this flexibility, a user must write an archetype for their desired simulation if it does not yet exist within the Cyclus ecosystem. At this stage, a user graduates to the title of archetype developer. Without automation, archetype development is difficult for the uninitiated. This paper presents the framework developed for simplifying the writing of archetypes: the Cyclus preprocessor, or cycpp. cycpp addresses the computer science and software development aspects of archetype development that can be addressed algorithmically, allowing the developer to focus on modeling the physics, social policies, and economics. cycpp passes through the code three times to perform the following tasks: normalizing the code via the C preprocessor, accumulation of notations, and code generation. Not only does this reduce the amount of code a developer must write by approximately an order of magnitude, but the archetypes are automatically validated...|$|E

European Commission funding (FP 6) for this “Network of Excellence” has started in March 2006, and runs for 5 years. For EDIT Work Package 7 (WP 7) “Applying Taxonomy to Conservation” {{the aim is to}} strengthen the input of taxonomic expertise in Europe for biodiversity conservation, by organizing the participation of individual taxonomists and experts in biodiversity inventory and monitoring efforts in conservation areas (www. atbi. eu). For biodiversity inventories and monitoring, the advantage of using digital field recording tools is to simplify data recording as well as to improve data quality. The use of electronic field tools and software should be promoted to help minimizing error rates, in particular to avoid mistakes {{from the beginning of the}} recording chain. Many errors may be avoided by using authority lists, e. g. for countries, habitat-types or taxa that can already be determined in the field. Automated georeferencing and recording of date and time in standardized formats already in the field will also avoid errors when importing or retyping such data into a database. Relevant software should be usable for tools such as mobile phones with GPS (Global Positioning System) functionality up to water resistant PDAs - Personal Digital Assistant (e. g. Magellan - Mobile Mapper; Trimble – Juno, Nomad). Examples presented here for more efficient electronic data recording in the field include the application of mobile recording devices with <b>customized</b> <b>forms,</b> which are tested for field work in ATBI+M (All Taxa Biodiversity Inventories + Monitoring; www. atbi. eu) sites operated in the EDIT project. This is a general approach for recording georeferenced, individual species data using <b>customized</b> <b>forms</b> for ESRI ArcPad applications. Species names can be selected from a taxonomic authority list provided in a file in dBASE-format. Such files can be easily created, modified, and exchanged to allow individual researchers to use regional or otherwise customized species lists.

The authority species lists may be customized for a geographic area (e. g., a nature reserve) and/or a group of taxa (e. g., larger birds). This allows each expert to choose the species list needed for his/her research. Problems remain with observation records which cannot be reliably determined in the field.

MethodsA new algorithm for the selection of an optimized set of Zernike terms in customized treatments for laser corneal refractive surgery was developed. Its tissue saving attributes have been simulated on 100 different wave aberrations at 6 mm diameter. Outcomes were evaluated {{in terms of how}} much depth and volume was saved for each condition (in micrometers and in percentage), whether the proposed correction consists of either a full wavefront correction or an aberration-free treatment, and whether the proposed depth or volume was less than the one required for the equivalent aberration-free treatment. ResultsSimulated outcomes showed an average saved depth of 5 μm (0 - 16 μm), and an average saved volume of 95 μl (0 - 127 μl) or 11 % saved tissue (0 - 66 % saved tissue). Proposed corrections were always less deep than full wavefront corrections and in 59 % of the cases were less deep than equivalent aberration-free treatments. ConclusionsEven though Zernike modes decomposition is a mathematical description of the aberration, it is not the aberration itself. Not all Zernike modes affect the optical quality in the same way. The eye does not see through Zernike decomposition but with its own aberration pattern. However, it seems feasible to efficiently perform laser corneal refractive surgery in a <b>customized</b> <b>form</b> minimising the amount of ablated tissue without compromising the visual quality.

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) were searched from their earliest available record up to May 2011 using Medical Subjects Headings and key words. We also undertook related articles searches and read reference lists of all incoming articles. STUDY SELECTION: Studies involving human participants describing the effects of thermal interventions on ROM and/or mechanical properties in soft tissue. Two reviewers independently screened studies against eligibility criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by 2 review authors using a <b>customized</b> <b>form.</b> Methodologic quality was also assessed by 2 authors independently, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-six studies, comprising a total of 1301 healthy participants, satisfied the inclusion criteria. There was a high risk of bias across all studies. Meta-analyses were not undertaken because of clinical heterogeneity; however, effect sizes were calculated. There were conflicting data on {{the effect of}} cold on joint ROM, accessory joint movement, and passive stiffness. There was limited evidence to determine whether acute cold applications enhance the effects of stretching, and further evidence is required. There was evidence that heat increases ROM, and a combination of heat and stretching is more effective than stretching alone. CONCLUSIONS: Heat is an effective adjunct to developmental and therapeutic stretching techniques and should be the treatment of choice for enhancing ROM in a clinical or sporting setting. The effects of heat or ice on other important mechanical properties (eg, passive stiffness) remain equivocal and should be the focus of future study...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} describe antibiotic prescribing for potential infections among patients admitted in pediatric departments in two private sector hospitals; one teaching (TH) and one non-teaching (NTH) in Central India. Data from all patients admitted at the pediatric departments of both study hospitals was collected manually, for 3 years (2008 - 2011) using a <b>customized</b> <b>form.</b> Data from inpatients aged 0 - 18 years, diagnosed with; acute gastroenteritis (AGE), respiratory tract infections, enteric fever, viral fever or unspecified fever were focused for analysis. Antibiotic prescriptions were analysed using the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and defined daily doses (DDDs). Adherence to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics list of essential medicines (IAP-LEM) was investigated. P-values < 0. 05 were considered significant. Oftotal 6, 825 inpatients admitted at two pediatric departments, 510 patients from the TH and 2, 479 from the NTH were selected based on the assigned potential infectious diagnoses. Of these, 224 patients (44 %) at the TH and 2, 088 (84 %) at the NTH were prescribed at least one antibiotic during hospital stay (odds ratio- 0. 69, 95 %confidence interval- 0. 52 to 0. 93; p< 0. 001). Patients with AGE, viral- and enteric fever were frequently prescribed antibiotics at both hospitals, yet higher proportion were prescribed antibiotics at the NTH compared to the TH. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic class in both hospitals, namely third generation cephalosporins, J 01 DD (69 %) at the TH, and new fixed dose combinations of antibiotics J 01 R (FDCs, 42 %) at the NTH. At the TH, 37 % of the antibiotic prescriptions were comprised of antibiotics listed in the IAP-LEM, compared to 24 % at the NTH (p< 0. 05). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed frequently in both hospitals also for the un-indicated conditions such as viral fever and enteric fever. At the NTH, new FDCs were more frequently prescribed and adherence to the IAP-LEM was substantially lower at the NTH compared to the TH.

40|$|Prejudicial {{beliefs and}} {{behaviors}} {{have been viewed}} from numerous perspectives. Four factors, religious attitudes, pride of in-group membership, traditional beliefs, and certain personality types, have individually {{been shown to be}} associated with prejudice. Some researchers have looked at a few of these factors together, but none have looked at all four together to examine potential relationships and their individual contribution to prejudicial thinking. This research is designed to investigate attitudes toward out-groups, sources of prejudice, and religious outlook. Four measures of religious attitudes, the Quest scale of the Religious Life Inventory (RLI), the Intrinsic and Extrinsic scales from the Religious Orientation Scale (ROS), and the Christian Orthodoxy Scale were used to measure religious attributes. The Right Wing Authoritarian Scale (RWA) was used to identify the extent of authoritarian thinking. A <b>customized</b> <b>form</b> of the Group Self-Esteem Inventory (GESI) was used to measure a sense of Christian in-group thinking. Attitudes toward several out-groups (lesbians, gay males, and obese persons) were used as measures ofthe dependent variables using the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gays Scale (ATLG) and the Anti-Fat Attitudes Scale (AFA), respectively. The results are analyzed through correlations and regression looking for interactions with, and contributions to, prejudice in a sample population. Participants included undergraduate students at local public and private institutions. Prior research predicted that findings would show positive correlations between anti-homosexual prejudice and extrinsic religiosity, intrinsic religiosity, Christian group affiliation, religious tenets, and authoritarianism. Research with the Quest scale has not revealed association with the ATLG or AF A Anti-overweight prejudice has not been related to these attributes in past research. However, past research has shown authoritarianism to be correlated with many sorts of prejudices. Results of this study indicate authoritarianism is a consistent predictor of prejudice against both homosexuals and overweight persons with a beta coefficient of between. 61 and. 76 in the case of anti-homosexual prejudice and a weaker range of. 21 and. 27 with overweight persons. Extrinsic religiosity is a negative correlate with a beta coefficient of. 40 -. 43 for anti-homosexual prejudice and -. 1 5 regarding overweight persons. Christian orthodoxy is a significant correlate and predictor of anti-homosexual prejudice (beta =. 26) and Christian group affiliation is a weak negative predictor of anti-overweight prejudice (beta of-. 17 -. 18). The findings are discussed in terms of previous investigations, particularly in regard to the strong role authoritarianism plays in prejudice and the possible social roles associated with an extrinsic orientation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} an explorative attempt to study the {{popularity}} of the New Age in the context of late modern culture. In doing so, I have tried to construct a broad and multidisciplinary framework of analysis in which the New Age could be located. Positioning the New Age in a larger discussion on late-modern subjectivity, I have tried to argue that the emergence and popularity of the New Age seems to correspond to certain significant changes within late-modern subject formation. I have argued that the socio-psychological conditions of late-modernity seem to have generated some existential anxieties that could have major implications for the construction of subjectivity. In order to gain more insight into the way these tensions and anxieties are played out on a psychological level, I have argued that the psychoanalytic discussion on narcissism could provide a valuable framework of analysis through which these processes could be studied. Narcissism, in this sense, refers to a psychic defence mechanism that produces an ill-supported and thoroughly fragmented constitution of self, in which the subject is submitted to a permanent quest for self-affirmation to cover over his disintegrated and depleted self-identity. As such, one could argue that the narcissistic personality disorder could be understood as a psychopathological symptom that could indicate and describe certain significant features of late-modem culture. Furthermore, I have argued that the social production of narcissism in society may have engendered the emergence and popularity of the New Age in late-modern culture. Employing a <b>customized</b> <b>form</b> of 'self-religiosity', the New Age seems to be tailored to address the needs and anxieties of a particularly narcissistic subject, by offering an alternative therapeutic discourse that could not only support this subject in the process of self-definition, but also provide him with a (fleeting) sense of ontological security, so desperately needed in the uncertain environment of the late-modern age. As such, I have argued that the emergence of the New Age could be understood as a defence against the anxieties that late-modernity generates. However, this thesis has merely been an explorative one, highlighting a broad range of questions, themes and discussions in which the New Age could be located. With this thesis, I thereby hope to make a small contribution {{to the study of the}} New Age as a burgeoning field of cultural analysis.

40|$|Modern {{spreadsheet}} {{systems can}} be used to implement complex spreadsheet applications including data sheets, <b>customized</b> user <b>forms</b> and executable procedures written in a scripting language. These applications are often developed by practitioners that do not follow any software engineering practice and do not produce any design documentation. Thus, spreadsheet applications may be very difficult to be maintained or restructured. In this position paper we present in a nutshell two reverse engineering techniques and a tool that we are currently realizing for the abstraction of conceptual data models and business logic models.

40|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} century, the {{importance}} of Israel as spiritual homeland and safe haven served {{as the foundation of}} American Jewry’s relationship to the emerging State of Israel during {{most of the}} twentieth century. At the onset of the twenty-first century, however, these symbols have lost much of their power to engage young American Jews. While caring about Israel’s survival remains important to the majority of American Jews, it does not appear to figure strongly into religious identity or how people make personal meaning from being Jewish (Liebman and Cohen, 1990; Cohen and Eisen, 2000; Horowitz, 2000), particularly for Jews under the age of forty. Indeed, some evidence claims that for many today, Israel is irrelevant to sustaining rich American Jewish life (Aviv and Schneerson, 2005). Israel is certainly an integral part of Jewish tradition. It is embedded throughout the liturgy and calendar. Sacred texts are permeated with references to the landscape, climate, history, and theology of the land. It is an idealized homeland, now made real. It serves both as a sacred symbol of moral striving and a unifying force for the Jewish people. Demographic studies consistently demonstrate that the more identified and active one is as a Jew, the more important Israel becomes. Thus, it appears that the more connected one is to Jewish life, the less one needs an Israel “education ” per se. But, Jewish tradition is not the guiding force for most American Jews today. What was once an organic and integral part of Jewish life has now become diluted and detached from the more personalized and <b>customized</b> <b>forms</b> of Jewish engagement typical of mos...|$|R
