40|$|Problem statement: There {{are quite}} a few active faults {{recently}} found in the western and northern parts of Thailand, which could possibly induce earthquakes of magnitude (ML) of 5. 5 - 6. 5. Although seismic design code has been enforced in the area since 1980, the fundamental knowledge on dynamic soil behavior has not been extensively attained. Approach: <b>Collection</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>borehole</b> information in the targeted areas to form a typical subsoil profile. This borehole information, together with analytical result obtained from logistic regression based on worldwide liquefaction database was used to conduct an effective stress analysis. Result: Literature reviews <b>of</b> the existing <b>boreholes</b> from the two largest provinces in the north, Chiang-Mai and Chiang-Rai, revealed that the areas were underlain by layers of loose to medium dense sand found at shallow depths. The corrected SPT N-value of those sand layers varies in the range of 5 - 20. A simple tool correlating the liquefaction probability, which correlated excess pore water pressure and peak ground acceleration, was proposed for the studied areas. Conclusion: The proposed correlation provided preliminary tool to evaluate risk of the shallow foundation from partial liquefaction in the two northern provinces of Thailand...|$|R
40|$|This {{data report}} {{presents}} a discussion <b>of</b> the <b>borehole</b> radar tomography experiment conducted at Box Canyon, Idaho. Discussion {{concentrates on the}} survey methodology, data acquisition procedures, and the resulting tomographic images and interpretations. The entire geophysics field effort for FY 96 centered around the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>borehole</b> radar data within the inclined boreholes R 1, R 2, R 3, and R 4 before, during, and after the ponded infiltration experiment. The well pairs R 1 -R 2, R 2 -R 4, and R 3 -R 4 comprised {{the bulk of the}} field survey; however, additional data were collected between vertical boreholes within and around the infiltration basin. The intent <b>of</b> the inclined <b>boreholes</b> was to allow access beneath the infiltration basin and to enhance the ability of the radar method to image both vertical and horizontal features where flow may dominate. This data report will concentrate on the inclined borehole data and the resulting tomograms. The borehole radar method is one in which modified ground penetrating radar antennas are lowered into boreholes and high frequency electromagnetic signals are transmitted through subsurface material to a receiving antenna. The transmitted signals may be represented as multiple raypaths crossing through the zone of interest. If sufficient raypaths are recorded, a tomographic image may be obtained through computer processing. The data normally recorded are signal amplitude versus time. The information extracted from such data includes the following: (a) the transit time which depends on the wave velocity, (b) the amplitude which depends on the wave attenuation, the dispersion which indicates a change in velocity and attenuation with frequency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Groundwater levels {{rises and}} falls in {{response}} to different phenomena such as seasonal fluctuations, and rainfall variability occasioned by global warming. These fluctuations are attributed to naturally occurring changes in climate and anthropogenic activities like changes in landscape, pumpage, induced infiltration, evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature and pressure. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the influence of aquifer depth on microbial parameters <b>of</b> <b>borehole</b> water. The aquifer depth was determined using seismic refraction method and the water samples were collected in a polyethylene container and preserved in an ice-packed box. It was immediately transferred to the laboratory for microbial analysis. It is believed that the deeper the depth <b>of</b> <b>borehole</b> the better the quality of water abstracted from it but {{this was not the case}} in the study area. Results show that even at the deepest depth of 50 m, microbial parameters such as faecal and total coliform were still found because most <b>of</b> the <b>boreholes</b> were located close to pit latrines and soakaways. This scenario encourages the seepage of micro organisms through the soil strata from the pit latrines into the borehole. The multiple regression analysis shows that R 2 is 0. 650. This implies that 65 percent of the variation in aquifer depth was explained by microbial parameter <b>of</b> <b>borehole</b> water in the study area. The researchers therefore recommended that boreholes should be sited far away from soakaways and pit latrine, furthermore a depth of atleast 70 m is appropriate for sinking <b>of</b> <b>boreholes</b> within the study area...|$|R

40|$|In 2012 BRGM {{launched}} an extensive program {{to build the}} new French Geological Reference platform (RGF). Among the objectives of this program is to provide the public with validated, reliable and 3 D-consistent geological data. Approx. 100, 000 boreholes over the whole French national territory provide a preliminary interpretation in terms of depths of main geological interfaces, but with an unchecked, unknown and often low reliability. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present the procedure that has been tested on two areas in France, in order to validate (or not) these boreholes, with the aim of being generalized as much as possible to the nearly 100, 000 boreholes waiting for validation. The approach is based on the following steps: (a) Selection of a loose network <b>of</b> <b>boreholes</b> owning a logging or coring information enabling a reliable interpretation. This first interpretation is based on the correlation of well log data and allows defining 3 D sequence stratigraphic framework identifying isochronous surfaces. A litho-stratigraphic interpretation is also performed. Be "A" the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> all <b>boreholes</b> used for this step (typically 3 % of the total number of holes to be validated) and "B" the other boreholes to validate, (b) Geostatistical analysis of characteristic geological interfaces. The analysis is carried out firstly on the "A" type data (to validate the variogram model), then on the "B" type data and at last on "B" knowing "A". It is based on cross-validation tests. In this step, we take into account inequality constraints provided by boreholes that do not intersect all interfaces, as well as the "litho-stratigraphic pile" defining the formations and their relationships (depositing surfaces or erosion). The goal is to identify quickly and semi-automatically potential errors among the data, up to the geologist to check and correct the anomalies, (c) Consistency tests are also used to verify the appropriateness of interpretations towards other constraints (geological map, maximal formation extension limits, digital terrain model [...] .), (d) Construction of a 3 D geological model from "A"+ "B" boreholes : continuous surfaces representation makes it possible to assess the overall consistency and to validate or invalidate interpretations. Standard-deviation maps allow visualizing areas where data from available but not yet validated boreholes could be added to reduce uncertainty, (e) At last, truncated plurigaussian facies simulations can be realized using validated data. This allows checking the 3 D consistency of interpretation. In some cases, a comparison between surfaces from sequence stratigraphy and borehole lithological information can be performed in order to check the consistency of this information faced to expected deposition environments. This step is currently in progress. First results show that this procedure can quickly identify the main errors in the data. It guarantees rationalization, reproducibility and traceability of the various stages of validation. Automation aspect is obviously important when it comes to dealing with datasets that can contain tens of thousands of surveys. For this, specific tools have been developed by BRGM (GDM/ MultiLayer software, R scripts, GIS tools) ...|$|R
40|$|Underground coal {{extraction}} causes failure and movement of overlying strata, which could also {{result in the}} dislocation <b>of</b> vertical surface <b>boreholes.</b> Investigating the correlation between the dislocation <b>of</b> surface <b>boreholes</b> and the broken of overlying strata is of great significance in deducing the mining-induced dynamic movement of overlying strata, which cannot be seen inside the ‘black box’. Field measurement, laboratory experiment and theoretical analysis were employed to study the mechanism of the mining-induced dislocation <b>of</b> surface <b>boreholes,</b> and its relationship with the movement of overlying strata. Due to different deflection angles of adjacent strata, the horizontal movement of strata varies, and this contributes primarily to the dislocation <b>of</b> <b>borehole</b> wall. As the development of strata movement from the mining level towards surface, the position <b>of</b> <b>borehole</b> dislocation also occurred upwards, and the highest borehole dislocation occurred at the same position of overlying Key Stratum (KS). In other words, when a KS breaks, borehole dislocation will occur and develop from the bottom of this KS until the bottom of an upper KS.

40|$|Understanding the {{configuration}} of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer&# 39;s water table is made difficult, in part, due to borehole deviation in aquifer wells. A borehole has deviation if it is not vertical or straight. Deviation impairs the analysis of water table elevation measurements because it results in measurements that are greater than the true distance {{from the top of the}} well to the water table. Conceptual models of the water table configuration are important to environmental management decision-making at the INEEL; these models are based on measurements of depth to the water table taken from aquifer wells at or near the INEEL. When accurate data on the amount of deviation in any given borehole is acquired, then measurements of depth-to-water can be adjusted to reflect the true depth so more accurate conceptual models can be developed. <b>Collection</b> <b>of</b> additional <b>borehole</b> deviation data with gyroscopic logging is planned for selected wells to further our confidence in the quality of water level measurements. Selection of wells for the planned logging is based on qualitative and quantitative screening criteria. An existing data set from magnetic deviation logs was useful in establishing these criteria however, are considered less accurate than gyroscopic deviation logs under certain conditions. Population distributions for 128 aquifer wells with magnetic deviation data were used to establish three quantitative screening thresholds. Qualitative criteria consisted of administrative controls, accessibility issues, and drilling methods. Qualitative criteria eliminated all but 116 of the 337 aquifer wells, in the vicinity of the INEEL, that were initially examined in this screening effort. Of these, 72 have associated magnetic deviation data; 44 do not. Twenty-five (25) of the 72 wells with magnetic deviation data have deviation greater than one of the three quantitative screening thresholds. These 25 are recommended for the planned gyroscopic borehole deviation surveying. Nineteen (19) of the 44 wells without magnetic deviation data were selected for the planned gyroscopic logging based on their location relative to facilities, site boundaries, and contaminant transport concerns. In total, 44 aquifer wells (25 with magnetic deviation data and 19 without) are recommended for planned gyroscopic logging...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Water {{levels were}} {{measured}} in boreholes spaced {{along the entire}} length of Bench Glacier, Alaska, USA, for a period in excess of 2 years. Instrumented boreholes were arranged as nine pairs along the center line of the glacier and an orthogonal grid <b>of</b> 16 <b>boreholes</b> in a 3600 m 2 region {{at the center of the}} ablation area. Diurnal fluctuations of the water levels were found to be restricted to the late melt season. Pairs <b>of</b> <b>boreholes</b> spaced along the length of the ablation area often exhibited similar fluctuations and diurnal changes in water levels. Three distinct and independent types of diurnal fluctuations in water level were observed in clusters <b>of</b> <b>boreholes</b> within the grid <b>of</b> <b>boreholes.</b> Head gradients suggest water did not flow between clusters, and a single tunnel connecting the boreholes could not explain the observed pattern of diurnal water-level fluctuations. Inter-borehole and boreholecluster connectivity suggests the cross-glacier width of influence of a segment of the drainage system connected to a borehole was limited to tens of meters. A drainage configuration whereby boreholes are connected to a somewhat distant tunnel by drainage pipes of differing lengths, often hundreds of meters, is shown with a numerical test to be a plausible explanation for the observed borehole behavior...|$|R
