5|$|By the mid-1980s, the {{flexible}} fiberoptic bronchoscope {{had become an}} indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and anesthesia communities. The digital revolution of the 21st century has brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the <b>CMOS</b> active pixel sensor (<b>CMOS</b> APS) to generate {{a view of the}} glottis so that the trachea may be intubated.|$|E
5|$|Common memory {{consisted}} of silicon <b>CMOS</b> SRAM, organized into octants of 64 banks each, {{with up to}} eight octants possible. The word size was 64-bits plus eight error-correction bits, and total memory bandwidth was rated at 128 gigabytes per second.|$|E
25|$|The {{sustaining}} amps, PLLs, and auxiliary circuits {{are built}} with standard mixed-signal <b>CMOS</b> processes fabricated in <b>CMOS</b> foundries.|$|E
25|$|A <b>CMOS</b> {{image sensor}} (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) {{is an image}} sensor {{consisting}} of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. Starting at the same point, they have to convert light into electrons by using the <b>CMOS</b> process. <b>CMOS</b> image sensors {{can be found in}} digital SLR cameras, embedded web-cams, video cameras, automotive safety systems, swallowable-pill cameras, toys and video games, and wireless video-security networks. The renowned American physicist and engineer Eric Fossum invented the <b>CMOS</b> image sensor while working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. On January 28, 1994, Fossum filed U.S. patent #5,471,515, which was issued to him on November 28, 1995.|$|E
25|$|The 68HC000, {{the first}} <b>CMOS</b> {{version of the}} 68000, was {{designed}} by Hitachi and jointly introduced in 1985. Motorola's version was called the MC68HC000, while Hitachi's was the HD68HC000. The 68HC000 was eventually offered at speeds of 8–20MHz. Except for using <b>CMOS</b> circuitry, it behaved identically to the HMOS MC68000, but the change to <b>CMOS</b> greatly reduced its power consumption. The original HMOS MC68000 consumed around 1.35watts at an ambient temperature of 25°C, regardless of clock speed, while the MC68HC000 consumed only 0.13watts at 8MHz and 0.38watts at 20MHz. (Unlike <b>CMOS</b> circuits, HMOS still draws power when idle, so power consumption varies little with clock rate.) Apple selected the 68HC000 {{for use in the}} Macintosh Portable.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (<b>CMOS)</b> process by Frank Wanlass in 1963, {{and a number of}} advances in <b>CMOS</b> technology by many workers in the semiconductor field since the work of Wanlass, have enabled the extremely dense and high-performance ICs that the industry makes today.|$|E
25|$|Integrated MEMS {{oscillators}} with <b>CMOS</b> circuits on {{the same}} IC die have been demonstrated but to date this homogeneous integration is not commercially viable. Instead, it is advantageous to produce the MEMS resonators and <b>CMOS</b> circuitry on separate die and combine them at the packaging stage. Combining multiple die in a single package {{in this way is}} called heterogeneous integration or simply die stacking.|$|E

25|$|As of 2014, NASA's Ames Research Center was {{reported}} on working on vacuum-channel transistors produced using <b>CMOS</b> techniques.|$|E
25|$|Complementary metal-oxide {{semiconductor}} (<b>CMOS)</b> {{technology has been}} the industry standard for implementing Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) devices {{for the last two}} decades, mainly due to the consequences of miniaturization of such devices (i.e. increasing switching speeds, increasing complexity and decreasing power consumption). Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) {{is only one of the}} many alternative technologies proposed as a replacement solution to the fundamental limits <b>CMOS</b> technology will impose in the years to come.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{upon the}} type of resonator, the {{fabrication}} process is either done in a specialized MEMS fab or a <b>CMOS</b> foundry.|$|E
25|$|<b>CMOS</b> op-amps (such as the CA3140E) provide {{extremely}} high input resistances, higher than JFET-input op-amps, which are normally higher than bipolar-input op-amps.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at Nanyang Technological University {{invent a}} graphene-based sensor that is 1,000 times more {{sensitive}} to light than traditional <b>CMOS</b> or CCD sensors.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (<b>CMOS)</b> logic, which uses p- and n-channel MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating {{is a major concern}} in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. <b>CMOS</b> logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. <b>CMOS</b> accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E
25|$|It has {{a shallow}} P+ implant in N type {{diffusion}} layer over a P-type epitaxial substrate layer. It {{is used in}} <b>CMOS</b> Active pixel sensor.|$|E
25|$|Production tests {{check and}} {{calibrate}} the MEMS resonators and <b>CMOS</b> ICs to verify they are performing to specification and trim their frequencies. In addition, many MEMS oscillators have programmable output frequencies {{that can be}} configured at test time. Of course {{the various types of}} oscillators are configured from specialized <b>CMOS</b> and MEMS die. For instance, low power and high performance oscillators are not built with the same die. In addition, high precision oscillators often require more careful calibration than lower precision oscillators.|$|E
25|$|Tri-state {{circuitry}} sometimes {{incorporates a}} <b>CMOS</b> MOSFET switch on its output {{to provide for}} a low-ohmic, full-range output when on, and a high-ohmic, mid-level signal when off.|$|E
25|$|R5: uses a ring {{of eight}} 5-megapixel <b>CMOS</b> cameras by Elphel with custom low-flare lenses, plus a camera with fisheye lens on top to capture upper levels of buildings.|$|E
25|$|The bipolar {{point-contact}} transistor {{was invented}} in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain {{under the direction of}} William Shockley. The junction version known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948, was for three decades the device of choice in the design of discrete and integrated circuits. Nowadays, the use of the BJT has declined in favor of <b>CMOS</b> technology in the design of digital integrated circuits. The incidental low performance BJTs inherent in <b>CMOS</b> ICs, however, are often utilized as bandgap voltage reference, silicon bandgap temperature sensor and to handle electrostatic discharge.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the method}} of {{coupling}} two complementary MOSFETS (P-channel and N-channel) into one high/low switch, known as <b>CMOS,</b> means that digital circuits dissipate very little power except when actually switched.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of photodiode arrays (PDAs) {{is that they}} allow for high speed parallel read out since the driving electronics may not be built in like a traditional <b>CMOS</b> or CCD sensor.|$|E
25|$|For {{devices of}} equal current driving capability, {{n-channel}} MOSFETs {{can be made}} smaller than p-channel MOSFETs, due to p-channel charge carriers (holes) having lower mobility than do n-channel charge carriers (electrons), and producing only one type of MOSFET on a silicon substrate is cheaper and technically simpler. These were the driving principles {{in the design of}} NMOS logic which uses n-channel MOSFETs exclusively. However, neglecting leakage current, unlike <b>CMOS</b> logic, NMOS logic consumes power even when no switching is taking place. With advances in technology, <b>CMOS</b> logic displaced NMOS logic in the mid-1980s to become the preferred process for digital chips.|$|E
25|$|The {{completed}} MEMS devices, {{enclosed in}} small chip-level vacuum chambers, are diced from their silicon wafers, and the resonator die are stacked on <b>CMOS</b> die and molded into plastic packages to form oscillators.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{structured}} products tend {{to trade}} less frequently and involve more negotiation. Prices for these more complicated MBSs, {{as well as}} for <b>CMOs</b> and CDOs, tend to be more subjective, often available only from dealers.|$|E
25|$|Asset-backed {{securities}} are bonds whose {{interest and}} principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), collateralized mortgage obligations (<b>CMOs)</b> and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).|$|E
25|$|Hoerni headed Amelco {{until the}} summer of 1963, and, after the {{conflict}} with the Teledyne owners, for three years headed Union Carbide Electronics. In July 1967, supported by the watch company Société Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlogère (the predecessor of Swatch Group) founded Intersil, the company that created the market for custom <b>CMOS</b> circuits. The circuits developed by Intersil for Seiko in 1969–1970 contributed {{to the rise of}} Japanese electronic watches. Intersil and Intel weren't competitors as Intel released a limited set of templated circuits for computers and sold them initially only in the U.S. market, whereas Intersil focused on custom <b>CMOS</b> circuits with low power consumption and sold them worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Quantum dot {{cellular}} automata (sometimes {{referred to}} simply as quantum cellular automata, or QCA) are a proposed improvement on conventional computer design (<b>CMOS),</b> {{which have been}} devised in analogy to conventional models of cellular automata introduced by von Neumann.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{multi-core}} CPUs became commercially available. Content-addressable memory (CAM) {{has become}} inexpensive {{enough to be}} used in networking, and is frequently used for on-chip cache memory in modern microprocessors, although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages. Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, <b>CMOS</b> logic gates developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a <b>CMOS</b> gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states, except for leakage.|$|E
25|$|A {{two-dimensional}} smart detector array, fabricated using a 2µm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (<b>CMOS)</b> process, {{was used}} to demonstrate full-field TD-OCT. Featuring an uncomplicated optical setup (Fig. 3), each pixel of the 58x58 pixel smart detector array acted as an individual photodiode and included its own hardware demodulation circuitry.|$|E
25|$|Intel's first 80286 chips were {{specified}} for a maximal clockrate of 4, 6 or 8MHz {{and later}} releases for 12.5MHz. AMD and Harris later produced 16MHz, 20MHz and 25MHz parts, respectively. Intersil and Fujitsu also designed fully static <b>CMOS</b> versions of Intel's original depletion-load nMOS implementation, largely aimed at battery-powered devices.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>CMOS</b> image sensors {{can often}} capture a {{high dynamic range}} from a single exposure. The wide dynamic range of the {{captured}} image is non-linearly compressed into a smaller dynamic range electronic representation. However, with proper processing, the information from a single exposure {{can be used to}} create an HDR image.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} constant of uranium dioxide is about 22, {{which is almost}} {{twice as high as}} of silicon (11.2) and GaAs (14.1). This is an advantage over Si and GaAs in construction of integrated circuits, as it may allow higher density integration with higher breakdown voltages and with lower susceptibility to the <b>CMOS</b> tunneling breakdown.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} computer types on the Voyager spacecraft, two of each kind, sometimes used for redundancy. They are proprietary, custom-built computers built from <b>CMOS</b> and TTL medium scale integrated circuits and discrete components. Total {{number of words}} among the six computers is about 32K. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the <b>CMOS</b> {{devices in}} {{pervasive}} smartphone cameras {{have been proposed}} as a practical distributed network to detect air showers from ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) which is at least comparable with that of conventional cosmic ray detectors. The app, which is currently in beta and accepting applications, is CRAYFIS (Cosmic RAYs Found In Smartphones).|$|E
25|$|The depth sensor {{consists}} of an infrared laser projector combined with a monochrome <b>CMOS</b> sensor, which captures video data in 3D under any ambient light conditions. The sensing range of the depth sensor is adjustable, and Kinect software is capable of automatically calibrating the sensor based on gameplay and the player's physical environment, accommodating {{for the presence of}} furniture or other obstacles.|$|E
25|$|These {{devices are}} {{intended}} for applications in nanoelectronic memories, computer logic and neuromorphic/neuromemristive computer architectures. In 2013, Hewlett-Packard CTO Martin Fink suggested that commercial availability of memristor memory could arrive as early as 2018. In March 2012, {{a team of researchers}} from HRL Laboratories and the University of Michigan announced the first functioning memristor array built on a <b>CMOS</b> chip.|$|E
