500|$|A view often held {{by those}} who reject the {{evidence}} for global warming is {{that much of the}} temperature increase seen in land based thermometers could be due to an increase in urbanization and the siting of measurement stations in urban areas. For example, Ross McKitrick and Patrick J. Michaels conducted a statistical study of surface-temperature data regressed against socioeconomic indicators, and concluded that about half of the observed warming trend (for 1979–2002) could be accounted for by the residual UHI effects in the <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> data set they studied—which had already been processed to remove the (modeled) UHI contribution. Critics of this paper, including Gavin A. Schmidt, have said the results can be explained away as an artifact of spatial autocorrelation. McKittrick and Nicolas Nierenberg stated further that [...] "the evidence for contamination of climatic data is robust across numerous data sets." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{tunneling}} approach beyond semiclassical approximation {{has been}} used to calculate the corrected Hawking temperature and entropy for various black holes and FRW universe model. We examine their derivations, and prove that the quantity H in the <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> is the explicit function of the only free parameter A (which is an auxiliary parameter defined by A=ħ S_BH). Our analysis improves previous calculations, and indicates that the leading order logarithmic correction to entropy is a natural result of the <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> and the first law of thermodynamics. Additionally, we apply the tunneling approach beyond semiclassical approximation to neutral black rings.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the possibility of}} infrared thermography to measure accurately the temperature of elements of a rotating device, {{within the scope of}} condition monitoring. The tested machine was a blower coupled to a 500 kW electric motor, that operated in multiples regimes. The thermograms were acquired by a fixed thermographic camera and were processed and recorded every 15 minutes. Because the normal temperature variations could easily mask a drift caused by a failure, a <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> was computed using autorecursive models. It was shown that an efficient temperature correction should compensate for the variations of the process, and for the ambient temperatures variations, either daily or seasonal. The standard deviation of the <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> was of a few tenth of degree, making possible the detection of a drift of less than one degree and the prediction of potential failure.

40|$|Radiometric {{calibration}} of satellite-acquired data {{is essential}} for quantitative scientific studies, {{as well as for}} a variety of image-processing applications. This paper describes a multiyear, on-orbit radiometric calibration of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) Band 6 conducted at DOE's Pacific Northwest Laboratory. Numerous Landsat TM scenes acquired and analyzed included day and night coverages at several geographical locations over several seasons. Concurrent with Landsat overpasses, thermal field and local meteorological (surface and radiosonde) measurements were collected. At-satellite (uncorrected) radiances and temperatures for water and nonwater land cover were compared to ground truth (GT) measurements after making adjustments for atmospheric (using LOWTRAN), mixed-pixel, and emissivity effects. Results indicate that, for both water and nonwater features, TM Band 6 average <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> determinations using local radiosonde data to adjust for atmospheric effects, and using appropriate emissivities, are within 1. 0 C of GT temperature values. Temperatures of water pixels derived from uncorrected TM Band 6 data varied roughly between 1 and 3 C of ground truth values for water temperatures ranging between 4 and 24 C. Moreover, corrections using nonlocal and noncoincident radiosonde data resulted in errors as large as 12 C. Corrections using the U. S.

These values were used to derive the standard enthalpies of formation of 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol, 2 -bromoaniline, 4 -bromoaniline, 2, 4 -dibromoaniline and 2, 4, 6 -tribromo-aniline. The enthalpies of combustion of 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol and 2, 4, 6 -tribromoaniline were measured using a rotating-bomb calorimeter. These values were used to derive the standard enthalpies of formation of 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol and 2, 4, 6 -tribromoaniline. The discrepancy between these latter standard enthalpies of formation and those found using the solution calorimetric method is discussed, and possible sources of systematic error indicated. The solution calorimetric method was adapted for the thermometric titration of phenols in aqueous solution with an aqueous solution of bromine. The sequential nature of bromination of five compounds -phenol, 2 -bromophenol, 2 -methylphenol, 3 -methylphenol and 2 -hydroxy-benzoic acid - was investigated using this technique.

40|$|The {{effects of}} copper sulfate on the {{kinetics}} of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in a sulfuric acid solution were investigated. This {{was done by}} measuring the change in temperature {{as a function of}} time in a well stirred batch reactor (vacuum flask) immersed in a temperature controlled water bath. The cooling curve when no reaction was taking place was used to determine the heat loss from the reactor. The temperature that was measured during reaction was then corrected to account for heat losses and this <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> profile corresponds to that which would be found in an effectively adiabatic reactor. The <b>corrected</b> <b>temperature</b> is related to the extent of reaction and thus by following the corrected (adiabatic) temperature profile one can monitor the extent as a function of time. It was found that at lower temperatures (below 58 C) the rate of reaction was too slow to measure in the equipment. The reaction rate was sufficiently fast so as to allow accurate measurements of temperatures when the initial temperature was increased to 67 C. Unlike what had been expected {{there was not a single}} reaction but an exothermic reaction followed by an endothermic reaction. It was shown that both the adiabatic temperature rise and fall were proportional to the amount of hydrogen peroxide added. The amount of copper sulfate present in the solution affected the exothermic part of the rate of the decomposition of peroxide. However, the amount of copper sulfate had no effect on the rate of the endothermic reaction. A simple model that had an asymptote was chosen to model the effect of the copper sulfate on the rate of the exothermic reaction and it was shown to fit the results very well. A possible explanation for the exothermic reaction followed by the endothermic reaction was proposed...|$|E
