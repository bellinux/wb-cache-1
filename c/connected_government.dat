5000|$|The story {{takes place}} in early September 1963. After {{relaxing}} following a successful mission in Jamaica, secret agent Nick Carter receives an anonymous letter asking that he return to New York City via a specific flight where the writer will contact him on the plane. On the flight Carter is contacted by stewardess Rita Jameson, who believes Carter to be a private investigator. Carter is asked to help solve the mystery surrounding a plane crash that killed Rita Jameson's pilot fiance and for {{which he has been}} named responsible. Also on board is a minor diplomat with an artificial hand. Upon disembarking in New York, the diplomat is killed by a bomb that appears to have been contained within his own artificial hand. Carter learns that [...] "the man with the steel hand" [...] is the fourth anti-Communist politician/diplomat to have been killed by explosions linked to planes in recent months. Their successors are all pro-Communist sympathizers. Rita Jameson is murdered and attempts are made on Carter's life indicating that the crash that killed Jameson's fiance and the murder of [...] "the man with the steel hand" [...] at least are <b>connected.</b> <b>Government</b> agencies around the world suspect that all 4 crashes are indeed linked and cover up the fact (prompting Jameson's independent investigation). Carter and Julia Baron are assigned to protect US Ambassador to the United Nations, Lyle Harcourt - a staunch anti-Communist - as he travels to London. On board, Carter and Baron foil a plot by a suicide bomber to set off a bomb. The would-be bomber commits suicide by poison before he can be interrogated. In London, Carter and Baron contact the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Henry Judson. However,they become suspicious of him when he probes the meaning of coded messages sent to Carter from AXE via the embassy. As they leave the embassy, Carter and Baron are knocked out and transported to the London hideout of Mr. Judas - an international terrorist who hires out his services to the highest bidder. He is currently employed by China to destabilise anti-Communist sentiment among world leaders. As they are about to be tortured and murdered by Mr. Judas and his sexually sadisdic henchman, Braille, they manage to escape, killing Braille and wounding Mr. Judas in the process. In revenge and to prevent Carter and Baron identifying him in future, Mr. Judas arranges to have Harcourt kidnapped, thereby forcing Carter and Baron to attend a potentially fatal meeting. Carter and Baron meet Mr. Judas to arrange Harcourt's release. Mr. Judas attempts to bribe Carter into planting a bomb on the US President's plane. After a struggle Mr. Judas is thwarted and Harcourt rescued. Mr. Judas escapes into the London fog.|$|E

40|$|<b>Connected</b> <b>government</b> {{implies that}} {{citizens}} and enterprises can interact with government {{as with a}} single entity rather than {{with a number of}} different public authorities. In countries characterized by a highly fragmented system of Local Government, <b>connected</b> <b>government</b> at the local level can be achieved only through a process of progressive integration on a wider area of systems of local government already integrated at the local level. In the chapter, the author argues that this process should be based on a maturity model and a reference model that define the technological and organizational conditions that allow the establishment of more and more integrated aggregations of municipalities. With reference to a study funded by the Region Lombardia (Italy), the chapter introduces the concept of Integrated System of Local Government (ISLG) and describes the process that leads to the establishment of ISLGs as an intermediate step toward <b>connected</b> <b>government</b> at the local level. Moreover, the chapter discusses the conditions that can induce different aggregations of municipalities to comply with a set of standard requirements in the implementation of their integration processes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Connected</b> <b>Government</b> {{requires}} different government {{organizations to}} connect seamlessly across functions, agencies, and jurisdictions {{in order to}} deliver effective and efficient services to citizens and businesses. In {{the countries of the}} European Union, this also involves the possibility of delivering cross-border services, which is an important step toward a truly united Europe. To achieve this goal, European citizens and businesses should be able to interact with different public administrations in different Member States in a seamless way to perceive them as a single entity. Interoperability, which is a key factor for <b>Connected</b> <b>Government,</b> is not enough in order to achieve this result, since it usually does not consider the social dimension of organizations. This dimension is at the basis of co-operability, which is a form of non-technical interoperability that allows different organizations to function together essentially as a single organization. In this chapter, it is argued that, due to their unique capacity of coupling several technologies and processes with interpersonal styles, awareness, communication tools, and conversational models, the integration of social computing services and tools within inter-organizational workflows can make them more efficient and effective. It can also support the “learning” process that leads different organizations to achieve co-operability...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} <b>connected</b> <b>government</b> is coming {{once again to}} the {{forefront}} of national development priorities around the world. This stems from the need to address various local and global necessities in light of the changing landscape of the new digital world we live in today. In a <b>connected</b> <b>government</b> context, public service agencies are needed to act as a single enterprise so that citizens feel they are being served by one organization rather than a number of different public authorities. Identity management is considered here a fundamental pillar to enable such operating models and support single sign-on (SSO) and online identity validation capabilities for e-government and e-commerce environments. This article explores and describes the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government integration strategy with relation to keeping its national identity management infrastructure (population register) updated as life events take place. The integration strategy also aims to support federal and local government entities to verify citizen and resident information using their own applications in a secure, reliable, and integrated manner. Another expected contribution of the integration platform is to support decision-making and strategic planning dimensions of government work...|$|E

40|$|Australia confronts {{challenges}} {{on a number}} of fronts – economic stability and growth, health, education, social security, water security and climate change are contemporary examples. The complexity of these challenges demands whole-of-government responses. Building on many years of experience in the successful deployment of spatial technology in government agencies, the States and the Federal government are today at various stages of adoption of whole-of-government spatial solutions. Some governments overseas are following a similar path. These whole-of-government spatial solutions are being referred to, in some quarters, as spatially enabling government (SEG), however, the concept is still evolving. This paper discusses the SEG concept and presents a methodology for investigating the state of a government's enablement based on reviews of activities in Australia and selected overseas countries.

30|$|Introduction of domesticated herbivores into {{mountain}} “wilderness” {{often is}} accompanied by ecosystem modifications either by herding one’s flock and fencing off carnivores or by eradicating the same carnivores and thereby reducing {{the complexity of the}} ecosystem. In many instances, such a simplified carnivore-free cultural landscape of mountain pastures was created in northern Scandinavia between 1700 and 1960, and many of the governance conflicts, such as the one reported in this paper, are due to poorly <b>connected</b> <b>government</b> policies after 1960, the effort to reach a win-win solution: the policy of recreating the biodiverse wilderness {{on the one hand and}} the policy of a continued modernization of the pastural industry on the other hand. The state government fragmentation in Norway (NOU 2003 : 19) becomes apparent in the governance system of the regional social-ecological system, with biodiversity conservation on the one side through the environmental department and pastoral industry rationalization through the agricultural department on the other.|$|E
40|$|Government {{investments}} in enhancing the interoperability of ICT systems {{have the potential}} to improve services and help governments respond to the diverse and often incompatible needs and interests of individual citizens, organizations, and society at large. These diverse needs and interests encompass a broad range of value propositions and demands that can seldom be met by single programs or assessed by simple metrics. The diversity of stakeholder needs and the complexity inherent in interoperable systems for <b>connected</b> <b>government</b> require an architecture that is up to the task. Such an architecture must include the reference models and components that can accommodate and integrate large portfolios of applications and support multiple kinds of performance assessments. The value propositions that underlie the architecture’s performance assessment or reference model are fundamental. The propositions must be broad enough to span the full scope of the government program’s goals, a substantial challenge. In recognition of that challenge, this chapter puts forward two perspectives for assessing the value of interoperable ICT investments, incorporating outcomes beyond financial metrics. The first is the network value approach to assessment of {{investments in}} interoperable ICT systems for government. The second 1 is the public value framework developed by the Center for Technology in Government, which expands on the network value approach to include a broader range of public value outcomes. These approaches are illustrated in two case studies: the I-Choose project designed to produce interoperable government and private sector data about a specific agricultural market and the government of Colombia’s interoperability efforts with expanded metrics based on the expansion of interoperability networks...|$|E
