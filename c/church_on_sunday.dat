He was accepted to General Theological Seminary, from which he received the degree of Master of Divinity, a requirement to becoming an Episcopal priest.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto Transit Commission {{eliminated}} all Sunday {{stops on}} June 7, 2015, as these stops slowed down streetcars {{making it more}} difficult to meet scheduled stops. Sunday stops, which served Christian churches, were deemed unfair to non-Christian places of worship, which never had the equivalent of a Sunday stop. Toronto created Sunday stops in the 1920s along its streetcar routes to help worshippers get to <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday.</b>|$|E

The students were provided with three meals a day, and were given plenty of time to sleep and play. Religious study was regularly kept up, and included <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> and praying each morning and evening every day of the week. Every night at dinner, along with singing and praying, every student had to recite a verse, or part of a verse, of Scripture from the Bible.|$|E
25|$|Faringdon {{seems to}} have taken the king's side during the divorce controversy. While Henry was searching for {{authorities}} to support his views on matrimonial laws, Faringdon sent him books which he thought would serve the purpose. He sat in Parliament from 1523 to 1539 and, in 1530, he signed, {{with other members of the}} House of Lords, a letter to the Pope pointing out the evils likely to result from delaying the divorce desired by the King; and, again in 1536, he signed the Articles of Faith drawn up in Convocation which virtually acknowledged the supremacy of the Crown over the <b>Church.</b> <b>On</b> <b>Sunday,</b> 4 November 1537, he sang the requiem and dirge for Queen Jane Seymour at St. George's Chapel, Windsor and was present at the burial on 12 November. As late as March, 1538, he was in favour, being placed in the commission of the peace for Berkshire.|$|E
25|$|Many Hollywood {{cartoons}} {{from the}} 1930s {{are based on}} feature films. Therefore, it was only natural for Leon Schlesinger's cartoon studio to parody the 1936 Warner Bros. musical film The Green Pastures, itself an adaptation of a play by Marc Connelly which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930. The Green Pastures features an all-black cast and proved a success for Warner Bros., despite generating controversy. Animator Friz Freleng had directed the short Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in 1936. The cartoon lampoons African American religious beliefs to the backdrop of jazz music and {{tells the story of}} a rural black man who shirks <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> in favor of worldly pastimes and finds himself in Hell as a result. Clean Pastures was thus keeping with his past work. Freleng even reuses animation of a jitterbugging couple from the Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in Clean Pastures. The short's use of caricatures of famous performers was in the same vein as such Freleng films as At Your Service, Madam and Coo-Coo Nut Grove.|$|E

2500|$|The Duchess of Kent was {{received}} into the Catholic Church in 1994. This {{was a personal}} decision, and she received the approval of The Queen. As she explained {{in an interview on}} BBC, [...] "I do love guidelines and the Catholic Church offers you guidelines. I have always wanted that in my life. I like to know what's expected of me. I like being told: You shall go to <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> and if you don't you're in for it!" [...] Basil Hume, then Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster and thus spiritual leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, warned the Church against triumphalism over the Duchess's conversion.|$|E
2500|$|Omar Devone Little is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the HBO drama series The Wire, portrayed by Michael K. Williams. He is a notorious Baltimore stick-up man, frequently robbing street-level drug dealers. He is legendary around Baltimore for his characteristic duster under which he hides his shotgun, large caliber handgun and bulletproof vest, {{as well as}} for his facial scar, and his habit of hauntingly whistling [...] "The Farmer in the Dell" [...] when stalking the streets. When people see or hear him approaching, they run away and will often warn others by shouting [...] "Omar comin'!" [...] Omar has a strict moral code, which involves refusal to harm innocent people or use profanity, setting him apart from other street-level characters. Also his homosexuality and privately tender nature are in obvious contrast with typical notions of masculinity attached to violent criminals. He also cares for his grandmother and is seen escorting her to <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> mornings.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his trial}} and three-year {{suspension}} from preaching, the violently anti-Presbyterian Henry Sacheverell retired to New Hall, {{the home of}} his once removed first cousin, George Sacheverell. [...] Henry Sacheverell preached a vitriolic sermon at Sutton <b>Church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> 17 October 1714, which fuelled Birmingham’s contribution to the nationwide rioting the following Wednesday, the day of King George I's coronation. [...] It also appears that, whilst residing in New Hall, he helped ferment the anti-Presbyterian [...] "Church in danger" [...] riots of July 1715, when, according to a correspondent of George Berkeley, up to 4000 rioters gathered in Birmingham, twenty-eight rioters died, and no more than three Dissenters’ meeting-houses survived in Birmingham, Worcestershire and Staffordshire. [...] The town became a temporary refuge in 1791, following the [...] "Priestley Riots" [...] in Birmingham. William Hutton, for example, whose house was attacked by protesters, decided to spend the summer in Sutton. However, local residents' fears of further rioting, forced him to move permanently to Tamworth. Joseph Priestley is said to have stayed at the 'Three Tuns' following the destruction of his home in the riots, and his initial flight to Heath-forge, Wombourne.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly Clarkson {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer. She is the {{youngest}} of three children with a brother named Jason and a sister named Alyssa. Clarkson also has two younger half brothers from her father's second marriage. Her parents divorced when she was six years old, wherein her brother went to go live with their father, her sister {{went to live with}} an aunt and she stayed with her mother. Clarkson's mother later remarried, to Jimmy Taylor. Her ancestry is Greek (from a maternal great-grandfather), Welsh, English, Irish, German, and Scottish. Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said: [...] "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I’ve always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I’ve just gotten a lot closer just because He’s the only one I can lean on." [...] She later said of her upbringing: [...] "My family was highly conservative; I had to go to <b>church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> and Wednesday." ...|$|E

He was bequeathed Hartland Abbey, Devon, by {{the will of}} his uncle [...] Paul Orchard (1739–1812) of Hartland Abbey, but never lived there as it was occupied by Orchard's widow Bettina Lawley until her death in 1833. He also owned the estates of Gallsham in Hartland and Alderscombe, Kilkhampton, Cornwall, the ancient seat of the Orchards. He married Anna Rolle Wollocombe (1781–1860), daughter of Thomas Stafford Wollocombe (1741–1814), Colonel of the Devonshire Militia and Lt-Col. of the 2nd Foot Regiment (The Queens), of Bridestowe, Devon. He is remembered for the rousing sermon he gave in Hartland <b>Church</b> <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> 21 December 1794, {{during a time of}} great fear of a possible invasion by French Revolutionaries, to the newly formed North Devon Volunteers, at the request of that regiment's Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant, his uncle Paul Orchard (1739–1812) of Hartland Abbey (by whom he was later bequeathed Hartland Abbey, and to whom he erected a monument in Hartland Church). It was published shortly afterwards at Exeter under the title The Duty of Arming for the Defence of Our Country in Time of Danger and copies were sold throughout Devon.
