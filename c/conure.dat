5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican <b>conure</b> (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E

2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{accounts}} of the Spix in captivity was given by Rev. F.G. Dutton, president of the Avicultural Society U.K. in 1900: [...] "I have not yet seen a good-tempered Spix... My Spix, which is really more a <b>Conure</b> than a Macaw, will not look at sop of any sort, except sponge cake given from one's fingers, only drinks plain water, and lives mainly on sunflower seed. It has hemp, millet, and canary, and peanuts, but I {{do not think it}} eats much of any of them. It barks the branches of the tree in which it is loose, and may eat the bark. It would very likely be all the better if it would eat bread and milk, as it might then produce some flight feathers, which it never yet has had. But I expect it would not eat any sop, even if I gave it nothing else." ...|$|E

5000|$|Old Tupi for [...] "bright macaw," [...] (ara - [...] "macaw", tinga [...] "bright") the Aratinga conures {{generally}} {{seem to have}} a more mischievous personality {{than the}} real little macaws or mini-macaws. Popular as pets, the Aratinga conures are generally larger with brighter plumage and are generally the noisier, more outgoing, more demanding of the two primary <b>conure</b> genera. The colorful sun <b>conure</b> and jenday <b>conure</b> are among the species of conures more commonly kept as pets. Many of the Aratinga species can be quite loud but otherwise can make very good pets for responsible owners. Some species, such as the dusky <b>conure,</b> brown headed <b>conure,</b> peach front <b>conure,</b> and half moon <b>conure,</b> are among the quieter Aratinga species, though they may still be loud at times. Lifespan is 20-30 years.|$|E

Sun <b>conures</b> have been seen in shrublands along the Amazon riverbank as well as forested valleys and coastal seasonally flooded forests.

50|$|The {{maroon-bellied parakeet}} (Pyrrhura frontalis) {{is a small}} parrot found from southeastern Brazil to {{north-eastern}} Argentina, including eastern Paraguay and Uruguay.

50|$|Pyrrhura is {{the other}} {{prominent}} genus of conures. These conures (with generally more green colors) include the very common green-cheeked <b>conure,</b> {{as well as the}} maroon-bellied <b>conure,</b> pearly <b>conure,</b> black-capped <b>conure,</b> painted <b>conure,</b> crimson-bellied <b>conure,</b> {{and a number of other}} species. They are usually smaller, have more subdued colors, and are much quieter than the Aratinga conures. Pyrrhura species are growing in popularity as pet birds, primarily due to their quiet nature, their affectionate and intelligent personalities, and the increasing number of color mutations developed in several of these species. On average, Pyrrhura conures live around 20 or 25 years. To reach full maturity, many of them molt to rid themselves of feathers from previous growth stages, and - occasionally - young birds pluck their feathers during the winter.|$|E

5000|$|Sun <b>conures</b> are {{currently}} endangered. Unfortunately, their population numbers are declining exponentially due to loss of habitat, hunting for plumage and being excessively wild caught -about 800,000 each year, for the pet trade. Now {{there are more}} sun <b>conures</b> living in people's homes than in the wild. Since the Wild Bird Conservation Act {{was put in place}} in 1992 to ban the importation of parrots (including sun <b>conures)</b> into the United States, they are more frequently breed in captivity for domestication purposes. Similarly, the European Union more recently banned the importation of wild caught birds in 2007. These legislations may help increase their population numbers in the wild ...|$|R
