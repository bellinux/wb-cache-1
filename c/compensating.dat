For example, a primitive externalizer may <b>compensate</b> and appear more as an internalizer. However, there are differences between an uncompensated primitiveexternalizer and a <b>compensated</b> internalizer. The <b>compensated</b> adjustment is a more tense adjustment and requires more rehearsal and more display of consistency.

40|$|Video {{compression}} {{has been}} an active research area in the last decade. Amongst many proposed methods, motion <b>compensated</b> coding has taken the most attention and taken its place in many standards (Mpeg, H. 26 L, etc…) The main difference between motion <b>compensated</b> coding and image based coding schemes such as DCT is that motion <b>compensated</b> coding exploits temporal redundancies between consecutive frames, i. e., between two frames. In this paper, we investigate 3 D methods that exploit the temporal redundancies on more than two frames. We first describe and evaluate transform based methods such as 3 D DCT, and PCA. Next, we propose a new method called volume based motion <b>compensated</b> coding. Volume based motion <b>compensated</b> coding {{is an extension of}} regular motion <b>compensated</b> coding and works on stacks of images as opposed to images. Our results indicate that, 3 D methods can provide better results than motion <b>compensated</b> coding in many of the video sequences. 1...|$|R

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals <b>compensating</b> for low recruitment rates.|$|E

A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes.
