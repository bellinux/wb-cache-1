5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption <b>column.</b> <b>Base</b> surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

25|$|For decades, {{part of the}} {{palatial}} {{complex of}} al-Sinnabra was misidentified as a Byzantine era (c. 330-620 CE) synagogue because of a <b>column</b> <b>base</b> engraved with a seven-branched candelabrum. This thesis was questioned by Ronny Reich in 1993. Donald Whitcomb suggested the complex was the qasr of al-Sinnabra in 2002, and excavations carried out in 2010 showed his analysis to be correct. Constructed in the 7th century by Mu'awiya {{and one of his}} successors, Abdel Malik, who also commissioned the building of the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem, it likely represents the earliest Umayyad complex of this type yet to be discovered.|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} paper, it is shown that story drift concentration is restraint by columns of two braced frames with pinned and fixed <b>column</b> <b>bases.</b> But embedded <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> are nearly fixed and exposed <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> are nearly pinned {{in the real}} structures. These <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> is designed as rotational springs. In this paper, the equations of the drift concentration factor for two story braced frames with <b>columns</b> <b>base</b> of rotational springs have been developed from the equilibrium conditions of the frames subjected to lateral force. This paper clarifies the relationship between drift concentration and ratio of column flexural stiffness and column rotational stiffness...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{stress of}} spherical tank and {{displacement}} of <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> were calculated by finite element method, considering the uneven gravity loads on support columns which {{was caused by}} manufacturing and setting errors. The preliminary displacement adjustment scheme for <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> was made, according to the safety range of <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> displacement which {{was determined by the}} maximum stress restricted by allowable stress at the set heat treatment temperatures. The final scheme was made after checking the preliminary scheme. The method of making adjustment scheme of <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> for a 10000 m 3 spherical tank during the whole-body heat treatment may provide a reference for other large spherical tank...|$|R
30|$|Exposed {{baseplates}} {{together with}} anchor bolts are the customary method of connection of steel structures {{to the concrete}} footings. Post-Kobe studies revealed that the embedded <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> respond better to the earthquake uplift forces. The embedded <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> also, offer higher freedom in achieving the required strength, rigidity and ductility. The paper {{presents the results of}} the pullout failure of three embedded IPE 140 sections, tested under different conditions. The numerical models are then, generated in Abaqus 6.10 - 1 software. It is concluded that, the steel profiles could be directly anchored in concrete without using anchor bolts as practiced in the exposed conventional <b>column</b> <b>bases.</b> Such embedded <b>column</b> <b>bases</b> can develop the required resistance against pullout forces at lower constructional costs.|$|R
500|$|The {{monument}} {{was restored}} twice during the Soviet era (1962 and 1980–1981). In keeping with tradition the restorations and maintenance after {{the renewal of}} Latvia's independence are financed partly by private donations. The monument underwent major restoration in 1998–2001. During this restoration the statue of Liberty and its stars were cleaned, restored and gilded anew. The monument was formally re-opened on July 24, 2001. The staircase, <b>column,</b> <b>base</b> and inside of the monument were restored, and the stone materials were cleaned and re-sealed. The supports of the monument were fixed to prevent subsidence. Although the restorers {{said at the time}} that the monument would withstand a hundred years without another major restoration, it was discovered a few years later that the gilding of the stars was damaged, due to the restoration technique used. The stars were restored again during maintenance and restoration in 2006; however, this restoration was rushed and there is no warranty of its quality.|$|E

2500|$|One simple {{retrofit}} is {{to surround}} the column with a jacket of steel plates formed and welded {{into a single}} cylinder. The space between the jacket and the column is then filled with concrete, a process called grouting. Where soil or structure conditions require such additional modification, additional pilings may be driven near the <b>column</b> <b>base</b> and concrete pads linking the pilings to the pylon are fabricated at or below ground level. In the example shown not all columns needed to be modified to gain sufficient seismic resistance for the conditions expected. (This location is {{about a mile from}} the Hayward Fault Zone.) ...|$|E
2500|$|By January 1923 the {{foundation}} was almost completed and the granite walls {{for the first}} floor were rising. [...] Work proceeded very rapidly through June. By February 1923, $1 million had been spent on constructing {{the foundation}} and walls and on landscaping. Topsoil for the landscaping came from the Earl Strong Co. of Alexandria, the grass seed from O.M. Scotts and Sons of Ohio, and other trees, shrubs, and landscaping products from C.F. Armiger of Washington, D.C. Revenues easily exceeded these expenditures, as $1.8 million had been received in donations and pledges. The same month, the GWMNMA expanded {{its board of directors}} from nine to 12. By April 1923, the foundation had been fully excavated and the foundation walls constructed. The Washington Post reported that the concrete foundation was the largest ever cast in a single piece. The foundation (of articulate girder design) was [...] in size, [...] thick, and contained [...] of concrete. Plows pulled by mules had reshaped the side of the hill into its terraced form, and most of the landscaping was now done. Total cash donations received by April 1923 totaled more than $1 million. Concrete for the first floor was poured in June 1923, and once it had set the eight green [...] granite marble columns in the atrium were set in place. [...] Each green marble column was [...] high and [...] in diameter when finished. To prevent the columns from twisting or slipping, a mortise and tenon was used. [...] A mortise approximately [...] deep was created in the floor, and a tenon carved {{on the bottom of the}} <b>column</b> <b>base.</b> A small amount of mortar, mixed with small flat discs of metal, was used to help fix the tenon into the mortise. Between the base and the first drum (or section of the column), between the drums, and between the top drum and the capital were placed wedge-shaped thin sheets of lead to inhibit slippage. By October 15, the first floor and granite outer walls were complete.|$|E
