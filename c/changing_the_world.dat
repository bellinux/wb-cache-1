5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks about giving up <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the male}} protagonists of NOW. A good person at first but is becomes twisted and evil by a {{traumatic}} incident in the first volume. Originally sent with his brothers to destroy Sashinmu's secrets upon his swordmaster's last wishes. He discovered his older brother had secretly been working for an opposing force, and was nearly killed by him. It was this brother's sword that left the scar on his cheek. Together, the two plunge into a chasm, and he barely survived unlike his brother. He acquires the Sashinmu killing technique from reading the Sashinmu book {{with the purpose of}} <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> so as to acknowledge his strength and, indirectly, his reason for existing. Yu Sae-Ha's style of Sashinmu is unique, for it utilizes negative (ice / Yin) ki instead of positive (fire / Yang) ki, as a result of him having absorbed Yhun Ah-Ran's ki. Originally starting out as a shy and timid character, Yu Sae-Ha grows obsessed with power as the story goes on, willing to do anything to become stronger. He harbors feelings for Yhun Ah-Ran.|$|E

500|$|Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork panned the release, {{saying that}} [...] " [...] life as portrayed in this {{documentary}} is cloistered and withdrawn, marked by hours of quiet Kabbalah study but very little self-reflection. Whether intentionally or not, Åkerlund reveals Madonna's supreme lack of self-awareness, from her embarrassing attempts at poetry to the condescending tone she takes with her dancers to her incredibly irresponsible visit to Rachel's Tomb despite the warnings of her host country and her security team." [...] He ended the review noting that Madonna {{did not need}} to prove anything further, since her songs [...] "have become a shared language among people who have very little common ground. Her music has been <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{for more than two decades}} now, but sadly she seems unaware of this, her one true 'secret' to pop cultural unity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{character}} of [...] "Mr. Lovewell" [...] and the album came up while the band was attempting to figure out concepts for the record. According to lead singer Bart Millard [...] "we [...] were {{trying to come up}} with the concept for our next record. For some reason, the words 'love well' got stuck in my head". Millard elaborated that [...] "we're very good, as a nation, at loving well when a massive tragedy takes place... We all of a sudden become very unified, which is a great, great thing. But on a day-to-day basis, we pass up opportunities. We look the other way, or we try to ignore. So the idea of loving well is almost a kind of 'pay it forward' that revolves around the cross". With that general idea, MercyMe was going to name the album Love Well. However, the band decided to make a character that personifies the idea of 'loving well', and came up with the character of 'Mr. Lovewell', partly inspired by The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Because of the character and the more diverse sound the album was going to have, the band felt the original name didn't fit and changed the album name to reflect the character of 'Mr. Lovewell'. Millard has described the character of 'Mr. Lovewell' as [...] "like Buddy the Elf meets Forrest Gump. He sees the good in everyone and knows his neighbors enough to know their needs. Mr. Lovewell may not be the next Billy Graham, but he’s <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> each day in every little word and deed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Between {{the years}} 1966 and 1974, {{the visual arts}} scene in Croatia expanded, as {{in the rest of}} the world, to include new media art. Minimal art, Pop-art and the {{geometric}} forms of New Tendencies combined in a new generation of artists characterized by the free spirit of 1968 and ideas about <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> They used mass media as a means to express their individual observations and views. Within Croatia, the movement was known as [...] "new art practice", stressing the importance of the artist's part in the process. The very notion of art was called into question, along with its function. Analyzing the concepts of culture, society, politics and economics led to new media as forms of expression such as photography, video, performance art, spatial interventions, and installation art. The works were most frequently conceptual or environmental, and emphasis shifted from aesthetic to ethical principles. By the mid-seventies disillusionment had set in, groups broke up, and some artists left the country.|$|E
