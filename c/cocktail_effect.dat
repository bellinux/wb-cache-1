30|$|The <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect</b> of β-glucosidase {{obtained}} from Aspergillus niger for the cellulase system {{obtained from}} T. reesei is widely known {{to enhance the}} saccharification yield of biomass resources [27]. A. tubingensis is also an excellent β-glucosidase producer [9, 28]. The crude enzyme solution from A. tubingensis KRCF 700 - 33 showed a <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect</b> along with that of T. reesei, and the highest cellulase activity (FPU) was obtained with a 25  % cocktail enzyme using optimized culture medium (Fig.  2). Although {{it is difficult to}} figure out all enzymes that contribute to the saccharification yield of sugi pulp at present, supplementing β-glucosidase certainly increases the yield.|$|E
30|$|The <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect</b> {{was also}} shown under the SSF process. SSF {{originally}} offers {{the advantage of}} avoiding end-product inhibition that affects the hydrolysis rate of cellulose, as glucose is consumed by the yeast {{as soon as it}} forms [3, 29]. The enzyme system from A. tubingensis contributed to decrease the remaining sugars in the reactant after 4  days of fermentation (Fig.  4). An enhanced hydrolysis yield due to supplementing with lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, including β-glucosidase from A. tubingensis, resulted in favorable ethanol conversion. Moreover, supplementing with the A. tubingensis enzyme system apparently promoted the liquefaction of sugi pulp as related to advanced substrate degradation. Under a high substrate concentration, a complete mixing of the content is difficult, particularly in the initial stage of the fermentation process. Regional accumulation of the end product might delay the total conversion process, thereby making efficient mixing of the reactant is very important to the conversion process. The boosted liquefaction of the reactant by the enzyme system from A. tubingensis must be {{one of the reasons for}} the effective fermentation of sugi pulp. The crude enzyme of A. tubingensis was produced using the medium optimized to T. reesei to facilitate the enzyme preparation step in this study. Further optimization of the culture conditions of A. tubingensis and a detailed investigation of the <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect</b> of these fungi will lead to an improved ethanol yield of sugi pulp.|$|E

The objective of this investigation was to assess the effect of variations in blood sample collection on measured Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), the best characterised AGE, and its homolog, Nε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (CEL). The investigation examined the effect on CML and CEL of different blood collection tubes, inclusion of a stabilising <b>cocktail,</b> <b>effect</b> of freeze thaw cycles, different storage times and temperatures, and effects of delaying centrifugation on a pooled sample from healthy volunteers. CML and CEL were measured in extracted samples by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Median CML and CEL ranged from 0. 132 to 0. 140 mM/M lys and from 0. 053 to 0. 060 mM/M lys, respectively. No significant difference was shown CML or CEL in plasma/serum samples.

40|$|High entropy alloys (HEAs) are {{multicomponent}} alloys {{based on}} the novel alloy design concept of mixing a sufficiently large number of elements (more than five) in equiatomic or near equiatomic proportion. Remarkably, despite having the presence {{of a large number of}} components, the HEAs often show rather simple crystal structures, such as FCC (e. g. equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi), BCC or FCC+BCC. This rather surprising behaviour is explained on the basis of large configurational entropy of mixing, which increases with increasing number of the alloying elements according to the relationship ∆ S = - R∑n ln ∆ S = - R∑n ln (where n is the number of elements and R is the Universal gas constant). It has been argued that large increase in the configurational entropy can sufficiently lower the free energy, thereby stabilizing the HEAs into solid solution phases with simple crystal structures. HEAs have attracted considerable research interest which have resulted in the discovery of many interesting and unique properties of these materials. The origin of these unique properties in HEAs is attributed to the core effects of multicomponent solid solution formation, including distorted lattice structure, <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect,</b> sluggish diffusion and extensive formation of deformation nano-twins...|$|E

40|$|High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are {{single-phase}} systems prepared from equimolar or near-equimolar {{concentrations of}} at least five principal elements. The combination of high mixing entropy, severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion and <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect</b> favours the formation of simple phases—usually a bcc or fcc matrix with minor inclusions of ordered binary intermetallics. HEAs have been proposed for applications in which high temperature stability (including mechanical and chemical stability under high temperature and high mechanical impact) is required. On the other hand, the major challenge to overcome for HEAs to become commercially attractive is the achievement of lightweight alloys of extreme hardness and low brittleness. The multicomponent AlCrCuScTi alloy was prepared and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning-electron microscope (SEM) and atomic-force microscope equipped with scanning Kelvin probe (AFM/SKP) techniques. Results show that the formation of complex multicomponent ternary intermetallic compounds upon heating {{plays a key role}} in phase evolution. The formation and degradation of W-phase, Al 2 Cu 3 Sc, in the AlCrCuScTi alloy plays a crucial role in its properties and stability. Analysis of as-melted and annealed alloy suggests that the W-phase is favoured kinetically, but thermodynamically unstable. The disruption of the W-phase in the alloy matrix has a positive effect on hardness (890 HV), density (4. 83 g·cm− 3) and crack propagation. The hardness/density ratio obtained for this alloy shows a record value in comparison with ordinary heavy refractory HEAs...|$|E

However, practical difficulties, such as long distances to the laboratory, generally prolong the time between euthanisation and specimen handling. For instance, tissue fixation is often performed on frozen material or on material where deterioration has started, which may affect tissue morphology. This study examined the effect of pre-fixation delay and freezing on mink testicular endpoints {{in order to determine}} robust endpoints in suboptimally handled specimens. Sexually mature farmed mink (n= 30) selected at culling were divided into six groups and subjected to different time intervals between euthanisation and fixation or freezing: 0 hours (fixed immediately post mortem), 6 hours, 18 hours, 30 hours, 42 hours, or frozen 6 hours post mortem and thawed overnight. Unaffected endpoints when pre-fixation storage was extended to 30 hours included: area and diameter of the seminiferous tubules, length and weight of the testes, and acrosomes marked with Gata- 4. Epithelial height, Sertoli cells marked with Gata- 4 and cell morphology were affected endpoints after 6 hours of storage. Freezing the tissue prior to fixation severely altered cell morphology and reduced testicular weight, tubular diameter and area. Morphological changes seen after 6 hours included shredded germ cells and excess cytoplasm in seminiferous tubular lumen, chromatin rearrangements and increased germ cell death. Extended delay before fixation and freezing affected many endpoints in the mink testicular tissue. Some of these endpoints may mimic chemically induced effects, which is important to consider when evaluating specimens from wild animals for environmental toxicity...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{beginning}} of April 2014 England again experienced “red rain”, which {{is due to}} long distant transport of Saharan dust. In 2014 this coincided with the worst air pollution episode in Southern England for more than a decade. We argue here, that when the Saharan dust episodes like this happens during spring in Northern Europe, then there is also a very large risk that this will cause a health damaging cocktail consisting of Saharan dust, aeroallergens and increased air pollution. It mainly depends on the path of the air masses. Method: We explore observations of pollen from Worcester and coastal monitoring sites in England during the episode of Saharan dust. This is combined atmospheric modelling using the weather forecast model WRF and the particle dispersion model HYSPLIT. Results: During the episode, southern air masses arrived at Worcester and the coastal sites, thus from the sea. All sites showed large amounts of birch pollen and detailed analysis at Worcester pollen grains from plants native to Southern Europe or North Africa. Foot print modelling with WRF-HYSPLIT shows that air masses pass France during their way from the area around the Mediterranean. Conclusion: During episodes of Saharan dust, then the atmosphere is in a state that favours long distance transport to an extreme degree. When the air masses pass large continental areas like Central-Northern Europe during spring, there is a good possibility that a fraction of the passed areas will have flowering birch trees. The pollen will therefore enrich the already polluted air masses and also undergo long distance transport. This will cause a <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect</b> of Saharan dust, allergenic pollen and increased air pollution in areas like England...|$|E
40|$|The eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) is {{strongly}} affected by xenobiotics (e. g endocrine disrupting chemicals), {{one of which}} is suspected to be nonylphenol (NP). The project investigates the endocrine disrupting chemical, NP, its effect on the eelpout, and how it degraded from nonylphenolethoxylates (NPE) into NP during water treatment. Scientifical literature is used to describe how NP finds its way to the aquatic environment, which kind of endocrine disrupting effect it has and how the eelpouts life and hormone cycle works. Previous studies are used to describe NP’s endocrine disrupting effects on the eelpout and other fish species. This study concludes that NP is discharged into the aquatic environment from the water treatment plant. During the water treatment NPE decomposes into NP. The non-branched chains of NP de-compose completely during aerobe process, while the branched chained NP’s are discharged to the aquatic environment and is afterwards consumed by the prey of eelpouts. Experiments show that NP in high concentrations has an effect on adult male eelpouts. This is shown by change in shape and size of the testicles. The em-bryos of the eelpout are expected to be more sensitive to endocrine disrupted chem-icals, than grown eelpouts. This is seen by deformities in the eyes, head and spine. The embryos are affected even at concentrations which has no effect on the adult eelpouts. The <b>cocktail</b> <b>effect</b> (mixture of chemicals) can contribute to an increased effect and clear/more visual deformities. In addition NP is able to bioaccumulate, so it is possible that NP has a damaging endocrine disrupting effect on its own, if the concentration is high enough...|$|E
40|$|In Germany, as {{in almost}} all {{industrial}} countries, active pharmaceutical substances can now be found in virtually all water bodies and occasionally also in drinking water. Even though the concentrations in question {{tend to be very}} low, there are initial signs of their impact on aquatic life. There is no evidence as yet of any acute consequences for human health. It is, however, impossible to rule out long-term consequences from these minimal concentrations or unexpected effects from the interaction between various active ingredients (<b>cocktail</b> <b>effect).</b> At special risk here are sensitive segments of the population such as children and the chronically ill. There is thus a need for action on precautionary grounds. The main actors in the health system are largely unaware of the problem posed by drug residues in water. Although knowledge cannot be equated with awareness – given the existence of the ‘not wanting to know' phenomenon – {{the first step is to}} generate a consolidated knowledge base. Only by creating awareness of the problem can further strategies be implemented to ultimately enlighten and bring about behavioural change. At stake here is the overall everyday handling of medications, including prescription, compliance, and drug-free disease prevention down to the doctor-patient relationship. The latter, namely, is often characterised by misunderstandings and a lack of communication about the – supposed – need to prescribe drugs. The first part of the strategy for the general public involves using various channels and media to address three different target groups. These were identified by ISOE in an empirical survey as reacting differently to the problem under review: · ‘The Deniers/Relativists' · ‘The Truth-Seekers' · ‘The Hypersensitives' The intention is to address each target group in the right tone and using the most suitable line of reasoning via specific media and with the proper degree of differentiation. The ‘Truth-Seekers' play an opinion-leading role here. They can be provided with highly differentiated information through sophisticated media which they then pass on to their dialogue partners in an appropriate form. The second part of the strategy for the general public relates to the communication of proper disposal routes for expired drugs. The goal is to confine disposal to pharmacies so that on no account are they flushed down the sink or toilet. Based on an analysis of typical errors in existing communications media on this topic, ISOE prepared recommendations for drafting proper information materials. In addressing pharmacists, the first priority is to convey hard facts: to this end we propose a PR campaign to place articles in the main specialist media. At the same time, the subject should feature in training and continuing education programmes. Another aim is to strengthen the advisory function of the pharmacies. The environmentally sensitive target group would indeed react positively to having their attention drawn to the issue of drug residues in water. For all other customers, the pharmacists can and should act as consultants: they emphasise how important it is to take medication as instructed (compliance) and use suitable pack sizes, and warn older customers in particular about the potential hazards of improper drug intake. The first stage of the communications strategy for doctors likewise revolves around knowledge. Here, however, it is important to take into account their self-image as scientists while in fact having little grasp of this specific area. The line to take is that of ‘discursive selfenlightenment'. This means that the issue of drug residues in water cannot be conveyed to doctors by laymen but must be taken up and imparted via the major media of the medical profession and by medical association officials (top-down). The second stage, namely that of raising doctors’ awareness of the problem, is likely to encounter strong resistance from some of the medical profession. They may fear a threat of interference in treatment plans from an environmental perspective and feel the need to emphasise that doctors are not responsible for environmental issues. As shown in empirical surveys by ISOE, such a defensive reaction is ultimately down to an underlying taboo: people are loath to discuss the over-prescription taking place in countless doctors' surgeries. And it is a fact that this problem cannot be tackled from the environmental perspective, although the goals of water protection are indeed consistent with the economic objectives of restraint in the deployment of drugs. Any communications measure for this target group has to bear in mind that doctors feel restricted by what they see as a ‘perpetual health reform' no matter which government is in power. On no account are they prepared to tolerate any new form of regulation, in this case for environmental reasons. An entirely different view of the problem is taken by ‘critical doctors' such as specialists in environmental health and those with a naturopathic focus. They are interested in the problem because they see a connection between the quality of our environment and our health. What is more, they have patients keen to be prescribed as few drugs as possible and who are instead interested in ‘talking medicine'. So, any communication strategy intent on tackling the difficult problem of oversubscribing drugs needs to look carefully at the experiences of these medical professionals and also at a ‘bottom-up strategy'. Implementation of strategic communications should be entrusted to an agency with experience in ‘issue management'. Knowledge of social marketing and the influencing of behaviour are further prerequisites. All important decisions should be taken by a consensus committee (‘MeriWa' 1 round table), in which the medical profession, pharmacists and consumers are represented. In Deutschland und in fast allen Industrieländern finden sich mittlerweile Medikamentenwirkstoffe in nahezu allen Gewässern und vereinzelt auch im Trinkwasser. Auch wenn die Konzentrationen in der Regel sehr gering sind, lassen sich erste Anzeichen für Auswirkungen auf Wasserlebewesen nachweisen. Akute Folgen für die menschliche Gesundheit sind bisher nicht erwiesen. Es kann allerdings nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass sich Langzeitfolgen dieser Niedrigstkonzentrationen entwickeln und unerwartete Effekte durch die Wechselwirkung zwischen verschiedenen Wirkstoffen (Cocktaileffekt) entstehen. Besonders gefährdet sind dabei sensible Bevölkerungsgruppen wie Kinder und chronisch Kranke. Es besteht daher nicht zuletzt aus Vorsorgegründen Handlungsbedarf. Das Problem der Medikamentenreste im Wasser ist bei den wichtigsten Akteuren des Gesundheitssystems weitgehend unbekannt. Auch wenn Wissen nicht mit Bewusstsein gleichgesetzt werden kann – denn es gibt auch das Phänomen des Nicht-Wissen-Wollens – geht es in einem ersten Schritt darum, fundiertes Wissen zu erzeugen. Nur auf Basis dieser Sensibilisierung können weitere Strategien umgesetzt und letztendlich Aufklärung und Verhaltensänderungen erreicht werden. Dabei geht es um die gesamte Alltagspraxis im Umgang mit Medikamenten. Diese umfasst Fragen der Verschreibung, der Compliance, der nichtmedikamentösen Krankheitsvorsorge bis hin zum Arzt-Patienten-Verhältnis. Das ist nämlich häufig von Missverständnissen und mangelnder Kommunikation über – vermeintliche – Verschreibungsnotwendigkeiten geprägt. Der erste Teil der Strategie für die Bevölkerung soll über unterschiedliche Kanäle und Medien drei unterschiedliche Zielgruppen ansprechen, die in einer empirischen Untersuchung vom ISOE identifiziert wurden und auf das angesprochene Problem ganz unterschiedlich reagieren: · ‚Die Verleugner/Relativierer‘ · ‚Die Aufklärungsinteressierten‘ · ‚Die Hypersensiblen‘ Jede Zielgruppe soll in der passenden sprachlichen und argumentativen Art und Weise durch spezifische Medien und mit dem richtigen Grad der Differenziertheit angesprochen werden. Dabei spielen „die Aufklärungsinteressierten“ eine Opinionleader-Rolle. Sie können über anspruchsvolle Medien mit sehr differenzierten Informationen versorgt werden und geben dieses Wissen dann in angemessener Form an ihre Gesprächspartner weiter. Der zweite Teil der Strategie für die Bevölkerung bezieht sich auf die Kommunikation richtiger Entsorgungswege für Altmedikamente. Ziel ist es, dass Medikamentenreste nur noch in der Apotheke, keinesfalls aber in der Spüle oder in der Toilette entsorgt werden. Auf Grundlage einer Analyse typischer Fehler in bereits bestehenden Kommunikationsmedien zu diesem Thema hat das ISOE Empfehlungen zur richtigen Konzeption von Infomaterialien erarbeitet. Bei der Ansprache der Apotheker geht es in einem ersten Schritt um die Vermittlung von Faktenwissen: Wir schlagen dazu eine PR-Kampagne vor, die Artikel in den wichtigsten Fachmedien platziert. Gleichzeitig soll das Thema auch Teil der Aus- und Fortbildung werden. Zusätzlich soll die Beraterfunktion der Apotheken gestärkt werden. Die spezielle Zielgruppe der umweltsensiblen Kunden würde durchaus positiv darauf reagieren, wenn sie auf die Problematik der Medikamentenreste im Wasser hingewiesen würde. Bei allen anderen Kunden können und sollen die Apotheker ihre Rolle als Berater wahrnehmen: Sie betonen, wie wichtig die korrekte Einnahme (Compliance) und adäquate Packungsgrößen sind und warnen ihre Kunden, insbesondere die älteren, auch vor potenziellen Fehleinnahmen. Bei der Kommunikationsstrategie für Ärzte geht es im ersten Schritt ebenfalls um Wissen. Dabei muss aber deren Selbstverständnis als Wissenschaftler bei gleichzeitig niedrigem Wissensstand in diesem speziellen Feld berücksichtigt werden. Hier muss der Weg einer ‚diskursiven Selbstaufklärung‘ beschritten werden. Das Thema Medikamentenreste im Wasser kann somit nicht von Laien von außen an die Ärzte herangetragen werden, sondern muss in wichtigen Medien der Ärzteschaft und durch Verbandsfunktionäre angenommen und kommuniziert werden (top-down). Wenn es im zweiten Schritt um eine Problemsensibilisierung geht, muss mit starkem Widerstand eines Teils der Ärzteschaft gerechnet werden. Sie könnten fürchten, dass eine Einmischung in Heilungspläne aus Umweltsicht droht und betonen, dass Ärzte nicht für Umweltfragen zuständig seien. Letztlich steht – das haben empirische Untersuchungen des ISOE gezeigt – hinter dieser Problemabwehr ein Tabu: Es soll nicht darüber gesprochen werden, dass in zahlreichen Praxen zu viel verschrieben wird. Diese Problematik kann tatsächlich nicht aus der Umweltperspektive angegangen werden. Doch decken sich hier die Ziele des Gewässerschutzes mit den ökonomischen Zielen eines sparsamen Umgangs mit Arzneimitteln. Bei jeder Kommunikationsmaßnahme für diese Zielgruppe muss berücksichtigt werden, dass sich die Ärzte von dem, was sie als ‚Dauergesundheitsreform‘ aller Regierungen wahrnehmen, gegängelt fühlen. Sie sind keinesfalls bereit, eine neue Form der Regulierung, diesmal aus Umweltgründen, hinzunehmen. Ganz anders wird das Problem von ‚kritischen Ärzten‘ wie Umweltmedizinern und von Ärzten mit Naturheilschwerpunkt gesehen. Sie interessieren sich für die Problematik, weil sie einen Zusammenhang zwischen Umweltqualität und Gesundheit sehen. Außerdem haben sie Patienten, die an möglichst wenig Medikamentenverschreibungen, dafür aber an einer ‚sprechenden Medizin‘ interessiert sind. Wenn eine Kommunikationsstrategie also auch das schwierige Problem der übermäßigen Verschreibungen angehen will, empfiehlt es sich, die Erfahrungen dieser Mediziner einzubeziehen und zusätzlich auf eine ‚Bottom-up-Strategie‘ abzuzielen. Mit der Umsetzung der strategischen Kommunikation sollte eine Agentur beauftragt werden, die Erfahrungen im ‚Issue Management‘ vorweisen kann. Weiterhin sollte die Agentur Kenntnisse im Social Marketing und der Beeinflussung von Verhalten haben. Alle wichtigen Entscheidungen sollten von einem Konsens-Gremium (Runder Tisch ‚MeriWa‘ 1) verabschiedet werden, in dem die Ärzteschaft, die Apotheker sowie die Verbraucherinnen und Verbraucher angemessen repräsentiert sind...|$|E

All ecotoxicological studies were voluntarily excluded. <b>Cocktail</b> <b>effects</b> were classified according to how they had been classified by each author. The frequency of the various <b>cocktail</b> <b>effects</b> and the classes and chemical families of pesticides involved in the observed effects were assessed. When focusing on the function of pesticides (i. e. herbicide, insecticide or fungicide), 46 % of the mixtures contained insecticides alone, 15 % fungicides alone, and 4. 5 % herbicides alone. Mixtures with effects associated with neurotoxicity were mainly composed of insecticides, and most studies {{on the effects of}} fungicide mixtures (90 %) were associated with effects on endocrine regulation and/or reproduction. Dose addition was observed with each kind of mixture except herbicide combinations. In contrast, synergic interactions or greater-than-additive effects were mainly reported for insecticide mixtures. There were few examples of potentiating and antagonistic interactions. We have identified chemical families of compounds specifically involved in synergy, addition, potentiation and antagonism, and those that do not interact when combined. The chemical families identified as being involved in synergy are in agreement with data from another recently published compilation of ecotoxicological studies. For most mixtures investigated, further validation data is still needed from experiments using other compounds and other experimental models but this update provides useful information to help in human health risk assessments...|$|R

One example of ASA is the so-called <b>cocktail</b> party <b>effect</b> [2, 3], which describes the human ability to follow a conversation with a single target speaker while other interfering speakers are active. The <b>cocktail</b> party <b>effect</b> is a major area of hearing research, and many important factors that are part of human ASA have been identified.

Thus it follows that our proper name is detected even under conditions of low attention. What happens within outer speech during a cocktail-party, likewise occurs within inner speech in dreams. Code words - linked in sound to our proper name - will be detected in the set of potential associations during thinking. The ongoing thinking process will then deviate because code words will act as priming-words, influencing the direction in which associations will go (Engels, 2005, p. 187).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Human mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) have the {{potential}} to differentiate into nucleus pulposus (NP) -like cells under specific stimulatory conditions. Thus far, the effects of bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP 3) and the <b>cocktail</b> <b>effects</b> of BMP 3 and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β on MSC proliferation and differentiation remain obscure. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} clarify these unknowns. MSCs were cultured with various gradients of BMP 3 and BMP 3 /TGF-β, and compared with cultures in basal and TGF-β media. Cell proliferation, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, gene expression, and signaling proteins were measured to assess the effects of BMP 3 and BMP 3 /TGF-β on MSCs. Cell number and GAG content increased upon the addition of BMP 3 in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of COL 2 A 1, ACAN, SOX 9, and KRT 19 increased following induction with BMP 3 and TGF-β, in contrast to that of COL 1 A 1, ALP, OPN, and COMP. Smad 3 phosphorylation was upregulated by BMP 3 and TGF-β, but BMP 3 did not affect the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Our results reveal that BMP 3 enhances MSC proliferation and differentiation into NP-like cells, as indicated by increased cell numbers and specific gene expressions...|$|R

Furthermore, studies have shown that by utilizing audio, the perceived quality of lower quality visual displays can increase [6]. Likewise, researchers from neuroscience and psychology {{have been interested}} in the multimodal perception of the auditory and visual senses [7]. Studies have been addressing issues such as how the senses interact, which influences they have on each other (predominance), and audio-visual phenomena such as the <b>cocktail</b> party <b>effect</b> [8] and the ventriloquism effect [9].|$|R
50|$|During {{a real-life}} conversation, sounds follow a complex journey before {{reaching}} the listener's ears for decoding by the brain. The human brain analyses the sounds and all their alterations to determine the source's position in the room. This enables the brain to know instantly who the speaker is, even without recognizing his voice or seeing the speaker. In a crowded room with lots of background noise, the brain can isolate specific sounds and can focus on decoding the information or voice that matters while disregarding the others, a phenomenon also called the <b>cocktail</b> party <b>effect.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} using two or more {{microphones}} to enhance speech corrupted by nonstationary noise, such as that of a competing speaker (<b>cocktail</b> party <b>effect)</b> at very low SNR, by means of linear filtering of two microphone signals. This work is a variant to the probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method but using a more accurate probability distribution of the speech signal based on a mixture Autoregressive model. Comparison with other algorithms on published real recordings shows more separation than with previously existing ICA algorithms. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{superior}} temporal gyrus (STG) {{is important}} for language comprehension, but studies also suggest that it plays a functional role in the <b>cocktail</b> party <b>effect.</b> A magnetoencephalography study was conducted on participants that were exposed to five differing listening conditions each with a different level of background noise. It was discovered that the STG has a strong connection with the attended speech stream in a cocktail party setting. When the attended speech stream wasn’t disrupted by background noise a bilateral connection was displayed, but as more background noise was introduced the connection became left-hemisphere-dependent.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>cocktail</b> party <b>effect</b> is the {{phenomenon}} {{of being able to}} focus one's auditory attention on a particular stimulus while filtering out a range of other stimuli, as when a partygoer can focus on a single conversation in a noisy room. This effect is what allows most people to [...] "tune into" [...] a single voice and [...] "tune out" [...] all others. It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance originating from unattended stimuli, for instance hearing one's name in another conversation.|$|R
