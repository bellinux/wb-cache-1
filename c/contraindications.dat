5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. <b>Contraindications</b> include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative <b>contraindications.</b>|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids {{have been}} found to be as {{effective}} as NSAIDs and may be used if <b>contraindications</b> exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.|$|E
5|$|No <b>contraindications</b> {{are known}} for this examination. Ultrasonography does not involve the use of {{ionizing}} radiation, and the procedure is harmless and can be safely used on anybody of any age. A World Health Organization report published in 1998 supports this.|$|E

5000|$|In medicine, a <b>contraindication</b> is a {{condition}} or factor {{that serves as a}} reason to withhold a certain medical treatment due to the harm that it would cause the patient. [...] <b>Contraindication</b> is the opposite of indication, which is a reason to use a certain treatment.|$|R
5|$|Surgery {{carries a}} high risk of complications, and is {{typically}} only offered in case of inexorable deterioration or <b>contraindications</b> to any of the other treatments. Various arterial repair procedures have been described.|$|E
5|$|The few <b>contraindications</b> {{to surgery}} include {{inoperable}} tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These <b>contraindications</b> happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all <b>contraindications</b> and precautions.|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{block to}} the lower {{extremity}} despite relative <b>contraindication</b> (two cases) Peripheral nerve blocks can provide a number of advantages in high-risk patients and may sometimes be preferred despite relative <b>contraindication.</b> Our first case had relative <b>contraindication</b> due to being confused, with a Glasgow coma score of 10, and our second case due {{to the presence of}} bacteremia, and also the anti-platelet treatment he was receiving. In this case report we describe our experience with peripheral nerve block {{to the lower}} extremity in two high-risk patients with relative <b>contraindication.</b> Block with the classic Winnie approach (3 - 1) and anterior sciatic nerve block with the Meier method were applied in both cases, with lateral femoral cutaneous block being additionally performed in the second case. No complications were observed...|$|R

5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous <b>contraindications</b> to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor <b>contraindications</b> of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>contraindications</b> to {{androgen}} therapy exist. An absolute medical contraindication is pregnancy.|$|E

50|$|Although {{it varies}} from patient to patient, a {{progressive}} neurological or medical disease {{might be an}} absolute or relative <b>contraindication</b> to corpus callosotomy. Intellectual disability is not a <b>contraindication</b> to corpus callosotomy. In a study of children with a severe intellectual disability, total callosotomy was performed with highly favorable results and insignificant morbidity.|$|R

40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} {{estrogen}} dependent {{and has been}} considered as a <b>contraindication</b> for HRT. Some uncontrolled studies reported no increase in recurrence in women who received ERT after they had suffered early stage endometrium cancer and many opinion leaders have mandated that early uterus cancer {{should not be considered}} as an absolute <b>contraindication</b> to HRT.

50|$|Previously atrovent inhalers used {{chlorofluorocarbon}} (CFC) as a propellant {{and contained}} soy lecithin in the propellant ingredients. In 2008 all CFC inhalers were phased out and hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) inhalers replaced them. Allergy to peanuts was noted for the inhaler as a <b>contraindication</b> {{but now is}} not. It {{has never been a}} <b>contraindication</b> when administered as a nebulized solution.|$|R
50|$|Thrombolysis is {{not without}} risks. Therefore, clinicians must select {{patients}} who are to be best suited for the procedure, {{and those who have}} the least risk of having a fatal complication. An absolute <b>contraindication</b> is in itself enough to avoid thrombolysis, while a relative <b>contraindication</b> needs to be considered in relation to the overall clinical situation.|$|R
25|$|There are few <b>contraindications</b> to {{bone marrow}} examination. It is {{important}} to note that thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders are not <b>contraindications</b> as long as the procedure is performed by a skilled clinician. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can be safely performed even in the setting of extreme thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). If there is a skin or soft tissue infection over the hip, a different site should be chosen for bone marrow examination.|$|E
