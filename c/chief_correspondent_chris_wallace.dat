50|$|Way Too Early was an American {{morning news}} show which aired weekday mornings on MSNBC. It premiered on July 27, 2009 hosted by Willie Geist. It {{has since been}} hosted {{by a variety of}} NBC News on-air talent {{including}} Thomas Roberts and others on a temporary basis, including Ayman Mohyeldin. The final host was <b>Chief</b> White House <b>Correspondent</b> <b>Chris</b> Jansing. It ended August 5, 2016, as its lead-in program First Look was expanded back into the full hour and re-branded as Morning Joe First Look to build continuity with the later program, and presumably because the timeslot is now nearly universally programmed as a morning news slot on local television stations in both the Eastern and Central Time Zones, making the title Way Too Early an artifact.|$|R

40|$|Dedicated to <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace</b> on the {{occasion}} of his 70 th birthday. We outline some of <b>Chris</b> <b>Wallace's</b> contributions to pseudo-random number generation. In partic-ular, we consider his recent idea for generating normally distributed variates without relying on a source of uniform random numbers, and compare it with more conventional methods for generat-ing normal random numbers. Implementations of Wallace's idea can be very fast (approximately as fast as good uniform generators). We discuss the statistical quality of the output, and mentionhow certain pitfalls can be avoided...|$|R
