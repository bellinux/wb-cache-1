50|$|<b>Conessine</b> is a steroid {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} a number of plant species from the Apocynaceae family, including Holarrhena floribunda, Holarrhena antidysenterica and Funtumia elastica. It acts as a histamine antagonist, selective for the H3 subtype (with an affinity of pKi = 8.27; Ki = ~5 nM). It was also found to have long CNS clearance times, high blood-brain barrier penetration and high affinity for the adrenergic receptors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Conessine,</b> a steroidal {{alkaloid}} {{isolated from}} Holarrhena floribunda, has anti-malarial activity and {{interacts with the}} histamine H 3 receptor. However, the cellular effects of <b>conessine</b> are poorly understood. Accordingly, we evaluated the involvement of <b>conessine</b> in the regulation of autophagy. We searched natural compounds that modulate autophagy, and <b>conessine</b> was identified as an inhibitor of autophagic flux. <b>Conessine</b> treatment induced the formation of autophagosomes, and p 62, an autophagic adapter, accumulated in the autophagosomes. Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) result in muscle cell death by inducing excessive autophagic flux. Treatment with <b>conessine</b> inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced autophagic flux in C 2 C 12 myoblast cells and also interfered with cell death. Our results indicate that <b>conessine</b> has the potential effect to inhibit muscle cell death by interfering with autophagic flux...|$|E
40|$|The cultivation, <b>conessine</b> {{content and}} {{harvesting}} methodology for Holarrhena floribunda were investigated. Allometric measurements are proposed as prediction tools for estimation of trunk total productions of bark and <b>conessine.</b> A linear relationship found between stem diameter and bark <b>conessine</b> content allowed {{the establishment of}} log-log correlations between trunk circumference and trunk production of bark and <b>conessine.</b> Harvesting of a five years old culture by a coppicing method could be estimated at 976 kg/ha of stem bark and 7. 8 kg/ha of <b>conessine.</b> Stems of diameter < 0. 5 cm present little interest for alkaloid production and should be discarded. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|The {{methanolic}} extract and <b>conessine</b> {{isolated from}} the stem bark of Holarrhena floribunda (Hf) were tested for their antibacterial activities on Bacillus: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus stearothermophilus using the disc diffusion method. Phytochemical analysis of the crude extract and fractions was also conducted. The inhibition parameters of the crude methanol extract and the total alkaloid fraction were determined using the macrodilution method. The {{results showed that the}} crude extract, the total alkaloid fraction and <b>conessine</b> exhibited a significant antibacterial effect against all the strains studied. The antibacterial effect of <b>conessine</b> is almost similar to that of chloramphenicol used as reference. The ratio of the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) over the minimal inhibitive concentration (MIC) indicates the bactericidal effect of the plant. These results support common use of stem bark of Hf and <b>conessine</b> isolated from Hf in the treatment of some infectious diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the antioxidant effect of the methanolic extract, its alkaloidal and non-alkaloidal fractions along with petroleum ether soluble, ether soluble and ethyl acetate soluble sub-fractions of non-alkaloidal part of the bark of Holarrhena pubescens.

40|$|Various {{alkaloids}} {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} bark and seeds of Holarrhena antidysenterica since the early investigations of Haines in 1858 (1) when <b>conessine,</b> the main alkaloid was first obtained. Recently an additional alkaloid to which it has been proposed to apply the name norconessine has been isolated by Dr. R. D. Haworth (2) to whom I am indebted for the supply of the drug used in this present investigation. The following is {{a summary of the}} main chemical features as found by him. A light petroleum extract of the seeds of Holar-rhena antidysenterica contains <b>conessine</b> (3, 4) and a new base C 23 HN 2, for which the name norconessine is suggested. This new base was separated from <b>conessine</b> by fractional crystallisa-tion of the hydrogen oxalates. Norconessine is an oil boiling point 240 #{ 176 }/ 0. 7 mm. containing three methylimino groups, and is slightly dextrorotatory in alcoholic solution. It is dibasic and the salts, of which the hydrogen oxalates, nodules melting point 225 #{ 176 }C. (dec.) and the dihydrochloride, slender needles, melting point 340 #{ 176 }(dec.) have been obtained crystalline, are readily soluble in alcohol and water. In chemical properties norconessine resembles <b>conessine.</b> Norconessine appears to be identical with kurchine, one of the bases obtained from the bark of Holarrhena anti-dysenterica by Ghosh and Ghosh (5), and described more fully by Ghosh and Bose (6). As a result of the close chemical similarities of <b>conessine</b> and norconessine it was considered that it might be of interest to see whether this similarity extended to their pharmacological properties. The dihydrochloride of norconessine was the salt used throughout this investigation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A rapid, simple, {{sensitive}} and reproducible RP-HPLC method {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>conessine</b> (bioactive steroidal alkaloid) in Holarrhena pubescens, a highly valued medicinal plant extensively used in pharmaceuticals. Separation was achieved on Discovery (R) RP Amide C 16 Supelco column (250 µm x 4. 6 µm ID) using a mobile phase of acetonitrile: water (95 : 5 v/v) with flow rate 0. 6 ml / min detection at λ 210 nm. Assessments of six extraction techniques were also performed to evaluate the <b>conessine</b> content and further {{the efficiency of the}} extracts against bacterial strains was tested to address causative relationship between the both. The method was linear over a concentration range of 2. 5 - 20 µg/ml (r 2 = 0. 9991). Accuracy, precision and repeatability were all within the required limits. The mean recoveries measured at the three concentrations were higher than 98. 8 % with RSD< 2 %.

30|$|Holarrhena antidysenterica is a {{tropical}} plant which grows up to 5 m in height. The bark extract of this plant {{is used in}} ayurvedic and homoeopathic systems of medicine {{for the treatment of}} tropical diarrhoeas and dysentery. It belongs to Apocynaceae family. Around 30 alkaloids have been isolated from the plant, mostly from the bark. These include <b>conessine,</b> kurchine, kurchicine, holarrhimine, conarrhimine, conaine, conessimine, iso-conessimine, conimine, holacetin and conkurchin [1]. It is a well-known drug for amoebic dysentery and other gastric disorders. It is also indicated for the treatment of diarrhoea, indigestion, flatulence and colic [2]. Homoeopathic system of medicine uses ethanolic extracts, called as mother tincture, and their dilutions (potencies). As per the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of India standard, the drug strength is 1 / 10. Since there is no standardization criterion for the particle size of the tincture, the experimentation was carried out by changing the particle size of the tincture, and size-related effects were compared in vitro.|$|E
40|$|N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is {{a potent}} {{carcinogen}} and can be produced during chloramination of drinking water and wastewater. Computational chemistry methods {{were used for the}} first time to calculate molecular descriptors for 64 NDMA precursors containing a dimethylamine (DMA) moiety. Descriptors were partial charge, bond length and pKa of the DMA nitrogen and planarity of the DMA group. Precursors classified on the basis of chemical functionality showed distinct relationships between partial charge and NDMA formation. Quaternary amines and tertiary amines with the DMA bonded to -COR and -CSR groups had a combination of low NDMA formation and high partial charge. The most potent NDMA precursors are tertiary amines with an acidic hydrogen and electron-donating group α and β to the DMA respectively. They also have comparable molecular descriptors: relatively negative partial charges, low planarity values, high bond lengths and pKa values from ∼ 8. 3 – 10. 1. A literature search identified 233 potential NDMA precursors that have never been tested experimentally. Of these chemicals 60 % are therapeutics, 13 % veterinary therapeutics and 10 % natural products. Analysis combining qualitative assessment of chemical functionality and computational calculation of molecular descriptors successfully identified rivastigmine, a therapeutic, and <b>conessine,</b> a naturally occurring species, whose NDMA yields were determined experimentally to be 83. 3 ± 0. 5 % and 42. 3 ± 1. 8 % mol mol− 1, respectively. This study defines the molecular properties associated with reactive NDMA precursors and the origin and identity of those amines which contribute to NDMA formation in drinking water...|$|E
40|$|DMNG- 3 (3 β-Methyl-[2 -(4 -nitrophenoxy) ethyl]-amino]con- 5 -enine), {{is a new}} and the {{potentially}} most potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor recently obtained from <b>conessine</b> by N-demethylation and nucleophilic substitution reaction. In the present study, a step‑down passive avoidance {{test was used to}} investigate whether DMNG- 3 could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine, and a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the determination of DMNG- 3 in biological samples was applied to study its pharmacokinetics and tissues distribution. Separation was achieved on C 18 column using a mobile phase consisting methanol‑water (70 : 30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min. The intra- and inter-day precisions were good and the RSD was all lower than 1. 30 %. The mean absolute recovery of DMNG- 3 in plasma ranged from 88. 55 to 96. 45 %. Our results showed oral administration of DMNG- 3 (10, 25, 50 mg/kg/day) can significantly improve the latency and number of errors and had a positive effect of improvement of learning and memory in mice in passive avoidance tests. The elimination half-life (T 1 / 2) was 14. 07 ± 1. 29, 15. 87 ± 1. 03 h, and the total clearance (CL) values were 0. 70 ± 0. 11, 0. 78 ± 0. 13 L/h/kg, respectively. The pharmacokinetic studies showed that DMNG- 3 has a slowly clearance and large distribution volume in experimental animals, and its disposition is linear over the range of doses tested. The liver, small intestine, stomach, and large intestine were the major distribution tissues of DMNG- 3 in mice. It was found that DMNG- 3 could be detected in brain, suggesting that DMNG- 3 can cross the blood-brain barrier. The present study shows that DMNG- 3 can be possible developed as a new drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the future...|$|E
40|$|In our {{continued}} {{search for}} natural compounds with activity against Trypanosoma brucei, causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, "sleeping sickness"), we have investigated extracts from {{the leaves and}} bark of the West African Holarrhenaafricana (syn. Holarrhena floribunda; Apocynaceae). The extracts and their alkaloid-enriched fractions displayed promising in vitro activity against bloodstream forms of T. brucei rhodesiense (Tbr; East African HAT). Bioactivity-guided chromatographic fractionation of the alkaloid-rich fractions resulted in the isolation of 17 steroid alkaloids, one nitrogen-free steroid and one alkaloid-like non-steroid. Impressive activities (IC 50 in µM) against Tbr were recorded for 3 β-holaphyllamine (0. 40 ± 0. 28), 3 α-holaphyllamine (0. 37 ± 0. 16), 3 β-dihydroholaphyllamine (0. 67 ± 0. 03), N-methylholaphyllamine (0. 08 ± 0. 01), conessimine (0. 17 ± 0. 08), <b>conessine</b> (0. 42 ± 0. 09), isoconessimine (0. 17 ± 0. 11) and holarrhesine (0. 12 ± 0. 08) with selectivity indices ranging from 13 to 302. Based on comparison of the structures of this congeneric series of steroid alkaloids and their activities, structure-activity relationships (SARs) could be established. It was found that a basic amino group at position C- 3 of the pregnane or pregn- 5 -ene steroid nucleus is required for a significant anti-trypanosomal activity. The mono-methylated amino group at C- 3 represents an optimum for activity. ∆(5, 6) unsaturation slightly increased the activity while hydrolysis of C- 12 β ester derivatives led {{to a loss of}} activity. An additional amino group at C- 20 engaged in a pyrrolidine ring closed towards C- 18 significantly increased the selectivity index of the compounds. Our findings provide useful empirical data for further development of steroid alkaloids as a novel class of anti-trypanosomal compounds which represent a promising starting point towards new drugs to combat human African trypanosomiasis...|$|E
