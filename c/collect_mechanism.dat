40|$|In a {{multicasting}} application it {{is often}} desirable for a source to get information {{on the status of}} receivers. We call this operation a collect. In large scale groups it is not feasible to have individual messages flowing from each receivers to the source. We present a collect using a hierarchical control structure which progressively aggregates data from subsets of receivers to the source. The hierarchical control structure is based on a control structure that is also used for implementing reliable multicast. In this paper we propose such a <b>collect</b> <b>mechanism,</b> called CAGE. We describe several types of collects (standard, scheduled, asynchronous) depending mainly on when aggregation of data starts.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the charge <b>collecting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a radiation detector based on superconducting tunnel junctions depends strongly on the competition between tunneling and losses of quasiparticles in the electrodes of the junction. In this article we discuss the loss of quasiparticles, both in the bulk and {{at the edges of}} the electrodes. The quasiparticle loss taking place during their diffusion in the junction limits the amount of charge carriers tunneling and thereby the energy resolution of the detector. A charge amplification process caused by multiple tunneling of quasiparticles is beneficial to higher signal to noise ratios. Such multiple tunneling is always present in the case of junctions based on symmetrical electrodes. In this article we present a theory for the detector response which takes into account both multiple tunneling and the diffusion of quasiparticles. A model is presented for the spectral response of the detector based on four parameters one of which is the degree of back-tunneling present in the device. Analytical solutions of the model for rectangular and circular junctions are discussed.

40|$|Value Added Tax (VAT) is {{a general}} {{consumption}} tax levied on goods and services. In September 2002, {{in the face of}} mediocre economic performance, deteriorating government finances and stagnant investment levels - all due to the political coups of 2000 -an increase in VAT was recommended to Fijian policy makers by the IMF as a remedy to Fiji's problems. The Fiji government, without an in depth economy wide repercussions of a VAT policy, welcomed it by announcing a 25 % increase in VAT in its 2003 budget. Beginning 1 January 2003 all goods and services were levied a VAT rate of 12. 5 %. In this paper, we use a computable general equilibrium model to examine the economy wide effects of this VAT policy. We find that while the VAT improves government revenue and brings about a small 0. 6 % increase in real GDP, it fails to address investment levels. VAT actually leads to a decline in investments and a reduction in real consumption and national welfare. We highlight that large amounts of tax revenue are owed to government. This is three times more than what government will collect from the 25 % increase in VAT. In this light, an alternative to VAT is to upgrade government's tax <b>collecting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> From this we deduce that the IMF policy is misdirected. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|A healthy Cha'topterus {{introduced}} {{into a glass}} tube rapidly lines this with a parchment-like secretion. One individual, after living in such a tube for two weeks, extended the lining beyond the aperture of the tube at one end. The prolongation was sharply constricted, showed suc cessive thickened rings, and terminated in an expanded rim; it was, in fact, an exaggeration of the constriction {{at the end of}} a normal tube. The tube current in such a preparation, as is well known, enters the tube anteriorly and leaves posteriorly, maintained by the rhythmic beat ing of the fans on segments 14, 15, and 16. It is weak ventral to the animal, but strong dorsally, and is directed under the arch formed by the long parapodia of segment 12. This main tube current provides the food supply, the nature of which has been described by Enders (1909). The <b>collecting</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been described by several authors as follows: the broad ciliated buccal funnel collects directly from an extensive antero-ventral field; in addition, ciliated grooves on the dorsal side of the thorax collect froni the tube current. To demonstrate this when the animal is removed from its tube, food particles must be supplied by dropping them onto the thorax from a pipette. Such particles are collected in a niucoid stream into grooves along the inner edge of the arch formed by the parapodia of segment 12, and pass from this anteriorly in a median groove. Particles which happen to fall on the ventral face of the thorax are passed in laterally moving streams dorsally, between some of the posterior parapodiaâ€”being thus brought into the dorsal collecting field. The median dorsal groove does not lead directly into the mouth, but ends blindly in a dilatation posterior to the dorsal lip overhanging the mouth (Fig. 1). The wall round the terminal dilatation is thickened and raised, and forms a three-lobed prominence. The anatomical details of the structure of the groove have been given by Joyeux-Laffuie (1890) ...|$|R

The main theory used has been Lean Production, as this theory suits the circumstances of the company well. Disorder has been the biggest problem, which has caused the safety in the factory to be below an acceptable level. Dicomad has two different businesses – producing decking and furniture. The decking production is fairly standardized whereas the furniture production is customized. The study was carried out during the summer and fall of 2009. The analysis has resulted in changes in the layout of the factory such that a clearer work flow as well as proper order can be maintained. More specifically, three new layout suggestions have been made. The first suggestion makes big changes in the layout creating the “optimal” layout for the current situation. The second makes slightly smaller changes and the third makes small, but important changes to the layout. Our choice of the three is the second suggestion which constitutes the best compromise given the current layout. This suggestion will bring substantial benefits in form of a clearer flow, more organized inventory and separation of the two businesses but does not include a strenuous movement of the molder. Furthermore, each operation in the factory has been scrutinized and suggested improvements have been made to banish disorganization. Suggestions include redesign of machines, addition of <b>collecting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for material and creation of best practices for machines. The greatest improvements have been possible within the furniture manufacturing as the factory was originally designed for decking production only. Additionally, proposals about improving the light, the air quality and the general organization and cleanliness of the factory have been made.

In this scenario, the VCG <b>mechanism</b> <b>collects</b> in payments up to n− 1 n of the total value of the agents. This collected revenue represents a loss of social welfare. Given this, we study how to redistribute most of the VCG revenue back to the agents. Our first result is a bound on the best possible efficiency ratio, which we conjecture to be tight based on numerical simulations. Furthermore, the upper bound is confirmed on the case with 3 agents, for which we derive an optimal redistribution function. For more than 3 agents, we turn to heuristic solutions and propose a new approach to designing redistribution mechanisms. ...|$|R
