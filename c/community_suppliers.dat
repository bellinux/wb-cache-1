A property rights approach based on the incomplete contract literature rationalizes a vertical integration decision at the community level. The basic argument is that uncertainties in production and forest resource management create contractual hazards between <b>community</b> <b>suppliers</b> of wood products and private buyers and that residual decision-making rights affect community development. The model conditions tendencies towards community-level control with measures of the local community productivity relative to private contractors. Original survey data from Mexico provides the basis for empirical testing.

40|$|Reputation is an {{intangible}} concept. Universally, {{good reputation}} demonstrably increases corporate worth {{and provides a}} sustained competitive hedge. As such, positive reputation from key stakeholders such as customers, opinion leaders in the business <b>community,</b> <b>suppliers</b> and current and potential employees can help a business undertaking achieve its objectives more easily. For instance, if an organization is positively perceived by its main customers, they will prefer trading with the organisation rather than its competitors.

These findings have practical implications for corporate level strategy and the prioritization of budgetary resources by communication managers.

The study investigated the subset of the associations dedicated to collectively producing goods and services, because they are formally set up and aimed at speeding up the dynamism of local development. The empirical research consisted of two stages. The first was a survey covering a sample of 378 organizations, to find out which of those had already undergone or were undergoing a succession process. The second interviewed the main manager of 32 organizations, to obtain a description of their succession experience. In this stage, the research aimed to analyze how the Individual, Organization and Environment dimensions interact to configure the succession process, identifying which factors of each of these dimensions can facilitate or limit this process. The following guiding elements were taken as the analytical basis: Individual dimension – leadership roles, skill and styles; Organization dimension – structure, planning, advisory boards, communication (transparency), control and evaluation; and Environment dimension – influence of the stakeholders (<b>community,</b> <b>suppliers,</b> clients, and business partners) on the succession process. The results indicated that succession in the researched associations is in the construction stage: it adapts to the requirements of current circumstances but is evidently in need of improvement in order for more effective planning and shared management of the process to be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Communal {{consumption}} {{has lately}} received abundant research attention. Nevertheless, consumption community management {{has not been}} studied very widely in the discipline of marketing. In particular, {{there are very few}} community management studies that examine the phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} community supplier. Because the present study adopts this scantily studied perspective, it employs an abductive research approach. In order to give much emphasis on the empirical data, the researcher did not use any specific preselected theoretical framework to classify the findings. However, existing consumption community literature was broadly examined to create preliminary understanding, to provide theoretical background information and to support the researcher's interpretation. The previous community management theory often underlines how difficult, if not impossible, it is to control communities consisting of autonomous actors. Despite this, suppliers cannot settle for the role of a passive onlooker. Since consumption communities can provide substantial commercial and even strategic benefits to suppliers, suppliers must find alternative ways to manage those communities. Therefore, this study aims to specify the role of the supplier in the consumption community as well as analyze how the consumption communities can actually be managed. In this study, consumption communities are seen as heterogeneous social networks that express communality in manifold ways. Altogether five representatives of three successful <b>community</b> <b>suppliers</b> were interviewed. In addition to the depth interviews, a post-review seminar was organized to enrich the empirical data. In the post-review seminar six experts of community management discussed the findings of the analysis in order to verify and enhance researcher's interpretation. Based on the major findings, a framework for consumption community management from the supplier perspective was created. First, the framework summarizes the role of the supplier. Both previous literature and the empirical findings indicate that in the consumption community the role of the supplier is above all a facilitator. This research indicates that the supplier that operates in this facilitative role can manage consumption communities by implementing twelve actions that can be further divided into six action categories. Due to its data driven nature the formed framework provides both theoretical contribution and managerial implications...|$|E

40|$|On the Oregon coast, {{however, the}} issue of water supply has become paramount, {{especially}} given the need to restore instream flows in order to restore coastal salmon runs and meet water quality standards. With {{the ebb and flow}} of population and the economic growth of Oregon coastal communities, three hypotheses have been generated about the ability of these communities to meet future water supply needs. The purpose of this project was to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing coastal <b>community</b> water <b>suppliers</b> as a whole and to ultimately improve the prospects for meeting future water needs. Findings show that contrary to the first hypothesis, most of those interviewed do not think that economic development is constrained by waters supply. However, it does appear that it would be difficult for state economic development officials to match businesses and industries interested in relocating to the Oregon coast with community water supply availability and reliability. Findings also show that the major problem facing <b>community</b> water <b>suppliers</b> in preparing water management and conservation plans cited by interviewees is financial. Though Oregon’s coastal communities face several planning, management, physical, economic, and regulatory challenges in preparing for future water supply needs, numerous partnership, conservation, and research and training opportunities exist.

40|$|The {{internet}} has revolutionized travel packaging, {{in terms of}} both travel package development and distribution. Although tour packages are still assembled and sold in the traditional fashion by tour operators, customers who use the web have access not only to assembled tour products, but also to an array of travel-element bundles. These offers take various forms, depending on the approach of the many suppliers and intermediaries who sell directly to customers via the internet. Packaging travel elements benefits suppliers by reducing the price transparency created by the internet, because the prices of those individual travel elements are bundled and therefore difficult for the package buyer to discern. Moreover, with the growth of online <b>communities,</b> <b>suppliers</b> can observe consumers 2 ̆ 7 stated desires for travel and make proposals for travel packages, rather than wait for consumers to search out the packagers. A notable development is consumers 2 ̆ 7 creation of their own packages in real time, based on changes in vendors 2 ̆ 7 inventories and revenue management pricing. The efficacy of this process depends on the connectivity and computing power of the suppliers, packagers, and intermediaries. A framework presented here assesses value-creation aspects of the following package value drivers: component quality levels, reductions in the opportunity cost of time, flexibility of time and destination choice, and risk management. Based on the value-creation assessment, the report suggests a research agenda and a checklist for package value creatio...|$|R

This Article reports {{the findings of the}} first comprehensive study of the variables that determine whether a business will succeed or fail. Eleven conditions best predict companies' survival prospects. First, a company that even hints in the press release announcing its bankruptcy that it intends to sell its business is highly likely to fail. Second, reorganizations assigned to more experienced judges are more likely to succeed. Third, companies headquartered in isolated geographical areas are more likely to fail. Fourth, companies that report greater shareholder equity are more likely to fail. Fifth, companies with routinely appointed creditors' committees are more likely to fail. Sixth, companies with debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans are more likely to succeed. Seventh, companies that prepackage or prenegotiate their plans are more likely to succeed. Eighth, companies that file in periods of low interest rates are more likely to succeed. Ninth, larger companies are more likely to succeed. Tenth, manufacturers are more likely to succeed. Eleventh, companies with positive pre-filing operating income are more likely to succeed. System participants may be able to improve survival rates by shifting cases to more experienced judges and perhaps also by paying greater attention to the decisions to appoint creditors' committees, to prenegotiate plans, to obtain DIP loans, and to publicly seek alliances...|$|R
