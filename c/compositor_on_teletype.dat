50|$|This {{advancement}} {{was possible}} because many university computer terminals had switched by the mid-1970s to CRT screens, {{which could be}} refreshed with text {{in a few seconds}} instead of a minute or more. Earlier games printed game status for the player <b>on</b> <b>Teletype</b> machines or a line printer, at speeds ranging from 10 to 30 characters per second with a rat-a-tat-tat sound as a metal ball or belt with characters was pressed against paper through an inked ribbon by a hammer.|$|R

5000|$|National Science Foundation (NSF) funded three initial {{projects}} {{for the study of}} [...] "Natural Language Processing." [...] These projects included the University of California, Irvine Physics Computer Development Project, headed by Alfred Bork and Research Assistant, Richard L. Ballard. The Mitre Ticcit Project conducted at the University of Texas, later moved to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and its sister project called the PLATO Project, was conducted at the University of Illinois, Champaign. Over 140 natural language dialog programs were created between 1970 and 1978. UCI's Physics Computer Development Project conducted approximately 55 educational programs and spearheaded development throughout the UC system. Initial projects were conducted <b>on</b> <b>Teletype</b> model 33, paper tape punch machine that operated at a 110 baud rate.|$|R
50|$|Printed output <b>on</b> a <b>Teletype</b> Model 33 ASR was {{controlled}} by a single pole relay. A subroutine would convert the LINC character codes into ASCII and use timing loops to toggle the relay on and off, generating the correct 8-bit output to control the Teletype printer.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Greymouth, New Zealand, on 16 June 1936 and {{received}} an education of sorts with the Marist Brothers, leaving school at 15 1/2 years of age. He became an apprentice hand <b>compositor</b> <b>on</b> the local newspaper, the [...] Greymouth Evening Star, and later when he was 17 or 18 began writing articles for the paper while still an apprentice. He was encouraged by the editor George Gaffney and, following his interest and involvement as {{a player in the}} sport, became the paper's cricket writer. Graeme would cover local games played at weekends and write his reports on Sunday evenings. These were based on the match he had played in and on scorebooks he collected from other games, and published in the following day's paper.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} at Ellalong near Maitland, the son of Thomas Walsh and Ellen Brines. He {{received}} a primary education and was a <b>compositor</b> <b>on</b> the Maitland Mercury before moving to Tamworth around 1881. There {{he worked as a}} tailor, and around 1884 married Mary Elizabeth Buosell, with whom he had three children. In 1901 {{he was elected to the}} New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Tamworth; he ran as an independent, but always supported Premier John See and was soon considered a Progressive. In 1903 he was declared bankrupt and thus was no longer eligible to sit in parliament; he contested the by-election as an endorsed Progressive but was defeated by the Liberal candidate. Around 1905 he moved to Toowoomba in Queensland, where he worked as a tailor's cutter. Walsh died at Toowoomba in 1930.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Wagga Wagga to miner Heening Peters and his wife Margaritha. He {{attended}} primary school at Temora but left {{at a young age}} to work as a <b>compositor</b> <b>on</b> the local newspaper.

In 1907 he was elected as a Labor member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing Deniliquin, transferring to Canterbury in 1913. He was declared bankrupt in 1914, and so forfeited his seat. In 1916 he tried unsuccessfully to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, being declared unfit on grounds of insufficient eyesight. He enlisted in April 1917 under the assumed name of Henry Edward Murray. In December 1918 he died at the military hospital in South Tedworth in England from wounds sustained during the war.|$|R
5000|$|The slashed zero long predates computers, and {{is known}} to have been used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It is used in many Baudot {{teleprinter}} applications, specifically the keytop and typepallet that combines [...] "P" [...] and slashed zero. Additionally, the slashed zero is used in many ASCII graphic sets descended from the default typewheel <b>on</b> the <b>Teletype</b> Model 33.|$|R
40|$|A {{program or}} an {{algorithm}} can be animated by {{a movie that}} graphically represents its dynamic execution. For instance, a memory allocator might be animated by lines that appear when memory is allocated and disappear when it is freed; a sort might be animated by a randomly scrambled sequence of lines being permuted into order. Such animations are useful for debugging programs, for developing new programs, and for communicating information about how programs work. This paper describes a basic system for algorithm animation: the output is crude, but the system is easy to use; novice users can animate a program {{in a couple of}} hours. The system currently produces movies <b>on</b> <b>Teletype</b> 5620 terminals and workstations that support the X window system, and also renders movies into "stills" that can be included in troff documents.

50|$|The Lithgow Mercury was {{established}} in 1878. Initially a weekly publication, the paper was published daily from 1949 to 1986, then tri-weekly. In 1879, the paper was purchased by Walter Scott Targett, who had started work as a <b>compositor</b> <b>on</b> the paper, and who was later elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Member for Hartley. J.P.T. Caulfield acquired the paper in 1886. He worked as editor for eighteen months, until late 1887 when he sold the paper to the proprietors of the Lithgow Enterprise and Australian Land Nationaliser. In January 1889, the Lithgow Mercury Newspaper Co., headed by James Ryan, purchased the business and property of the Lithgow Enterprise. Ryan became {{managing editor of the}} paper, a position he held for over 37 years. In July 1926, Western Newspapers Ltd, led by L.T. Watson, Hubert Browett Whitham and F.V. Sparrow, purchased the plant and book debts of the paper. The Lithgow Mercury is currently owned by Fairfax Regional Media.|$|R
5000|$|Stairs {{lead up to}} the caseroom, a large rooflit {{room for}} {{typesetting}} with racks {{around the perimeter of}} drawer-like letter cases. The racks are up to a worktop height, with the pairs of cases in use by the <b>compositors</b> <b>on</b> top so that the case of minuscule (lower-case) letters is at a shallow angle, and the case of majuscule (capital or upper-case) letters stands above and behind it at a steep angle leaning against the wall. The letters are cast metal sorts, and visitors are shown by the compositor how to set this movable type by hand into a metal composing stick. He then binds the type forme set by each visitor in a galley, and (time permitting) prints these using a hand-operated printing press to make a galley proof of each for the visitor. The room also has many galleys which were made up and set aside for possible future use, including the last job set by Cowan Smail, [...] "Closing Down Sale from Today".|$|R
50|$|TELCOMP {{programs}} were normally input via a paper tape reader <b>on</b> a <b>Teletype</b> Model 33, {{which would be}} connected to a PDP via a modem and acoustic telephone line. Data could be read from the paper tape reader or from the Teletype keyboard. Output was either printed to the Teletype or sent to the paper tape punch. Early versions had no facility for on-line storage of programs or data.|$|R
