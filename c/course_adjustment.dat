50|$|While {{the orbit}} of a {{satellite}} around the Sun was empirically discovered by Kepler and theoretically proven by Newton to be an ellipse, {{at the time when}} the United States was interested in going to the Moon, there was no such solution known for the shape of a satellite orbiting regularly around two objects, such as a spacecraft going between the Earth and the Moon. This is a special case of the infamous Three Body Problem, for which a general analytical solution is not known because of its complexity of solving the effect of three bodies which all pull on each other while moving, a total of six interactions. However the case of an Earth-Moon satellite can be simplified to four interactions, because although the three objects gravitationally all pull on each other, the effect of the spacecraft's gravity upon the motion of the vastly more massive Earth and Moon is practically non-existent. Arenstorf found a stable orbit for a spacecraft orbiting between the Earth and Moon, shaped like an '8' with the Earth or Moon located inside each loop of the '8'. This orbit is the basis of a path going to the Moon from the Earth, such as the United States Apollo program. For a permanent presence on the Moon, it would be the path of what Arenstorf calls a 'Space Bus', a ferry which could regularly orbit supplies and people between the Earth and Moon without directly expending fuel. By staying on the Arenstorf orbit, lunar astronauts automatically return to Earth. Before leaving NASA at the first Moon Landing, Arenstorf mapped out an emergency rescue orbit, which was used in the Apollo 13 incident, in which a catastrophic malfunction forced aborting the Moon landing, but the astronauts ultimately returned safely to Earth without a major <b>course</b> <b>adjustment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To learn, a motor {{system needs}} to know its {{sensitivity}} derivatives, which quantify how its neural commands affect motor error. But are these derivatives themselves learned, or are they known solely innately? Here we test a recent theory that the brain's estimates of sensitivity derivatives are revisable based on sensory feedback. In its simplest form, the theory says that each control system has a single, adjustable estimate of its sensitivity derivatives which affects all aspects of its task, e. g. if you learn to reach to mirror-reversed targets then your revised estimate should reverse not only your initial aiming but also your online <b>course</b> <b>adjustments</b> when the target jumps in mid-movement. Methods Human subjects bent a joystick to move a cursor to a target on a computer screen, but the cursor's motion was reversed relative to the joystick's. The target jumped once during each movement. Subjects had up to 4000 trials to practice aiming and responding to target jumps. Results All subjects learned to reverse both initial aiming and <b>course</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Conclusions Our study confirms that sensitivity derivatives can be relearned. It {{is consistent with the}} idea of a single, all-purpose estimate of those derivatives; and it suggests that the estimate is a function of context, as one would expect given that the true sensitivity derivatives may vary with the state of the controlled system, the target, and the motor commands. </p...|$|R

Institutional innovation is certainly required, {{but this does not}} mean that a research university should be organized and managed like a firm as it is still frequently supposed.

40|$|In {{the near}} future, several space {{applications}} in the Earth-Moon system may require a spacecraft to hold a stable motion, but the transfer trajectory infrastructure to access such stable motions has not been fully investigated yet. The triangular libration points, L 4 and L 5, in the Earth-Moon system have long been thought of as ideal locations for a communications satellite. Recently, Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs) and Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs) near the Moon {{have been identified as}} motion of interest for manned and unmanned missions with a focus on operations in cislunar space. The triangular libration points, as well as lunar DROs and NRHOs describe special types of possible motion for a spacecraft/satellite that is influenced solely by the gravitational fields of the Earth and the Moon. What is common to the tree types of solutions is that they are practically stable, that is, a spacecraft/satellite can naturally follow the solution for extended periods of time without requiring significant <b>course</b> <b>adjustment</b> maneuvers. This investigation contributes to the infrastructure of a network of transfer trajectories connecting regions of stability located near the Earth, Moon, and the triangular libration points in the Earth-Moon system. Several transfer options between regions of stability are presented and discussed, including transfer options between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and lunar DRO, lunar DRO and periodic orbits near L 4 and L 5, as well as lunar DRO and L 2 NRHOs. ...|$|E
40|$|A new Vision for Space Exploration was {{announced}} {{earlier this year}} by U. S. President George W. Bush. NASA has evaluated on-going programs for strategic alignment with this vision. The evaluation proceeded at a rapid pace and is resulting in changes to the scope and focus of experimental research that will be conducted in support of the new vision. The existing network of researchers in the physical sciences - a highly capable, independent, and loosely knitted community - typically have shared conclusions derived from their work within appropriate discipline-specific peer reviewed journals and publications. The initial result of introducing this Vision for Space Exploration has been to shift research focus from a broad coverage of numerous, widely varying topics into a research program focused on a nearly-singular set of supporting research objectives to enable advances in space exploration. Two of these traditional physical science research disciplines, Combustion Science and Fluid Physics, are implementing a <b>course</b> <b>adjustment</b> from a portfolio dominated by "Fundamental Science Research" to one focused nearly exclusively on supporting the Exploration Vision.

The relevance to the new NASA direction is provided, while demonstrating through two examples how the prior investment in fundamental research is being brought to bear on solving the issues confronting the successful implementation of the exploration goals...|$|E
