It is shown that in any time period there are sixteen different kinds of demographic flows for a two region system. These flows can be represented in an accounting table. Some of the minor flows, involving double ot triple demographic events such as a birth followed by a migration, cannot be measured directly from data, and an iterative scheme is offered for the calculation of these flows. In this way a <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> can be built up from existing data. Two principles of model building using this set of accounts are then discussed. The first uses a simple definition of demographic rates, while the second uses a definition of rates which employs a concept of 'at-risk' populations. Procedures are given for calculating these populations. The account building principles are illustrated with a worked example for a three region system: the West Riding of Yorkshire, the rest of England and Wales, {{and the rest of the}} world. The results presented in this paper are for aggregate populations. In a subsequent paper equivalent results will be presented for age/sex disaggregated populations. ...|$|E

For this specific use, the GN-model has enjoyed substantial validation, both simulative and experimental. Recently, however, it has been pointed out that its predictions, when used to obtain a detailed picture of non-linear interference (NLI) noise accumulation along a link, may be affected by a substantial NLI overestimation error, especially in the first spans of the link.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} introducing more regional detail into an applied general equilibrium model than {{is available from the}} top-down approach to disaggregation. Recognizing that the <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> inter-regional <b>accounts</b> is rarely available, the method described uses available data for one or more regions of interest for which the demand patterns and/or the input structures of certain industries are known not to be a close reflection of the national averages for these industries. The method splits these national industries into the part(s) located in the region(s) of interest for which detailed data are available, and the remainder. The new regionally specific industries are then treated just like any other aggregate industry recognized at the national level (but of course, their demand and/or production structures differ). Shocks specific to such regionally specific industries can now be introduced into simulations. This limited bottom-up disaggregation does not impede the use of the top-down method [...] in this paper, the ORANI-LMPST method [...] for disaggregating the aggregate national industries. Thus detail in simulations comes both from region-specific information (as in the bottom-up approach), as well as from top-down disaggregation. Because it incorporates more region-specific data, this hybrid method is more reliable than stand-alone use of the top-down approach. The example detailed in the paper describes the use of the hybrid method to improve disaggregated results for Tasmania (Australia's smallest State) from the ORANI national model of Australia. ...|$|R

The question of how the boundary be-tween market and nonmarket activity should be defined {{would be one of the}} main issues of contention; how to measure the real output associated with intangible products like services {{would be a}}nother.

Current {{international}} {{standards for the}} statistical treatment of the issue In many cases, a business will set up a separate legal entity in order to undertake operations in an economy outside its home economy. However, where a separate entity is not created in the outside economy, but the operations are substantial, a notional institutional unit resident in that economy may be identified for statistical purposes. In this paper, such a unit is called a “branch. ” 1 Although a branch is not a legal entity, it behaves in many ways as if it were, and treating it as a unit can allow statistics to give a better portrayal of the economic reality, see 1993 SNA paras. 4. 49 - 52. (An issues paper for DITEG deals with the valuation of branches, so this paper is only concerned with the units and residence issues.)

40|$|Abstract:- Carbon dioxide is {{the highest}} emitted {{greenhouse}} gas in the world today, mostly due to fossil fuel based energy industries and deforestation. Hence, {{to address the issue}} of climate change, one of the most significant questions is how to reduce increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. One promising technology is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), which consists of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from the sources of generation and sequestering them in deep geologic formations for long periods of time. Even though researches are carried out to crystalise this technology, there has been insufficient attention paid to develop an approach that seek to balance emissions from forest ecosystems and the management of such, with environmental stewardship and economic growth as objectives. In countries where forests account as a major player in balancing CO 2, this approach becomes extremely relevant. The carbon sequestration model is a step forward in developing a <b>complete</b> and interconnected <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> practices allowing for an accurate and credible analysis of past, present, and future carbon emissions relating to forestry in the region. This paper basically looks into the ways by which global warming and the climate changes can be averted to a greater extent by the use of carbon sequestration and suggests a two-part, carbon dioxide emissionabsorption potential (CEAP) model in which all flows into and out of the system are mathematically accounted for. The model is a tool meant to be of help in the assessment and resolution of trade offs at different levels in the management to ensure sustainable and balanced climate system...|$|R

40|$|Modeling of {{nonlinear}} interference (NLI) {{generated by}} the fiber Kerr effect is a hot topic in coherent optical transmission systems. Four years ago, the Gaussian-noise (GN) model was proposed as an approximate tool for predicting the system maximum reach performance, in realistic optical coherent transmission scenarios, over lumped-amplification dispersion uncompensated links. For this specific use, the GN model has enjoyed substantial validation, both simulative and experimental. The original GN model reference formula (GNRF) only described the simple second-order fiber dispersion. In this thesis, we first extend that formula to take the general dispersive propagation constant into account. We then make a comparison {{with the results of}} the GNRF over various types of fibers with quite different dispersions. It turns out that third-order dispersion has a very substantial effect on nonlinearity, especially near a fiber dispersion-zero. It should be mentioned that the GN model may lose accuracy for fundamental reasons when approaching a dispersion zero. These can be overcome by the enhanced-GN (EGN) model, introduced below. On the other hand, the EGN model has two contributions, one of which is the GN model, so the extension of the GN model that was {{the first part of this}} thesis provides useful results for the EGN model too. The GN model predictions, when used to obtain a detailed picture of NLI accumulation along a link rather than an estimate of the system maximum reach, may be affected by a substantial overestimation error, especially in the first few spans of the link. The error is larger for low-cardinality formats and systems with very short spans, or that use nearly-ideal distributed amplification. In this thesis, we analyze in detail the GN model errors. We discuss recently proposed formulas for correcting such errors and show that they neglect several contributions to NLI, so that they may substantially underestimate NLI in specific situations, especially over low-dispersion fibers. We derive a <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> formulas <b>accounting</b> for all single-, cross-, and multi-channel effects. This <b>set</b> <b>of</b> formulas constitutes what we have called the EGN model. We extensively validate the EGN model by comparison with accurate simulations in several different system scenarios. The overall EGN model accuracy is found to be very good when assessing detailed span-by-span NLI accumulation and excellent when estimating realistic system maximum reach. The computational complexity vs. accuracy trade-offs of the various versions of the GN and EGN models, and the presence and relevance of phase noise within NLI are discussed. However, although the EGN model is theoretically rigorous, the complexity is substantially larger than that of the GN model, which makes its use difficult for real-time applications. Fortunately, we are able to derive a simple closed-form GN model correction formula based on the EGN model. The GN model, together with the correction formula, provides a low-complexity approximation to the EGN model. Such approximation has limitations, but already in its present form it effectively and rather accurately corrects for the GN model tendency to overestimate NLI, which is carefully validated over a wide range of system scenarios. The correction formula also allows to clearly identify the correction dependence on key system parameter, such as span length and loss. As a reliable model, the EGN model is then employed to evaluate NLI generation in some study-cases: 1. Dispersion pre-compensation over mixed-fiber links: The dispersion pre-compensation impact both on homogeneous links (single fiber type) and inhomogeneous links (links using a mixture of high and low dispersion fibers) is analyzed. All results demonstrate that the EGN model is capable of dealing with the dispersion pre-compensation in mixed-fiber links. 2. Determining the optimum system symbol rate: The system symbol rate impact on NLI generation is studied in detail. The EGN model is found to be quite accurate in identifying the optimum symbol rate, as well as in predicting the related performance improvement. We also derived a simple closed-form formula that very reliably predicts the optimum symbol rate for quasi-Nyquist systems with lumped amplification. 3. NLI modeling for dynamically reconfigurable networks: the variability of NLI accumulation in dynamically reconfigurable networks with re-routing, different formats and accumulated dispersion is investigated. The EGN model can take the propagation history of all channels into account, and correctly assess NLI generation with different link features. Finally, an experiment is carried out to validate the EGN model for the first time. Using a PM-QPSK Nyquist WDM transmission, we confirm the enhanced accuracy of the EGN model comparing maximum reach predictions with those of the GN mode...|$|R
