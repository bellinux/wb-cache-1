5|$|Counterfeit {{copies of}} <b>cards</b> issued by {{legitimate}} publications can be made. Issuers of <b>cards</b> have taken measures to prevent counterfeiting of their <b>cards,</b> creating <b>cards</b> with holographic foil blocking, signature strips, and tamper-resistant lamination.|$|E
5|$|In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), {{children}} are initially asked to sort <b>cards</b> {{by a single}} dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter their strategy to sort <b>cards</b> based on a second dimension (such as shape). Typically, three-year-old {{children are}} able to sort <b>cards</b> based on a single dimension, but are unable to switch to sort the <b>cards</b> based on a second dimension. However, five-year-old children are able to sort <b>cards</b> based on one dimension and can then switch to sorting <b>cards</b> on a second dimension.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{set of rules}} prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks {{to play with the}} <b>cards</b> rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two <b>cards</b> would be set aside as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both <b>cards.</b> Early sets included a few <b>cards</b> with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of <b>cards</b> up for ante, adding more <b>cards</b> to the ante, or even permanently trading <b>cards</b> in play.|$|E

5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for <b>cards.</b> However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional <b>cards.</b> When older <b>cards</b> are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older <b>cards</b> more collectible.|$|E
5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two <b>cards</b> are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two <b>cards</b> are picked up, all of the <b>cards</b> the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the <b>cards</b> in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a {{transfer}} student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable {{to use the}} Clow <b>Cards</b> and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the <b>cards</b> into Sakura <b>Cards</b> as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain <b>cards.</b> Once all the <b>cards</b> have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the <b>cards</b> so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.|$|E

5|$|An early {{criticism}} of the SmarTrip <b>cards</b> had been that they were only sold at suburban Metrorail stations, online, a few selected retailers, and Metro sales offices. However, in 2008, Metro reached an agreement with CVS/pharmacy to sell the <b>cards</b> at 187 DC-area locations {{in an effort to}} increase SmarTrip use. The SmarTrip <b>cards</b> are also sold at area grocery store chains. In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations.|$|E

5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of <b>cards</b> are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine <b>cards</b> are as their pip value, while tens and court <b>cards</b> count as zero. A player is dealt two <b>cards</b> and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court <b>cards,</b> and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court <b>cards</b> will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E
