40|$|Bagpipes and pipers, as {{cultural}} identifiers, are embedded within their national culture, charged with symbolisms. British authors have often viewed bagpipes {{as cultural}} icons, endowing them with connotations from devilish to virtuous, from rural to military. By analysing literary and artistic references one can perceive how the {{attitude towards the}} bagpipe changes with the evolution of Britain’s internal dynamics. Jacobitism contributed in casting a particular light on the bagpipe: it was the ‘voice of the rebellion’. In Scotland this <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for national pride, while in England the ‘common denominator’ of the Scot-enemy charged the bagpipe with the worst connotations. After Jacobitism stopped being seen as a threat, authors and artists came to view the bagpipe in a different light: the once negative icon was now imbued with ancestral values. The Scot – and the bagpipe by synecdoche – was romanticised: as James Boswell wrote, “The very Highland names, or {{the sound of a}} bagpipe, will stir my blood, and fill me with [ [...] . ] a crowd of sensations with which sober rationality has nothing to do” (1785). The words of many Romantic authors contributed in characterising the instrument, endowing it with implications the influence of which is still relevant today...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{representation}} of Belgian painting and literature as Flemish or German ‘Primitive’ revival (or permanence) {{in the nineteenth century}} and its particular perceptions in the British context. First, it shows the difference of process that could exist between such Belgian ‘Primitive’ constructs in France compared to Britain. It has often been demonstrated indeed that the success of Belgian symbolists in France (notably, Maurice Maeterlinck and Georges Rodenbach) was due to the Nordic image promoted by this cultural group and their explicit references to the universe of Flemish painters during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. If this representation also <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for Parisian critics to denigrate a Belgian or German ‘invasion’ and the ‘dangers’ of cosmopolitanism, what was the import of this image across the Channel, where the attraction of Nordic fogs are less exotic for British audiences than for the French? The paper thus will consider the discourse of ‘Primitive’ art in columns published by Belgian writers and artists in British magazines (The Magazine of Art and The Studio). Fernand Khnopff, Octave Maus or Émile Verhaeren promoted Belgian art and celebrated Belgium as a land for art, through its artistic and popular events. They present it as a land where the time of the ‘Primitive’ art is presented as permanent and may justify deep links established with German and English areas. The paper also explores English reviews of Belgian art and artistic events in the same journals and magazines to articulate the scope and significance of Belgian self-promotion. During WW 1, the exile of many Belgian artists and writers to Britain raised their cultural production to the forefront of public attention. Their success, crossing over the Channel where the ‘Fleming’ is perceived ‘nearer the English’ than to the French (Michel Saddler, Introduction, Émile Verhaeren’s Belgium’s Agony, 1915), may be perceived as another consequence of their international promotion and constructions of Belgian and Flemish Primitive art. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} {{recession in the}} 1980 s <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to revise vocational education in the Netherlands. There was a search for new forms of learning in context, with authentic tasks in the real world, which had the explicit goal of bringing theory and practice closer together. This combination of learning and working was said to better prepare learners {{for the future and}} to guarantee effective training and a powerful learning environment. Business and industry would acquire custom-designed people, ‘just in time, just enough’. This combination of learning and working is referred to by the term dualisering, (which is a dual programme of work and study). It was assumed that integration of learning at the workplace and working under an employment contract, with reflective learning moments at school, would provide an effective learning environment for the development of professional skills. Within higher professional education (HPE, in Dutch: HBO) many forms and variants of learning while working and working while learning gradually emerged. A distinction can be drawn, for example, between ‘apprenticeship’ and ‘internship’, in which the student either follows a dual track or undertakes a work placement respectively. The work placement component seems to have increased in size {{over the past few years}} to such an extent that it has become comparable with the dual system. Since the 1990 s various initiatives have been undertaken in the Netherlands to promote the dual programme of work and study through experiments within higher professional education. Their design has varied from first-year full-time training followed by sixmonthly periods of ‘school’ learning alternated with periods of working (CooP), to the entire training programme of three days a week working and two days undertaking study activities (Gilde-HBO). Currently, colleges of higher professional education are free to design their own dual training programme. However, as part of a dual track, the relationship between student, company and institute must be regulated by means of an employment contract or training-employment contract. This means that dual students are employees at the company, whereas non-dual students come into contact with the world of work through work placements. Dual students were therefore believed to learn more effectively what it takes to work in a specific profession. Furthermore, they would acquire the more generic and specific skills necessary to perform a job and would be better trained in profession-related skills, such as problem-oriented working and flexibility...|$|E

In such contexts, ambiguity may <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> or rational response to a given set of circumstances. This rationality needs to be acknowledged by health professionals.
