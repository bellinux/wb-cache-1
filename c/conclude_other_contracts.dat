While the works on the new European rules on air passengers’ rights are still ongoing {{it is important to}} examine what protection measures the air passengers are currently missing that European consumers may already be enjoying while <b>concluding</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>other</b> than for air transport services. Additionally, I will also discuss whether certain air passengers’ rights in Europe and the methods of providing these rights could {{serve as a model for}} the further development of European consumer protection measures. The assumption underlying this comparison is that air transport services are just one of many services that European consumers purchase. Conceivably, consumers should enjoy similar, if not the same, protection regardless of the type of service they are interested in. Special justifications, e. g., of an economic nature, could, however, justify the introduction of divergent rules with respect to air transport services. Therefore, where my research indicates such differences in the protection levels of air passengers and consumers <b>concluding</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>other</b> than for air transport services, I will consider whether these differences could be justified due to the need to protect interests of one of the contractual parties or due to the internal market’s objectives...|$|R
