40|$|The {{issues of}} energy and {{environment}} are the main constraint of sustainable development in worldwide. Nuclear energy source is one important optional choice for long term sustainable development. The nuclear energy consists of fusion energy and fission energy. Compared with fission, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) {{is a kind of}} clean fusion energy and can generate large energy and little environmental pollution. ICF mainly consists of peripheral driver unit and target. The cooling arm is {{an important component of the}} target, which cools the hohlraum to maintain the required temperature and positions the thermal-mechanical package (TMP) assembly. This paper mainly investigates the cooling arm, including the structural design, the verticality of sidewall and the mechanical properties. The TMP assembly is uniformly clamped in its radial when using (111) crystal orientation silicon to fabricate cooling arm. The finite element method is used to design the structure of cooling arm with 16 <b>clamping</b> <b>arms,</b> and the MEMS technologies are employed to fabricate the micro-size cooling arm structure with high vertical sidewall. Finally, the mechanical test of cooling arm is taken, and the result can meet the requirement of positioning TMP assembly.

40|$|BackgroundMale {{circumcision}} {{can reduce}} the risk of heterosexually-acquired HIV- 1 infection in men. Neonatal male circumcision (NMC) has many potential advantages over circumcision at older ages but little is known about its feasibility and safety in resource-limited settings. MethodsWe performed a randomized trial in southeastern Botswana of Mogen clamp and Plastibell, two commonly used devices for NMC. Follow-up visits occurred at six weeks and four months postpartum. Adverse events, parental satisfaction and staff impressions were recorded. ResultsOf 302 male neonates randomized, 300 (99 %) underwent circumcision, 153 (51 %) with Mogen clamp and 147 (49 %) with Plastibell. There were no major adverse events in the Mogen <b>clamp</b> <b>arm</b> but there were two major adverse events in the Plastibell arm (both were a proximally migrated ring that had to be removed by study staff). Minor adverse events were more common with the Mogen clamp compared with the Plastibell, specifically removal of too little skin and formation of skin bridges or adhesions (12 vs. 1 and 11 vs. 3, respectively, all P< 0. 05). Five (3 %) infants in the Mogen <b>clamp</b> <b>arm</b> and none in the Plastibell arm had minor bleeding (P= 0. 03). More than 94 % of mothers reported being highly or completely satisfied with the procedure. ConclusionsNMC can be performed in Botswana with a low rate of adverse events and high parental satisfaction. Although the risk of migration and retention of the Plastibell is small, the Mogen clamp may be safer for NMC in regions where immediate emergent medical attention is not available.

40|$|Abstract. This article aims to {{optimize}} the <b>clamp</b> <b>arm's</b> length and the number {{and shape of the}} slots of the spring-tube fixture. First it uses the theory of elasticity to create the force deformation model of slot with regular shape, and analysis the deformation of the slot numerically. Then draws the relationship between the elastic deformation and the radius of the bore and the arm’s length while the force is not change, and comes an ideal shape of the bore through this relationship. It also simulates the deformation of fixture with different number of modified slots through the finite element analysis method, and optimizes the fixture for equal strength further. In summary it comes to meet the requirements of fixture theoretically. Finally through experiments the theory gets verified. From the results of experiments the conclusion can be drawn that the corrected fixture is better than before...|$|R
40|$|Equipment for {{measuring}} the direct tip force of a <b>clamp</b> <b>arm</b> on the vessel wall was designed as an adjustable surgical clamp with strain gauges applied and connected via an amplifier to a computer-based data acquisition system. A mechanical model that incorporates the resistance of tissue against momentary deformations is developed to analyse and justify measured results.

5000|$|Richard Whitaker and David Stuart then {{introduced}} a key improvement to the system. Early {{versions of the}} Spademan required the skier to clamp the binding onto the plate by tightening the spring with the rotating nut. Whitaker and Stuart suggesting having the spring on an arm that rotated upward, positioned over a cam {{at the rear of}} the binding. When the arm was rotated up, it would slide off the top of the cam and release all the tension. It could then be re-tensioned onto the plate by pushing the spring back down onto the cam. Spademan later further improved on this design, adding a latch to keep the <b>clamp</b> <b>arms</b> open. In use, the skier would remove the binding as normal by lifting the spring off the cam, but could then return it immediately to the [...] "clamped" [...] position. The latch kept the clamps open until a small button under the binding plate was depressed, which happened when the skier stepped back into the binding. This gave the Spademan [...] "step in" [...] performance, which previous models lacked.|$|R

25|$|Rutten found {{a measure}} of {{redemption}} after the upset loss by choking out expert grappler and King of Pancrase Tournament Finalist Manabu Yamada in his next fight, on January 26, 1995. Rutten {{was taken to the}} ground, but he <b>clamped</b> an <b>arm</b> triangle choke from half guard and exerted such a pressure that Yamada, refusing to tap out, was choked out and remained unconscious with his eyes wide open after the hold. Thanks to this performance against the tournament finalist, Rutten received a rematch and a title shot against tournament winner and then current King of Pancrase Ken Shamrock for the King of Pancrase title on March 10. The match was very anticipated, but it ended early when Shamrock executed a kneebar and forced Rutten to submit. According to the Dutch, the loss was due to his training partner Funaki teaching him the wrong way to escape a kneebar, which made Rutten spin in the opposite direction giving a tighter hold for Shamrock. After this failure, Rutten focused on grappling even harder and started training 2 to 3 times a day solely on submissions.|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{technique}} to inject a discontinuous zero sequence signal (D-ZSS) into voltage modulation of the modular multilevel converter arms. The core of the technique is the <b>clamping</b> of the <b>arm</b> voltages to a particular level and interval, {{in such a way}} that reduces the number of switching events on the instants that the load stress on the semiconductors is high, and consequently the dissipated energy. The clamping voltage and interval has some degrees of freedom which are also discussed. The description of the methodology is complemented with its simulation. Either in steady-state or in dynamic converter operation this technique is able to reduce the switching events and the correspondent total losses up to 6. 6 %.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was the {{evaluation}} of the efficacy of the use of a new wearable AR video see-throught system based on Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) to guide the position of a working cannula into the vertebral body through a transpedicular approach without the use X-Ray images guidance. We describe a head mounted stereoscopic video see-through display that allows the augmentation of video frames acquired by two cameras with the rendering of patient specific 3 D models obtained on the basis of pre-operative radiological volumetric images. The system does not employ any external tracker to detect movements of the user or of the patient. User's head movements and the consistent alignment of the virtual patient with the real one, are accomplished through machine vision methods applied on pairs of live images. Our system has been tested on an experimental setup that simulate the reaching of lumbar pedicle as in a vertebral augmentation procedure avoiding the employment of ionizing radiation. Aim {{of the study}} is to evaluate the ergonomics and the accurancy of the systems to guide the procedure. We performed 4 test sessions with a total of 32 kirschner wire implanted by a single operator wearing the HMD with the AR guide. The system accurancy was evaluated by a post-operative CT scan. The most ergonomic AR visualization comprise the use of a pair of virtual viewfinders (one {{at the level of the}} skin entry point and one at the level of the trocar's bottom) aligned according to the planned direction of the trocar insertion. With such AR guide the surgeon must align the tip of the needle to the center of the first viewfinder placed on the patient's skin. indeed the viewfinder barycenter provides a 2 degrees of freedom (DoFs) positioning guide corresponding to the point of insertion preoperatively planned over the external surface of the model. The second viewfinder is used by the surgeon to rotate and align the trocar according to the planned direction of insertion (2 rotational DOFs). After the first test series a <b>clamping</b> <b>arm</b> has been introduced to maintain the reached trocar's trajectory. The post-operative CT scan was registered to the preoperative one and the trajectories obtained with the AR guide were compared to the planned one. The overal results obtained in the 4 test session show a medium error of 1. 18 +/− 0. 16 mm. In the last year there was a growing interest to the use of Augmented Reality systems in which the real scene watched by the surgeon is merged with virtual informations extracted from the patient's medical dataset (medical data, patient anatomy, preoperative plannig). Wearable Augmented Reality (WAR) with the use of HDMs allows the surgeon to have a “natural point of view” of the surgical field and of the patient's anatomy avoiding the problems related to eye-hand coordination. Results of the in vitro tests are encouraging in terms of precision, system usability and ergonomics proving our system to be worthy of more extensive tests...|$|R

5000|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{above and}} beyond the call of duty, while participating on a bombing mission over enemy-occupied continental Europe, 28 (sic) July 1943. Prior to reaching the German coast {{on the way to the}} target, the B17 aircraft in which 2d Lt. (sic) Morgan was serving as co-pilot was attacked by a large force of enemy fighters, during which the oxygen system to the tail, waist, and radio gun positions was knocked out. A frontal attack placed a cannon shell through the windshield, totally shattering it, and the pilot's skull was split open by a [...]303 caliber shell, leaving him in a crazed condition. The pilot fell over the steering wheel, tightly <b>clamping</b> his <b>arms</b> around it. 2d Lt. Morgan at once grasped the controls from his side and, by sheer strength, pulled the aircraft back into formation despite the frantic struggles of the semiconscious pilot. The interphone had been destroyed, rendering it impossible to call for help. At this time the top turret gunner fell to the floor and down through the hatch with his arm shot off at the shoulder and a gaping wound in his side. The waist, tail, and radio gunners had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen and, hearing no fire from their guns, the copilot believed they had bailed out. The wounded pilot still offered desperate resistance in his crazed attempts to fly the aircraft. There remained the prospect of flying to and over the target and back to a friendly base wholly unassisted. In the face of this desperate situation, 2d Lt. Officer Morgan made his decision to continue the flight and protect any members of the crew who might still be in the ship and for 2 hours he flew in formation with one hand at the controls and the other holding off the struggling pilot before the navigator entered the steering compartment and relieved the situation. The miraculous and heroic performance of 2d Lt. Morgan on this occasion resulted in the successful completion of a vital bombing mission and the safe return of his aircraft and crew.|$|R
30|$|ATR-FTIR {{spectroscopy}} was, once again, {{shown to}} be a suitable method of characterisation of unknown polymers commonly found in heritage collections. Here the spectra were interpreted by band assignment rather than using spectral matching via libraries. Polymer fragments were analysed without sample pre-treatment and were easily identified by visual examination of the collected spectra. The technique lends itself to the analysis of smaller polymer samples (due {{to the use of the}} pressure clamp) or polymer fragments. Care needs to be taken when ‘softer’ samples are analysed to ensure the imprint from the <b>arm</b> <b>clamp</b> is not visually apparent after sampling. It should also be noted that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is a surface technique therefore caution must be used when analysing a sample which could comprise of polymer layers. Matching unknown samples to collected data was attempted using PCA rather than spectral libraries. It was possible to unambiguously determine samples that contained cellulose acetate, polycarbonate, polyurethane foam or cellulose nitrate; regardless of the age of the sample, its formulation or the presence of additives. More importantly, PCA was used to differentiate polyurethane samples that had been aged using thermal- or photo-ageing treatment despite the inability to see visual changes in either the material or the collected spectra. This provides users with a tool to identify the early stages of polyurethane deterioration. Similar work is now being conducted on the other polymer family groups identified in this study.|$|R
