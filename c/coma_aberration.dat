Although the first theoretical derivations of [...] were published by others, {{it is fair to say}} that Abbe was the first to reach this conclusion experimentally. In 1878, he built the first homogenous immersion system for the microscope. The objectives that the Abbe Zeiss collaboration were producing were of ideal ray geometry, allowing Abbe to find that the aperture sets the upper limit of microscopic resolution, not the curvature and placement of the lenses. Abbe's first publication of [...] occurred in 1882. In this publication, Abbe states that both his theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed [...] Abbe's contemporary Henry Edward Fripp, English translator of Abbe's and Helmholtz's papers, puts their contributions on equal footing. He also perfected the interference method by Fizeau, in 1884. Abbe, Zeiss, Zeiss' son, Roderich Zeiss, and Otto Schott formed, in 1884, Jenaer Glaswerk Schott & Genossen. This company, which in time would in essence merge with Zeiss Optical Works, was responsible for research and production of 44 initial types of optical glass. Working with telescopes, he built image reversal system in 1895. In order to produce high quality objectives, Abbe made significant contributions to the diagnosis and correction of optical aberrations, both spherical aberration and <b>coma</b> <b>aberration,</b> which is required for an objective to reach the resolution limit of [...] In addition to spherical aberration, Abbe discovered that the rays in optical systems must have constant angular magnification over their angular distribution to produce a diffraction limited spot, a principle known as the Abbe sine condition. So monumental and advanced were Abbe's calculations and achievements that Frits Zernike based his phase contrast work that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953, and Hans Busch used them to work on the development of the electron microscope.|$|E

Methods: Three types of IOL holders were prepared. The first was without decentration or tilt, the second had a decentration of 0. 5 mm, and the third had a tilt of 5. 0 °. One spherical IOL and three aspherical IOLs, each with a power of + 20 D, were set in the holders and their optical properties (wave front aberration, defocused modulation transfer function, defocused point spread function, and Landolt ring simulations) were compared. Results: Coma aberrations generated by misaligned IOLs were related to the spherical aberration corrective power of the IOLs. Landolt ring simulations show that the depth of focus increased as spherical aberration increased and that the retinal image quality was degraded by increases in <b>coma</b> <b>aberration.</b> Conclusion: <b>Coma</b> <b>aberration</b> was generated by IOLs with a large degree of spherical aberration correction, leading to reduced retinal image quality when the IOL was misaligned. This suggests that, in a clinical setting, the quality of vision might be improved by reducing the degree of <b>coma</b> <b>aberration</b> using IOLs that retain, or minimally correct, spherical aberration.

Results: The average of all evaluated pachymetric and topometric indices and the 3 rd and 5 th order vertical coma aberrations showed {{a significant difference between}} the study groups (p <  0. 001). Belin/Ambrosio Deviation Display (BAD_D), Index of Vertical Asymmetry (IVA), Index of Surface Variance (ISV), and 5 th order vertical <b>coma</b> <b>aberration</b> were identified as the best diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of subclinical keratoconus (R 2  =  0. 65, p < 0. 001), and BAD_D, mean keratometry and 3 rd order vertical <b>coma</b> <b>aberration</b> were identified as the best diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of definite keratoconus (R 2  =  0. 91, p < 0. 001).

40|$|To achieve optimal {{image quality}} in bright field microscopy, the slide surface should be {{perpendicular}} to the optical axis of the microscope. However, in the recently proposed "slanted scan" slide acquisition technique, scan speed is increased by purposely slanting the slide by a small angle (of 3 - 5 °) so that multiple focal depths can be imaged simultaneously. In this case, the slanted slide introduces {{a bend in the}} point spread function (PSF), resulting in a coma and other aberrations that degrade image quality. In this paper, we propose a two-stage deconvolution method specifically designed to correct the aberrations induced by a slanted scan, but with general applicability to high-resolution bright-field microscopy. Specifically, we initially apply phase deconvolution to correct the dominating <b>coma</b> <b>aberration,</b> before applying a conventional semi-blind deconvolution method to further improve image resolution and contrast.

Methods: This prospective study included 120 eyes from 92 patients who were randomized to receive one of four lenses, including three aspheric lenses (Acrysof SN 60 WF, Tecnis ZA 9000, and Hoya Py 60 AD) and one spherical lens (Acrysof SN 60 AT). Contrast sensitivity, higher-order aberrations of the whole eye, and pupil diameter under photopic and mesopic conditions were measured 1 month postoperatively. Higher-order aberrations were decomposed into Zernike coefficients, calculated according to individual pupil diameter. The correlation between higher-order aberrations and contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Results: There were no significant differences in contrast sensitivity function between the four types of lenses under photopic conditions. However, the contrast sensitivity function and area under log contrast sensitivity function in the aspheric lenses were significantly better than in the spherical lens under mesopic conditions. Under mesopic conditions, spherical aberration in eyes with aspheric lenses was significantly lower than in eyes with spherical lenses (P &lt; 0. 05).

Methods: In study 1, the right eyes of 43 non-cyclopleged subjects were evaluated using the Complete Ophthalmic Analysis System (COAS) aberrometer. In study 2, the right eyes of the 23 cyclopleged subjects were evaluated using the Optical Pathway Difference Scan aberrometer. Measurements were made with wide-open and deliberately narrowed palpebral apertures in these subjects. In study 3, the influence of eyelashes on the COAS output was investigated in 20 subjects by placing artificial eyelashes {{in front of the}} eye, in close proximity to the natural eyelashes. Results: For study 1, the total root mean square (RMS) of the third- and fourth-order aberrations with the wide-open lids was significantly different from the narrowed lid position after the correction for multiple comparisons. There was a difference in the Zernike coefficient of the defocus (C 4), 90 / 180 astigmatism (C 5), vertical coma (C 7) and spherical aberration terms (C 12) between the narrowed and wide-open positions. For study 2, changes were observed with the narrowed lid position in the overall RMS of the third and fourth orders, and total <b>coma</b> <b>aberrations,</b> as well as the specific Zernike coefficients of the C 5 and C 7 terms.

The analysis is illustrated with optical design of a model spectrometer to deliver a resolving power above 20400 at photon energy of 930 eV (Cu L-edge). With this energy taken as reference, the VLS coefficients are optimized to cancel the lineshape asymmetry (mostly from the <b>coma</b> <b>aberrations)</b> as well as minimize the symmetric aberration broadening at large grating illuminations, dramatically increasing the aberration-limited vertical acceptance of the spectrometer. For any energy away from the reference, we evaluate corrections to the entrance arm and light incidence angle on the grating to maintain the exactly symmetric lineshape. Furthermore, we evaluate operational modes when these corrections are coordinated to maintain either energy independent focal curve inclination or maximal aberration-limited spectrometer acceptance. The results are supported by analytical evaluation of the coma term of the optical path function. Our analysis gives thus a recipe to design a high-resolution spherical VLS grating spectrometer operating with negligible aberrations at large acceptance and over extended energy range...|$|R

RESULTS: 1) Vision: The uncorrected visual acuity {{of the three groups}} had no differences(P > 0. 05). 2) Corneal aberrations: Three kinds of surgical procedure for patients with corneal aberration had significant impact. The C 7, C 8, C 12 and RMSh of three groups were increased significantly(P 0. 05). The C 7, C 8, C 12 and RMSh were not recovered to preoperative levels after 3 mo. But the increase of patients after FS-LASIK was smaller than the other two groups, with statistical significance(P 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Compared with SBK and LASEK,FS-LASIK has better visual acuity in the early postoperative and corneal higher-order aberrations increase is relatively small...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D optical endoscopy {{is now a}} {{major challenge}} to allow the high resolution inspection of industrial equipments. The proposed instrument {{is based on a}} flexible image guide (70 000 fibres) and a Digital Micro mirror Device (DMD, 1024 x 768 "on-off" micro mirrors). The optical design is as follows: the light emitted by a 532 nm laser diode is dynamically structured by the DMD chip as a fringes pattern which is phase-shifted due to the active control of the DMD chip and projected onto an object on a circular field of 6 mm in diameter. Due to a telecentric and binocular arrangement that creates a stereoscopic angle, it is possible to get a depth of field of 2 mm along the optical axis without keystone distortions and few disturbances created by defocus and <b>coma</b> <b>aberrations.</b> Then, images are captured by a 1024 x 768 digital camera (not yet moved away by fibres) at 15 fps and directly used in the reconstruction algorithm to access the tri-dimensional shape of the unpainted object. The results are compared to incoherent white light results obtained with white painted mechanical objects. The lateral resolution is 31. 3 µm and the RMS axial resolution is 10 µm for the laser-based design after speckle attenuation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare {{changes of}} {{anterior}} corneal aberration (Pentacam®) and ocular aberration (aberrometer, LADARWave®) after laser refractive surgery. Methods: Sixty-six eyes underwent laser refractive surgery and were retrospectively reviewed. Anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration were measured by Pentacam ® and an aberrometer (LADARWave®) respectively. Changes of {{root mean square}} (RMS) values of <b>coma,</b> spherical <b>aberration,</b> and total high order aberration (HOA) were evaluated before, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery Results: Ocular aberrations displayed low preoperative values, but after laser refractive surgery, anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration increased equally. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} of internal optics aberration values (ocular aberration minus anterior corneal <b>aberration)</b> in <b>coma,</b> spherical <b>aberration,</b> and total HOA. Anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration showed statistically significant correlations at 1 and 3 months after surgery. Conclusions: Internal optics aberration compensated the anterior corneal aberration effectively before surgery, but the increase of anterior corneal aberration after laser refractive surgery exceeded the compensation of internal optics. As a result, anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration increased equally. The correlation between anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration after surgery was statistically significant due to the increased proportion of anterior corneal aberration in ocular aberration.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} endocapsular phacoemulsification cataract extraction and intraocular lens(IOL) implantation with a 1. 8 mm or 3. 0 mm clear corneal incision on total root mean square(RMS) value of the cornea, corneal astigmatism, spherical <b>aberration,</b> <b>coma,</b> trefoil and tear film. METHODS:In a prospective study, 156 age-related patients(196 eyes) were randomly distributed into two groups. 1. 8 mm-group comprised 94 eyes that had a silicone IOL inserted through a 1. 8 mm sutureless clear corneal incision, while, 3. 0 mm-group comprised 102 eyes through a 3. 0 mm clear corneal incision. Postoperatively, {{the changes in the}} total RMS value of the cornea, corneal astigmatism, spherical <b>aberration,</b> <b>coma,</b> trefoil and tear film at 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo were determined respectively. RESULTS: In both groups, postoperatively at 1 wk,there were statistically significant differences(P P P > 0. 05) between two groups at 3 mo postoperative. CONCLUSION:This study confirms that incision size has strong impact on the corneal higher-order aberrations, especially, 3. 0 mm incision caused significant differences in the total RMS value of cornea, corneal astigmatism, spherical <b>aberration,</b> <b>coma,</b> trefoil and tear film compared with 1. 8 mm micro-incision, therefore, micro-incision is very beneficial for clinical use in phacoemulsification...|$|R
