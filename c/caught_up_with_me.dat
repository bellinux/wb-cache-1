2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by and I hit rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it finally all <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I came down with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. My body was physically giving up. I took six months off and went home. I love working, but at the end of the day you've got to take care of yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{pressure}} from the music executives and heavy work schedule, Clarkson began to have erratic experience while performing in her Breakaway World Tour. She recalled,"Everything <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in a bad way. My body was wearing down, and my emotions were wearing down. I {{was trying to get}} over someone. I hadn't seen my friends and family for a while, and it was becoming a nuisance see them because I was so busy. I was traveling, and then there was more added to the schedule. It just got chaotic. I was 24, and that is pretty young to be the boss of so much. And it <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I couldn't smile. I couldn't do anything. I broke down. I cried so much I couldn't speak. I was that tired. I was drained. I didn't want to act, didn't want to smile -- I didn't want to pretend. I just broke. ... It was the lowest point of my life and my career." ...|$|E

I’m like, it’s done, it’s turned in, I got my release date. I got my album done and all the covers. Everything is in promotions. But I guess it just <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> But I’m back." ...|$|E
50|$|The 1970s and 1980s {{were less}} {{fruitful}} times for Central European film generally, and Czechoslovak cinema particularly suffered after the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. Nevertheless, interesting {{works on the}} Holocaust, and more generally the Jewish experience in Central Europe, were sporadically produced in this period, particularly in Hungary. Holocaust films from this time include Imre Gyöngyössy and Barna Kabay's The Revolt of Job (Jób lázadása, Hungary, 1983), Leszek Wosiewicz's Kornblumenblau (Poland, 1988), and Ravensbrück survivor Juraj Herz's Night <b>Caught</b> <b>Up</b> <b>With</b> <b>Me</b> (Zastihla mě noc, Czechoslovakia, 1986), whose shower scene {{is thought to be}} the basis of Spielberg's similar sequence in Schindler's List.|$|E

I got sick of the sound of my own voice". In 2013, Zellweger co-created and executive produced Cinnamon Girl, an original drama series set in the Hollywood movie and music scenes of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but the Lifetime network passed on the pilot.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was begun}} in Greece {{because there were}} no wires on the island where I was living to a certain moment. There were no {{telephone}} wires. There were no telephones. There was no electricity. So at a certain point they put in these telephone poles, and you wouldn’t notice them now, but when they first went up, it was about all I did - stare out the window at these telephone wires and think how civilization had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and I wasn’t {{going to be able to}} escape after all. I wasn’t going to be able to live this 11th-century life that I thought I had found for myself. So that was the beginning. Then, of course, I noticed that birds came to the wires and that was how that song began. 'Like a drunk in a midnight choir,' that’s also set on the island. Where drinkers, me included, would come up the stairs. There was great tolerance among the people for that because it could be in the middle of the night. You’d see three guys with their arms around each other, stumbling up the stairs and singing these impeccable thirds. So that image came from the island: 'Like a drunk in a midnight choir.' ...|$|E

5000|$|It was at {{our first}} house {{and on the}} first patch of ground that we {{actually}} owned that I really discovered the point of gardening. It wasn’t a Pauline conversion. There was no sudden, blinding vision of beauty. I didn’t see myself (still don’t) trolling through bowers of roses, straw hat just so, gathering blooms into a basket. Nor had I any idea at first of the immense joy of growing food. But I had at least begun to understand that gardening, {{if it is to}} be satisfying, requires some sense of permanency. Roots matter. The longer you stay put, the richer the rewards. I also realised how completely I had missed the point as a child. Gardening was not necessarily about an end result. The doing was what mattered. At this time too, I learned about gardening as therapy. Banged up with small children all day for the first time, I thought I would go under. When a confrontation seemed to be looming of a kind that had no solution (apart from giving away the children to the first person that passed by on the lane outside) I would race to the newly made vegetable patch and furiously hoe beans. The children’s legs were shorter than mine and if I was lucky, I’d have at least a minute and a half on my own before they <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and wanted to hoe too. Later on, when they were five or six years old, gardening with the children became a pleasure. But at this early stage - not. The Curious Gardener ...|$|E

[...] Norman explained that [...] "this record was written in two different seasons...,I had slipped into sort of this desert season. Life had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> When I get into that place when I feel distant from God, I start to question a lot of things, doubt a lot of things. If this world looks like its falling apart, then love is not winning, God is not winning. If God is not winning, is God really God?" [...] He shines some light on the evolution of how this album came into existence, which Norman told [...] "this all just snuck up on me and in the process of expressing those songs I wanted to be really honest,...I didnt have an answer for everything. So I went on a trip by myself. It was one of the first times I fasted. I had this really beautiful kind of awakening experience. It was very simple…no lighting bolts bolts, no big dream. It was very subtle, very surreal, life altering". Norman foretold how he [...] "...stumbled on this quote from the German mystic Meister Eckhart, If the soul could have known God without the world, the God would never have created the world. There is a real goodness about God. Even when it seems the world has gone dark, there are still beautiful things to hope for".|$|E
5000|$|Mikey Welsh left Weezer in 2001 {{for reasons}} that were left unclear {{to the public for}} several years after it happened. It was {{eventually}} revealed that he did in fact have a nervous breakdown due to drug use, undiagnosed mental conditions, and the constant wear of touring. The combination of these factors ultimately led Welsh to attempt suicide via drug overdose. He was checked into a psychiatric hospital sometime during August 2001. He later spoke about the ordeal {{in an interview with the}} website Rock Salt Plum: [...] Basically, a lifetime of doing drugs and being undiagnosed as having bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder finally <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> when I was 30 years old. At the beginning of a 3-month European tour with Weezer, I started slowly falling apart. Without getting too graphic, by the time the tour was winding up, my weight had gone down to about 140lbs (I'm 6'2") kg - 1,88 mand mentally completely wiped out. When I returned to the States, my family had made plans for me to see a psychiatrist in Boston. First though, we had to play a few dates around the U.S., and perform on The Tonite (sic) Show (which ended up being my last performance with Weezer). By the time I got to Boston, I was having a complete nervous breakdown. It ended with a severe suicide attempt (an overdose). I was found and rushed to the hospital where I had come to within minutes of my heart completely stopping. I was in a coma for a few days, and woke up in a lockdown psychiatric ward.

5000|$|Hua [...] "transformations" [...] {{are a key}} {{topic in}} the Daoist Zhuangzi. For instance, Victor H. Mair {{translates}} it as [...] "evolution" [...] in this context.Nuncle Scattered and Nuncle Slippery were observing the mounds of the Earl of Darkness in the emptiness of K'unlun where the Yellow Emperor rested. Suddenly a willow began to sprout from Nuncle Slippery's left elbow. He looked startled, as though he resented it."Do you resent it?" [...] asked Nuncle Scattered. [...] "No," [...] said Nuncle Slippery. [...] "Why should I resent it? Our lives are just a borrowed pretext. That which we borrow to maintain our lives is merely so much dust. Life and death alternate like day and night. As you and I were observing evolution, it <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> So why should I resent it? (1994:169) James D. Sellmann elucidates the Daoist significance of hua.There is no conclusion, no end, no finish for the Zhuangzi. Things transpose, and keep on changing. Therefore, the compassionate meaning and empathic understanding of [...] "transformation" [...] as it is mentioned {{in the context of}} the Zhuangzi encompasses each and every thing - in the natural world and the human world. From this perspective, transformation entails a magnitude of meaning, or [...] "spiritual" [...] dimension (in the sense of [...] "high spirits" [...] or [...] "laughter"). Transformation is not just change of form and shape (bian 變) or a change of things and situations (yi 易), but it also entails a complete renewal of the experience of life's meaning (hua 化). Hua provides a way to move through various shapes or bodily forms within a species and across species to merge with each unique perspective, and to experience a mystical continuity with the particulars of nature. In chapter two of the Zhuangzi, the mystical experience is described in these terms; [...] "heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one" [...] (5/2/52-53). The way hua is played out in the Zhuangzi is very telling, especially in the context of elaborating on the mystical experience. (1998:170) ...|$|E
