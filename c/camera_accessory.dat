The new console places a heavy emphasis on features surrounding social interaction; gameplay videos can be shared via the PlayStation Network and other services, and users can stream games being played by themselves or others (either through the console, or directly to services such as Twitch). The PS4's DualShock 4 controller is similar to the previous model, but adds a touchpad and a [...] "Share" [...] button, along with an LED light bar on the front to allow motion tracking. An updated <b>camera</b> <b>accessory</b> will also be offered for the system; it now uses 1280×800px stereo cameras with support for depth sensing similar to Kinect, and remains compatible with the PlayStation Move peripherals. The PS4 will also have second screen capabilities through both mobile apps and the PlayStation Vita, and game streaming through the recently acquired Gaikai service.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Wintertime is {{difficult}} for many beekeepers, as honey bees must keep themselves warm and dry while surviving on food stores from previous seasons [4]. Honey bees are able to survive such cold temperatures by vibrating their bodies in a cluster, which moves throughout the hive, to keep themselves and the queen warm and dry [4]. Outside temperatures greatly influence {{the efficiency of the}} internal cluster of the hive [4]. Honey bee colonies have the most efficient (i. e. least amount of energy spent and least amount of food stores used) clusters when the outside temperature is between 40 - 50 °F; the efficiency of this cluster greatly breaks down when the outside temperature rises slightly above 50 °F [4]. At this temperature the mechanics of the cluster change drastically; this is the point at which most energy is expended and the highest amounts of food stores are consumed [4]. Newly available technologies may be useful for beekeepers to improve management techniques during the winter season [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This study used an infrared (IR) smartphone <b>camera</b> <b>accessory</b> (FLIR One Thermal Imager), temperature, and relative humidity sensors (from BroodMinderTM). The goal was to determine practical uses of these technologies in winter management...|$|E
