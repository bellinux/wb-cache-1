5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term <b>cistron</b> in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
25|$|The mRNA {{from the}} PL {{promoter}} forms a stable secondary structure with a stem-loop in the sib {{section of the}} mRNA. This targets the 3' (sib) end of the mRNA for RNAaseIII degradation, which results in a lower effective concentration of int mRNA than xis mRNA (as the int <b>cistron</b> is nearer to the sib sequence than the xis <b>cistron</b> is to the sib sequence), so a higher concentrations of xis than int is observed.|$|E
25|$|Whereas a {{gene family}} (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} similar or identical functions) arises by duplication {{of a single}} original gene, this is usually {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional <b>cistron</b> duplication. That crossing-over can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{sequences}} which {{code for}} ribosomal DNA have been isolated and purified. The technique used has general application for RNA:DNA hybridization studies and enables {{the isolation of}} any gene for which sufficient gene product can be obtained. Experiments with isolated ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> demonstrated that (a) {{the majority of the}} ribosomal <b>cistrons</b> are similar to one another; (b) the <b>cistrons</b> which are similar to one another are virtually identical to one another; (c) ribosomal <b>cistrons</b> of different bacterial species are closely related to one another...|$|R
40|$|Additional {{experiments}} with homologous {{as well as}} heterologous hybridization confirmed our previous finding in Sciara coprophila that XX females have nearly {{twice the number of}} ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> as X 0 males. A comparison between two different X' chromosomes revealed that only the one carrying the irradiation-induced Wavy mutation has a deletion of 70 % of its ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> as compared to the standard X. The deletion is relatively stable, and the remaining ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> do not appear to undergo disproportionate replication or magnification as in Drosophila. Homologous hybridization experiments revealed an unusually low reiteration of ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> in this fly, 45 gene copies per X chromosome. The question is raised as to whether such a low number of <b>cistrons</b> {{may be related to the}} unusual nucleolar condition encountered in the Sciaridae...|$|R
40|$|Transfer RNA's were {{isolated}} from Euglena gracilis. Chloroplast <b>cistrons</b> for tRNA were quantitated by hybridizing tRNA to ct DNA. Species of tRNA hybridizing to ct DNA were partially purified by hybridization-chromatography. The tRNA's hybridizing to ct DNA and nuclear DNA {{appear to be}} different. Total cellular tRNA was hybridized to ct DNA to an equivalent of approximately 25 <b>cistrons.</b> The total cellular tRNA was also separated into 2 fractions by chromatography on dihydroxyboryl substituted amino ethyl cellulose. Fraction I hybridized to both nuclear and ct DNA. Hybridizations to ct DNA indicated approximately 18 <b>cistrons.</b> Fraction II-tRNA hybridized only to ct DNA, saturating {{at a level of}} approximately 7 <b>cistrons.</b> The tRNA from isolated chloroplasts hybridized to both chloroplast and nuclear DNA. The level of hybridization to ct DNA indicated approximately 18 <b>cistrons.</b> Fraction II-type tRNA could not be detected in the isolated chloroplasts...|$|R
2500|$|The gene {{encoding}} LepA {{is known}} to be the first <b>cistron</b> as part of a bicistron operon. [...] LepA is a polypeptide of 599 amino acids with a molecular weight of 67 kDa. [...] The amino acid sequence of LepA indicates that it is a G protein, which consists of five known domains. [...] The first four domains are strongly related to domains I, II, III, and V of primary elongation factor EF-G. [...] However, the last domain of LepA is unique. [...] This specific domain resides on the C-terminal end of the protein structure. [...] This arrangement of LepA has been observed in the mitochondria of yeast cells to human cells.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cistron</b> is an {{alternative}} term to a gene. The term <b>cistron</b> is used to emphasize that genes exhibit a specific behavior in a cis-trans test; distinct positions (or loci) within a genome are cistronic.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>cistron</b> {{was coined}} by Seymour Benzer {{in an article}} {{entitled}} The elementary units of heredity. The <b>cistron</b> was defined by an operational test applicable to most organisms that is {{sometimes referred to as}} a cis-trans test, but more often as a complementation test.|$|E
40|$|The catabolite {{repression}} caused by glucose and glucose- 6 -phosphate {{has been studied}} for both β-galactosidase and thiogalactoside transacetylase, {{the products of the}} operator proximal and distal <b>cistrons</b> of the lac operon, respectively. We find that both <b>cistrons</b> are affected coordinately by this form of repression. We also find that a single alteration at the lac promoter region is sufficient to abolish sensitivity to repression of both <b>cistrons.</b> From this, we conclude {{that there is only one}} target site for {{catabolite repression}} in the lac operon...|$|R
40|$|Watterson's (1975) {{formula for}} the {{steady-state}} {{distribution of the}} number of nucleotide differences between two randomly chosen <b>cistrons</b> in a finite population has been extended to transient states. The rate for the mean of this distribution to approach its equilibrium value is 1 / 2 N and independent of mutation rate, but that for the variance is dependent on mutation rate, where N denotes the effective population size. Numerical computations show that if the heterozygosity (i. e., the probability that two <b>cistrons</b> are different) is low, say of the order of 0. 1 or less, the probability that two <b>cistrons</b> differ at two or more nucleotide sites is less than 10 percent of the heterozygosity, whereas this probability may be as high as 50 percent of the heterozygosity if the heterozygosity is 0. 5. A simple estimate for the mean number (d) of site differences between <b>cistrons</b> is d = h/(1 - h) where h is the heterozygosity. At equilibrium, the probability that two <b>cistrons</b> differ by more than one site is equal to h 2, the square of heterozygosity...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{reported here}} involve temperature-sensitive mutations {{in two of}} five <b>cistrons</b> encoding 50 S ribosomal proteins that lie near the rif locus in Escherichia coli. I selected spontaneous TS+ mutants able to grow at elevated temperatures in which the TS+ event takes place outside this tract of <b>cistrons</b> near rif. Six distinct classes of extragenic suppressors were found, five {{of which have been}} mapped. Two of these suppressors lie near 64 min, a region known to be rich in <b>cistrons</b> ribosomal proteins (Dennis and Nomura, 1975). The remaining three extragenic suppressors were located near 16. 5, 47, and 86 min...|$|R

50|$|Overall, {{the genome}} is 10-15% longer than average potyvirus genome lengths; fittingly, <b>cistron</b> also is uniquely large in this virus. The virion is a long, flexuous, {{rod-shaped}} unit, and ranges from 810 to 865 nanometers in length.|$|E

Intracistronic and intercistronic quantitative complementation placed the mutants in 13 <b>cistrons,</b> and three-factor crosses {{have been used}} to assign an unambiguous order for 10 <b>cistrons.</b> Recombination frequencies have been presented for several regions of the genome to facilitate comparison of the sus system with the previously published temperature-sensitive mapping systems...|$|R
40|$|High-molecular-weight {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) of Saccharomyces carls bergensis has been {{fractionated}} by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The main DNA fraction has an {{average molecular weight}} of about 500 × 106. A major fraction of the DNA molecules containing sequences homologous to ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) sediments as material of this molecular weight. The remainder sediments as material of a molecular weight of about 250 × 106. The latter fraction contains relatively more ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> than the former. Studies on the buoyant density of high-molecular-weight DNA homologous to ribosomal RNA {{have led to the}} conclusion that the ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> occur in groups attached to a relatively large amount of nonribosomal RNA and suggest that ribosomal RNA <b>cistrons</b> are distributed over a number of yeast chromosomes...|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{suppose a}} {{mutation}} at a chromosome position [...] {{is responsible for}} a recessive trait in a diploid organism (where chromosomes come in pairs). We say that the mutation is recessive because the organism will exhibit the wild type phenotype (ordinary trait) unless both chromosomes of a pair have the mutation (homozygous mutation). Similarly, suppose a mutation at another position, , {{is responsible for the}} same recessive trait. The positions [...] and [...] are said to be within the same <b>cistron</b> when an organism that has the mutation at [...] on one chromosome and has the mutation at position [...] on the paired chromosome exhibits the recessive trait even though the organism is not homozygous for either mutation. When instead the wild type trait is expressed, the positions are said to belong to distinct cistrons / genes. It's important to know that <b>cistron</b> localization has been studied for several years, and, depending of the organism, this gene can be found in different places. For example, the gene can be found in RNA phage and is related to the <b>cistron</b> coat in some particular organisms. Some examples of the organisms that have been study are Tobacco, grapevine.|$|E
50|$|For example, an operon is {{a stretch}} of DNA that is {{transcribed}} to create a contiguous segment of RNA, but contains more than one <b>cistron</b> / gene. The operon {{is said to be}} polycistronic, whereas ordinary genes are said to be monocistronic.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years {{considerable}} information has accumulated on the organization of DNA in various classes of eukaryotic repetitive genes uch as riboso-mal RNA <b>cistrons</b> (Wellauer et al. 1974), 5 S RNA <b>cistrons</b> (Carroll and Brown 1976 a,b), transfer RNA <b>cistrons</b> (Clarkson and Kurer 1976), and the histone gene cluster (Kedes 1976; Schatfner et al, 1976; Gross et al. 1976).

50|$|All potyviruses are non-enveloped viruses with {{positive}} sense single-stranded RNA genomes. The SPFMV genome is approximately 10,820 bases long, varying slightly {{depending upon the}} specific strain. The majority of the SPFMV genome is one open reading frame, followed by a 3’ UTR and a poly(A) tail. The 3’ UTR exhibits secondary structure that {{may be involved in}} recognizing viral replicase. All potyviruses have 3’ poly(A) sequences, although they lack the cellular signal sequence for poly(A) tail addition. The encoded genes are P1, HC-Pro (helper component proteinase), P3, 6K1, CI, 6K2, NIa, NIb, and the coat protein <b>cistron,</b> which is found in a variety of other viruses.

40|$|Considerable {{antigenic}} and biochemical {{evidence has}} accumulated {{indicating that the}} four heavy chain subclasses of 7 G immunoglobulins are related to genes of at least four different <b>cistrons</b> (1 - 3). There are also striking structural similarities and a very close genetic linkage indicating that the subclass <b>cistrons</b> probably developed through relatively recent gene duplications. These four <b>cistrons</b> are under independent genetic control, since the rate of synthesis of the four corresponding subclass proteins is very different. Furthermore, various crossover events appear to have occurred among these <b>cistrons.</b> A number of gene complexes in separate population groups differ in the relationship of multiple Gm markers, {{some of which are}} known to involve more than one specific amino acid, as for example Gm(a) and "non-a, " and probably Gm(g), "non-g, " and Gm(n) (4, 5). Also, the unique 3 'G 1 molecule, Gm(f+a+), in Mongoloid populations has an Fd part like one type of Caucasian heavy chain, and an Fc part which is like another Caucasian type (6, 7).

40|$|The colorless alga Polytoma obtusum {{has been}} found to possess leucoplasts, and two kinds of ribosomes with {{sedimentation}} values of 73 S and 79 S. The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the 73 S but not the 79 S ribosomes was shown to hybridize with the leucoplast DNA (rho - 1. 682 g/ml). Nuclear DNA of Polytoma (rho = 1. 711) showed specific hybridization with rRNA from the 79 S ribosomes. Saturation hybridization indicated that only one copy of the rRNA <b>cistrons</b> was present per leucoplast genome, with an average buoyant density of rho = 1. 700. On the other hand, about 750 copies of the cytoplasmic rRNA <b>cistrons</b> were present per nuclear genome with a density of rho = 1. 709. Heterologous hybridization studies with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rRNAs showed an estimated 80 % homology between the two cytoplasmic rRNAs, but only a 50 % homology between chloroplast and leucoplast rRNAs of the two species. We conclude that the leucoplasts of Polytoma derive from chloroplasts of a Chlamydomonas-like ancestor, but that the leucoplast rRNA <b>cistrons</b> have diverged in evolution more extensively than the <b>cistrons</b> for cytoplasmic rRNA...|$|R
