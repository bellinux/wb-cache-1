5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet <b>clover,</b> {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet <b>clover</b> (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good <b>clover</b> stalks and damaged <b>clover</b> stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of <b>clover</b> hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E
5|$|S {{is about}} {{voyeurism}} {{as it relates}} to underground films. Interviews with horror film directors and Carol J. <b>Clover,</b> a writer on the horror genre, are weaved between clips from horror films. In the beginning of the film, clips show the directors and <b>Clover</b> commenting on a horror film that is not shown onscreen and with the title not mentioned. The film then moves on to Petty's meetings with Eric Rost (Erik Marcisak), Bill Zebub, and Fred Vogel. He interviews these men and actress Debbie D., while clips from horror films and facts and opinions provided by <b>Clover</b> about the genre are interspersed.|$|E

40|$|In the agro-pastoral ecotone of {{northern}} China, two exotic sweet <b>clovers</b> have spread widely and have significant impacts on local animal husbandry, vegetation {{and the visual}} landscape. In order to evaluate the invasion mechanism of these exotic plants in a farmland-grassland ecosystem, a line-transect survey was conducted and field sampling was undertook in August of 2011. The results showed that land use patterns markedly influenced the distribution and dispersal of exotic sweet <b>clovers</b> in a farmland-grassland ecosystem and sweet <b>clovers</b> grew well in hay-making grassland but growth was restricted in farmland and free-grazing grassland. Environmental parameters may be also the important factors in the invasion process. Distance affected the distribution of exotic sweet <b>clovers.</b> When comparing farmland and grassland, {{the density of the}} plants declined significantly with increasing distance from the interface between farmland and grassland. Prevailing winds may also be a trigger factor that facilitated the distribution and dispersal of the two exotic sweet <b>clovers.</b> There was a higher density of sweet <b>clovers</b> in a downwind direction than in an upwind direction in the grassland ecosystem. Furthermore, competition with native plants may affect the establishment and development of the two exotic sweet <b>clovers.</b> The dominant species, Chinese leymus (Leymus chinensis), had a negative correlation with the two exotic sweet <b>clovers</b> for above-ground biomass. The native dicotyledonous plant, Saussurea runcinata, had a positive effect on the biomass of the two exotic sweet <b>clovers.</b> Th...|$|R

5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When red <b>clover</b> was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and <b>clover</b> seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red <b>clover</b> was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E

His siblings, Janet Hamilton Edmiston and 	Herbert William Edmiston had also immigrated to Canada. In <b>Clover</b> Bar, he was named justice of the peace, {{and served as a}} trustee in the local school board.|$|E

40|$|<b>Clovers</b> are a novel {{mechanism}} for object-oriented languages that relax {{the constraints of}} the conventional type/instance distinction. <b>Clovers</b> provide a new definition of objecthood, in which a single object may consist of multiple overlapping representations, sharing aspects of both behavior and identity. We show how <b>clovers</b> can be used to implement multiple views, changes to the type of an object, and expanded type notions such as minimal template. We argue that <b>clovers</b> provide a useful unification of the type/instance relaxations that have been presented in the literature, such as versioning, prototypes, and boolean classes. ...|$|R

5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and <b>clover),</b> opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of <b>clover</b> was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf <b>clover.</b> Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a <b>clover</b> until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf <b>clover</b> Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that there are approximately 10,000 three-leaf <b>clovers</b> for every four-leaf clover; even so, this probability has not deterred collectors who have reached records as high as 160,000 four-leaf <b>clovers</b> in a lifetime. However, the world record for four-leaf <b>clovers</b> in a single day is 72, and the record for one hour is 51, set by an American named Griffin McDowell on August 12, 2013.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, a bonus was introduced to reward farmers who retained their best bulls, even though they were not productive. The increase in weight of the animals began with improved grassland.

Vineyards affected by phylloxera were also being returned to pasture.|$|E
