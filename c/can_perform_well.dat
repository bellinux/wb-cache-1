She steals the money that Chanda has been collecting {{to pay for the}} math tuition and spends it all on food and new clothes. This devastates Chanda, who becomes depressed when Apu tells her that the money was not hard-earned. Chanda stops attending school and continues to work with the hope that Apu will join the Indian Administrative Service, after she is inspired by a kind District Commissioner (Sanjay Suri). In the meantime, Amar helps Apu realize her mistake by making her witness Chanda working at the restaurant. Apu rekindles her interest in school and begins to treat her mother with respect, having realized that she <b>can</b> <b>perform</b> <b>well</b> if she possesses the will.

We also incorporate an efficient heuristic named entity list searching process into the framework of statistical model in order to improve both the performance and the adaptability of the statistical NER system.
