60|$|Secondly: {{the most}} usual bed on the clay-slate is a coarse, white, {{slightly}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerate,</b> of no great thickness, including broken crystals of feldspar, grains of quartz, and numerous pebbles of brecciated claystone porphyry, {{but without any}} pebbles of the underlying clay-slate. I nowhere saw the actual junction between this bed and the clay-slate, though I spent a whole day in endeavouring to discover their relations. In some places I distinctly saw the white conglomerate and overlying beds inclined at from 25 to 30 degrees to the west, and {{at the bottom of}} the same mountain, the clay-slate and grauwacke inclined to the same point, but at an angle from 70 to 80 degrees: in one instance, the clay-slate dipped not only at a different angle, but to a different point from the overlying formation. In these cases the two formations certainly appeared quite unconformable: moreover, I found in the clay-slate one great, vertical, dike-like fissure, filled up with an indurated whitish tuff, quite similar to some of the upper beds presently to be described; and this shows that the clay-slate must have been consolidated and dislocated before their deposition. On the other hand, the stratification of the slate and grauwacke, in some cases gradually and entirely disappeared in approaching the overlying white conglomerate; in other cases the stratification of the two formations became strictly conformable; and again in other cases, there was some tolerably well characterised clay-slate lying above the conglomerate. (The coarse, mechanical structure of many grauwackes has always appeared to me a difficulty; for the texture of the associated clay-slate and the nature of the embedded organic remains where present, indicate that the whole has been a deep-water deposit. Whence have the sometimes included angular fragments of clay-slate, and the rounded masses of quartz and other rocks, been derived? Many deep-water limestones, it is well known, have been brecciated, and then firmly recemented.) The most probable conclusion appears to be, that after the clay-slate formation had been dislocated and tilted, but whilst under the sea, a fresh and more recent deposition of clay-slate took place, on which the white conglomerate was conformably deposited, with here and there a thin intercalated bed of clay-slate. On this view the white conglomerates and the presently to be described tuffs and lavas are really unconformable to the main part of the clay-slate; and this, as we have seen, certainly is the case with the clay-stone lavas in the valley of Canota, at the western and opposite base of the range.|$|E

At the same depth the mottling of the abrasion platform by karstic dissolution probably occurred during the last glacial regression. -from Author...|$|R
30|$|The summary {{analysis}} of the stratigraphic column {{of the study area}} shows the presence of three aquiferous formations among them the formation of plio-quaternary one. This aquifer of great extension occupies the major part of the tectonic depression, limited at the West and at the East by two great faults of NW–SE orientation. It is consisted very varied deposits such as, alluvial fans, silts, <b>calcareous</b> crust, <b>conglomerates,</b> and gravels. This aquifer {{plays an important role in}} the supply of drinking water for the inhabitants of this area (Fehdi et al. 2008).|$|R
50|$|The Nam Phong Formation is the basal {{unit of the}} Khorat Group. It {{consists}} of resistant, red-brown micaceous sandstones, conglomerates, siltstone and mudstone of mainly fluvial origin. The sandstones are medium to very fine-grained and are usually <b>calcareous.</b> The <b>conglomerates</b> contain pebbles of quartz, brown and grey chert, and reddish brown siltstone. Cross bedding and plane-bed stratification are common in the sandstones and conglomerates. The sandstones and conglomerates make up approximately 30% of the formation. This sedimentary rock formation is found in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. It is of Norian to Rhaetian age (Upper Triassic) to (Lower Jurassic) age, and is notable for its fossils of early dinosaurs.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to present}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerate</b> {{deposits}}, {{which have been}} taken as perigacial deposits related with slope evolution during Pleistocene cold periods. The studied deposits are located in a small tectonic depression near Tapeus. The outcrops show two main units: i) one at the bottom showing <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerate</b> with clast imbrication and planar structures that could indicate a northwestward palaeoflow; ii) at the top we can observe a red poligenic sandy silt deposit interbeded with small conglomeratic lenses composed by poorly sorted angular gravel elements of limestone. These are sedimentary and stratigraphic characteristics of typical deposits associated with {{the evolution of a}} slope under periglacial conditions. The preservation of the deposit is due to its location in a small depression (graben), which results from activity related with the tectonic evolution of the Sicó Massif. This also justifies the restrict geographic distribution of this deposits since they are confined to the small depression...|$|E
40|$|Though beachrock has not so {{far been}} known in the Japanese Islands {{excepted}} with the southern islands of Kagoshima Prefecture, the writer unexpectedly discovered it from Narushima (lat. 32 ° 51 ′N. and long 128 ° 53 ′ 36 ″E.) in the Goto Islands of Nagasaki Prefecture. Coral reefs with which beachrock is frequently accompanied have not {{been seen in the}} Goto Islands. The beachrock is a statified <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerate</b> firmly cemented by calcareous shell sands, being found in the intertidal zone of a beach. The strike is various with the dips of a gentle angle as shown in figure 9 of the Japanese text. In this paper the writer described beachrock based upon the field investigations and discussed the process of of cementation of beachrock. This recent <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerate</b> was named the Ikezuka conglomerate bed. It seems to have been formed about three to four thousand years ago as the writer found fragments of the Jomon earthenware of the neolithic age...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of the}} reported Pleistocene species of and Lagoinhas (Santa Maria Island, Azores) is provided, new data increasing the marine molluscan fauna to 95 taxa (80 Gastropoda and 15 Bivalvia). Six of the reported taxa are considered dubious records (5 Gastropoda, 1 Bivalvia). The stratigraphic sequence of Praia Formosa is composed of two main units, about 2 - 4 meters above present-day sea level. In the lower unit, Patella ulyssiponensis dominates the fossil assemblage of the basal <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerate</b> while Myoforceps arustatus (Dillwyn, 1817) dominates the assemblage associated to a calcareous algae mat. Above a non-depositional hiatus surface, a sandy beach deposit mainly composes the upper unit. Its fossil assemblages are dominated by large amounts of Eruilin castanea (Montagu, 1803) and, in a less extent, Lucinella diwricntn (Linnaeus, 1758) and Ensis minor (Chenu, 1843). The stratigraphic sequence of Lagoinhas, located 7. 4 m above present-day sea level, is also composed of two units. A basal conglomerate is fossilized by or passes laterally to a calcareous algae mat, dominated by Myoforceps aristatus and with abundant Calliostoma pecimens. As at Prainha, these lower units are covered by a highly fossiliferous sandy bach deposit, though thinner, in which Ervlie castanea is the dominant species. Some species with Caribbean or West African affinities, the "Strombus bubonius accompanying fauna" (Garcia-Talavera, 1990), {{were found in the}} lower layers. The upper layer malacofauna is mainly related to the Mediterranean faunas, similarly to what happens nowadays (Ávila, 2000) ...|$|E
50|$|The Lotena Formation is a {{geologic}} formation dated from the Late Callovian to Early Oxfordian in the Neuquén Basin in Mendoza Province, Argentina. The formation, first defined by Weaver in 1931 and named after Cerro Lotena, consists of fluvial <b>conglomerates,</b> <b>calcareous</b> sandstones and marine limestones and shales. The Lotena Formation is overlain by the La Manga Formation and overlies the Lajas Formation of the Cuyo Group.|$|R
60|$|The Cumbre, {{where the}} road crosses it, is, {{according}} to Mr. Pentland, 12,454 feet above the sea; and the neighbouring peaks, composed of dark purple and whitish porphyries, some obscurely stratified with a westerly dip, and others {{without a trace of}} stratification, must exceed 13,000 feet in height. Descending the eastern slope of the Cumbre, the structure becomes very complicated, and generally differs on {{the two sides of the}} east and west line of road and section. First we come to a great mass [A] of nearly vertical, singularly contorted strata, composed of highly compact red sandstones, and of often <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> and penetrated by green, yellow, and reddish dikes; but I shall presently have an opportunity of describing in some detail an analogous pile of strata. These vertical beds are abruptly succeeded by others [B], of apparently nearly the same nature but more metamorphosed, alternating with porphyries and limestones; these dip for a short space westward, but there has been here an extraordinary dislocation, which, on the north side of the road, appears to have determined the excavation of the north and south valley of the R. de las Cuevas. On this northern side of the road, the strata [B] are prolonged till they come in close contact with a jagged lofty mountain [D] of dark- coloured, unstratified, intrusive porphyry, where the beds have been more highly inclined and still more metamorphosed. This mountain of porphyry seems to form a short axis of elevation, for south of the road in its line there is a hill [C] of porphyritic conglomerate with absolutely vertical strata.|$|R
40|$|In paper several {{selected}} {{specimens of}} sedentary Polychaetes of species Rotularia spirulaea (Lamarck, 1818) are presented. They {{were found in}} Middel Eocene – Lutetian <b>calcareous</b> breccias and <b>conglomerates,</b> respectively olistostromes,below the village of Gračišće near Pazin in Istria (Croatia). The rare individuals are of various shapes and sizes, and they occur among numerous nummulitines, corals, molluscs, echinoderms, bryozoans, lithothamnias and other fossil remains. The mentioned rocks and their contents are constituting parts of the Istrian Paleogene basins, in this istance of the Pazin flysch basin...|$|R
40|$|The “Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum” (PETM), is {{understood}} to be an extreme and short-lived (ca. 150 - 220 kya) global warming event that occurred 55. 8 million years ago and during which global annual temperatures are estimated to have increased by ca. 5 - 8 ◦C, with respect to sea surface temperatures and ca. 4 - 5 ◦C, {{with respect to the}} deep sea. A remaining outstanding question is: in addition to the global increase in temperature, how was precipitation perturbed during the event, and how did fluvial surface processes respond to the perturbation? In the southern Spanish Pyrenees, the Paleocene succession of the Tremp-Graus Basin is made up of the Talarn (Danian) and Esplugafreda (Thanetian) red bed formations. The Esplugafreda section is composed of approximately 250 m of reddish paleosols and contains numerous lenticular bodies of calcareous conglomerates, which are interpreted as braided channels. The Esplugafreda Formation is overlain by the Claret Conglomerate— an extensive sheet-like unit which ranges in thickness between 1 m and 4 m of clast-supported <b>calcareous</b> <b>conglomerate</b> and pebbly calcarenites and is interpreted as marking the fluvial response to a dramatic climate change, {{in the form of the}} transformation of a braided river and floodplain system into an enormous conglomeratic braided plain (formed over at least 2000 km 2 conservatively) due to dramatic change in the hydrologic cycle. The conglomerate unit ends abruptly and is overlaid by fine-grained yellowish soils which are mainly made up of silty mudstones with abundant small size carbonate nodules suggesting another shift in the hydrological cycle after the PETM. Here we present paleo-channel geometry and grain size data collected in the southern Pyrenees (Tremp, Aren, and Serraduy sections) that we invert to reconstruct paleoflow conditions during the Paleocene and during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Event. We confront paleohydraulic results with sea level, isotope and litholog- ical records in order to understand river response to the PETM climate change and try to assess the possible precipitation perturbations at the PETM in the study area and how these are transferred into the sedimentary record...|$|E
50|$|In the Neogene orogeny (mountain building) started again. As {{the ground}} was {{deformed}} <b>conglomerate,</b> <b>calcareous</b> sandstone, limestone, and calcareous turbidites appeared. During the orogeny from Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene {{the ground was}} shortened (compressed) by 50%. On the southeast of Majorca overturned folds were produced in the Late Oligocene to Langhian. In the Middle and Late Miocene (mostly Serravallian) the ground was stretched (extended) and faults formed and created basins. In the Late Miocene they filled with water and sediment. After the orogen, limestone marl and calcareous sandstone were added. Later in the Pliocene till now contraction has taken place again.|$|R
30|$|The Hulien {{observation}} well in eastern Taiwan {{is located at}} the Hulien meteorological observation station, which is administered by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Taiwan. The HUL well is located on the trace of the surface rupture caused by the 1951 Hulien Earthquake, whose magnitude (ML) was 7.1. HUL was chosen for monitoring large earthquakes in the eastern Taiwan seismic zone. CWB carries out geodetic, seismological, and meteorological observations, as well as GPS, at the same location. These integrated observations will provide information on the relationship between the groundwater level and the crustal deformation related to seismic events. The geology of HUL is mostly composed of thick <b>calcareous</b> sandstone and <b>conglomerates</b> with good cementation.|$|R
40|$|Basement rocks {{within the}} southeastern Tararua Range belong to two associations: a {{sedimentary}} association (greywacke, argillite, <b>calcareous</b> siltstone, <b>conglomerate</b> and olistostrome) and a volcanogenic association (metabasite, chert, red argillite and limestone). Rocks of the sedimentary association are more abundant {{and have been}} deposited by turbidity currents and debris flows in a deep water, marine environment. Three turbidite and two intercalated non-turbidite lithofacies are recognized. Sedimentological {{data suggest that the}} sediment was deposited in a submarine fan system (mid-fan environment), probably in a trench. The alternating greywacke-argillite beds have detrital compositions which are essentially quartzo-feldspathic. Framework mode and geochemical analyses indicate that the sediment was derived from an active continental margin that was shedding detritus of mainly acid-volcanic and metamorphic origin. Rocks of the volcanogenic association, although volumetrically minor, are widely distributed. Geochemical analyses of metabasites suggest that they were erupted in an oceanic environment, both at a mid-ocean ridge and an intra-plate setting. The presence of radiolaria skeletons in red argillite and chert indicates a hemiplagic depositional environment for these rocks. Rocks of the volcanogenic association often have conformable contacts. These rocks have a related depositional environment and represent seafloor material. Where observed, contacts between rocks of the two associations are always faulted. Deformation in the field area is characterized by development of the following types of structures: several generations of folds, faults at both a low angle and high angle to bedding, shear foliation and melange. The region has undergone the following deformational events, outlined from oldest to youngest: 1) folding with at least two fold generations present. 2) fragmentation and disruption of the beds by faults. Low-angle to bedding faults and high-angle to bedding faults have disrupted the bedding. Where these structures have occurred to a great extent, a chaotically disrupted unit, melange, has formed. 3) post-melange folding. 4) recent faulting related to the present strike-slip regime in New Zealand. Rocks have undergone prehnite-pumpellyite facies metamorphism. The rock types, their field relationships and the deformation that the area has undergone is consistent with accretion at a convergent plate margin. Radiolaria were extracted from two red chert samples. In the study the radiolaria define a Middle Jurassic age, which indicates that the sediments in the southeastern Tararua Range must be of Middle Jurassic in age or younger (possibly Cretaceous). A similar sample from the Manawatu Gorge {{to the north of the}} study area contained radiolaria of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age. Sediments in both areas therefore belong to fossil zone 5 (Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous) of MacKinnon (1983) ...|$|R
