40|$|AbstractRecently, {{composites}} made of thermosetting epoxy matrix {{reinforced by}} glass fibers {{have been widely}} used for advanced engineering and aerospace applications. This study newly proposes a developed methodology to manufacture a glass-fiber/epoxy resin <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> of a small 1 kW wind generator system. The improved mechanical properties of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> are verified in a series of systematic experiments. The study focuses on the responses of applying a torsional loading to a long straight member such as the root of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade.</b> The core aluminum shaft was wrapped in glass-fiber/epoxy to form the root of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> and a <b>composite</b> shaft. The composite shaft is a sandwich structure combining glass-fiber/epoxy and an aluminum shaft. The composite shaft was placed in a torsional testing machine and a strain gage monitored the strain on the composite shaft. We considered the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> to have a circular cross section and determined both stress distribution within the member and the angle of twist. Finally, mechanical properties were obtained in torsional testing, including the relationship between applied torque and the angle of twist on the composite shaft. The torsional loading and failure locations of the blade root were measured experimentally. The experiments showed that the weakest location of the blade root is at the interface of the aluminum shaft and glass-fiber/epoxy lay-ups in the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> root. It is found that the quality of the aluminum shaft, the glass-fiber/epoxy layers around the shaft and the bonding at the interface between the shaft and the layers should be increased to improve the torsional strength of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade.</b> These results can provide a reference for analysts and designers of small wind turbine systems...|$|R

Fiber has to be oriented in the loading direction while designing the <b>composite</b> propeller <b>blade.</b> The blade geometry and design are more complex involving many controlling parameters. In the present work a methodology to design a composite propeller to analyze its strength and deformation using ANSYS software.

40|$|In this paper, {{the finite}} element method is used to study the dynamic {{behavior}} of the damaged rotating <b>composite</b> <b>blade.</b> Three dimensional, finite element programs were developed using a nine node laminated shell as a discretization element for the blade structure (the same element type is used for damaged and non-damaged structure). In this analysis the initial stress effect (geometric stiffness) and other rotational effects except the carioles acceleration effect are included. The investigation covers the effect speed of rotation, aspect ratio, skew angle, pre-twist angle, radius to length, layer lamination and fiber orientation of <b>composite</b> <b>blade.</b> After modeling a non-damaged rotating <b>composite</b> <b>blade,</b> the work procedure was to apply different damage cases {{in reference to the}} non-damaged structure in order to compute the shift in the fundamental natural frequency and stresses. Damage occurs in several layers of the composite sheet in different locations throughout its volume, and through several layers of the sheet. The numerical results show a good agreement compared with the available investigations using other methods...|$|R
