40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} contact {{location}} information on virtual edge perception {{was investigated in}} two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants discriminated edge sharpness under force-alone and force-plus-contact-location conditions using a 4. 8 mm radius <b>contact</b> <b>roller.</b> Virtual objects were 2 D profiles of edges with two adjoining surfaces. For both conditions, the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in change of edge radius increased from 2. 3 to 7. 4 mm as edge radii increased from 2. 5 to 20. 0 mm; {{there was no significant}} difference between the two conditions. A follow-up experiment with contact location alone resulted in higher edge sharpness JNDs. In Experiment 2, the same edge sharpness discrimination task was performed using a smaller <b>contact</b> <b>roller</b> (R = 1. 5 mm) to investigate the effect of roller size. The JNDs for the smaller roller were not statistically significant from those of the larger roller. Our results suggest that 1) contact location cues alone are capable of conveying edge sharpness information, but that force cues are dominant when both types of cues are available; and 2) the radius of the <b>contact</b> <b>roller</b> does not significantly affect the user’s ability to discriminate edge sharpness, indicating that the participants could use the changes in contact location to judge curvature.

The MCVT is particularly applicable to very high power density applications or those with very demanding packaging constraints, due primarily to the existence of multiple traction contacts on each of the rolling elements.

This lead to the further development and testing of a 2 nd prototype MCVT rated to 60 kW, however the design target of this device was not achieved and performance was hampered by a loss of traction capacity compared to the design specification.

40|$|Roller derby is a growing, popular sport, where teams {{compete on}} roller skates, and where rules allow ‘blocking’ and full body <b>contact.</b> <b>Roller</b> derby is {{primarily}} played by women, with men restricted to support roles during its revival {{stage in the}} early 2000 s. However, men and gender diverse skaters are increasingly playing the sport, in mixed/co-ed leagues and Men’s teams. This has created deep divisions within the derby community regarding the role of men in a women’s space and the playing of a full-contact sport with men against women on the track. The tensions within derby highlight the wider gendered problems in sport regarding perceptions of athletic ability, strength and capability. Drawing on an ethnographic methodology, we present a range of perspectives from derby players and counter-point their lived experiences with the structural constraints on gender enforced by the governing bodies with the sport Women’s Flat Track Derby Association and Men’s Roller Derby Association. We explicitly engage from a radically inclusive position inspired by Hargreaves’ call for sport to challenge gendered notions of capability. Full Tex...|$|E

Furthermore, the results of the technique have been applied to develop a design tool based on multi dimensional response surface models of pertinent transmission performance criteria. The use of the design tool is then demonstrated to derive future geometry iterations of the MCVT based on the tradeoffs between efficiency, ratio range and transmission life requirements.

40|$|The Milner {{continuously}} variable transmission (MCVT) is a traction drive transmission based on rolling contacts analogous {{to those found in}} angular <b>contact</b> <b>roller</b> bearings. The MCVT is applicable to very high power density applications or those with demanding packaging constraints, due primarily to the existence of multiple traction contacts on each of the rolling elements. The transmission has been modeled analytically and then Design of Experiments (DoE) techniques have been applied to create response surface model sets describing performance criteria over a wide range of design input factors. The response surface models have then been interrogated to find optimal solutions. The results show {{that it is possible to}} create a transmission with a significantly higher ratio range (10 : 1), compared with 5 : 1 that is typical for existing designs. The results also indicated that the traction patch spin factor could also be reduced over the existing designs and it is hypothesized that this should lead to an increase in efficiency. Finally, research into the stresses set up by the rolling contact indicated that stress is highest at the greatest reductions in ratio and that maximum stress appears to be proportional to the ratio range of the transmission. Hence a design optimization tool has been developed allowing engineers to rapidly optimize geometries of the MCVT to achieve desired trade-offs between ratio range, ratio position, transmission life/durability and transmission efficiency...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInternal radial {{clearance}} (IRC) in roller bearings {{must be kept}} to a minimum to avoid non-synchronous vibration (NSV). However, tight IRC increases the risk of bearing durability so that initial clearance is often on the high side and then reduced if necessary when problems with NSV are detected.
