40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between CEO turnover and firm performance in China’s listed firms. The study examines how the sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance is moderated by the private <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms,</b> the presence <b>of</b> a majority shareholder {{and the presence of}} independent directors on the board. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of about 1200 Chinese firms per year from 1999 to 2006 we find significant changes in the ownership and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> The private <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> and the fraction of independent directors on the board have increased considerably over time. The study finds a significant negative association between CEO turnover and firm performance consistent with the agency model. There is evidence that the CEO turnover sensitivity for poor performance is greater in firms that are privately controlled, or have a majority shareholder, or have a greater fraction of independent directors on the board. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support for the agency model and the importance of internal corporate governance to attenuate agency costs. It provides important insights into firm governance in transition economies. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the design of internal corporate governance within transition economies...|$|R

The {{aim of the research}} is to assess the degree and the directions <b>of</b> changes in <b>control</b> patterns <b>of</b> industrial <b>firms</b> in Italy. The data show that ownership concentration, as measured by various indicators, is high and that direct family <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> is prevalent. Separation between ownership and control is limited. Financial institutions (including private equity) rarely own capital stakes or play a role in <b>controlling</b> non-financial <b>firms.</b> Ownership <b>of</b> a <b>firm</b> by another firm is widespread, especially for bigger firms; ultimate owners are usually families. Foreign ownership and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Italian <b>firms</b> is growing. Overall, relatively small changes in the patterns <b>of</b> ownership and <b>control</b> have occurred over the decade (1993 - 2003). The market for corporate control has not developed significantly; it remains based on personal contacts. Financial institutions do not play a relevant role in it; transactions are usually mediated by legal and accounting professionals. Many firms will deal with generational transfers <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in the near future. ownership structure, control, control transfers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{aspects of}} the evolution <b>of</b> ownership and <b>control</b> in global industries from 1960. The existing literature usually uses the largest firms in industrialized countries, to provide generalizations about national systems of corporate governance. In practice, this characterization {{is far from being}} comprehensive. For example, global industries which are not dominant in countries’ economies – such as alcoholic beverages – are overlooked. Including such overlooked cases, this study suggests that there is a broader range of combinations <b>of</b> ownership and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> than is usually considered. Regardless of national systems of corporate governance, family ownership may remain very important in some industries. Industry-specific factors, such as brands and marketing knowledge in alcoholic beverages, help explain why the predominant ownership and <b>control</b> structures <b>of</b> global <b>firms</b> are distinct from those that characterize their countries of origin. ...|$|R

Conditioning on his optimal behavior, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> risk increases the expected time to exercise for his employee stock options. It also reduces the percentage gap between his certainty equivalent and the firm’s fair value for his compensation, but that gap remains substantial. Managerial control also causes traded options to exhibit an implied volatility smile. ...|$|R
