2500|$|For the 2001 model year, a {{redesigned}} coupe {{version of}} the TL was introduced, the 3.2CL. While it was mechanically identical to the TL, its sales never came close to that of its sibling model, and as a result, it was discontinued in May 2003. The 2001 added one feature that the 2000 did not have, a new redesigned <b>cupholder</b> insert. The automatic transmission {{in many of these}} cars were also defective. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to [...] or 7.75 years for all 99 to 02 and 03 partial per VIN. Acura dealers replace the transmissions under warranty. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. Transmissions replaced on 3/2005 and later include a redesigned 3rd gear clutch pack reported to fix the problem.|$|E

5000|$|Terms like PEBKAC or and ID10T error {{are often}} used by tech support {{operators}} and computer experts to describe a user error as a problem that is attributed to the user's ignorance instead of {{a software or hardware}} malfunction.

A dual child seat with a swing-up tray was {{also included in the}} design, as well as a <b>cupholder,</b> a scanner to skip the checkout line and steerable back wheels for maneuverability.

50|$|Some retailers, such as Target, {{have begun}} using carts fully made of {{recycled}} plastic {{with the only}} metal part being the wheel axles, drawing away from the established metal cart design. Target's cart has won design awards for its improved casters, interchangeable plastic parts to simplify repairs, and handles that improve maneuverability. Other cart designs also incorporate additional features such as a <b>cupholder</b> for cold or hot drinks or a bouquet of flowers, along with other features such as a secure shelf for a tablet computer or mobile phone to allow the use of mobile coupons and circulars, or as seen in an all-plastic design created for the Wisconsin-based Festival Foods and also used by Whole Foods Market by Bemis Manufacturing Company, all of these features, along with extra rungs on the side rail designed to attach plastic bags or carry handles for beverages. Smaller half-sized carts for smaller shopping trips have also become common.|$|E
5000|$|Among the Aerotech III's [...] "concept" [...] {{features}} were digital instrumentation, head-up display, four leather-trimmed reclining bucket seats with a center console which ran the whole {{length of the}} interior cabin.

2500|$|As {{with the}} exterior, the {{interior}} was completely redesigned with a more conservative style, although some features from the previous cars were carried over. The dashboard had a more linear appearance, instead of curving around the driver. The [...] "Integrated Control Panel" [...] was carried over but enlarged, reshaped, {{and placed in the}} center of the dash instead of being tilted toward the driver. The Flip-Fold center console was also carried over but it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had different <b>cupholders</b> and storage areas. Unlike previous Tauruses, this one offered rear <b>cupholders</b> that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.|$|R
25|$|In the interior, the rear-seat and {{headliner}} are redesigned to {{add more}} rear legroom and headroom, improving comfort, additional sound insulation is added and the <b>cupholders</b> are larger. A rear camera and a 16-gigabyte flash card system now comes with the Navi system. Furthermore, the gauge cluster is refreshed.|$|R
50|$|The European and British {{versions}} {{were installed}} with standard headlight washers and rear fog lights, so that other drivers {{could see them}} in inclement weather and at night. European models also received glass-lens halogen headlights that could have the distance the light was projected adjusted from an electric switch installed on the dashboard, and also received speed sensitive, variable effort power steering, and both items were standard installed. The Australian-spec sedan and wagon were equipped with the rear fog light, but not the headlight washers. The British and Europeans could also install a front bumper bull bar and an 8 mm thick steel sump guard that extended from the bottom edge of the front bumper to the front suspension. The Europeans could not get an in-dash <b>cupholder</b> located in the small space below the HVAC controls and above the stereo, found in the Australian, USA and Japanese models. In that location instead is a clock, and a button to deploy an electric radio antenna, if so equipped. Clocks are integrated with the OEM stereo internationally.|$|E
50|$|The JDM GTX model {{featured}} four-wheel drive, viscous {{limited slip}} differentials and a turbocharged 1.8 L BP engine. In the U.S. the Protegé {{came with a}} 1.8 L SOHC non-turbocharged engine, along with 4WD. The JDM GT-R rally homologation version was added in 1992, featuring a number of enhancements over the GTX model: an aggressive front bumper, grill and bonnet vents, updated rear bumper, wheel flares, stiffer suspension and anti-roll bars with thicker cross members, and homologated five-stud wheel hubs with larger brakes. The interior was fitted with leather and suede seats, and {{had the option of}} replacing the <b>cupholder</b> with a 3 gauge cluster. In addition, the GTR has stronger connecting rods and pistons, larger oil squirters, larger nose crank, larger oil cooler, sodium filled valves, a baffled inlet manifold, larger injectors (from 360cc (black) to 440cc (orange)), removed boost cut, front-mounted intercooler, and an IHI VJ-23 ball bearing water-cooled turbocharger. Both the GTX and GTR models were limited to a top speed of 180kph. However, removing a screw {{on the back of the}} instrument cluster, labeled 180kph, meant that the speed limiter was removed.|$|E
5000|$|Concerning the design, Lancia's chief {{designer}} said [...] "People will {{be looking}} for excuses not to buy this car. So, we wanted to be damn sure we didn't give them anything to hook onto." [...] To that end the car was intended to match the substance of the Audi A6 and Mercedes E-class. It was fitted with more technology and [...] "more style". To convince buyers it was also priced to be 15% cheaper than the competition. In the view of motoring writer Paul Horrell of the UK's CAR Magazine the shape was [...] "controversial, but certainly regenerates an authentic Italian alternative to the po-faced approach" [...] of the competition. [...] "Look at that extravagant front end, like a row of chrome-decorated sand dunes. The whole form is plump and carries telling details of bi-xenon headlights and multi-LED blades of tail-lamp - a comfortably fed and well-jewelled car like the folk who'll drive it." [...] Discussing the interior, Horrell went on to say: [...] "The effect is redoubled within. The cabin is truly rich, and walks the right side of that line in Italian style dividing the perfectly proportioned minimalism from their bling-bling rap-star Versace vulgarity.". A notable feature of the interior was the use of high quality, lightly varnished wood trim and cast magnesium for the centre console."I can't tell you," [...] wrote Horrell [...] "how much more satisfying it is to use a <b>cupholder</b> or ashtray that glides out of solid metal than some clacky plastic lid." [...] After describing the engraved glassware of the instruments which were notable for their needles [...] "floating at depth" [...] CAR concluded that [...] "it felt expensive." ...|$|E
50|$|Hot Rod Magazine {{tested the}} car in April 2011, and were {{generally}} positive. They praised the car's reliability and driveability, although David Freiburger criticized {{the placement of the}} fly-by-wire throttle, and both testers criticized the <b>cupholders.</b> In 2012, it was featured on an episode of Jay Leno's Garage.|$|R

50|$|The 3.5-litre {{engine that}} powered the KF series Verada was {{identical}} to that fitted to the KE series.
