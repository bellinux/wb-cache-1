5|$|During the {{suspension}} of competitive football in the First World War, Hyde Road was used to stable 300horses. Later in the wartime period the club became the sole leaseholder of the ground, no longer dependent upon support from Chesters brewery. At this point the annual rent was £500. In 1920, the ground became the first football venue outside London to be visited by a reigning monarch; King George V attended the ground to watch a match between Manchester City and Liverpool. In November a fire caused by a <b>cigarette</b> <b>end</b> destroyed the Main Stand, and Manchester City began to seek a new home. Initial discussions {{raised the possibility of}} sharing Old Trafford with neighbours Manchester United, but United's proposed rent was prohibitive, so repair work was undertaken and Manchester City continued to play at Hyde Road.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Blow!" [...] he said, at last, and then, viciously, [...] "Blow!" [...] and so {{rose and}} flung away his <b>cigarette</b> <b>end,</b> and pursued his reluctant, dubiating way towards the really quite uncongenial splendours of the Royal Grand....|$|E
6000|$|... "I must," [...] said Kipps, nodding {{his head}} slowly with raised eyebrows. He looked at his <b>cigarette</b> <b>end</b> and threw it into the fender. He was {{beginning}} to think he was holding his own in this conversation rather well, after all.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the dustiest place I {{was ever}} in," [...] said the voice. [...] "It's inches deep everywhere. It's full of <b>cigarette</b> <b>ends,</b> too. I must tell uncle. Oh, here it is. Kidnapping--penalties--" ...|$|R

60|$|At {{this point}} of the recital his {{companion}} rose softly, flung his <b>cigarette</b> <b>end</b> into the little water-bowl, and passed into the further swelter room. Cornelian Valpy was left, still clothed in a look of ineffable complacency, still engaged, in all probability, in reclothing himself in the finery of the previous evening.|$|E
6000|$|All {{communication}} trenches are tortuous {{and practically}} endless. On an offensive front they have vertical sides of unsupported earth and occasional soakaways for rain, covered by wooden gratings, {{and they go}} on and on and on. At rare intervals they branch, and a notice board says [...] "To Regent Street," [...] or [...] "To Oxford Street," [...] or some such lie. It is all just trench. For a time you talk, but talking in single file soon palls. You cease to talk, and trudge. A great number of telephone wires come into the trench and cross and recross it. You cannot keep clear of them. Your helmet pings against them and they try to remove it. Sometimes you have to stop and crawl under wires. Then you wonder what the trench is like in really wet weather. You hear a shell burst at no great distance. You pass two pages of The Strand Magazine. Perhaps thirty yards on you pass a <b>cigarette</b> <b>end.</b> After these sensational incidents the trench quiets down again and continues to wind endlessly--just a sandy, extremely narrow vertical walled trench. A giant crack.|$|E
50|$|Cigarette litter {{continues}} to be a problem outside premises, especially bars and restaurants, and Environmental Health Officers have become more proactive in fining people dropping <b>cigarette</b> <b>ends.</b> Phone calls to Smokeline (a smoking support line run by NHS Health Scotland) increased before and after the ban and smoking cessation services have reported that their number of clients has increased since the ban.|$|R

5000|$|St. John Green was an American {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} who released one self-titled LP, produced by Kim Fowley and Michael Lloyd, in 1968.

50|$|The Colston Hall {{survived the}} bombs that brought much {{destruction}} all around it, but succumbed to a stray <b>cigarette</b> <b>end</b> in 1945.

6000|$|The river's tent is broken: {{the last}} fingers of leaf Clutch and {{sink into the}} wet bank. The wind Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.

And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors; [...] 180 Departed, have left no addresses.|$|R
5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} {{there was enough}} food occupied most of the internees' time. Little food {{was provided by the}} Japanese authorities, and it was of poor quality – frequently containing dust, mud, rat and cockroach excreta, <b>cigarette</b> <b>ends,</b> and sometimes dead rats. Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, and meals consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed from friends or relatives in the city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought food from the canteen or the black market.|$|R
25|$|Relapses {{tend to be}} {{attributed}} to stressful situations and having friend groups that smoke. Relapses are also caused by cigarette smokers’ use of the narghile {{as a means of}} easing off of <b>cigarettes,</b> which <b>ends</b> up proliferating their dependence.|$|R

60|$|Adam {{went off}} after the president, and Kit pondered. A few days later, he sat one evening at a small table outside the café Bolivar. The café was badly lighted, hot, and full of flies. There was no door or window, and a few wooden pillars divided the low room from the pavement, which was strewn with <b>cigarette</b> <b>ends</b> and {{cardboard}} matches. In front, small palms, and eucalyptus lined the dusty alameda, where groups of citizens walked up and down. Inside the café somebody sang a Spanish song and played a guitar. It was not cool on the pavement, although a faint breeze made the palms rustle. The air was heavy and a smell of aniseed and new rum hung about the spot.|$|R

2500|$|At Spa-Francorchamps in 1966, Stewart ran off {{the track}} while driving at [...] in heavy rain, and crashed into a {{telephone}} pole and a shed before coming to rest in a farmer's outbuilding. His steering column pinned his leg, while ruptured fuel tanks emptied their contents into the cockpit. There were no track crews to extricate him, nor were proper tools available. There were no doctors or medical facilities at the track, and Stewart was put {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck, remaining there until an ambulance arrived. He was first taken to the track's first aid centre, where he waited on a stretcher, which was placed on a floor strewn with <b>cigarette</b> <b>ends</b> and other rubbish. Finally, another ambulance crew picked him up, but the ambulance driver got lost driving to a hospital in Liège. Ultimately, a private jet flew Stewart back to the UK for treatment.|$|R
50|$|In one chapter, a {{dog that}} was carried dozens of miles into the jungle to serve as tiger bait succeeded in making so good an {{impression}} {{on the way to}} the trap that he came to be considered more valuable than a tiger. Buck tells how he himself caught a huge orang-utan, whose favorite dish was a molasses sandwich. A jungle necessity, according to Buck, is liquid soap. After rain or even an excessive heavy dew bushes are full of leeches ready to fasten onto any passer-by. Once these creatures take hold they bury their heads and the only way to get rid of them is to burn them out with a lighted <b>cigarette</b> <b>end.</b> But leeches don't like the odor or taste of liquid soap and will seldom burrow through a layer of it to get at the skin. Buck derides little men with big rifles who kill jungle animals, especially elephants, and ranks these men as killers lower than cobras.|$|E
5000|$|He {{participated in}} the reconquest of Minorca and in the Battle of Gibraltar, and later went on to lead various {{diplomatic}} missions in Europe. In 1793, the colonel of cavalry Romana fought against France in the War of the First Coalition, and in 1802, he was named General Captain of Catalonia and Chief of Engineers Corps in 1805. Two years later, King Carlos IV, pressured by Napoleon, agreed to send troops to support the Napoleonic army in Germany and the Marquis of la Romana to command the Division of the North. [...] Don Pedro Caro and his unit found themselves in 1808 in Denmark {{under the command of}} Marshall Bernadotte (Prince of Pontecorvo, Governor of the Hanseatic towns and Général-en-Chef of the Elbe Army, later Charles XIV John of Sweden, King of Sweden and Norway (1818). This part of the Spanish history is somewhat unknown in Spain, but in Denmark this episode left a profound mark in the literature, gastronomy and customs in the Danish culture. The Danish national writer, Hans Christian Andersen, in his book [...] "Un Viaje por España" [...] (Travels in Spain) writes about his childhood memory when he, at 3 years old, met the Princess of his life, Spain. A popular song from the period also tells about one burning <b>cigarette</b> <b>end</b> thrown by a Spaniard, set up a fire the castle of Koldinghus (“¡Castillo de Kolding! ¡Castillo de Kolding!, Hay que quemarlo hasta los cimientos, con la cerilla del español y el cigarrillo de su boca”). [...] The War of Spanish Independence broke out against the Napoleonic invasion and of the coronation of José I as the King of Spain. The Marquis of La Romana and his division refused to swear an oath to the new King. [...] The Marquis of la Romana did not trust him {{and with the help of}} the British, was able to repatriate his division to Spain. Romana and his men arrived in Santander where he was appointed Commander of the Galician Armada, at which point he was able to achieve the withdrawal of the French from Galicia and Asturias.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann notes {{straight}} away, that [...] "Money and Cigarettes marked several important turning points in Eric Clapton's recording career: It was his debut release {{on his own}} Duck imprint within Warner Bros.' Reprise Records subsidiary. It {{was also the first}} album he made after coming to terms with his drinking problem by giving up alcohol. Newly focused and having written a batch of new songs, he became dissatisfied with his longtime band and fired them, with the exception of second guitarist Albert Lee. In their place, he hired session pros like Stax Records veteran bassist Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn and Muscle Shoals drummer Roger Hawkins, also bringing in guest guitarist Ry Cooder." [...] Finishing his analysis, the critic summed the album up, [...] "For all the changes and the high-powered sidemen, though, Money and <b>Cigarettes</b> <b>ended</b> up being just an average effort from Clapton." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} ebbing slowly {{out of the}} rotunda and to my bodily eyes she was {{beginning}} to grow shadowy. I sat down on the couch {{and for a long time}} no word passed between us. We made no movement. We did not even turn towards each other. All I was conscious of was the softness of the seat which seemed somehow to cause a relaxation of my stern mood, I won’t say against my will but without any will on my part. Another thing I was conscious of, strangely enough, was the enormous brass bowl for <b>cigarette</b> <b>ends.</b> Quietly, with the least possible action, Doña Rita moved it to the other side of her motionless person. Slowly, the fantastic women with butterflies’ wings and the slender-limbed youths with the gorgeous pinions on their shoulders were vanishing into their black backgrounds with an effect of silent discretion, leaving us to ourselves.|$|R
60|$|This Shelter is wonderfully {{equipped}} and organized. It contains sitting or resting-rooms, smoking-rooms, huge dormitories {{capable of}} accommodating about 600 sleepers; bathrooms, lavatories, extensive hot-water and warming apparatus, great kitchens, and butteries, and so forth. In the sitting and smoking-rooms, numbers of derelict men were seated. Some did nothing except stare before them vacantly. Some evidently were {{suffering from the}} effects of drink or fatigue; some were reading newspapers which they had picked up {{in the course of their}} day's tramp. One, I remember, was engaged in sorting out and crumpling up a number of cigar and <b>cigarette</b> <b>ends</b> which he had collected from the pavements, carefully grading the results in different heaps, according to the class of the tobacco (how strong it must be!) either for his own consumption or for sale to other unfortunates. In another place, men were eating the 1d. or 1/2d. suppers that they had purchased.|$|R
