500|$|The lungs {{are located}} in the chest {{on either side of the}} heart in the rib cage. They are conical in shape with a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a broad <b>concave</b> <b>base</b> that rests on the convex surface of the diaphragm. The apex of the lung extends into the root of the neck, {{reaching}} shortly above the level of the sternal end of the first rib. The lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm. The left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its border called the cardiac notch of the left lung to accommodate this. The front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make light indentations on their surfaces. The medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre of the chest, and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where the trachea divides into the two main bronchi. [...] The cardiac impression is an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest against the heart.|$|E
2500|$|The similar point, local {{southwest}} Altizer {{and some}} Feurt variants with hints of [...] "ears" [...] (Hamilton-like), also appear in central Ohio Valley and dates CE 1400 (Carmean 2009). These rare finds with edges flaring to the base, along the Blue Ridge border areas, also generally have concave bases or somewhat straight base not, as more often found, as dart points, {{for example the}} Hamilton.

50|$|The {{classification}} of the Plainview point {{was made in}} 1947 by Glen Evans, G. E. Meade and E. H.

At least twenty-eight specimens were recovered from this location, which was the site of a Bison antiquus kill. Plainview was previously used as a general term to describe unfluted lanceolate points throughout the entirety of the Plains as well as the eastern Upper Mississippi Valley whereby points were classified as Plainview sub types. However this approach was later rejected and revised leading to new projectile point classifications. The Golondrina point (formally Plainview Golondrina) was one of these types mistakenly named as Plainview.|$|R

50|$|Through {{the whole}} Siberian prehistoric period from the Neolithic until the Iron Age, {{there are a}} very limited range of ceramic types. The vast {{majority}} of ceramic finds are round bulbous vessels, often with folded edges. In the Neolithic they mostly had <b>concave</b> <b>bases,</b> while later flat bases became more common. In {{the eastern part of}} the west Siberian forest steppe, on the Ob, Irtysh and Yenissei, decoration consisted of comb patterns, puncture rows and dimples, arranged in long series or fields (right image). In the course of the dramatic growth of the Andronovo culture in the middle Bronze Age, another type spread through the region. Examples of it are decorated with meander bands, herringbone patterns and triangles (left image). These ceramic types endured even into the Iron Age in west Siberia, yet a stark decline in decoration is pservable, contemporary with the entrance of the Scythian and Hunnic Sarmatian nomads. This applies even to the nomadic cultures themselves.|$|R

50|$|The {{culture has}} been {{referred}} to as the Abu Madi Entity as it shows evidence of having retained Natufian characteristics of a temporary settlement, while being at least partly contemporary with the PPNA cultures of the Levant further to the North. It has been dated approximately 10100 to 9700 BP or from between 9660 to 9180 BC with calibrated datings ranging between c. 9750 and 7760 BC. Judging by these radiocarbon dates, Abu Madi has been suggested to be a form of late Khiamian culture. It has been suggested that the dwellings found housed small groups of nuclear families continuing in the Natufian style. A large number of chipped flints were recovered including a new type of aerodynamic arrowhead known as the Abu Madi Point characterised by elongated ovals or rhomboid shapes, occasionally with a small tang. El Khiam points were also found with deep <b>concave</b> <b>bases</b> and it has been suggested these arrowheads were used to hunt such animals as gazelles and wild ibexes. Abu Madi has been suggested to be amongst the ten probable centers for the origin of agriculture and used in statistical analysis to determine the rate of spread into Europe.|$|R
