40|$|Roof coverings, {{particularly}} barrel tiles, {{have experienced}} significant damage {{over the last}} few years from storms, even weaker storms such as Category 1 Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Efforts have been made to ban mortar-set attachments in southern Florida in favor of adhesive sets. Moreover, some homeowners have generalized the poor performance of clay or <b>concrete</b> <b>tiles</b> in favor of one or the other. This study aims to address whether there is a significant difference in the uplift capacity and impact resistance of field and ridge tiles of clay and concrete with either mortar-set or adhesive-set attachments. The detailed experimental study revealed the strongest system to be <b>concrete</b> <b>tiles</b> with mortar, both for uplift capacity and impact resistance. Although <b>concrete</b> <b>tiles</b> bond to mortar much better than clay tiles, clay tiles adhere better to the foam adhesive. <b>Concrete</b> <b>tiles</b> were also shown to perform better than clay tiles when impacted by a traveling projectile. Test results do not support the ban on the use of mortar for hip and ridge tiles. It is suggested that any such ban on mortar should be limited to clay tiles only. The study also showed cyclic testing to more accurately represent the uplift capacity of tiles for real hurricane conditions. In contrast, the monotonic testing used by tile manufacturers across the industry was found to overestimate the uplift capacity of tiles by as much as 40 %. PublishedN/...|$|R

Of special interest is The Stores, a Grade 2 house, built in circa 1590, converted to a shop and house in the 19th century, and back to a house in the 20th century. Timber framed, plastered, roofed with handmade red clay tiles, it has one 19th century half-glazed door and one plain boarded door. The shop front retains a 19th-century three directional sign reading 'Lifebuoy Soap - Sunlight Soap - No wear no tear no care' made by Roots and Heinemann of Connersville, Indiana, under a patent of 1888 and a clasped purlin roof, with original partitions infilled with wattle and daub to apex. Also found is Fairstead Lodge, a Grade 2 listed house, built in the early 19th century of red brick in Flemish bond and roofed with handmade red clay tiles and The Herons, a Grade 2 house from the 17th century. Timber framed, plastered, roofed with slate and handmade red clay tiles this has been two cottages previously and a six bay wagon lodge from the early 19th century which is timber framed, weather boarded and roofed with slate. The houses, built by Braintree Rural District Council (pre 1974 council changes), leading into the village are of two storey semi detached constructions some with red brick elevations, some with rendered elevations under <b>concrete</b> <b>tile</b> roofs; the windows were originally of the [...] "Crittall" [...] metal type but have largely been replaced with UPVC. These dwellings have off-road parking spaces but the natural hedging at the perimeter boundaries has been maintained The operational scaffold commercial premises and yard storage areas are of unremarkable steel framed construction clad in a mixture of materials; the perimeter boundaries are more suited for security than visual harmony to their rural setting, especially close to listed buildings, although the hedging and brick construction have been maintained for the commercial car repair business. Areas of open countryside come into the centre of the hamlet, which contribute to its essential character, which is recognised by the Planning Inspectorate as a character asset in Ranks Green There is no village envelope.
