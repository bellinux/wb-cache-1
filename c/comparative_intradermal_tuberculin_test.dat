40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study to determine}} individual animal prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) was conducted on 1171 dairy cattle in 12 randomly selected dairy farms in Ethiopia between January 1999 and May 2001 using <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (CIT) <b>test</b> and bacteriologic study through milk culturing. An overall individual animal prevalence of 46. 8 % (548 of 1171 animals) and a herd prevalence of 91. 7 % (11 of 12 farms) were recorded in 12 dairy farms by the CIT test. There were significant (P < 0. 0001) differences in individual prevalence between farms and breeds (pure Holstein and their crosses with Zebu). There was positive correlation (r = 0. 41) between herd size and prevalence of bovine tuberculosis. Furthermore, {{a negative linear association}} (R 2 = 0. 24) was found between mean score of management of the farm and prevalence, indicating that the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis could be improved by sanitary measures. Breed and management affected the prevalence of BTB (R 2 = 0. 30) as confounding variables. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the milk of 13. 3 % (4 of 30) reactor cows. The widespread occurrence of BTB in the study farms and isolation of M. bovis from the milk of reactor cows signify its economic importance and potential risk to public health.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the specificity of the most widely used tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic <b>tests,</b> single <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (SIT) and single <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (SCIT) <b>tests</b> and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) assay in 937 animals from eight TB-free caprine flocks under different epidemiological situations. Maximum specificity was found using SCIT test (99. 4 - 100 % depending on the interpretation criteria) while SIT test and IFN-γ assay showed a slightly lower overall specificity (97. 6 - 99. 2 % and 96. 4 - 98. 4 % respectively). Specificity of the SIT test in a Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infected flock was significantly (. P< 0. 05) lower if a severe interpretation criterion was applied. Similarly, specificity values of SIT test and particularly IFN-γ assay in a paratuberculosis (PTB) -vaccinated flock were lower than those observed in non-vaccinated flocks. Higher proportion of false positive reactors to TB tests (SIT and IFN-γ assay) were observed among animals positive in the PTB-ELISA in PTB vaccinated flock. These results demonstrate that TB diagnostic tests show an adequate specificity when performed in goats from TB-free flocks in most situations. However, certain factors such as C. pseudotuberculosis infection and paratuberculosis vaccination can have a negative impact in the most sensitive tests.

According to the Office des Internationale Epizooties recommendation, the cutoff point for positivity of the CIDT test, calculated as the difference between skin thicknesses after bovine tuberculin (B) and avian tuberculin (A) injections (B − A), is > 4 mm. This cutoff point is used worldwide, although {{it is likely that}} local conditions influence test performance. Thus, this study was formulated to determine CIDT test cutoff points applicable to cattle in central Ethiopia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for the CIDT test, using data from 186 Bos indicus (zebu) and Bos taurus (Holstein) cattle. Detailed postmortem examination for the presence of TB lesions was used to define disease status. At a cutoff of > 2 mm, CIDT test sensitivity was 69 % (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 58. 5 to 79 %), while it was 59 % (95 % CI, 49 to 69 %) at a cutoff of > 4 mm. In contrast, specificities of the CIDT test at these two cutoff values were identical, at 97 % (95 % CI, 89 to 100 %). Thus, the maximum sensitivity of the CIDT test can be realized using a > 2 -mm cutoff without affecting specificity.

The main purpose of the study was to determine the presence and distribution of the tuberculous lesions in reactor cattle, and to isolate and identify the causative agents of bovine tuberculosis in the Republic of Macedonia. Lymph nodes and affected organs from 188 reactor cattle slaughtered due to a positive <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> cervical <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> were analyzed by detection of tuberculous lesions, followed by isolation and molecular identification of the isolated mycobacteria. The isolation was performed on selective media – Lowenstein Jensen with glycerol, Lowenstein Jensen without glycerol and Stonebrink medium supplemented with pyruvate. The molecular identification of the MTBC members was performed by analysis of the Regions of difference (RD 1, RD 9 and RD 4) and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lepA gene for Mycobacterium caprae. Typical tuberculous lesions were detected in 62 animals (33. 0...|$|R
40|$|Background: Here, we jointly {{summarise}} {{scientific evidence}} for genetic variation in resistance to infection with Mycobacterium bovis, the primary agent of bovine tuberculosis (TB), provided by two recent and separate studies of Holstein-Friesian dairy cow populations in Great Britain (GB) and Ireland. Methods: The studies quantified genetic variation within archived data from field and abattoir surveillance control programmes within each country. These data included {{results from the}} single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> (SICTT), abattoir inspection for TB lesions and laboratory confirmation of disease status. Threshold animal models were used to estimate variance components for responsiveness to the SICTT and abattoir confirmed M. bovis infection. The link functions between the observed 0 / 1 scale and the liability scale were the complementary log-log in the GB, and logit link function in the Irish population. Results and discussion: The estimated heritability of susceptibility to TB, as judged by responsiveness to the SICTT, was 0. 16 (0. 012) and 0. 14 (0. 025) in the GB and Irish populations, respectively. For abattoir or laboratory confirmation of infection, estimates were 0. 18 (0. 044) and 0. 18 (0. 041) from the GB and the Irish populations, respectively. Conclusions: Estimates were all significantly different from zero and indicate that exploitable variation exist...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a cross-sectional study from August 2003 to February 2004 to identify {{risk factors for}} bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in the Kafue basin of Zambia. We investigated a total of 106 herds of cattle for presence of BTB using the <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> (CITT) while an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to gather epidemiological data on herd structure, management and grazing strategies. BTB prevalence at herd level was estimated and possible risk factors were investigated using the multiple logistic regression model. The true herd level prevalence of BTB was estimated at 49. 8 % (95 % CI: 37. 9, 61. 7 %). The logistic regression model showed that cattle herd BTB status was highly associated with area and husbandry practices. When compared to Kazungula, cattle herds in Blue Lagoon {{were more likely to}} test positive for BTB when other factors such as management practices were controlled (OR = 10. 5). In terms of grazing strategies, transhumant herds (TH) had higher odds (OR = 3. 0) of being positive compared to sedentary herds (OR = 1. 0). The results in this study provide preliminary information about potential risk factors that were found to be associated with BTB status in cattle...|$|E

Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is endemic in African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) in some National Parks in Southern Africa, whilst no {{studies have been conducted}} on BTB on buffalo populations in Zambia. The increased demand for ecotourism and conservation of the African buffalo on private owned game ranches has prompted the Zambian Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) and private sector in Zambia to generate a herd of “BTB-free buffaloes ” for ex situ conservation. In the present study, 86 African buffaloes from four different herds comprising a total of 530 animals were investigated for the presence of BTB for the purpose of generating “BTB free ” buffalo for ex-situ conservation. Using the <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> (CIDT) the BTB status at both individual animal and herd level was estimated to be 0. 0 % by the CIDT technique. Compared to Avian reactors only, a prevalence of 5. 8 % was determined whilst for Bovine-only reactors a prevalence of 0. 0 % was determined. These results suggest the likelihood of buffalo herds in the Kafue National Park being free of BTB. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a nested-PCR system, {{targeting}} the TbD 1 region, involving {{the performance of}} conventional PCR followed by real-time PCR, was developed to detect Mycobacterium bovis in bovine/bubaline tissue homogenates. The sensitivity and specificity of the reactions were assessed with DNA samples extracted from tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacteria, {{as well as other}} actinomycetales species and DNA samples extracted directly from bovine and bubaline tissue homogenates. In terms of analytical sensitivity, the DNA of M. bovis AN 5 was detected up to 1. 56 ng with conventional PCR, 97. 6 pg with real-time PCR, and 1. 53 pg with nested-PCR in the reaction mixture. The nested-PCR exhibited 100 % analytical specificity for M. bovis when tested with the DNA of reference strains of environmental mycobacteria and closely-related Actinomycetales. A clinical sensitivity value of 76. 0 % was detected with tissue samples from animals that exhibited positive results in the <b>comparative</b> <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> (CITT), as well as from those with lesions compatible with tuberculosis (LCT) that rendered positive cultures. A clinical specificity value of 100 % was detected with tissue samples from animals with CITT- results, with no visible lesions (NVL) and negative cultures. No {{significant differences were found between}} the nested...|$|E
40|$|The {{most widely}} used ante-mortem {{diagnostic}} tests for tuberculosis in cattle are the <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> and the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assay, both of which measure cell-mediated immune responses to Mycobacterium bovis infection. However, limitations {{in the performance of}} these tests results in a failure to identify all infected animals. In attempting to increase the range of diagnostic tests for tuberculosis, measurement of the cytokine IP- 10 in antigen-stimulated blood has previously been shown to improve the detection of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis infection, in humans and African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer), respectively. In the present study, 60 cattle were identified by the single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> as tuberculosis reactors (n = 24) or non-reactors (n = 36) and the release of IFN-γ and IP- 10 in antigen-stimulated whole blood from these animals was measured using bovine specific ELISAs. There was a strong correlation between IP- 10 and IFN-γ production in these samples. Moreover, measurement of the differential release of IP- 10 in response to stimulation with M. bovis purified protein derivative (PPD) and M. avium PPD distinguished between reactor and non-reactor cattle with a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI, 86 %- 100 %) and a specificity of 97 % (95 % CI, 85 %- 100 %). These results suggest that IP- 10 might prove valuable as a diagnostic biomarker of M. bovis infection in cattle...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTB) is {{a considerable}} health threat to livestock keepers and general communities in many developing countries. Information on genetic resistance or susceptibility because of polymorphisms of candidate genes {{could be used in}} making selection decisions for breeding disease tolerant/resistant animals. Here, we investigated associations between polymorphisms at the solute carrier family 11 (proton-coupled divalent metal ion transporters), member 1 gene (SLC 11 A 1, previously known as natural resistant associated macrophage protein 1, NRAMP 1), with BTB phenotypes in Chadian cattle. Phenotypes were (i) single <b>intradermal</b> <b>comparative</b> cervical <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> (SICCT) outcome, (ii) presence of gross visible lung lesions, (iii) a bacteriological culture test outcome and (iv) a predicted true BTB infection status using a Bayesian model. All traits were recorded as binary (presence or absence) traits. A total of 211 cattle were genotyped for a microsatellite within the SLC 11 A 1 candidate gene. Standard linear and threshold-liability models regressing BTB traits on copy number of SLC 11 A 1 alleles revealed statistically significant effects of SLC 11 A 1 alleles (P > 0. 001) on most BTB traits. Polymorphisms (alleles 211, 215 and 217) are significantly related to lower incidence of BTB traits in Chadian cattle. This is the first study to report the association of SLC 11 A 1 gene polymorphisms with BTB traits in Chadian or any other African cattle breed...|$|R
