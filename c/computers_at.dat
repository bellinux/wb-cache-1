5|$|In 1980, Applewhite and Nettles {{had about}} 80followers, {{many of whom}} held jobs, often working with {{computers}} or as car mechanics. In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families. They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on Mother's Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> a monastery. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led Apple's SuperMicro division, {{which was}} {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Macintosh and Lisa personal computers. The Macintosh had been successful on university campuses partly because of the Apple University Consortium, which allowed students and institutions to buy the <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> a discount. The consortium had earned more than $50million on computers by February 1984.|$|E
5|$|Obsidian is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tony Warriner, one of four founders of the adventure game developer Revolution Software. Warriner was introduced to home <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> the age of 13, {{as a result of}} which he developed an interest in game development. This interest resulted in him creating Obsidian when he should have been studying for his school exams, resulting in him failing every exam. The game was published, however, resulting in the young developer's entry into the video game industry. Revolution Software was formed 4 years later.|$|E

The district also plans many general updates to all campuses such as school entry improvements, a digital radio communication center, and site improvements. There will also be technology additions (such as 1:1 <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> newly built Klein Cain High School in 2017) and multiple facility capital projects. High School Career and Technology Education programs, music instruments, furniture, and buses are also receiving funding in the 2015 bond.|$|E
5|$|Shehri {{moved into}} the Homing Inn, a budget motel in Boynton Beach, on June 21, 2001, sharing a room with his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami. Wail and Suqami both used this hotel as their address when they {{received}} Florida state non-driver identifications on July 3. Shehri checked into the Panther Motel & Apartments, in Deerfield Beach, with his brother and Suqami on August 2, staying there until August 10. While in Florida, Wail {{was a member of}} the World Gym in Boynton Beach, where he trained with Waleed and Suqami. During the summer of 2001, Wail regularly used <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> the Delray Beach Public Library.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the <b>computers.</b> <b>At</b> the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E

5|$|Early {{computer}} games {{began to be}} created in the 1950s, and the steady {{increase in the number}} and abilities of computers over time led to the gradual loosening of restrictions on access to mainframe <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe computers, with increasing complexity {{towards the end of the}} decade. While games continued to be developed on mainframes and minicomputers through the 1970s, the rise of personal computers and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers, even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent of the strategy and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of <b>computers</b> <b>at</b> the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, and then once the screen was at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} possible differences in student performance {{depending on the}} frequency {{and the type of}} <b>computer</b> usage both <b>at</b> home and at school of 15 -years-old Italian students. Using the PISA 2006 dataset and controlling {{for a wide range of}} individual and school characteristics, our results suggest that students using the <b>computer</b> <b>at</b> home very often obtain higher test scores than those who never use it. More importantly, we find a significant positive correlation between student achievement and the use of <b>computer</b> <b>at</b> home as educational/learning device. Focusing on the frequency of <b>computer</b> usage <b>at</b> school, it emerges that student achievement increases with the intensity of computer use but the effect becomes smaller the more often they use the computer and even negative when students use the <b>computer</b> <b>at</b> school almost every day...|$|R
