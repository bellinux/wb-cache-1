60|$|Meanwhile the {{declaration}} of war drew nearer, and became inevitable. She knew Ciccio would go. And with him went the chance of her escape. She steeled herself to bear the agony of the knowledge that he would go, {{and she would be}} left alone in this place, which sometimes she hated with a hatred unspeakable. After a spell of hot, intensely dry weather she felt she would die in this valley, wither and go to powder as some exposed April roses withered and dried into dust against a hot wall. Then the cool wind came in a storm, the next day there was grey sky and soft air. The rose-coloured wild gladioli among the young green corn were a dream of beauty, the morning of the world. The lovely, pristine morning of the world, before our epoch began. Rose-red gladioli among corn, in among the rocks, and small irises, black-purple and yellow blotched with brown, like a wasp, standing low in little desert places, that would seem forlorn but for this weird, dark-lustrous magnificence. Then there were the tiny irises, only one finger tall, growing in dry places, frail as crocuses, and much tinier, and blue, blue as the eye of the morning heaven, which was a morning earlier, more pristine than ours. The lovely translucent pale irises, tiny and morning-blue, they lasted only a few hours. But nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> more exquisite, <b>like</b> <b>gods</b> on earth. It was the flowers that brought back to Alvina the passionate nostalgia for the place. The human influence was a bit horrible to her. But the flowers that came out and uttered the earth in magical expression, they cast a spell on her, bewitched her and stole her own soul away from her.|$|R

6000|$|The first puzzle was: How is it {{that while}} I <b>am</b> <b>like</b> the animals in some things, and yet feel as if I ought to be, and can <b>be,</b> <b>like</b> <b>God</b> in other things? How {{is it that}} I feel two powers in me; one {{dragging}} me downward to make me lower than the beasts, the other lifting me upwards--I dare not think whither? It {{seems to me to}} be my body, my bodily appetites and tempers which drag me down. Is my body me, part of me, or a thing I should be ashamed of, and long to be rid of? I fancy that I can <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God.</b> But can my body <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God?</b> Must I not crush it, neglect it, get rid of it before I can follow the good instinct which draws me upward? ...|$|R
6000|$|Therefore {{let us not}} feed our fancies with {{pictures}} of what the next world will be like,--pictures, I say, which are but waking dreams of men, intruding into those things which they have not seen, vainly puffed up in their fleshly minds--that is in their animal and mortal brain. Let us be content with what St. John tells us, which is a matter not for our brains, but for our hearts; not for our imaginations, but for our conscience, which is indeed our highest reason. Whatever {{we do not know}} about the next world, this, he says, we do know,--that when God in Christ shall appear, we shall <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Him. <b>Like</b> <b>God.</b> No more: No: but no less. To <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> it appears, <b>is</b> the very end and aim of our being. [...] That we might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> God our Father sent us forth from His eternal bosom, which is the ground of all life, in heaven and in earth. That we might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> He clothed us in mortal flesh, and sent us into this world of sense. That we might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> He called us, from our infancy, into His Church. That we might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> He gave us the divine sense of right and wrong; and more, by the inspiration of His holy spirit, that inward witness, that Light of God, which lightens every man that cometh into the world, He taught us to love the right and hate the wrong. That we might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> educating us from our cradle to our grave, by every event, even the smallest, which happens to us. That we might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> it <b>is</b> in God that we live, and move, and have our being; that as the raindrop which falls from heaven, rises again surely, soon or late, to heaven again; so each soul of man, coming forth from God at first, should return again to God, as many of them as have eternal life, having become <b>like</b> to <b>God</b> from whom it came at first. And how shall we become <b>like</b> <b>God?</b> or rather <b>like</b> Christ who <b>is</b> both God and man? [...] To become <b>like</b> <b>God</b> the Father,--that <b>is</b> impossible for finite and created beings as we are. But to become somewhat, at least, <b>like</b> <b>God</b> the Son, <b>like</b> Jesus Christ our Lord, who is the brightness of His Father's glory, and the express image of His person, that is not impossible. For He has revealed Himself as a man, in the soul and body of a man, that our sinful souls might <b>be</b> made <b>like</b> His pure soul; our sinful bodies like His glorious body; and that so He might be the first born among many brethren. And how? [...] "We know that when He appears, we shall <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Him, for we shall see Him as He is." ...|$|R
60|$|And so God, and {{the life}} of God, was {{manifested}} in the flesh and reasonable soul of a man; and from that time there is no doubt what the life of God is; for the life of God is the life of Jesus Christ. There is no doubt now what <b>God</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> for <b>God</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> Jesus Christ. No one can now say, 'I cannot see God, how then can you expect me to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> God?' for He who has seen Jesus Christ, as His character stands in the Gospels, has seen God the Father. No one can say now, 'How can a man <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> and live a life <b>like</b> <b>God's</b> life?' for if any one of you say that, I can answer him: 'A man can <b>be</b> <b>like</b> God; you can <b>be</b> <b>like</b> God; for there was once a man on earth, Jesus, the son of the Blessed Virgin, who <b>was</b> perfectly <b>like</b> God.' And if you answer, 'But He <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> because He <b>was</b> God,' I can say, 'And that is the very reason why you can <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God</b> also.' If Jesus Christ had been only a man, you could no more become like Him than you can become clever because another man is clever, or strong because another man is strong: but because He was God The Son of God, He can give you, to make you <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> the same Holy Spirit which made Him like God; for that Holy Spirit proceeds from Him, the Son, {{as well as from the}} Father, and the Father has committed all power to the Son; and therefore that same Man Christ Jesus has power to change your heart, and renew it, and shape it to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Him, and like His Father, by the power of His Spirit, that you may <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>God</b> as He <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> and live the life of God which He lived; so that the Lord Jesus Christ, because He <b>was</b> a man <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> showed that all men can become like God; and because He was God, Very God of Very God, He is able to make all who come to Him men like Himself, men <b>like</b> <b>God,</b> and raise them up body and soul to the everlasting life of God, that He may be the firstborn among many brethren.|$|R
