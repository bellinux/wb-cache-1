5|$|The DuSable Museum is {{the oldest}} and before the {{founding}} of the National Museum of African American History and <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, the largest caretaker of African American <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Over its long history, it has expanded as necessary to reflect the increased interest in black culture. This willingness to adapt has allowed it to survive while other museums faltered due to a weakening economy and decreased public support. The museum was the eighth one located on Park District land. Although it focuses on exhibiting African American culture, it is one of several Chicago museums that celebrates Chicago's ethnic and cultural heritage.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Middle Ages, England was a part of Britannia, a former {{province}} of the Roman Empire. The local economy had once been dominated by imperial Roman spending on a large military establishment, which in turn helped to support a complex network of towns, roads, and villas. At the end of the 4th century, however, Roman forces had been largely withdrawn, and this economy collapsed. Germanic immigrants began to arrive in increasing numbers during the 5th century, establishing small farms and settlements, and their language, Old English, swiftly spread as people switched from British Celtic and British Latin to the language of this new elite. New political and social identities emerged, including an Anglian <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east of England and a Saxon <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south, with local groups establishing regiones, small polities ruled over by powerful families and individuals. By the 7th century, some rulers, including those of Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, and Kent, had begun to term themselves kings, living in villae regales, royal centres, and collecting tribute from the surrounding regiones; these kingdoms are {{often referred to as the}} Heptarchy.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} a part of human <b>culture,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> broad sense of social behaviour, customs and {{practices}} including but not limited to expressive forms such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years.

5|$|<b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands {{at the end}} of the 15th {{century was}} {{influenced}} by the Italian Renaissance through trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator's map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of Hieronymus Bosch to the everyday life depictions of Pieter Brueghel the Elder.|$|E

5|$|During Davis's youth, {{his family}} moved twice: in 1811 to St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, and {{less than a year}} later to Wilkinson County, Mississippi. The {{international}} slave trade was prohibited in 1808, and planters used the domestic slave trade to procure laborers for developing cotton <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Deep South. Three of Davis's older brothers served in the War of 1812. In 1813, Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy in the small town of Woodville, near the family cotton plantation.|$|E

5|$|In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly {{from its}} birthplace in Florence {{to the rest}} of Italy and soon {{to the rest of}} Europe. The {{invention}} of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas.

5|$|Moncton {{was placed}} on the Trans-Canada Highway network in the early 1960s after Route 2 was built along the {{northern}} perimeter of the city. Later, the Route 15 was built between the city and Shediac. At the same time, the Petitcodiac River Causeway was constructed. The Université de Moncton was founded in 1963.

5|$|Over time, {{indigenous}} {{cultures in}} North America grew increasingly complex, and some, {{such as the}} pre-Columbian Mississippian <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. From approximately 800 to 1600 AD the Mississippian culture flourished, and its largest city Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, lasting {{until the end of}} the Revolutionary War.|$|E
