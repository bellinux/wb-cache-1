50|$|The {{principle}} used in {{a typical}} (active) liquid cooling system for computers is identical to that {{used in a}}n automobile's internal combustion engine, with the water being circulated by a water pump through a waterblock mounted on the CPU (and sometimes additional components as GPU and northbridge) and out to a heat exchanger, typically a radiator. The radiator is itself sometimes cooled additionally {{by means of a}} fan. Besides a fan, it could possibly also be cooled by other means, such as a Peltier cooler (although Peltier elements are most commonly placed directly on top of the hardware to be cooled, and the coolant is used to conduct the heat away from the hot side of the Peltier element). A <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir</b> is often also connected to the system.|$|E
50|$|Since an engine's oil circulates at {{much higher}} {{pressures}} than its coolant, {{oil in a}} porous head {{has a tendency to}} gradually seep into the coolant galleries. A typical symptom of a porous head is usually a 'mayonnaise'-like substance forming somewhere inside the cooling system (usually, this can be found residing on the <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir</b> cap). However, depending on the degree of porosity, symptoms of a porous head have a tendency to vary. Many C20XE operators have described the symptom as a curry-like residue or in more severe cases, a thick brown sludge which may overcome the entire cooling system. In such instances, engine oil will readily react with the sulfur in rubber components, hence quickly degrading coolant pipes and hoses to the point of failure. During the porous head debacle, GM faced bankruptcy - therefore dealers failed to recall affected models. Due in part, to the engine's immense prominence and demand, many businesses now specialize in the repair of porous GM C20XE/LET heads - by either sleeving the affected gallery or by injecting a polymer based substance into the porous region. Reportedly, a small number of total GM C20XE cylinder heads ever exhibited significant symptoms of porosity.|$|E

40|$|Before {{fuelling}} {{the tanks}} of missiles, boosters, and spacecraft with liquid-propellant components (LPC) their temperature preparation is needed. The missile-system ground equipment performs this operation during prelaunch processing of space-purpose missiles (SPM). Usually, the fuel cooling {{is necessary to}} increase its density and provide heat compensation during prelaunch operation of SPM. The fuel temperature control systems (FTCS) using different principles of operation and types of coolants are applied for fuel cooling. To determine parameters of LPC cooling process through the fuel heat exchange in the heat exchanger with coolant, which is cooled by liquid nitrogen upon contact heat exchange in the <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir,</b> a mathematical model of this process and a design technique are necessary. Both allow us to determine design parameters of the cooling system and the required liquid nitrogen reserve to cool LPC to the appropriate temperature. The article presents an overview of foreign and domestic publications on cooling processes research and implementation using cryogenic products such as liquid nitrogen. The article draws a conclusion {{that it is necessary}} to determine the parameters of LPC cooling process through the fuel heat exchange in the heat exchanger with coolant, which is liquid nitrogen-cooled upon contact heat exchange in the <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir</b> allowing to define rational propellant cooling conditions to the specified temperature. The mathematical model describes the set task on the assumption that a heat exchange between the LPC and the coolant in the heat exchanger and with the environment through the walls of tanks and pipelines of circulation loops is quasi-stationary. The obtained curves allow us to calculate temperature changes of LPC and coolant, cooling time and liquid nitrogen consumption, depending on the process parameters such as a flow rate of liquid nitrogen, initial coolant temperature, pump characteristics, thermal insulation of tanks and pipelines of circulation loops of LPC and coolant. To cool LPC in the heat exchanger with coolant which is liquid nitrogen-cooled upon contact heat exchange in the <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir,</b> a mathematical model of this process and design technique is developed. It allows us to define PLC and coolant temperature changes, cooling time, and liquid nitrogen consumption, depending on the parameters of the process such as a flow rate of liquid nitrogen, initial temperature of the coolant, pump characteristics, thermal insulation of tanks and pipeline circulation loops of LPC and coolant. The application of the developed technique in creating these systems allows us to determine the rational design and operating parameters of the fuel cooling system to provide LPC cooling operation to the required temperature at the lowest liquid nitrogen flow rate. </p...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe programme was concerned {{with the effects of}} processing variables on the structure and properties of <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir</b> tanks. The work was concentrated on the extrusion blow moulding process and on propylene polymers, following an earlier similar research in the Institute on high density polyethylene. We have worked with a company which specialises in technical blow mouldings; the work has dealt with coolant tanks which are required for high temperature, high pressure service in the presence of antifreeze. It soon became apparent that the application made severe demands on polypropylene in that failure was possible by a variety of mechanisms, including environmental stress cracking and ductile blow-out failure. Additionally, the shaping process by extrusion blow moulding was not being carried out in the optimum way, either with respect to process economics or to product properties. Investigation of the surface texture of corn mercial tanks revealed that shrinkage from the mould occurred frequently due to inadequate holdon pressure; this loss of contact gives poor surface finish and retarded cooling. This phase of the research was supported by a programme carried out on the Bradford University equipment and by providing appropriate thermal data for the Bradford mathematical model for cooling. To reduce the cooling cycle time, the efficacy of internal cooling techniques, including forced air cooling and liquid carbon dioxide, was studied. Further, the possibility of shaping polypropylene in the supercooled region was investigated and a double extruder system was developed to examine the shear viscosity of supercooled polymers. The main concern has been failure caused by stress cracking and environmental stress cracking, especially of development grades of propylene polymers. The structures of various ethylene-modified polypropylenes have been elucidated, as have the relationship of structure' to processing history and its relevance to the severe stress cracking encountered. A new method for determining ethylene content of ethylene- propylene systems has been developed, as {{this is one of the}} important characteristics of ethylene modified polypropylene. The available processes of manufacturing the <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir</b> tanks have been considered; in particular, competing methods of manufacture of extrusion blow moulding and injection moulding/welding have been compared. The design of coolant tanks, in particular the wall thickness required, has been examined. Stress analysis, supported by tensile failure and relaxation data, has been carried out to provide background to the failures encountered in practice. Finally, possible new candidate material for the coolant tank application, polypropylene-linear low density polyethylene (ethylene-octene copolymer) blends have been investigated...|$|E
40|$|A {{spacecraft}} includes heat-generating payload equipment, and a {{heat transport}} {{system with a}} cold plate thermally coupled to the equipment and a capillary-wick evaporator, for evaporating coolant liquid to cool the equipment. The coolant vapor is coupled to a condenser and in a loop back to the evaporator. A heated <b>coolant</b> <b>reservoir</b> is coupled to the loop for pressure control. If the wick is not wetted, heat transfer will not begin or continue. A pair of check valves are coupled in the loop, and the heater is cycled for augmentation pumping of coolant {{to and from the}} reservoir. This augmentation pumping, in conjunction with the check valves, wets the wick. The wick liquid storage capacity allows the augmentation pump to provide continuous pulsed liquid flow to assure continuous vapor transport and a continuously operating heat transport system. The check valves are of the ball type to assure maximum reliability. However, any type of check valve can be used, including designs which are preloaded in the closed position. The check valve may use any ball or poppet material which resists corrosion. For optimum performance during testing on Earth, the ball or poppet would have neutral buoyancy or be configured in a closed position when the heat transport system is not operating. The ball may be porous to allow passage of coolant vapor...|$|E
