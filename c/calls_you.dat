500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score. Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time. [...] "What a treat for me to get to write a piece that <b>calls</b> <b>you</b> into the movie and lets you know something bad is going to happen from the get go", Walker said. According to Walker, [...] "Main Title" [...] consumed most of her time, due to its [...] "dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score".|$|E

[...] Another remix by Sick Individuals, which consist of Dutch duo Rinze [...] "Ray" [...] Hofstee and Joep [...] "Jim" [...] Smeele, was released exclusively to Billboard.

500|$|In Latin, {{the middle}} finger was the digitus impudicus, meaning the [...] "shameless, indecent or {{offensive}} finger". In the 1st century AD, Persius had superstitious female relatives concoct a charm with the [...] "infamous finger" [...] (digitus infamis) and [...] "purifying spit"; {{while in the}} Satyricon, an old woman uses dust, spit and her middle finger to mark the forehead before casting a spell. The poet Martial has a character in good health extend [...] "the indecent one" [...] toward three doctors. In another epigram, Martial wrote: [...] "Laugh loud, Sextillus, at whoever <b>calls</b> <b>you</b> a cinaedus and extend your middle finger." [...] Juvenal, through synecdoche, has the [...] "middle nail" [...] cocked at threatening Fortuna. The indecent finger features again in a mocking context in the Priapeia, a collection of poems relating to the phallic god Priapus. In Late Antiquity, the term [...] "shameless finger" [...] is explained in the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville with reference to its frequent use when accusing someone of a [...] "shameful action".|$|E

History, co-produced by West, was released on June 21, 2005 on Universal South Records. The first single off the album, [...] "Next Thing You Know", was released June 20, a day before the album's release.

2500|$|A Midrash {{found in}} [...] {{support for the}} proverb that if a person tells {{you that you have}} a donkey's ears, do not believe it, but if two tell it to you, order a halter.

2500|$|In June 1988, police closed an {{investigation}} into alleged jamming of the Cox campaign's phone lines by supporters of Rosenberg. [...] "For several weeks, about every third call we got {{was one of these}} bogus <b>calls.</b> <b>You</b> would hear a kind of whirring noise like a machine of some kind. ... It got so bad just before the election that we had to move our get-out-the vote operation to another office and use cellular phones in the field," [...] said Cox's campaign manager Bob Schuman. A representative of the police said that charges were not made because though the location of the jamming was traced, it could not be determined specifically which individuals were responsible. [...] "It's incredible to me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but I feel pretty strongly that we don't want to let them get away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't know anything about it. I don't want to speculate about who might have done this to Cox's phones, but I certainly don't condone it," [...] said Rosenberg. Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters. The residence belonged to a developer and his wife who had each made donations of $1,000 to Rosenberg's campaign for Congress.|$|E
2500|$|In the October 1959 church general conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball stated: [...] "Millions of {{you have}} blood {{relatively}} unmixed with Gentiles. Columbus called you 'Indians,' thinking he had reached the East Indies. ... The Lord <b>calls</b> <b>you</b> 'Lamanites,' a name which has a pleasant ring, {{for many of the}} grandest people ever to live upon the earth were so called. In a limited sense, the name signifies the descendants of Laman and Lemuel, sons of your first American parent, Lehi; but you undoubtedly possess also the blood of the other sons, Sam, Nephi, and Jacob. And you likely have some Jewish blood from Mulek, son of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Hel. 6:10). ... You came from Jerusalem in its days of tribulation. You are of royal blood, a loved people of the Lord. In your veins flows the blood of prophets and statesmen". Similarly, at a 1971 Lamanite Youth Conference, Kimball stated: [...] "With pride I tell those who come to my office that a Lamanite is a descendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ and with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi and his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes in North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea". Ted E. Brewerton, a general authority of the LDS Church, stated in 1995: [...] "Many migratory groups came to the Americas, but none was as important as the three mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The blood of these people flows in the veins of the Blackfoot and the Blood Indians of Alberta, Canada; in the Navajo and the Apache of the American Southwest; the Inca of western South America; the Aztec of Mexico; the Maya of Guatemala; and in other native American groups in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific islands".|$|E
