5|$|In July 1994 {{one of his}} sons, Norodom Chakrapong, led {{a failed}} coup attempt to topple the {{government}}. Following the coup attempt, Chakrapong took refuge in a hotel in Phnom Penh, but government troops soon discovered his hideout and surrounded the hotel. Chakrapong called Sihanouk, who negotiated with government representatives {{to allow him to}} go into exile in Malaysia. The following November, Sirivudh was accused of plotting to assassinate Hun Sen and imprisoned. Sihanouk intervened to have Sirivudh detained at the interior ministry's headquarters, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a secret plan to kill the latter if he were to remain in prison. After Sirivudh was relocated to the safer location, Sihanouk appealed to Hun Sen that Sirivudh be allowed to go into exile in France together with his family. Subsequently, Hun Sen accepted his offer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was {{a future}} in talking films, Perret {{directed}} an adaptation of Huguette Garnier's famous novel entitled Quand nous étions deux in 1929. However, his first talking film met with only mild success {{compared to the other}} competing films of that period. In general, the Franco-Film company was having difficulty adapting to talking films. After he finished Quand nous étions deux, Léonce Perret decided to leave the Franco-Film. He didn't quit the film industry, however; his next project was a collaboration with Adolphe Osso, the founder of the production company Osso. Together they shot Perret's first live sound film Arthur. He followed that up in 1931 with a film adaptation of a play by Pierre Wolff and Henri Duvernois called Après l'amour starring Gaby Morlay, a film that was particularly successful in Belgium. Perret's next project was Grains de beauté in 1932, followed by Enlevez-moi, a film that showcased the young actress Arletty as well as the veteran actor Roger Tréville.|$|E

25|$|Cyril {{was once}} again banished from Jerusalem by the Arian Emperor Valens in 367. St. Cyril was able to return again at the {{accession}} of Emperor Gratian in 378, after which he remained undisturbed {{until his death in}} 386. In 380, St. Gregory of Nyssa came to Jerusalem on the recommendation of a council held at Antioch in the preceding year. He found the faith in accord with the truth, but the city a prey to parties and corrupt in morals. Cyril's jurisdiction over Jerusalem was expressly confirmed by the First Council of Constantinople (381), at which he was present. At that council he voted for acceptance of the term homoousios, having been finally <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no better alternative. His story is perhaps best representative of those Eastern bishops (perhaps a majority), initially mistrustful of Nicaea, who came to accept the creed of that council, and the doctrine of the homoousion.|$|E
25|$|Fowler {{might have}} {{remained}} with the Middlesbrough firm {{and made his}} reputation there, {{had it not been}} for a chance visit to Ireland in 1849, probably on business. This was at the time of the Irish potato famine, and Irish agriculture depended on the potato crop whilst much of the land was uncultivated due to poor drainage. This affected Fowler and he was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be a way of bringing more land into production. The normal way to drain agricultural land was to use a mole plough to dig a subterranean drainage channel. The mole plough has a vertical blade with a cylindrical “mole” attached to the bottom. The mole is pointed at the front end, and as it moves through the soil, it leaves a horizontal channel into which porous drainage pipes can be laid. However this required considerable tractive power, so that the size of the plough was limited by the strength of the teams of horses that pulled it. Fowler returned to England and developed a horse-powered ploughing engine that would dig drainage channels.|$|E

500|$|One of the Parliament's {{justifications}} for restricting judicial review {{in response to}} Chng Suan Tze was that national security is [...] "not a judicial decision" [...] and is not capable of [...] "objective evaluation by the courts". Commentators have noted, though, {{that the role of}} the court as enunciated in Chng Suan Tze is merely to be <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a national security issue at hand, not to inquire into the executive action required to preserve it. In fact, the court applied the doctrine of justiciability which recognizes that the limits of judicial review in politically sensitive issues is better left to the discretion of the executive.|$|E
500|$|During this period, the Armenian-populated {{areas were}} {{divided between the}} Russian Empire (Eastern Armenia) and the Ottoman Empire (Western Armenia). One of the {{earliest}} uses of the phrase [...] "United Armenia" [...] is by the English Society of Friends of Russian Freedom in an 1899 edition of Free Russia monthly. It quotes a confidential report of Grigory Golitsin (the Russian governor of the Caucasus) sent to tsar Nicholas II [...] "containing suggestions for a future policy."

500|$|Fraser {{began her}} work in {{gynaecology}} and obstetrics in 1924, noting that the only internships available to her were in OBGYN or children's tonsillectomies. Much of her work required her to visit immigrant patients of the tenement houses of the Lower East Side. She had little understanding of the diverse ethnicities of her patients, their poverty and {{the conditions in which}} they lived. Fraser had been influenced by Eugenics studies, which caused her medical practices to be influenced by ethnic origin. She became <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was inadequate information available about birth control available to both physicians and patients and she sought information from non-medical sources, becoming an advocate. Soon after her arrival in New York, Fraser began a more intense correspondence with Williams, who would become her life partner. Despite the desires of both women's families to keep them apart—Williams' family sending her to England and Fraser's family threatening that continuing the relationship would fracture her familial ties—the two refused to give up their relationship.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his early}} career Etty was highly {{regarded}} by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, {{who had been}} educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses ("Odysseus" [...] in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, {{a scene from the}} Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.|$|E

500|$|<b>Convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was {{no future}} {{for him in}} Hungary, Szilard left for Berlin via Austria on December 25, 1919, and {{enrolled}} at the Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He was soon joined by his brother Béla. Szilard became bored with engineering, and his attention turned to physics. This was not taught at the Technische Hochschule, so he transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he attended lectures given by Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Walter Nernst, James Franck and Max von Laue. He also met fellow Hungarian students Eugene Wigner, John von Neumann and Dennis Gabor. His doctoral dissertation on thermodynamics Über die thermodynamischen Schwankungserscheinungen (On The Manifestation of Thermodynamic Fluctuations), praised by Einstein, won top honors in 1922. It involved a long-standing puzzle {{in the philosophy of}} thermal and statistical physics known as Maxwell's demon, [...] a thought experiment originated by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell. The problem was thought to be insoluble, but in tackling it Szilard recognized the connection between thermodynamics and Information theory.|$|E

[...] Cotton may have still been angry over the zeal with which some opponents had come after the dissidents within his congregation.

[...] Many of the Puritans had been <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a single destructive prophetic figure behind all of the difficulties that the colony had been having, and Hutchinson had just become the culprit.
