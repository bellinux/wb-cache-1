5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a jaw of Sudamerica. Because {{some of this}} jaw's features {{were thought to be}} incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) as Mammalia incertae sedis. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) and multituberculates. The <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> partially due to disagreement over the assignment of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as Ferugliotherium, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the peak}} was {{suggested}} by an explorer named Chris Dickinson during the Cambridge Coast Mountains Expedition in 1979. It was adopted on November 24, 1980, and has been its official name since then. However, this name for the peak does not normally show up in any volcanological resources. Instead, it is informally referred to as Lava Fork or Lava Fork volcano due to its close association with the creek of the same name. The reason for this <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> because The Volcano is generic. In speech {{it may not be}} obvious whether The Volcano or the volcano is intended, leading to confusion. Similar named volcanoes in Canada include Volcano Vent in the Tuya volcanic field of northwestern British Columbia and Volcano Mountain in the Fort Selkirk volcanic field of central Yukon. As of 2009, the unofficial terms for The Volcano continue to be used by Natural Resources Canada.|$|E

25|$|The Pirahã {{language}} is most notable {{as the subject}} of various controversial claims; for example, that it provides evidence for linguistic relativity.

25|$|The Egyptian {{identification}} card <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> {{a series of}} events, beginning in the 1990s, that created a de facto state of disenfranchisement for Egyptian Bahá'ís, atheists, agnostics, and other Egyptians who did not identify themselves as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish on government identity documents.|$|E
25|$|Opinions partly differ about {{sleep in}} migratory birds. The <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> mainly {{about whether they}} can sleep while flying or not. Theoretically, certain types of sleep could be {{possible}} while flying, but technical difficulties preclude the recording of brain activity in birds while they are flying.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> valuing the environment, {{which in}} the 21st century is {{typically}} assessed by valuing ecosystem services to humans, such as air and water quality and pollution. Monetary values may also be assigned to other intangible effects such as business reputation, market penetration, or long-term enterprise strategy alignment.|$|E

25|$|One {{reason for}} <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> that the list {{includes}} some dependencies that have democratically chosen to maintain their current status, or have had referenda in which an insufficient {{percentage of the population}} vote for a change of status, or in some cases (such as United States Virgin Islands) simply had an insufficient number of voters participate.|$|E
25|$|Vaccine controversies have {{occurred}} since almost 80 {{years before the}} terms vaccine and vaccination were introduced, and continue to this day. Despite scientific consensus that recommended vaccines are safe and effective, unsubstantiated scares regarding their safety still occur, resulting in outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Another source of <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> whether mandatory vaccination policies violate civil liberties or religious principles.|$|E

25|$|Significance of the old/new text <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> {{a debate}} {{topic in the}} modern sinology. Martin Kern claims that the issue itself was an {{artificial}} projection of the mid-Han problematic onto the early Han realities. According to him, the issue should be seen {{in light of the}} transition from the self-referential ritual tradition (centered on the oral and multimedia practices) to the literary canon.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> the {{relationship}} between smoking and sensory gating in schizophrenia. Nicotine may help improve auditory gating, the ability to screen out intrusive environmental sounds. This may help improve attention spans and reduce auditory hallucinations, allowing people with schizophrenia to perceive the environment more effectively and engage in smoother motor functions. However, research shows this effect alone cannot account for increased smoking rates.|$|E
25|$|A {{complicated}} {{factor to}} the Luke and Noah <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> the couple's popularity.

While competitors One Life to Live and Days of Our Lives saw double-digit drops in viewership over the past year, As the World Turns was down only 2 percent.|$|E
