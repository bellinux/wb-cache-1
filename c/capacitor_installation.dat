With improvements in circuit breaker technology, modern SF 6 puffer circuits have been designed with less interrupter per pole than previous generations of SF 6 circuit breakers. This has caused modern circuit breakers to operate with higher voltage stress in the dielectric recovery region after current interruption. Catastrophic failures of modern SF 6 circuit breakers have been reported during shunt reactor and capacitor bank de-energisation. In those cases, evidence of cumulative re-strikes {{has been found to}} be the main cause of interrupter failure. Monitoring of voltage waveforms during switching would provide information about the magnitude and frequency of small re-ignitions and re-strikes.

These non-linear devices improve efficiency but distort the supply waveforms. To address the harmonic issues, harmonic filters are used to mitigate distortion levels and prevent damage. These harmonic filters are commonly found at medium voltage levels in power systems. The problem is that knowledge from the design to commissioning stages of these medium voltage harmonic filters are neither well developed nor adequately documented. The aim of this research is to investigate and expound upon the process whilst taking into account all the factors involved throughout the process from bringing such a filter into operation in the real world. Medium voltage harmonic filters are usually the open rack type found in outdoor <b>installations.</b> <b>Capacitors</b> and reactors are the main components used in the construction of such harmonic filters and in some instances resistors are also used. The physical size and spacing of such components determines the construction layout area and how this is done in practice warrants being researched and explained in this thesis. In order to make these factors explicit, a methodology is developed from design, to installation and commissioning and is applied to two networks which are used to prove that the developed methodology is applicable for the different types of harmonic filters designed. The network voltage levels are also different, thus implying that the components will have different design factors. The final arrangements of the harmonic filters are later drawn and shown in three-dimension (3 D) as per dimensions. The 3 D figures are a further contribution as the design is taken from theory and is ultimately implemented into an installation and construction layout for erection at site. Interviews and surveys are conducted with specialists in industry dealing with harmonic filter applications and the results are analysed as part of implementation of the developed methodology.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{power lines}} have some power quality {{problems such as}} voltage drop voltage sag, voltage fluctuation, voltage flicker, transient voltages etc. Those are some common problems in the distribution systems all over the world. Those problems are occurred due to reasons such as loading pattern, length of the line, consumer behavior in the feeder etc. Considering Sri Lanka, in recent history there was no much power requirement and the demand of the electricity supply is less. At present distribution system is expanded to the whole country and provides the electricity to each house hold. Additionally due to growing of economy in the country the industries, factories are also established and the demand growth is occurred very fast. Therefore the Power quality problems were raised in the distribution system rapidly in past few years. To minimize the voltage violation of the regulation, the several temporary solutions were adopted to the system in time to time by implementing the short term planning proposals. But they were not much suitable solutions to mitigate the voltage violation of the system permanently. This research was done to enhance the system voltage by applying the reactive power compensators along the distribution feeders. Analysis of the whole network of Sri Lanka by simulating {{is a very difficult}} task and therefore the most critical feeder of the down south network of the electricity is selected as a case study of the research. The same procedure is followed by another feeder also as derivation of the results. For this drastic problem, this study is carried out to find the solution by placing of reactive compensators in the distribution feeder to improve the voltage level within the required limit of ± 6 % of 33 kV as the CEB planning guide lines. The Synergee software is used to prepare a model and to analyze the feeder. Loading data of the transformers and conductor data in the feeder is required to prepare the model. This model is a mathematical model and by using load flow technique the model is analyzed. In this analysis, a range of voltage drops were recorded by adding capacitor banks to the line and there by the required sizes and locations of the capacitor banks were recorded as in the relevant voltage drop. Study about the capacitor bank types and installation methods were carried out to get the most effective solution. The results obtain from the study is to install one switching capacitor bank of 3600 kVar,and two fixed capacitor banks of 150 kVar and one 300 kVar fixed capacitor bank in the feeder which improve the voltage level within the required level of the regulation of CEB. As a Conclusion of this study, the voltage level improvement can be carried out with reactive power compensator placement to the medium voltage distribution line economically. The total capacitor bank sizes installed in the distribution feeder should be less than the required reactive power in that feeder. The Fixed capacitor banks should be installed at the most affected load ends with validation of off peak loads also. After selecting the fixed capacitor banks sizes the rest of the reactive power requirement should be installed with capacitor banks having switching facility and the harmonic damping reactors should be installed at the load center. The power utilities can implement the <b>capacitor</b> bank <b>installation</b> techniques to improve the voltage level up to regulated level in the distribution network. It is an economically viable solution where thoes capacitor banks can be used with any other feeder enhancement in the future and they will provide the additional benefits of improving power factor, reducing feeder losses etc...|$|R

Therefore, the low power factor may be appropriate to enable the rectifier and power of asynchronous machine of synchronous generator increasing its excitement. This should automatically be happened with increasing of discharge current filter <b>capacitor</b> <b>installation</b> and should be funded to some acceptable limits. The research is carried out in general terms, it can be used for asynchronous traction results in electric various serie...|$|E

On the other hand, the energy crisis triggered the increased use of Energy Saving Lamps (LHE), Computer, electronic power equipment that is the cause of harmonics that can interfere with the electrical distribution system including Distribution Transformer (TGD). By performing measurements in the TGD, it is known the existence of harmonic currents which can increase the losses on the TGD. In the measurements made on the TGD Education and Training Unit Lubuk Alung capacity of 160 kVA obtained that influence THDi (Total Harmonic Distortion) currents in the TGD (6. 57 %) while according to the standard (4 %). Shrinkage of 1. 22 years of age transformer (4. 067 %). By using ETAP simulation active <b>capacitor</b> <b>installation</b> of 60 KVAR and 1500 mH obtained THD decline to 8 % by neutral currents down to 12 A. From the simulation results ETAP effective current of each phase down 6 % while the neutral current down 64 %. Transformer derating of these conditions can be avoided and the use of the load can be increased. The impact of harmonics on transformer resulting in transformer losses increased from 3, 755 kW to 3. 775 kW. The increase in transformer losses (0. 16 %) led to decreased work efficiency transformer. This resulted in a decrease in the capacity of the transformer...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{evaluation procedure}} for {{the degree of}} active power losses reduction in the power transmission lines under 1 kV and 6 – 10 kV of the systems of electric power supply of industrial enterprises with compensating installations mounted {{at the side of}} the customer. The capacitor installations conform to the applied voltage level and factor in dielectric losses in the capacitors. The voltage at the compensating device terminal changes from 0. 95 to 1. 05 of the capacitors nominal voltage. The study did not account for reactive power losses in the line, nor did it for its charge capacity, conditioned by relative shortness of the cable lines generally operating in the mains of industrial enterprises. For this reason, the quantities of reactive power being consumed and generated by the transmission line are negligible and do not significantly affect the reactive power flux. The researchers obtain functional relations that allow estimating the degree of power loss reduction in the transmission line factoring in its explicit initial data. They perform mathematical analysis of the obtained functional relations and study the function by means of derivatives. The function extremum points are found as well as the intervals of its increment and decrement. A graphical research of the obtained functional relation is performed. It is ascertained that reduction of the active power losses is contingent on the line and the capacitor-installation engineering factors, the electrical energy consumer reactive load value as well as the voltage applied to the <b>capacitor</b> <b>installation.</b> The functional relations presented in the article can be employed in scoping calculation necessary for decision making on the reactive power compensation in systems of the industrial facilities electric power supply. Their account will allow a more accurate estimate of technical and economic effect of the capacitor bank installation in the electrical mains under 1 kV and 6 – 10 kV.  </p...|$|E
