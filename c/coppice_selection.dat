50|$|A {{regeneration}} method which {{depends on}} the sprouting of cut trees. Most hardwoods, the coast redwood, and certain pines naturally sprout from stumps and can be managed through coppicing. Coppicing is generally used to produce fuelwood, pulpwood, and other products dependent on small trees. A close relative of coppicing is pollarding. Three systems of coppice woodland management are generally recognized: simple coppice, coppice with standards, and the <b>coppice</b> <b>selection</b> system.|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{dynamics}} of birch (Betula aetnensis Rafin) coppices on the Mount Etna (Sicily). The {{aim of this}} paper is to evaluate the {{dynamics of}} Etna birch stands (Betula aetnensis Rafin) following the cessation of silvicultural activities in the Etna Regional Park (Sicily). We investigated forest structure, natural regeneration, vegetation and deadwood in different forest types. Our findings highlighted three different dynamics for birch populations: stable birch stands in the high mountain area which might represent an edapho-climax forest; progressive dynamic birch stands in the intermediate mountain area, showing a gradual depletion of birch and a concomitant replacement with monospecific stands (calabrian pine, beech, oaks) or mixed ones (with birch); pure birch stands (typical) that tend to be regressive - especially under stressful conditions - and to be replaced by xerophilous grasslands. Following the cessation of coppicing and with stand ageing, the stumps transformation into more homogeneous stand structures have been increasing. Within the context of protected areas the restoration of <b>coppice</b> <b>selection</b> system (with appropriate adaptations) could help to maintain the traditional forest landscape, acting as a silvicultural technique with low environmental and landscape impact...|$|E
40|$|Beech forests characterise the {{landscape}} of many mountain areas in Italy, from the Alps to the southern regions. This paper analyses the relationship between stand structure and the management history of beech in Italy. The aim is to outline possible strategies for the sustainable management of these forest formations. The present structure of beech forests in Italy {{is the result of}} many interacting factors. According to the National Forest Inventory, more than half the total area covered by beech {{has a long history of}} coppicing. High forests cover 34 % of the total beech area and 13 % have complex structures which have not been classified in regular types. Coppices are very widespread mainly because of the past, but also present importance of firewood and charcoal for mountain populations. A particular type of beech <b>coppice,</b> the <b>selection</b> <b>coppice</b> (or uneven aged coppice), was traditional in Tuscany and in some alpine areas. Starting from the fifties, following the widespread use of other low cost energy sources and the depopulation of mountain areas, many beech coppices have been progressively abandoned. Forest policies have been increasingly directed to favouring beech coppice conversion to high forests, which are considered more productive and ecologically more functional. Beech high forests have a very interesting management history which is a very good example of the separation between classical forest management, i. e., forest management systems defined by &# 8220;scientific forestry&# 8221;, described in text books and usually prescribed in forest regulation plans, and real life forest management, i. e., how forests have been, and mostly still are, actually managed. The analysis of the management history of beech high forests in Italy shows that management systems which favour simplified stand structure and composition according to rigid, predetermined models have been rarely applied. However, the traditional silviculture of beech stands in Southern Italy, based on the opening of very small gaps organized in time and space according to the different situations and to the reactions of the stand, can provide an example for a sustainable approach...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{characterize}} {{the state of the}} coppice on research plots Usakov and Hradisko. Describe resprouting of Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) in partial areas that were previously cutted down. Find out whether it would be theoretically possible under the conditions of the Czech Republic to manage the oak and hornbeam <b>coppice</b> using the <b>selection</b> system. Conducted to evaluate impact of executed felling on radial increment and high increment and establish basic principles of coppice tending. Within the thesis was characterized present state in both research plots. It revealed a high probability of resprouting and expressed its dependence on type of felling and polycormon parameters. The results shows that in Czech Republic is use of selection system in Sessile oak and European hornbeam coppice possible. Fellings carried out on research plots had a statistically significant effect on the radial increases of Sessile oak and European hornbeam. From the detected biomass increses was developed a model, that is possible to use when proceeding with <b>selection</b> system in <b>coppice</b> (determination of returnable time) ...|$|R
