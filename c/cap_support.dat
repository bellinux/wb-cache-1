40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} acquire {{mechanical}} performance of High <b>cap</b> <b>supporting</b> frame-shear structure, {{in view of}} the sea high <b>cap</b> <b>supporting</b> frame-shear theory analysis and numerical simulation of structure is less, this paper performs numerical simulation analysis for pile caps-soil-the upper structure using the finite element software ANSYS. Expression equation of wave force is given, and three-dimensional finite element model is established. By Analysis the deformation and stress of pile foundation and pile caps under different load combinations are obtained, and the deformation, bending moment of pile top, axial force are checked, finally the feasibility of the system is verified, and these can provide a reliable basis and reference for reasonable design of offshore structures. High <b>cap</b> <b>supporting</b> frame-shear structure for its strong adaptability is widely used in offshore construction system...|$|R

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} a growing health problem, {{affecting}} {{an increasing number of}} patients with rapidly increasing costs for the health care system. In spite of recent improvements in pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical treatments the prognosis for patients with severe heart failure is still poor. Heart failure is associated with numerous processes and changes in left ventricular structure and function often referred to as left ventricular remodelling. The Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device is a mesh-like polyester device designed to arrest and reverse these processes thereby facilitating left ventricular reversed remodelling in heart failure. We have explored the effect of passive containment surgery using the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device in heart failure patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Following application of the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device reduced cardiac dimensions, increased functional capacity, decreased levels of circulating plasma levels of Endothelin- I and improved quality of life was demonstrated. Furthermore, the possible beneficial effect on reduction on left ventricular dilatation with application of the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device concomitant with aortic valve replacement in patients with longstanding aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation was evaluated. No additive beneficial effects of application of the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device were found in these patients when compared to patients with chronic aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation undergoing aortic valve replacement as the sole procedure. The acute effects of application of the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device in experimental porcine myocardial infarction were investigated. No acute effect on hemodynamics, coronary vasomotor function, Endothelin- I levels or infarction size was demonstrated following application of the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device at induction of acute experimental myocardial infarction. Based on the findings in these studies it is concluded that application of the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device is safe, simple and without apparent negative effects. In heart failure patients with ventricular dilatation the Acorn Cor <b>Cap</b> Cardiac <b>Support</b> Device represents a novel and interesting amendment to current surgical treatment options with likely beneficial effects...|$|R

50|$|The Federal Office for Citizen Protection and Disaster Support (Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe, BBK) {{is working}} on an {{implementation}} based on CAP 1.2, which will allow for Internet-based access to data provided by the nation's modular warning system MoWaS. The development of MoWaS {{is based on the}} satellite-based warning system SatWaS from 2001, which only provides information to less than 150 state and media entities. In case no broadcast receiver, like a radio or television, is running nearby, the resulting warning effect of SatWaS would be severely limited, because many state-run emergency sirens have been left unmaintained or were dismantled altogether. The use of <b>CAP</b> <b>support</b> in MoWaS should alleviate this problem.|$|E

30|$|A {{main concern}} for European pastoralists in this pillar {{relates to the}} {{classification}} of land and thus their eligibility for CAP subsidy schemes. The Integrated Administration and Control System undertakes land categorisation and controls compliance with EU regulations. In order to benefit from CAP subsidies, a land area must be identified in the IACS system. Pastoralists' associations as well as environmental organisations claim that important portions of pastoral landsa are not classified as eligible for CAP payments and therefore the livestock owners who manage these lands cannot receive the relevant <b>CAP</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
40|$|The chapter {{develops}} a comparative analysis, among selected European Union Member States, {{of the investment}} demand, for farm buildings and machinery and equipment, of a sample of specialised arable crop farms as determined – inter alia – by different types and levels of Common Agricultural Policy (<b>CAP)</b> <b>support.</b> The empirical analysis investigates the role of long and short run determinants of investment levels as well as accounts {{for the presence of}} irregularities in the cost adjustment function due to the existence of threshold-type behaviours. Throughout the estimated models a consistent and significant long-run dynamic adjustment towards lower levels of the farms’ capital stocks is detected. The effect of <b>CAP</b> <b>support</b> on both types of investments is positive, although seldom significant. The elasticities of average net investment with respect to CAP payments are employed to simulate the effects of the recently proposed, reductions in the Pillar I CAP Direct Payments (DPs). Since these reform options imply, almost exclusively, a reduction in the level of support granted through DPs, simulated effects largely respect the expectation of a worsening of the farm investment prospects for both asset types (i. e., a larger negative investment or a smaller positive one). Notable exceptions concern investment in machinery and equipment in France and Italy which improve, irrespectively of the magnitude of the implemented cuts in DPs...|$|E

Disaggregated among six sub-sectors, the analysis shows Italian producers benefiting from sizeable subsidies, especially for dairy products, beef and mutton. This support is mainly financed by Italian households, as consumers and taxpayers. However, since Italy is a net importer within the EU, about one-fifth of the burden on Italian households goes to producers of other EU countries. Cap, Economic Transfers, Livestock, Italy...|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} four years, 36 % of upland farmers have reduced or stopped grazing on moorland, which is the highest most {{marginal}} land in the uplands. The most common reasons given were due to environmental schemes (61 %) and the poor financial return of upland livestock (38 %). These figures suggest that farmers have responded significantly to the incentives of environmental schemes to reduce overgrazing on moorland areas, but indicate that wider economic factors have also reduced the business incentive to graze moorland. While the changes in <b>CAP</b> <b>support</b> outlined above are important, consistently weak market prices up to 2007 (Gaskell et al. 2008) may also be relevant. Such reductions may also hinder farm businesses responding when market conditions improve, as they have since 2009.|$|E
