5|$|Isaac D'Israeli {{had never}} taken {{religion}} very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the <b>children</b> <b>if</b> they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had <b>children</b> <b>if</b> they were able to do it over again.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} on October 23, {{a series of}} phone calls between Green and Farrar {{escalated}} into a confrontation. Farrar was convinced that Green was continuing to drink heavily while {{she should have been}} caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the <b>children</b> <b>if</b> she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E

5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the <b>children</b> <b>if</b> Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{widespread}} fady about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption {{because of their}} resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or orthograde posture. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs. Known locally as babakoto ("Ancestor of Man"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors. Other lemur fady include the belief that a wife will have ugly <b>children</b> <b>if</b> her husband kills a woolly lemur, or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.|$|E

25|$|Early {{detection}} improves treatment success. Eye glasses {{may be all}} {{the treatment}} needed for some <b>children.</b> <b>If</b> this is not sufficient, treatments which force the child to use the weaker eye are used. This is done by either using a patch or putting atropine in the stronger eye. Without treatment, amblyopia typically persists into adulthood. Evidence regarding treatments for adults is poor.|$|E

In addition to sickness, social disorder could cause sterility of land or other disasters. Harmony could be restored only by confession and apology.|$|E

25|$|Temperance {{was very}} much a women's rights issue at that time because of laws that gave husbands {{complete}} control of the family and its finances. A woman with a drunken husband had little legal recourse even if his alcoholism left the family destitute and he was abusive to her and their <b>children.</b> <b>If</b> she obtained a divorce, which was difficult to do, he could easily end up with guardianship of the children.|$|E
25|$|If a {{vaccination}} program successfully reduces the disease threat, it {{may reduce the}} perceived risk of disease as cultural memories {{of the effects of}} that disease fade. At this point, parents may feel they have nothing to lose by not vaccinating their <b>children.</b> <b>If</b> enough people hope to become free-riders, gaining the benefits of herd immunity without vaccination, vaccination levels may drop to a level where herd immunity ceases to be as effective.|$|E

25|$|Kibbutz divorce {{rates were}} and are {{extremely}} low. Unfortunately {{from the point}} of view of the adults in the community, marriage rates among communally raised children were equally low. This conservatism on the part of kibbutz children has been attributed to the Westermarck effect—a form of reverse sexual imprinting whereby even unrelated <b>children,</b> <b>if</b> raised together from an early age, tend to reject each other as potential partners. The children who grew up together in the children's houses considered their peers brothers and sisters and had close lasting bonds with each other.|$|E

Bona pulled out the big guns with his tender loin steak and tropical BBQ sauce. It was a concern of Mark's that Bona might frighten young <b>children</b> <b>if</b> he was to host a show. Even though Mags struggled with the screen test and has no formal cooking training, she was declared the winner of heat 2 and Rita was granted a wild card.|$|E

His father, Arturo Falcone, {{the director of a}} provincial chemical laboratory, was married to Luisa Bentivegna. Giovanni had two older sisters, Anna and Maria. Falcone's parents emphasised the importance of hard work, bravery and patriotism; he later said they 'expected the maximum' from him.
