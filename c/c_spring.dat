50|$|The barouche, {{used in the}} 19th century, was a four-wheeled, shallow {{vehicle with}} two double seats inside, {{arranged}} vis-à-vis, so that the sitters {{on the front seat}} faced those on the back seat. It had a soft collapsible half-hood folding like a bellows over the back seat and a high outside box seat in front for the driver. The entire carriage was suspended on <b>C</b> <b>springs</b> and used leather straps to connect parts. It was drawn by a pair of high-quality horses and was used principally for leisure driving in the summer. A light barouche was a barouchet or barouchette. A barouche-sociable was described as a cross between a barouche and a victoria.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} {{suspension}} {{system has been}} one of the challenging tasks for engineers. The main function of any suspension system is to reduce or eliminate the road excitations transmitted to vehicle body. An effort has been made in this paper for a passive suspension system by using an optimization technique called Genetic algorithm to absorb vibrations as per ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 standards. The spring stiffness (ks), damping coefficient (<b>cs),</b> <b>sprung</b> mass (ms), unsprung mass (mu), tyre stiffness (kt) are optimized in such a way that ride comfort is increased. The quarter car and driver seat with the driver's body are simply modeled together as four degree of freedom (DOF) system by using SIMULINK for analyzing the ride comfort...|$|R

5000|$|The city {{is located}} at the {{intersection}} of the Lakavica, Ovče Pole, and Kočani valleys. Two rivers pass through Štip, the Bregalnica which is the second largest in the Republic of Macedonia, and the Otinja which divides the city center. The hill Isar, with its early medieval fortress on top, dominates the city and provides for the common reference as [...] "The city under the Isar'. The area surrounding the city is suffering from deforestation which is contributing to the temperature extremes, summers being hot and dry with mean temperatures around 32 C and days above 40 C being common. Winters are short (less than 2 months usually) and mild (though considered cold for the area) with normals around -2 C, but with occasional drops down to -10 <b>C.</b> <b>Spring</b> usually comes in February, when most of the foliage is regenerating, although freak snow storms could appear as late as May.|$|E
