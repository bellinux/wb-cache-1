As punishment of Adam's breach of trust, the Doctor returns him home, despite his pleading, and destroys his answering machine. When Adam's mother (Judy Holt) returns home, she reacts with shock and horror after inadvertently activating the implant installed in his forehead.|$|E

This update added the option to increase or decrease {{the size of the}} home buttons for easier use. The update also added a better fitness app, which had a better pedometer split into walking and running style. The update also included 16 new clock faces, which included designs like a Nixie tube clock face or an old-style clock face, and Disney-licensed designs, such as Mickey Mouse and Kermit the Frog, bringing to a total of 18 clock faces.

40|$|Existing therapies for {{symptoms}} {{related to}} painful <b>clicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporomandibular joint (TMJ) have rarely met with complete success and predicting prognosis remains difficult. Few {{studies have reported}} <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> maxillary flat occlusal splints (MFOSs) for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> painful <b>clicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TMJ, and few studies have evaluated the predisposing factors that influence <b>the</b> clinical outcomes <b>of</b> MFOSs. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} investigate <b>the</b> treatment efficacy <b>of</b> MFOSs for painful <b>clicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TMJ, and to determine the factors influencing TMJ therapy with MFOSs. We conducted a retrospective study of 109 patients suffering from unilateral clicking concurrent with preauricular area pain for at least 2 months between 2004 and 2008. Seventy-five patients were treated with an MFOS, while 34 patients did not receive MFOS therapy. Clicking score, pain-free maximal mouth opening, pain score, duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clicking</b> sounds, age and bruxism were recorded during treatment and involved into the reviews. <b>The</b> degree <b>of</b> joint <b>clicking</b> was determined by a stethoscope placed in <b>the</b> anterolateral area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external auditory canal and was divided into four grades. Data were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t test. Results showed statistically significant differences in treatment outcomes between the MFOS-treated and control groups in clicking index, maximal mouth opening, pain and complete remission rates of symptoms within 1 year. Furthermore, for patients treated with MFOS, there were statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes between those with a high clicking index and those with a low index before treatment. Factors significantly correlated with successful outcomes of MFOS included nocturnal bruxism, patient age and duration <b>of</b> <b>clicking.</b> MFOSs can be used to treat patients with painful <b>clicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TMJ and related symptoms. <b>The</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>clicking,</b> bruxism, age and duration <b>of</b> <b>clicking</b> are all important factors influencing treatment outcomes with MFOSs...|$|R

40|$|Interference of single-photon wave packets at a beam {{splitter}} usually leads to an anticorrelation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light intensity in the two output ports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{beam splitter}}.
