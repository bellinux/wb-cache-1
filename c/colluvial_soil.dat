The aim of this study was to determine the systematic position of <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> commonly found in the Chełmno and Brodnica Lake District, northern Poland. Ten soil pits located in different types of landscapes were selected for testing <b>soil</b> properties. The <b>colluvial</b> material is characterized by diversified properties: thickness, particle-size distribution, organic carbon content, color, pH, and base saturation. As a result, the investigated soils represent broad spectrum of typological units according to Polish Soil Classification (2011). Some of them contain epipedons mollic and meet the criteria of <b>colluvial</b> chernozemic <b>soils.</b> They were found mainly on buried black earths in areas with small slope inclinations. Many pedons contain pale colored acidic colluvial material with low base saturation and low organic carbon content and must be classified as other types: arenosols (in Polish: arenosole) or rusty soils (in Polish: gleby rdzawe). These soils occur mostly in areas with intensive relief and overlay the different soil types, including rusty soil and organic soils. They are formed as a result of soils lessivés and rusty soils truncation. An introduction of the additional units of “proper colluvial soils” which have epipedon ochric, and “rusty-colluvial soils” with endopedon sideric to the next edition of Polish Soil Classification would enable a more precise expression of the genesis of these soils in the type rank. Moreover, the definition of chernozemic <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> could be extended to <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> with umbric horizon.

40|$|The {{soil survey}} of Walker Branch Watershed (WBW) {{utilized}} the most up-to-date knowledge of soils, geology, and geohydrology {{in building the}} soils data base needed to reinterpret past research and to begin new research in the watershed. The soils of WBW were also compared with soils mapped elsewhere along Chestnut Ridge on the Oak Ridge Reservation to (1) establish whether knowledge obtained elsewhere could be used within the watershed, (2) determine whether there were any soils restricted to the watershed, and (3) evaluate geologic formation lateral variability. Soils, surficial geology, and geomorphology were mapped at a scale of 1 : 1200 using a paper base map having 2 -ft contour intervals. Most of the contours seemed to reasonably represent actual landform configurations, except for dense wooded areas. For example, the very large dolines or sinkholes were shown on the contour base map, but numerous smaller ones were not. In addition, small drainageways and gullies were often not shown. These often small but important features were located approximately as soil mapping progressed. WBW is underlain by dolostones of the Knox Group, but {{only a very small}} part of the surface area contains outcroppings of rock and most outcrops were located in the lower part. Soil mapping revealed the presence of both ancient alluvium and ancient colluvium deposits, not recognized in previous soil surveys, that have been preserved in high-elevation stable portions of present-day landforms. An erosional geomorphic process of topographic inversion requiring several millions of years within the Pleistocene is necessary to bring about the degree of inversion that is expressed in the watershed. Indeed, some of these ancient alluvial and colluvial remnants may date back into the Tertiary. Also evident in the watershed, and preserved in the broad, nearly level bottoms of dolines, are multiple deposits of silty material either devoid or nearly devoid of coarse fragments. Recent research indicates that most of this silty material is the result of slope wash processed during the Holocene Age. Residual soils of the watershed were related to the underlying geologic formations by their morphology and types of chert. <b>Colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> were identified and mapped whenever the colluvium thickness exceeded 20 in.

Except for the ancient <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> (colluvium without a present-day source area), <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> were not separated according to their geologic age, but stacked colluvial deposits are located in low footslope landforms. <b>Colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> in the watershed were identified and mapped according to their morphologic properties that would influence the perching and subsurface movement of water.

The spatial separation {{of these systems}} {{is thought to have}} contributed to the dynamics of social and political organization in pre-contact Hawai’i. However, deep stream valleys on older Hawaiian Islands often retain the remains of rainfed dryland agriculture on their lower slopes. We evaluated why rainfed agriculture developed on valley slopes on older but not younger islands by comparing soils of Pololū Valley on the young island of Hawai’i with those of Hālawa Valley on the older island of Moloka’i. Alluvial valley-bottom and <b>colluvial</b> slope <b>soils</b> of both valleys are enriched 4 – 5 -fold in base saturation and in P that can be weathered, and greater than 10 -fold in resin-extractable P and weatherable Ca, compared to soils of their surrounding uplands.

40|$|<b>Colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> are {{enriched in}} soil organic car- bon (SOC) in {{comparison}} to the soils of upslope areas due to the deposition and progressive burial of SOC. This burial of SOC has important implications for the global carbon cycle, but the long-term dynamics of buried SOC remain poorly constrained. We addressed this issue by determining the SOC burial efficiency (i. e. the fraction of originally de- posited SOC that is preserved in colluvial deposits) of buried SOC as well as the SOC stability in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils.</b> We quan- tified the turnover rate of deposited SOC by establishing sed- iment and SOC burial chronologies. The SOC stability was derived from soil incubation experiments and the δ 13 C val- ues of SOC. The C burial efficiency was found to decrease with time, reaching a constant ratio of approximately 17 % by about 1000 – 1500 yr post-burial. This decrease is attributed to the increasing recalcitrance of the remaining buried SOC with time and a less favourable environment for SOC decom- position with increasing depth. Buried SOC in colluvial pro- files was found to be more stable and degraded in compari- son to SOC sampled at the same depth at a stable reference location. This is due to the preferential mineralisation of the labile fraction of the deposited SOC. Our study shows that SOC responds to burial over a centennial timescale; how- ever, more insight into the factors controlling this response is required to fully understand how this timescale may vary, depending on specific conditions such as climate and depo- sitional environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a soil cover is a dynamic process. Soil cover can be altered within a few decades, which requires updating of the legacy soil maps. Soil erosion {{is one of the}} most important processes quickly altering soil cover on agriculture land. Colluvial soils develop in concave parts of the landscape as a consequence of sedimentation of eroded material. Colluvial soils are recognised as important soil units because they are a vast sink of soil organic carbon. Terrain derivatives became an important tool in digital soil mapping and are among the most popular auxiliary data used for quantitative spatial prediction. Prediction success rates are often directly dependent on raster resolution. In our study, we tested how raster resolution (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 meters) influences spatial prediction of colluvial soils. Terrain derivatives (altitude, slope, plane curvature, topographic position index, LS factor and convergence index) were calculated for the given raster resolutions. Four models were applied (boosted tree, neural network, random forest and Classification/Regression Tree) to spatially predict the soil cover over a 77 ha large study plot. Models training and validation was based on 111 soil profiles surveyed on a regular sampling grid. Moreover, the predicted real extent and shape of the <b>colluvial</b> <b>soil</b> area was examined. In general, no clear trend in the accuracy prediction was found without the given raster resolution range. Higher maximum prediction accuracy for <b>colluvial</b> <b>soil,</b> compared to prediction accuracy of total soil cover of the study plot, can be explained by the choice of terrain derivatives that were best for Colluvial soils differentiation from other soil units.

40|$|Colluvial {{soils are}} usually coarse and widely graded. Shallow-seated {{failures}} occur frequently in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soil</b> deposits during rainfall infiltration. This paper investigates {{the behavior of}} coarse, widely graded soils under very low confining pressures of 5 - 25 kPa encountered in shallow-seated failures. Isotropic consolidation tests, drained triaxial tests, and undrained triaxial tests were conducted on several widely graded soils with different coarse contents but with the same void ratio of 0. 62. With increasing coarse content, the soil microstructure changes from a fines-controlled structure to a coarse-controlled structure after a critical coarse content of approximately 70 %. Silty sand with gravel with a coarse content close to the critical value exhibits the highest compressibility {{because of the presence}} of large interaggregate pores. Even under very low confining pressures, such soil still shows strong contractive behavior during drained loading, and generates large positive pore-water pressures during undrained loading. This explains why shallow-seated failures occur frequently in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soil</b> deposits caused by rainfall infiltration. Soils with lower or higher coarse contents than the critical value may show dilative behavior under the same low confining pressures.

Here, we studied the persistence of OC along an eroding hillslope using soil in situ surface heterotrophic respiration measurement as an indicator. Along this topographical gradient, we quantified the space-time distribution of soil water and temperature {{as well as the}} amount of labile OC (i. e. NaOCl-non-resistant) in relation to CO 2 fluxes. We used a Generalized Least Square (GLS) regression model (i) to identify the role of each abiotic factor as well as their interactions, and (ii) to quantify spatial differences in CO 2 fluxes along the hillslope. We observed significant differences in respiration along the topographical gradient, i. e. 30 % more at the downslope and 50 % more at the backslope, relative to the uneroded summit position. Soil OC persistence along the hillslope was mainly controlled by the labile OC stock and moisture content. Our in-situ measurements also indicated that the temperature sensitivity of soil OC (as expressed by Q 10 values) was strongly related to soil water content. The large stock of OC stored in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> has a higher temperature sensitivity (Q 10 ¼ 3. 72 ± 0. 17) than in non-depositional slope positions(Q 10 ¼ 1. 77 ± 0. 18 to 2. 59 ± 0. 13). Given the large stock of labile OC, its high temperature sensitivity and the high water contents that are needed to stabilize OC, we conclude that the OC stored in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> is particularly vulnerable to OC mineralization under drier/warmer conditions.

This study was carried out to identify and compare spatial variation of some soil physical properties by geostatistics in alluvial and adjacent <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> formed under ustic moisture regime at Gökhöyük State Farm (1750 ha), Amasya, Turkey. Seventy four soil samples were collected on a regular grid (500 × 500 -m) and additional 224 samples were collected on 28 500 -m fine-transects, randomly superimposed between the nodes of grids. Semivariograms and corresponding kriging maps for soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), bulk density (BD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and available water content (AWC) were prepared. Statistical analyses were conducted separately for colluvial and alluvial sites as well as whole area. The soils in alluvial site is rich in clay with high BD and SOM, and low in Ks and AWC; and the <b>soils</b> in <b>colluvial</b> site was designated as low in Ks, SOM, and AWC and high in BD. All variables, except SOM, showed a strong spatial dependency. In general, nugget, sill and range values of most of the studied soil variables decreased from alluvial site to colluvial site. When local (alluvial and colluvial sites separately) and global (alluvial + colluvial) kriged maps for BD, AWC, and soil textural separates, use of global semivariograms (one semivariogram for entire study area) resulted in lost of some details in colluvial sites, suggesting that local semivariograms for alluvial and <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> should be used in kriging predictions at the farm.

40|$|A {{significant}} part of the soil organic carbon (SOC) that is eroded in uplands is deposited and buried in colluvial settings. Understanding the fate of this deposited soil organic carbon is of key importance for the understanding of the role of (accelerated) erosion in the global C cycle: the residence time of the deposited carbon will determine if, and for how long, accelerated erosion due to human disturbance will induce sequestration of SOC from the atmosphere to the soil. Experimental studies may provide useful information, but, given the time scale under consideration, the response of the colluvial SOC can only be simulated using numerical models which need careful calibration using field data. In this study, we present a depth explicit SOC model including soil profile evolution due to sedimentation to simulate the long-term C dynamics in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils.</b> The SOC profile predicted by our model is in good agreement with field observations. The C burial efficiency (the ratio of current C content of the buried sediments to the original C content at the time of sedimentation) of deposited sediments exponentially decreases with time and gradually reaches an equilibrium value. This equilibrium C burial efficiency is positively correlated with the sedimentation rate. The sedimentation rate is crucial for the long-term dynamics of the deposited SOC as it controls the time that buried sediments spend at a given soil depth, thereby determining its temporal evolution of C input and decomposition rate during the burial process: C input and decomposition rate vary with depth due to the vertical variation of root distribution and soil environmental factors such as (but not limited to) humidity, temperature, and aeration. The model demonstrates that, for the profiles studied, it takes circa 300 [*]years for the buried SOC to lose half of its C load. It would also take centuries for the SOC accumulated in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> over the past decades due to soil redistribution under mechanized agriculture to be released to the atmosphere after the application of soil conservation measures such as conservation tillage...|$|R

We focused on the evolution of landforms as a key factor in the configuration of alluvial and colluvial sequences. The geomorphological and sedimentological studies indicate that the distribution of landforms is a main factor to understand the formation of <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils.</b> Granitic macroforms dominate the present landscape, constituted by alveolar depressions surrounded by crests and slabs. The thickest sedimentary deposits were found in the depressions. We identified two main stratigraphic units: a basal inorganic layer represented by alluvio‑ colluvial sediments, formed in a highly energetic environment, probably dating to the Younger Dryas (> 11000 years BP), and a younger unit of thick sandy, blackish, organic matter rich, colluvium. The oldest radiocarbon age obtained for this unit indicates that it may have started to form by 11240 ‑ 11130 cal. BP. The Holocene <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> show discontinuities in grain size, soil reaction, elemental composition of the inorganic phase and molecular composition of the soil organic matter. These features are evidence of the occurrence of several phases of erosion/sedimentation (i. e. landscape instability), some of which were coeval with known periods of Holocene abrupt climate change – the 8. 2 ka event, the beginning of the Neoglaciation (ca. 6 ka BP) or the 2. 8 ka wet/cold event. But some of the most intense phases coincided with increased human pressure on landscape during the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman Period, and the Middle Ages. Charcoal layers, burnt soil layers and the highly aromatic nature of the soil organic matter point to frequent fire episodes. Pollen studies also indicated a sharp decrease in forest cover beginning by ca. 6000 cal BP, which seems to have been accompanied by a progressive soil acidification with time.

A new interpretative procedure is developed to calculate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity based on the monitored water content, suction, and wetting front advancing velocity. The proposed technique is used to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of five <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils.</b> The results indicate that the proposed technique is timesaving (i. e., requires several days for a complete test) and can be applicable over wide ranges of suctions and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities. The measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity using the wetting front advancing method is similar to that obtained when using the instantaneous profile method. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequent}} use of copper fungicides in grape production results in increased accumulation of total copper in the surface layer of vineyard soils. The objective {{of this research was}} to survey copper concentration and determine degree of pollution or contamination with copper in surface soils of vineyards on island Hvar. Sampling was undertaken on anthropogenic <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils,</b> anthropogenic terrace soils on pleistocene calcareous aeolian sands and anthropogenic soils on quaternary alluvial, aeolian and diluvium depositions. Concentrations of total copper in the vineyard soils under research range from 50. 60 - 276. 33 mg kg- 1. Copper concentrations were significantly (p< 0. 01) higher in anthropogenic soils on quaternary alluvial, aeolian and diluvium depositions than on other soils sites tested. According to the specifications provided within the “Regulations on Protection of Cultivated Land from Contamination by Hazardous Substances” (NN 9 / 14) sixteen out of twenty-seven vineyard soils under research were polluted and five were contaminated with copper. Th e results of this research provide further data relevant to the inventory of heavy metals in vineyard soils of this part of the Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Strategies and {{techniques}} {{for the use}} of airborne digital image data equivalent to the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and from the NASA Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) in geological mapping are discussed. The test areas are in complex Archaean greenstone terrain that has been subject to deep lateritic weathering and subsequent incision. These are spectrally unlike areas that have been covered before, and the analysis is based on new reflected and emitted spectra of natural surfaces. The newly available Landsat TM data over most of Western Australia is seen to have unprecedented potential as an aid to geological mapping in such intractible terrains because of the consistent and clear discrimination of weathered rock surfaces and <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> over a wide range of rock types, particularly in decorrelation stretched three-band and band ratio images. The discrimination is due to the fortuitous association of mixtures of weathering products rather than to the primary mineralogy of the rocks. TIMS data are less useful in bedrock mapping, but offer considerable advantages for mapping the distribution of different types of superficial cover...|$|R
40|$|Pedostratigraphic levels (PLs) {{are typical}} assemblages of soil-genetic horizons, formed by {{materials}} {{having the same}} degree of weathering. The pedostratigraphic approach can be very useful to comprehend the formation of the Quaternary soil cover, the environmental evolution of a territory, and to estimate the age of paleosols. A pedostratigraphic study of a Terra Rossa was carried out to understand the soil–parent material origin and to estimate the time of the beginning of pedogenesis. Besides soil and geomorphological survey, the Terra Rossa was analyzed for Fe forms, geochemistry, clay mineralogy, micromorphology, and with scanning electron microscope. Optical dating was applied to obtain age estimates for the deposition of the parent material of soil formation. The insoluble residue of limestone was obtained and analyzed for geochemistry and clay mineralogy. The bedrock is constituted by Quaternary lacustrine limestone, showing pronounced karst landforms. The soil profile is situated in a little dissolution doline and was divided into three PLs: PL 1 (0 – 110 cm) is constituted by cambic and ochric horizons, formed during Holocene in a mixture of <b>colluvial</b> <b>soil</b> sediments and fresh limestone, with aeolian components; PL 2 (110 – 290 cm) includes two argic horizons, which began to form during Late-Middle Pleistocene in <b>colluvial</b> <b>soil</b> sediments, with few aeolian additions; PL 3 (290 – 330 cm) is constituted by a red argic horizon, with nitic properties, which developed from the insoluble residue of the limestone. The age of PL 3 was calculated through a mass balance and an estimation of the limestone-dissolution rate during the Quaternary, which led to an approximate age of Middle Pleistocene, between 250 and 500 ky BP. The time of the beginning of pedogenesis on limestone {{can be used as a}} reference for the tectonic uplifting of the area and emersion of the plateau...|$|E
40|$|Soil and terrain {{changes as}} a result of {{increased}} erosion and accumulation processes in selected locations Abstract Colluvial soils are formed in areas with increased intensity of soil erosion. Colluvial soils originate {{as a result}} of their position in terrain, they are usually found in places where has accumulated erosion material. Very often they are to be found at the around of slopes. Their accumulation horizon is deeper than 25 cm with a great amount of organic carbon buried in it. In my diploma thesis I will attempt to take a closer look at three locations, each having different types of dominant soils. The aim of this diploma thesis is to rebuild the original shape of the terrain before the beginning of the soil erosion process.

40|$|Failure of <b>colluvial</b> <b>soil</b> {{deposits}} {{induced by}} rainfall {{is a common}} geohazard in the natural terrain. Many colluvial soils are widely and gap graded with a minimal sand fraction. In order to study the pore water pressures in such gap-graded, unsaturated soil deposits through a seepage analysis and to evaluate the stability of these soil deposits, the soil-water characteristic curves for gap-graded soils must be known. Usually, gap-graded soils exhibit bimodal grain-size and pore-size distributions. This technical note presents a theoretical continuum method for the determination of soil-water characteristic curves for soils with a bimodal or multimodal pore-size distribution. Based on the capillary law, the water content in a multimodal soil {{is equal to the}} sum of water stored in each pore series in the soil. Therefore, the bimodal or multimodal soil-water characteristic curves can be obtained by combining the unimodal soil-water characteristic curves for all components of the soil corresponding to the pore series weighted by the respective volumetric percentages. The proposed method is verified using experimental soil-water characteristics data of sand-diatomaceous earth mixtures with dual porosity...|$|E

2500|$|The Canyons and Dissected Highlands {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by steeply sloping, upper river canyons and dissected plateaus in the rain shadow of the mountains. It includes the southern Seven Devils Mountains and pieces of the uplifted Columbia Plateau, where the basalt has been eroded {{to a series of}} knife-edge ridges flanked by deep canyons. The region occupies the elevational zone above the unforested Canyons and Dissected Uplands, at an elevation of 4,000to6,400feet (1,219to1,951m). The steep terrain limits human activities. The region is drier than the marine-influenced Mesic Forest Zone that exists at similar elevations to the west. Moisture retaining loess and ash soils support Douglas-fir, larch, and grand fir on relatively level benches and Douglas-fir in unstable <b>colluvial</b> <b>soils</b> on steep canyon slopes. Western ponderosa pine forest is also present, with ninebark, snowberry, oceanspray, heartleaf arnica, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bluegrass. Riparian areas support mountain alder, stinking and prickly currant, thimbleberry, and Columbia monk’s hood. The region covers [...] in Oregon, [...] in Idaho, and smaller areas in Washington, including parts of the Wallowa-Whitman, Nez Perce, and Payette National Forests, the Wenaha–Tucannon Wilderness, and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.|$|R
