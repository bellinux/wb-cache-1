40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} conditioning cutaneous nociceptive inputs by a new "pinch" model on the jaw-stretch reflex and the exteroceptive suppression periods (ES 1 and ES 2) in jaw muscles. Methods: The jaw-stretch reflex was evoked {{with the use of}} a custom-made muscle stretcher and electrical stimuli were used to evoke an early and late exteroceptive suppression period (ES 1 and ES 2) in the jaw-closing muscles. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded bilaterally from the masseter and temporalis muscles. These brainstem reflexes were recorded in 19 healthy men (28. 8 +/- 1. 1 years) during three different conditions: one painful <b>clip</b> <b>applied</b> to the earlobe; one painful <b>clip</b> <b>applied</b> to the nostril, and four painful <b>clips</b> <b>applied</b> simultaneously to the earlobe, nostril, eyebrow, and lower lip. Pain intensity induced by the application of the clips was scored continuously by the subjects on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: The highest VAS pain scores were evoked by placement of four clips (79 +/- 0. 5 mm). There was no significant modulation of the jaw-stretch reflex (ANOVAs: P = 0. 929), the ES 1 (P = 0. 298) or ES 2 (P = 0. 082) in any of the three painful conditions. Conclusions: Intense and tonic cutaneous pain could be elicited by this new "pinch" pain model; however, there was no significant modulation on either excitatory or inhibitory brainstem reflex responses. Significance: The novel observation that high-intensity pinch stimuli applied to the craniofacial region fail to modulate two different brainstem reflexes is in contrast to other experimental pain studies documented facilitation of the jaw-stretch reflexes or inhibition of exteroceptive suppression periods. The clinical implication of the present findings is that only some craniofacial pain conditions could be expected to show perturbation of the brainstem reflex responses.

In practice, however, contamination {{has never been}} a problem, and it has been found practicable to remove the used capillary tubes after one run and replace these carefully with fresh sterile ones. If the capillary tubes had been charged with pathogenic microorganisms, this handling procedure might constitute a hazard to the operator. In that event, the lower ends of the used capillary tubes should be immersed in an appro-priate disinfectant contained in a suitable vessel such as a 600 ml beaker. The height of the vessel would be adjusted with the laboratory jack so that the capillary tubes are introduced belowthe surfaceofthe disinfectant before their removal. Each tube would be individually removed by <b>applying</b> <b>forceps</b> below the lower polypropylene sheet of the capillary holder and carefully pulling downwards until the tube is freed from the teflon collar and slides into the disinfectant.

30|$|Some {{questions}} and uncertainties could be highlighted {{with this case}} report. We {{do not know what}} could be the physiological healing history of the remaining proximal tube in case of migrated Filshie clips and so whether a recanalisation is a rare but unavoidable risk or whether there is an increased likelihood of recanalisation after usage of diathermy. It could be assumed that all would depend on the length and consistency of the fibrosis which is maintained at the most distal part of the proximal remaining tube. Most of surgeons use currently only one Filshie <b>clip</b> adequately <b>applied</b> on each tube. However in our case, two <b>clips</b> were <b>applied</b> and the ischemia and scar formation could be different than with 1 clip application. In our case, also all four clips migrated. Perhaps the usage of two clips on each tube might have created more tubal ischemia and hence higher risk of clip migration in long term. The ischemic tissue might become weaker in time and clips might not maintain in the appropriate position on the tubal isthmus.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent ischemic {{events are}} known to occur during {{diagnostic}} and interventional endovascular procedures between 10 % and 69 % of the time. The occurrence of silent and symptomatic ischemic events in the surgically treated population is not known, although atherosclerotic changes of intracranial vessels or within the aneurysms wall or neck area are seen often during surgery. METHODS: Patients with unruptured and ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated by microsurgical clipping were prospectively evaluated with MRI using diffusion-weighted imaging sequences before and within 24 hours after surgery. Patients were evaluated clinically before and after surgery. During surgery, the overall and maximal time of temporary occlusion {{as well as the}} total number of temporary and finally <b>applied</b> <b>clips</b> was noted. Diffusion-weighted images were analyzed with determination and characterization of diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with 51 aneurysms were included. One symptomatic and 5 silent ischemic lesions were found in 5 patients. This represents a risk of silent ischemia of 9. 8 % per treated aneurysm and a risk of symptomatic stroke of 2 %. The most significant risk factor in increasing order was: age (P< 0. 05), presence of thrombus (P< 0. 05), number of final <b>clips</b> <b>applied</b> (P< 0. 05), number of temporary clips used (P< 0. 01), total time of temporary clip occlusion (P< 0. 001), and maximal time of temporary occlusion (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of silent and symptomatic ischemic events during microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms seems to be low. Microsurgical clipping is safe and should continue to be strongly considered as a treatment option...|$|R
40|$|The study aims at {{developing}} and exploring a novel video-based assessment that captures classroom management expertise (CME) {{of teachers and}} for which statistical results are provided. CME measurement is conceptualized by using four video clips that refer to typical classroom management situations in which teachers are heavily challenged (involving the challenges to manage transitions, instructional time, student behavior, and instructional feedback) and by applying three cognitive demands posed on respondents when responding to test items related to the video clips (accuracy of perception, holistic perception, and justification of action). Research questions are raised regarding reliability, testlet effects (related to the four video <b>clips</b> <b>applied</b> for measurement), intercorrelations of cognitive demands, and criterion-related validity of the instrument. Evidence is provided that (1) using a video-based assessment CME {{can be measured in}} a reliable way, (2) the CME total score represents a general ability that is only slightly influenced by testlet effects related to the four video clips, (3) the three cognitive demands conceptualized for the measurement of CME are highly intercorrelated, and (4) the CME measure is positively correlated with declarative-conceptual general pedagogical knowledge (medium effect size), whereas it shows only small size correlations with non-cognitive teacher variables...|$|R

Image intensity was quantified in absolute Hounsfield units for clips and adjacent lumen and then normalized to the average lumen intensity. ResultsNo difference in absolute intensity was found between polymer clips and adjacent lumen (polymer clip 1021. 2 ± 19. 0 absolute Hounsfield units, adjacent lumen 1001. 7 ± 15. 7 absolute Hounsfield units, P =. 095).

Methods: Survival and growth of individuals of Quercus ilex and Q. cerrioides were evaluated in plants subjected to different fire histories and experimental disturbances (burning, cutting or <b>clipping)</b> <b>applied</b> either before or after summer. Results: Survival was high (> 99 %), with both species showing a similar high resistance to disturbances. Growth after experimental disturbance was positively related {{to the size of the}} individual before the latest forest fire occurred. Fire history had a large effect on resprout growth, as the repeated incidence of disturbances lowered the capacity of individuals to grow. The type and season of experimental disturbance experienced by plants had a large effect. Individuals that experienced total above-ground loss had lower growth rates than those with partial loss. A similar pattern was observed in individuals disturbed after the summer in relation to those disturbed before summer. Conclusions: The larger growth rates recorded in Q. cerrioides across all fire histories and experimental treatments, and the higher vulnerability of Q. ilex to increased fire frequency, intensity of experimental disturbance, and disturbance season, provide evidence for the relatively high susceptibility of the latter to repeated disturbances.
