5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the <b>clock</b> <b>hands</b> of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
25|$|The First Key can be {{separated}} into two Keys, taking {{the forms of}} the minute and hour hands of a clock. The Hour Hand is {{more powerful than the}} Minute Hand, but the Minute Hand is quicker and can be used more often. When combined, they make the First Key and {{take the form of a}} sword which bears some resemblance to the <b>clock</b> <b>hands,</b> having a silver and golden blade. It gives dominion over the Lower House and Monday.|$|E
25|$|The {{clock in}} the {{building}} tower was originally mechanical in nature, and kept accurate time via gravity. A cable was wrapped around a drum, and a large weight attached {{to the end of}} the cable. As the cable unwound due to the force of gravity, the <b>clock</b> <b>hands</b> turned. The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable and plunged through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who had just gotten up from his desk). The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E

5000|$|While Salzburg {{took over}} the parking disc from Paris there was also another variant in Vienna. The city {{introduced}} a parking disc on 16 March 1959 that had a single clock face with a <b>clock</b> <b>hand</b> with two marks that were exactly on hour away. When the black mark of the <b>clock</b> <b>hand</b> was set {{to the time of}} arrival on the clock face the red mark would point to the time of departure. This design was introduced by the director of urban planning Aladar Pecht so that it would also be nicknamed [...] "Pechtscheibe" [...] (Pecht Disc).|$|R
25|$|The clock {{tower and}} -tall {{ornamental}} spire {{is a local}} landmark and reference point in downtown Dallas. There are four 20ft (9.4meter) diameter tower clocks. New tower clock movements and hands were manufactured in 2007 by Electric Time Company. The <b>clock</b> <b>hands</b> are lighted with LEDs, which replaced the original neon. Above the clock a series of LED (originally neon) lights display weather information. White light rings flash upward when temperatures will rise and downward when they fall. A star-shaped light at the spire's top glows green when weather forecast is fair and red when it's inclement.|$|E
500|$|Swiatek and Breen {{describe}} the obverse {{of the quarter}} eagle as [...] "very Art Deco". Liberty appears on it, wearing a liberty cap and holding both a scroll representing the United States Declaration of Independence and a torch likely intended to recall the Statue of Liberty. The reverse depicts Independence Hall, where the Declaration was signed, and the rising sun behind it. [...] Sinnock's initials are to the right, above {{the right wing of}} the building. Bowers pointed out that the depiction of Independence Hall closely resembles that on the Bicentennial half dollar, struck a half century later. As no <b>clock</b> <b>hands</b> are seen on the bell tower of the building on the quarter eagle, it is not possible to say what time is intended—on the Bicentennial half dollar, the time is 3:00.|$|E
2500|$|Woodward {{claimed that}} {{when he wanted to}} meet Deep Throat, he would move a {{flowerpot}} with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment, number 617, at the Webster House at 1718 P Street, Northwest, and on occasion when Deep Throat wanted a meeting, he would circle the page number on page twenty of Woodward's copy of The New York Times and draw <b>clock</b> <b>hands</b> to signal the hour. Adrian Havill questioned these claims in his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, stating Woodward's balcony faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street, but Woodward responded that it has been bricked in since he lived there. Havill also claimed that copies of The Times were not delivered marked by apartment, but Woodward and a former neighbor disputed this claim. Woodward has stated: ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{read through}} his manuscript, {{and then sat}} {{thinking}} and gnawing his knuckle. It would look queer now if he owned up. He must beat Wedderburn. He forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John Burns and Bradlaugh. Besides, he reflected, the glimpse {{of the rest of}} the slip he had had was, after all, quite accidental, forced upon him by chance, a kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage. It was not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of Broome, who believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray daily for a first-class. [...] "Five minutes more," [...] said the demonstrator, folding up his paper and becoming observant. Hill watched the <b>clock</b> <b>hands</b> until two minutes remained; then he opened the book of answers, and, with hot ears and an affectation of ease, gave his drawing of the lenticel its name.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the formation of}} moving shadows on the circumbinary (CB) disk of young binary systems. Moving shadows can be created by a dusty disk wind of the secondary component. The densest parts of the dusty disk wind and the associated common envelope can be optically thick and may block the stellar radiation inside a certain solid angle, resulting in {{the appearance of a}} moving shadow zone. Its shape and size depends on the mass loss rate, the disk wind velocity, and optical properties of the dust. Our calculations show that the shadow zone is observable if the mass loss rate ˙Mw is greater than 10 − 9 M ⊙ per year. This shadow resembles a <b>clock</b> <b>hand.</b> If the orbit is an elliptical, the properties of this <b>clock</b> <b>hand</b> will change during the orbital motion of the secondary...|$|R
60|$|One Saturday {{night it}} was my {{pleasant}} duty to put the paper to bed alone. A King or courtier or a courtesan or a community {{was going to die}} or get a new Constitution, or do something that was important {{on the other side of}} the world, and the paper was to be held open till the latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram. It was a pitchy black night, as stifling as a June night can be, and the loo, the red-hot wind from the westward, was booming among the tinder-dry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels. Now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the flop of a frog, but all our weary world knew that was only pretence. It was a shade cooler in the press-room than the office, so I sat there, while the type ticked and clicked, and the night-jars hooted at the windows, and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their foreheads and called for water. The thing that was keeping us back, whatever it was, would not come off, though the loo dropped and the last type was set, and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat, with its finger on its lip, to wait the event. I drowsed, and wondered whether the telegraph was a blessing, and whether this dying man, or struggling people was aware of the inconvenience the delay was causing. There was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make tension, but, as the <b>clock</b> <b>hands</b> crept up to three o'clock and the machines spun their fly-wheels two and three times to see that all was in order, before I said the word that would set them off, I could have shrieked aloud.|$|E

5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the <b>clock's</b> <b>hands</b> move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|R
