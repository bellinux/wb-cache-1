5|$|Hill censer: The hill <b>censer,</b> {{a vessel}} used for burning incense, {{dates to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). The censers are shaped like {{mountains}} and were used for religious rituals. The shape of the hill <b>censer</b> acts as a visual aid for envisioning the sacred mountains that {{were said to have}} been inhabited by Taoist immortals. Hill censers were originally designed for Taoist rituals, but were later used by Chinese Buddhists. Hill censers often include carvings of wilds animals and birds. Some censers depict waves at the foundation of the vessel, said to be the waves of the East China Sea. A hole {{at the top of the}} <b>censer</b> releases the smoke of the incense.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{interior}} has preserved {{a number}} of medieval frescoes, particularly in the lower reaches of the walls and pillars. The paintings in the altar were done in the 11th–12th century, while the decoration of the pillars dates to the 12th century. All inscriptions that accompany the murals are in Medieval Greek. The altar features the images of four deacons bearing a <b>censer</b> and monstrances {{as well as two}} bishops who could possibly be identified as Basil of Caesarea and John Chrysostom. A number of saints are also depicted inside the church, including Saint Elijah, Saints Cosmas and Damian, Saint Hermolaus, Saint Pantaleon, and four unidentified female saints. There are also later works of art in the church. It boasts icons or murals by painter Ivan Dospevski from 1881 as well as works by Mihail Belstoynev.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner <b>Censer</b> agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a <b>censer.</b> Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E

25|$|The church {{houses a}} small {{collection}} of religious objects (sculpture and reliquaries), about 3 dozen {{examples from the}} 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, some of which come from the Carmelite Convent of São José, and from two shrines elsewhere in town. Among these objects is a silver <b>censer,</b> and a carved image of the Christ Child. The <b>censer,</b> {{in the shape of}} a boat, is still used today during the most solemn ceremonies. Its profusion of ornamentation with volutes, acanthus leaves, seraphim heads, etc. is characteristic of the Baroque period of the first half of the 18th century. There is no information about its creator, but it was probably one of the Algarve artists well known for this type of work.|$|E

And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his <b>censer</b> and stood between {{the living and the dead}} till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).|$|E

25|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church, altar servers {{assist the}} higher clergy during services. They might carry the cross, candles or liturgical fans in processions and entrances; {{maintain}} the <b>censer,</b> ensuring it has enough live charcoal, loading it with incense and {{handing it to}} the priest or deacon when required; preparing the hot water (zeon) in time {{for it to be}} added to the chalice at the Divine Liturgy; prepare the antidoron for the people to receive after Holy Communion; and any other necessary tasks so that the priest need not be distracted during the service. An altar server is vested in the sticharion only.|$|E
25|$|At the Divine Liturgy, {{during the}} Liturgy of Preparation, when the Aër {{is to be}} placed over the Gifts (the Bread and Wine for the Eucharist), it is first wrapped around the <b>censer</b> and then laid over the Chalice and Diskos, so that {{the front edge of}} the Aër just touches the surface of the table. When not {{covering}} the Gifts, the Aër is folded (usually folded 3 x 3, so that when it is laid out flat the creases will form a cross). The Aër normally has a cross embroidered in its exact center, so that when it is folded the cross is visible.|$|E
25|$|On strict fast {{days when}} {{food and drink}} are {{prohibited}} before vespers, e.g., Christmas Eve, the Annunciation when it falls on a weekday of great lent, or Holy Saturday, Vespers is joined to the Divine Liturgy, functioning {{in place of the}} typica as the framework of the hymns of the Liturgy of the Catechumens. After the readings from the Old Testament, the Trisagion is chanted, followed by the Epistle and Gospel, and the Divine Liturgy proceeds normally from that point. On these occasions, as at other times when the Gospel is read at vespers, the Little Entrance is made with the Gospel Book instead of the <b>censer.</b>|$|E

25|$|Parts of the {{building}} are 12th century, including the inner doorway of the north porch. The nave was rebuilt {{near the end of}} the 14th century, and is notable for its 14th- or 15th-century stone pulpit and a set of wall paintings dating from about 1440. The church has remnants of a set of 15th-century stained glass windows. The most complete survivor is one on the southeast corner of the nave depicting Saint James the Great. In the tracery at the top of the east window of the chancel survive images of Christ in Majesty with Saint Mary, flanked by cherubim and an angel using a <b>censer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1688, Captain Bartlomeu de Frias Coutinho, {{expressed}} {{his intention to}} enter the convent, ordering the construction of three rooms in the last dormitory of the western wing, for his spaces. On 23 February, a new image of the Virgin Mary was installed in the front niche, executed by Fauger again, and in white marble which was specially ordered by his son, Father João da Madre de Deus, who ministered in the Recolhimento (religious shelter). The master sculptor also built various columns, pedestals, angels, cherubs and images (including Nossa Senhora da Piedade and São José). The artisan died in 1693, before concluding the altar for the image of Nossa Senhora da Consolação. While a resident at the convent, Father Bartolomeu de Frias Coutinho worked on improving the roads to the chapel in 1695 and decorated the sepulchre tomb, during the Paschal Triduum of Holy Week, and other small works. Upon his death in 1696, Bartolomeu's testament left all his worldly possessions to the shelter, including his books and monies, {{to be used to}} create a silver <b>censer</b> and chains (with leftover funds).|$|E
