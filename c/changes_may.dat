5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate <b>changes</b> <b>may</b> further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these <b>changes</b> <b>may</b> result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|Boyce was a multi-millionaire by {{the early}} 1900s and by 1909 became more {{interested}} in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These <b>changes</b> <b>may</b> have been in part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement {{that he and his}} wife, Mary Jane, were separating.|$|E

5|$|<b>Changes</b> <b>may</b> affect {{specific}} sounds or {{the entire}} phonological system. Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal <b>changes</b> <b>may</b> be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E

25|$|Inflammation in {{the body}} may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Also, in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{fisheries}} {{are very}} vulnerable to climate change. Most {{of the research}} {{to date on the}} relation-ship between climate change and fisheries focuses specifically on how climate <b>change</b> <b>may</b> affect marine ecosystems and in turn abundance and harvests of specific marine species. This paper focuses on the human effects—economic, social and political effects—of climate-driven changes in Alaska commercial fisheries, {{and what can be done}} to mitigate these effects. Alaska commercial fisheries are the basis of a major industry of economic significance not only to Alaska but also the nation. In 1995, the ex-vessel value (the value received by fishermen) of Alaska landings exceeded $ 1. 4 billion, while the first wholesale value (the value after processing in Alaska) was almost $ 3. 0 billion. Climate <b>change</b> <b>may</b> have significant effects on Alaska fisheries. Climate change is likely to reduce the abundance of some species while increasing the abundance of others, with resulting reductions or increases in commercial harvests. For some species, significant <b>changes</b> in harvests <b>may</b> occur rapidly.
