25|$|The <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> is of a fixed length; the climber {{can only}} climb {{the length of}} the rope. Routes longer than the rope length are broken up into several {{segments}} called pitches; this is known as multi-pitch climbing. At the top of a pitch, the leader, the first climber to ascend, sets up an anchor and then belays the second climber up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route taken by the leader, the second climber removes (cleans) the carabiners and anchors placed along the way in order to use them again on the next pitch. Once both climbers are at the top anchor, the leader begins climbing the next pitch and so on until the top of the route is reached.|$|E
25|$|From the {{discovery}} of a serious rope-jerk injury around Mallory's waist, which was encircled by the remnants of a <b>climbing</b> <b>rope,</b> it appears that he and Irvine were roped together when one of them slipped. Mallory's body lay 300m below and about 100m horizontal to the location of an ice axe found in 1933, which is generally accepted from three characteristic marks on the shaft as belonging to Irvine. The fact that the body was relatively unbroken, apart from fractures to the right leg (the tibia and fibula were broken just above the boot), in comparison to other bodies found in the same location that were known to have fallen from the North-East Ridge, strongly suggests that Mallory could not have fallen from the ice axe site, but must have fallen from much lower down. Wang reportedly found Mallory's ice axe near his body (and took it with him). If this is true, then Mallory not only survived the initial fall with Irvine, but was in possession of his axe until the last seconds before striking a rock that stopped his final fall. When found, his body was sun-bleached, frozen and mummified.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 a {{distinctive}} method of exploration was invented. In a dome area [...] above the Big Room floor {{not far from}} the Bottomless Pit, a stalagmite leaned out. Using a balsa wood loop with helium-filled balloons attached, the explorers, (after several tries over several years), floated a lightweight cord up, over the target stalagmite, and back down to the ground. Then they pulled a <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> into position, and the explorers ascended into what they named The Spirit World. [...] A similar, smaller room was found in the main entrance corridor, and was named Balloon Ballroom in honor of this technique.|$|E

2500|$|Highlining is slacklining at {{elevation}} {{above the}} ground or water. Many slackliners consider highlining to be the pinnacle of the sport. Highlines are commonly set up in locations {{that have been used}} or are still used for Tyrolean traverse. When rigging highlines, experienced slackers take measures to ensure that solid, redundant and equalized anchors are used to secure the line into position. Modern highline rigging typically entails a mainline of webbing, backup webbing, and either <b>climbing</b> <b>rope</b> or amsteel rope for redundancy. However, many highlines are rigged with a mainline and backup only, especially if the highline is low tension (less than [...] ), or rigged with high quality webbing like [...] or [...] It is also common to pad all areas of the rigging which might come in contact with abrasive surfaces. To ensure safety, most highliners wear a climbing harness or swami belt with a leash attached to the slackline itself. Leash-less, or [...] "free-solo" [...] slacklining– a term borrowed from rockclimbing– is not unheard of, however, with proponents such as Dean Potter and Andy Lewis.|$|E
2500|$|Most climbers {{choose to}} wear {{specialized}} rubber climbing shoes {{which are often}} of a smaller size than their normal street shoes {{in order to improve}} sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage. [...] Climbing chalk (MgCO3) is commonly used as a drying agent to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use protection. The most basic protective equipment is a <b>climbing</b> <b>rope.</b> Climbing [...] would attach the rope to themselves; {{in the event of a}} fall, the rope would usually cause injury to the climber in the hope that it prevented death. With advances in technology came the development of specialized harnesses, carabiners which are used for clipping into belay and rappel anchors and connecting gear, and belay devices which are used to catch a falling climber, hold or lower a climber and for rappelling. Eventually, the placement of bolts with the use of quickdraws led to the rise of sport climbing. Traditional climbers developed the spring-loaded camming device, which increased safety over chocks, hexes, and pitons. Some climbers choose to wear a specialized climbing helmet to protect them from falling rocks or equipment or head injuries from crashing into rocks.|$|E
