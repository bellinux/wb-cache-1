40|$|Studies of key {{and newly}} {{discovered}} {{sections of the}} Upper Cretaceous Djadokhta Formation along the southern margin of the Ulan Nur Basin allow a new subdivision based on lithology. The formation and its members were mapped at both Bayn Dzak, an area that includes the Flaming Cliffs, and Tugrugyin Shireh, an area about 50 km to the northwest of Bayn Dzak. Stratigraphic sections at both localities were remeasured. The considerably enlarged formation comprises a lower Bayn Dzak Member, dominated by moderate reddish orange sands with subordinate mudstone units, and an upper Tugrugyin Member, composed of pale orange to light gray sands. Investigations of key sections at Tsonzh and Alag Teer demonstrate the presence of transitional mudstone lenses between these members within the Djadokhta For-mation.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{structures of}} some surviving sand dunes {{and the ancient}} shore-lines along the coast south of Venice have been investigated integrating Ground Probing Radar (GPR) profiles, Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) and water conductivity measurements in some boreholes. The GPR penetration depth has been limited (4 - 5 m,using a 400 MHz antenna) by the high conductivity of salt water saturating pores of the shallow sediments. On the other hand, the excellent spatial resolution of the radar survey provided an estimate of internal dune bedding features, such as <b>cross</b> <b>lamination</b> and forwarding ancient covered coast-lines dated in the Thirties. The interpretation of the data, in particular along one line 360 m long intercepting a sizable sand-dune bank, seems to offer clues to the evolutional history of the coast line {{and the depth of}} transition from fresh-water to brackish-salt water. The water table was detected with electrical measurements and direct observations in boreholes, whereas the transition between fresh and salt water (brackish water) was pointed out indirectly by the high energy absorption and total back-reflection of the EM waves, encountered at this boundary, and directly by the strong decrease in VES resistivity values...|$|E
30|$|Cross-laminated timber (CLT), {{which was}} first {{developed}} in Austria and Germany about 20  years ago, is an innovative engineered wood product. According {{to the previous}} research conclusions and engineering experiences, such mass timber panelized system can be very competitive in residential or mixed occupancy middle-rise and high-rise buildings. Even for low-rise buildings, {{because of the high}} level of prefabrication, CLT structures can also provide a prospective alternative to the traditional timber-framing structures. The process of <b>cross</b> <b>lamination</b> can provide improved dimensional stability to the CLT panels that allow for prefabrication of long floor slabs and shear walls. Because the cross section of a CLT panel usually has three-to-five-glued layers of boards made up of solid timber or dimension lumber placed in orthogonally alternating orientation to the neighboring layers, it can provide high compressive strength and stiffness within the panel. Since the inherent nature of thick timber members to char slowly at a predictable rate, the massive wood systems are able to maintain significant structural capacity for extended durations when exposed to fire, which adds benefits to CLT structures. Due to the aforementioned advantages, CLT panelized system may offer a promising structural solution for the shift towards sustainable densification of urban centers in China in the future.|$|E

These deposits lack clear {{change in their}} grain size or macroscopically visible laminations. The massive structure is observed in deposits of various thickness, grain size (both in sand and muds) and distance from the shoreline. The massive layers are more common in areas with smaller run up (more than 50 %) than in the regions with a higher run up (approximately 40 %).

Along the Phang Nga coast it is found in almost 70 % of the sites with a low run up height and in almost all of the sites with a higher run up (Table 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT. — The Mazıdağ {{phosphate}} beds of the Upper Cretaceous carbonate sequence were {{deposited in}} an area of upwelling water which supplied phosphorous was deposited on the sea bottom as biogenic detritus of zoo — and phytoplankton, fish bones and scales. The biogenic accumulation with high content of organic matter and phosphorous was a prime source of the phosphate which formed the phosphate deposits of the Mazıdağ—Derik area. Commonly, currents transported the phosphatic sediments laterally, forming parallel and low angle <b>cross</b> <b>laminations.</b> In some cases, the sea floor was uplifted after upwelling periods. Conse-quently, some phosphate beds underwent karstification, giving rise to phoscretes and silcretes. Ground water percoalating into the karstic realm caused phosphate replacement of many carbonate grains of the shallow water limestone facies. These complex events resulted in the formation of three basic phosphate peloid types in the Mazıdağ-Derik phosphate sequence, which are classified to the following origin of peloids: (1) in situ precipitation; (2) abrasion of phosphatized intraclast and bioclast and (3) phosphate micri-tization of fish bones.

40|$|Though {{the hybrid}} {{stepping}} motor {{has a long}} and proven history, in terms of toughness, accuracy of position {{and the ability to}} operate in open loop, motor performance improvements can still be made in terms of the physical structure of the motor's components. It is impossible to build a complete solution of the hybrid stepping motor using simple analytical functions or equivalent circuit representations. This is due to the difficulties introduced by the motor's highly non-linear three dimensional magnetic structure, of which the doubly salient tooth structure, axial magnet, and back iron all complicate the situation. However, with the recent advances in three dimensional finite element software a comprehensive study of the motor has been achieved in this thesis. This has allowed improvements to simpler two dimensional based mathematical models, which allow faster computation of the motor's electromagnetic performance. To aid modelling, novel equations which accurately model today's high permeability steels have been developed. These are shown to be more accurate than the established Jiles-Atherton method. Inductance calculations of the steel's flux paths have been comprehensively improved by the use of elliptical functions. The thesis concludes with the design of two quite individual new machines. The first dramatically improves a motor's power output, smoothness, noise levels, and resonance by modifying the tooth structure. The second uses soft magnetic composite materials to provide an isotropic path for <b>cross</b> <b>lamination</b> flux which flows in a stator's back iron.

40|$|Diatremes in the Navajo {{volcanic}} field were emplaced in steep pipes or dome-shaped “blind” eruptions. Aprons of bedded and stratified deposits envelope some {{of these}} complexes, providing insight into their eruptive histories. The pyroclastic apron at Cathedral Cliff diatreme preserves deposits and bedforms indicative of high energy emplacement of gas-charged magma. Field studies document multiple (18 +) eruptive cycles from distinct, episodic discharges of gas and pyroclastic material at depths of 1500 to 2000 feet. Erupted material in each cycle is 6 to 15 feet thick and contains three main deposit types. Basal deposits in each cycle are unbedded, matrix to clast supported, heterolithic tuff breccia with angular to subrounded fragments of essential, cognate and accidental material up to 30 cm in maximum dimension. This is overlain by thin bedded, crudely-graded tuff breccia with similar types of pebble-sized fragments. Cycles are usually capped by thinly-laminated to thin-bedded ash-rich tuffs that preserve cross stratification, impact structures, and erosional surfaces. Each cycle thus transitioned from highly explosive and chaotic deposition of material to finer ash-rich material dominated by transport bedforms. The tops of most cycles are scoured and truncated by basal deposits of the next cycle. Beds in the pyroclastic apron dip steeply {{toward the center of}} the diatreme. <b>Cross</b> <b>lamination,</b> scour surfaces, "bomb" sags, and graded bedding indicate that the oldest deposits are on the outer margin of the pyroclastic apron with successive deposits inward. The results of this investigation provide evidence for multiple and discrete subterranean eruptions during diatreme formation. This is consistent with models that involve the rise and expansion of gas-rich “bubbles” that ultimately exceed lithostatic pressure and erupt. These “bubbles” expand and release gas upwards, and then collapse in subsurface chambers, depositing subvertical masses of pyroclastic material. Our results, however, indicate a progression in each cycle from clast-laden material to low-density gas-rich and clast-poor material. The data lends support for multiple eruptive pulses during diatreme formation related to magmatic-gas decompression, as opposed to periodic interaction with groundwater reservoirs...|$|E

Investigations of key sections at Tsonzh and Alag Teer demonstrate the presence of transitional mudstone lenses between these members within the Djadokhta Formation. Two distinct, sandy, sedimentologic facies are recognized in both members. Crossbedded intervals, occasionally exhibiting wind-ripple <b>cross</b> <b>lamination,</b> document the presenceof a Cretaceous dunefield in the Ulan Nur Basin. Structureless intervals are interpreted to represent wet sandy fluvial deposits and debris flows that moved down the dune faces. In the Bayn Dzak Member, lenses of brownish mudstone are interpreted to represent interdune deposition in shallow ponds by fluvial action. Fluvial action is also represented in the Bayn Dzak Member by beds of caliche, which contain conglomerate at the base but fine upward into limestone. The vertebrate fauna from the Djadokhta Formation is summarized. Although the Bayn Dzak fauna lived somewhat earlier than that from Tugrugyin Shireh based on the superposition of the members, {{it is not clear}} how much earlier.

New magnetostratigraphic data document a sequence of normal and reversed magnetozones through the Bayn Dzak Member up into the basal Tugrugyin Member. The presence of reversed magnetozones establishes that the sediments containing the faunas were probably deposited after C 34 n.

50|$|The Wernecke Supergroup was {{deposited}} in the paleoproterozoic from >1.84 Ga - 1.60 Ga. The thickness of the deposits seen in the Wernecke Mountains suggests crustal thinning and extension in passive margin or intracratonal environment. The Wompay orogen has been suggested as a possible mechanism behind the initial formation of the Wernecke basin. This hypothesis is supported by both {{the timing of the}} orogeny, approximately 1.88-1.84 Ga, and Nd values in the Wernecke Supergroup consistent with Nd values in rocks involved in the Wompay orogen and the Canadian Shield. The oldest exposed sedimentary deposit in the Wernecke mountains, known as the Wernecke Supergroup, comprises Fairchild Lake Group, the Quartet Group, and the Gillespie Lake Group. Together, these groups represent two cycles of basin subsidence and consequent infilling at the western edge of Laurentia. The first cycle represents initial basin development followed by the second cycle, signifying deepening of the basin and marine transgression. The Fairchild group, the oldest and most deformed member of the Wernecke Supergroup is characterized by about 4.6 km of upward grading siltstone to shale with carbonates, representing a low sediment input environment and a shallow basin. The bottom of the Fairchild group is not exposed, but is thought to rest on the crystalline basement. These sediments have since been metamorphosed to slate, phyllite, or fine-grained chloritoid- or garnet-porphyroblastic muscovite-chlorite-quartz schist by the Racklan orogeny at 1.6 Ga, as well as magmatism and hydrothermal activity.

40|$|Tide-dominated depositional {{systems are}} {{very common in}} macro tidal and meso tidal settings. They are less {{developed}} in micro tidal marine areas where sediments are dispersed mostly under the effects of waves and currents. In some specific coastal settings, {{the influence of the}} dominant hydrodynamics can be reduced or attenuated by the presence of promontories forming engulfed sectors or by the occurrence of submarine passageways or straits. In these conditions, as well as in micro tidal settings, the tidal influence can be amplified, producing a significant signature in the sedimentary record. A number of tide-influenced deposits can be recognized in the Neogene of the Southern Apennine, Italy, although the Mediterranean area is characterized by minor tidal ranges. Spectacular exposure of middle to upper Pliocene deposits cropping out around Tricarico allows the analysis of the architecture and internal complexities of a mixed bioclastic-siliciclastic succession deposited in a thrust-top basin. Undulations forming along the hinge of an anticline favored the onset of seaway conditions, which produced hydraulic amplification of marine currents flowing towards the chain and subjected to tidal influences. The mixed deposits of Tricarico exhibit prominent large-scale, unidirectional cross stratification and a suite of additional dune- and ripple-bedded structures of various dimensions. Cross stratification can be subdivided into four hierarchical levels based on their increasing degree of internal complexity of different ranks (from first-order to fourth-order sets). Processes invoked for the formation of such a complex suite of larger- and smaller-scale sedimentary structures are related to cyclical events, such as high-frequency sea-level oscillations and tidal cycles of various durations. First-order sets are interpreted as produced by migrating subaqueous dunes along a SSW-NNE-trending seaway at water depths below the wave base. These sets exhibit bed-thickness vertical patterns which have been related to the influence of highfrequency base-level oscillations that occurred during dune accumulation, producing alternating stages of accelerating and decelerating currents. Second-order cross stratification has been interpreted to have formed by dunes with varying sinuosity, superposition, and flow conditions, under the effect of varying current strengths but constant sediment production. Formset successions were produced by large compound dunes and are considered as the expression of low-energy and decaying dune fields that developed during times of decreasing sediment transport. <b>Cross</b> <b>lamination</b> of third-order and fourth-order sets shows series of bundles and couplets of coarser and finer laminae which, at a different scale, recorded repeated cycles of tidal ranges of different amplitudes.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} a Messinian shallow-marine terrigenous unit, termed the La Virgen Formation, which forms part of the {{sedimentary}} infill of the Bajo Segura Basin (Betic margin of the western Mediterranean). This formation was deposited during a high sea level phase prior to {{the onset of the}} Messinian Salinity Crisis. Stratigraphically, it comprises a prograding stack of sandstone lithosomes alternating with marly intervals (1 st-order cyclicity). These lithosomes are characterized by a homoclinal geometry that tapers distally, and interfinger with pelagic sediments rich in planktonic and benthic microfauna (Torremendo Formation). An analysis of sedimentary facies of each lithosome reveals a repetitive succession of sandy storm beds (tempestites), occasionally amalgamated, which are separated by thin marly layers (2 nd-order cyclicity). Each storm bed contains internal erosional surfaces (3 rd-order cyclicity) that delimit sets of laminae. Two categories of storm beds have been differentiated. The first one includes layers formed below storm wave base (SWB), characterized by traction structures associated to unidirectional flows (scoured base, planar lamination, and parting lineation). The second category consists of layers deposited above the SWB which display typical high regime oscillatory flow structures (swaley and hummocky <b>cross</b> <b>lamination).</b> In both cases, the ichnological record is characterized by an oligotypic association of Ophiomorpha nodosa, which can be interpreted as the result of allochthonous tracemakers (crustaceans) transported during storm events together with the sediment. The benthic microfauna in the marly intervals that separate the sandstone lithosomes (1 st-order cyclicity) indicates that the storm ebb surges were deposited at depths ranging from those of inner shelf settings (with Elphidium spp. and Cibicides lobatulus) to those of outer shelf (with Valvulineria complanata and Uvigerina cylindrica). At the distal end of the sandstone lithosomes, the planktonic microfauna is characterized by a high content of taxa indicative of warm-oligotrophic waters (Globigerinoides obliquus and Globigerinoides bulloideus). In contrast, in the marly intervals, the microfauna is dominated by species typical of cold-eutrophic waters (Globigerina and Neogloboquadrina). This alternation of planktic foraminiferal assemblages is interpreted as being the expression of climatic cycles, in which every episode of progradation of tempestite-dominated lithosomes corresponds to maximum insolation and warm waters, whereas episodes of marly deposition correspond to minimal insolation and cold waters. The 1 st-order cyclicity recorded in the La Virgen Formation, in a context of terrigenous storm-dominated shelf, corresponds to sapropel/homogeneous marl cycles formed in a pelagic basin (Torremendo Fm). These cycles in pelagic sediments are commonplace throughout the Mediterranean during the Messinian and reflect precession orbital changes: repeated periods of maximum insolation – minimum precession (sapropels) and minimal insolation – maximum precession (homogeneous marls). The fact that the example of terrigenous unit studied herein is coetaneous with the well-developed reef complexes in the Mediterranean basins points out the importance of sediment supply in the formation of large-scale sandy lithosomes. This is a crucial aspect to understanding reservoir genesis as well as lateral stratigraphic relationships with potential seal and/or source rocks.

A typical sequence from top to bottom includes:dark gray shale; thin red mudstone; gray shale; limey siltstone; very fine-grained white sandstone interbedded with gray shale; well sorted, fine-grained, white sandstone; and thin black shale. The percentage of sandstone within the Big Clifty Formation varies laterally significantly. The thickness of the Big Clifty Formation ranges from 64 feet to 97 feet.

40|$|Sandy tsunami {{deposits}} {{may provide}} valuable information on tsunami inundation {{as well as}} hydrodynamics, such as flow speed. However, if the layer does not have sedimentary structures such as <b>cross</b> <b>laminations,</b> {{it is difficult to}} infer the flow direction, which is important to interpret the behavior of the tsunami, such as inflow and outflow as well as repetition of waves. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), in combination with grain size data, can provide information about the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing during the emplacement of tsunami sequences. It might also allow the reconstruction of transport directions because it provides a cryptic alignment of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic minerals, such as coarse-grained magnetite or platy phyllosilicate minerals (e. g. biotite). These minerals behave differently in different hydrodynamic conditions: for example, platy biotite may deposit in a cryptic micro-ripple. This therefore suggests that the usefulness of bulk AMS together with optical observations is limited in the study of flow fabric in tsunami deposits. The anisotropy of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (AARM) on the other hand isolates the fine-grained magnetite subfabric of needle-shaped inclusions exsolved in silicate minerals. Samples (18) from tsunami deposits, believed to have been laid down by the Jogan event (869 AD), were collected from a section on the Sendai Plain, east Japan. The transport direction in these deposits could not be determined by AMS analysis due to large declination and inclination errors. The AARM technique was thus used to determine the cryptic subfabric of magnetite exsolutions along cleavages in biotite and amphibole. Our scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations confirmed that the maximum AARM orientation is parallel to the needle-shaped magnetite microexsolutions in biotite and amphibole. We therefore infer that the large error of AMS is caused by the alteration of these paramagnetic minerals, and AARM provides a cryptic alignment of fine-grained magnetite microexsolutions. In order to apply this method to ancient historical Tsunami events, we also collected 40 samples from consecutive sand layers of possible tsunami deposits at 7 sites using 2 m long geoslicers in Rikuzen-Takata, northeast Japan.

It is the high specific weight and specific stiffness of this material that have drawn the interest of different industrial sectors. Civil engineers also picked up composites {{to use it as a}} roofing material. Laminated composite shells, which can cover large column-free area and reduces dead weight of structure, show vulnerability under sudden impact due to their low transverse shear resistances. This study utilises finite element tool to investigate the dynamic response of a multilayered laminated composite hypar shells for fully clamped boundary condition. This class of shells is unique in a sense that the curvature has only the radius of cross curvature and these shells do not admit easy closed form solution particularly when the boundary conditions are complicated. Contact behavior of impactor and impacted mass has been modeled by modified Hertzian contact law and time-dependent equations are solved using Newmark’s time integration technique. Basic aim is to analyse the shell for symmetrically placed multilayered angle and <b>cross</b> ply <b>lamination</b> under different impact velocities...|$|R
40|$|The MRS/MISS of the Makgabeng Formation {{encompasses}} sand cracks, wrinkle marks, mat fragments, mat {{chips and}} roll-ups {{and those of}} the Magaliesberg formation are wrinkle marks, petees/petee ridges, sand cracks, and multi-directional ripples. The sedimentary process that moderated the formational mechanism of the MISS of the Makgabeng Formation is (descriptively allochthonous) of high energy (inter-dune depositional setting) that eroded, transported and re-deposited mat bound sediments. The genetic mechanism of the MISS of the Magaliesberg Formation is descriptively authochthonous because of enhanced resistance of biostabilized sediments to being reworked. XRF (major and trace) and XRD analysis (qualitative and quantitative) was done on MISS bearing sedimentary rock layers (A) and underlying sedimentary sections (B) of Magaliesberg and Makgabeng samples. Result show high quartz content of all the analyzed samples compared to average sandstones. This premise suggests a relation of microbes (e. g. cyanobacteria) to phototrophy and/photoautotrophy because of the conduction properties of translucent quartz. Also plausible inference is that the intense chemical weathering that produced the quartz arenite was positively influenced by microbes, as noted in some Proterozoic basins. There is higher concentration of Ba in all A samples compared to B (Makgabeng and Magaliesberg) which might be emblematic of biogenicity. The Magaliesberg analyzed samples (MAG 101, 102, 103) exhibit homogeneity by the higher concentration of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, and P 2 O 5, and lower concentration of SiO 2 in the A compared to the B subsamples of a particular sample. Also, Magaliesberg analyzed samples (MAG 101, 102, 103) exhibit homogeneity by the lower concentration of quartz and higher concentration of muscovite in the A compared to the B subsamples. This exact established negative correlation between the duo of SiO 2 and quartz, and the quartet of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, and P 2 O 5, and muscovite as in Magaliesberg samples pertains also to a Makgabeng sample (MKG 102; roll-up). MKG 101 (mat fragment) deviates from this mineralogical and geochemical trend. Each of the A samples of MAG 101, 102, 103, are uniformly of higher concentration in Ce, Cr, Nb, Th, V, Y, Zn, Zr compared to the B version of that sample. MKG 101 and 102 are uniformly of lower concentration of Ce, Cr, Nb, Th, V, Y, Zn, Zr in A compared to the B version of that sample. The A of each of the samples MAG 101, 102, and 103 has higher concentration of Hf and Rb compared to its B; a character that is also exhibit in MKG 102, and MKG 101 is vice versa. Microscopy shows that A of all the samples is of smaller grain size compared to B, espousing affinity of microbes to fine-medium grained sandstones. Microscopy of the Magaliesberg Formation samples show Pseudo petee ridges and pseudo <b>cross</b> <b>lamination</b> which reflect biostabilization, and microscopy of the Makgabeng Formation show roll-ups, mat chips and composite mat chips. The MISS genetic difference of the two formations is related to energy, water residence time (emergence and inundation), Ph, and similarity is related to mutuality in shallow water environment. Mat types are inferred to be biologically, physically and chemically moderated adaptations of microbial communities to specific cum peculiar locally prevailing environmental conditions; factors that are premised on taphonomy and ecology.

40|$|The Mesozoic of Porto Pino (SW Sardinia) {{has been}} {{investigated}} in detail. The presence of two carbonate successions, belonging to two different stratigraphic-structural units (“Cala Su Trigu Unit” and “Guardia sa Perda Unit”, BARCA & COSTAMAGNA, 1997 a) has been confirmed. Detailed sedimentological analysis has improved the recently established stratigraphy (BARCA & COSTAMAGNA, 1997 a) and defined accurately the depositional environments of the successions. The whole thickness of the “Cala Su Trigu Unit” is about 120 - 130 m. The Unit starts at the base by the “Dolomie di Scollieddu formation”, consisting of grey, locally pinkish, dolostones passing upwards to grey calcareous dolostones; rare marly red layers also occur. This formation is characterized by several depositional textures and structures, as ooids, peloids, bioclasts, calcitic pseudomorphs after sulphates, cross- and parallel laminations and loferitic structures are clearly visible. In {{the lower part of}} the “Dolomie di Scollieddu formation” storm layers are often wellrepresented. Fossil organism (algae, brachiopods, bivalves, corals, gasteropods) are usually concentrated in few specific horizons. The age of this formation is comprised between Middle?-Upper Triassic (Megalodontidae, Thecosmilia) at the base and Liassic (defined by foraminifera) at the top. The Medau Mereu formation follows upwards; this unit is made up by green-yellow marls passing to well-stratified grey to blue-grey marly limestones. Fossils (radiolaria?, foraminifera, sponge spicules, worm tubes and rare pelagic bivalves, brachiopoda and bryozoan fragments) and nonskeletal grains (rare, reworked ooids and peloids) occur in the whole formation. The foraminifera association gives to the Medau Mereu fm. an Aalenian age. The deposition of the “Cala Su Trigu Unit” succession marks a carbonatic depositional environment ranging from a peritidal setting of inner ramp at the base (Dolomie di Scollieddu formation) to outer ramp close to the basin at the top (Medau Mereu fm.). The “Guardia Sa Perda Unit” consists of four formations; at the base the “Punta Tonnara formation” (BARCA & COSTAMAGNA, 1997 a) similar to the German “Muschelkalk” facies, is made up by well-stratified, blue-grey limestones with marly limestones and marls intercalations, usually arranged in decametric “shoaling upward” sequences. In the upper part of these sequences storm layers are very common; bioclasts (bivalves, gasteropods, echinoids spines, algal fragments, crinoids, ophiuroids, cephalopods?) such as pseudomorphs after sulphates, represent the basal lag of the tempestites. The age of this formation, about 25 m thick, can be referred to Middle-?Upper Triassic on the base of presence of Agathammina sp. (MARTINI et al, 1987). A comparison made with other similar succession of Sardinia (Punta del Lavatoio; GANDIN, 1978 a; Scivu-Is Arenas, BARCA et al., 1995; Monte Maiore, COSTAMAGNA et al., 1999) allows to assign to this formation a Ladinian age. The depositional environment of this formation varies from the intertidal? - shallow subtidal conditions of inner, shallow ramp to the deep subtidal ones of outer, deep ramp. The “Monte Zari formation”, corresponding to the German “Keuper” facies, follows upwards; the transition from the “Punta Tonnara formation” is marked by a thick horizon of dissolution-collapse breccias. This formation consists of grey dolostones containing rare layers of polychrome marls. The dolostones are usually well stratified and present a large spectrum of textural arrangement (loferitic bindstones, dissolution breccias, massive dolostones with evaporite casts, oolitic, more rarely peloidal, grainstones interested by large <b>cross</b> <b>lamination</b> structures). Fossils and bioclasts, with the only exception of algal mats and their derived fragments, are totally lacking. The whole thickness is about 120 - 130 m. The Upper Triassic - Lower Liassic age of this formation can be deduced from the paleontological data recorded in the underlying Punta Tonnara and overlying Guardia Sa Perda formations. The depositional environment is referred to a inner, shallow carbonatic ramp subjected to subtidal, lagoonal conditions, often restricted. Rarely intertidal environments have been also recorded. The limestones of the “Guardia sa Barracca Formation” sharply overlay the “Monte Zari fm. ”. They consists of bioclastic-oolitic packstones to grainstones, with a minor amount of peloids. Bioclasts (crinoids, brachiopods, foraminifera, bryozoa, bivalves, green algae) are diffuse and clearly visible; the non-skeletal grains (ooids, peloids, coated grains) are also abundant. Chert nodules occur too. Some horizons are rich of macrofossils as belemnites, brachiopods and crinoids. The age of this formation is Upper Liassic (Domerian? - Toarcian). It is gradually followed by the Aalenian “Medau Mereu formation”, here made by the same alternances of marls and limestones just described in the “Cala Su Trigu Unit”. The thickness of the Guardia Sa Barracca and Medau Mereu fms. together is about 150 m. The depositional environments of Guardia Sa Barracca and Medau Mereu fm. are strictly connected, so representing the gradual evolution from an oolitic shoal of a shallow ramp (rarely interfingering with the lagoon) environment toward the outer, deep ramp close to the basin. Comparing the typical successions of the German Triassic with the lithologies described in the succession of Porto Pino (in particular those of the “Guardia Sa Perda Unit”) the latter might be resulting by the deposition during Upper Triassic times in a transitional setting between the environments of the Germanic Realm and those of the Alpine one. In addition, setting of the Triassic part of this successions is redefined referring to classic “Muschelkalk” and “Keuper” stratigraphical units, utilized as sedimentary facies associations...|$|E

40|$|Sequential events during {{lymphocyte}} emigration {{from high}} endothelial venuses (HEV) were studied by scanning and {{transmission electron microscopy}} combined with regional perfusion techniques. The results indicate that blood lymphocytes selectively adhere to HEV surfaces through microvilli which attach to shallow pits on the luminal surfaces of high endothelial cells. These intercellular contact points resist hydrodynamic and osmotic shearing forces, but can be disrupted by treatments which remove endothelial glycocalyx, hydrolyse lymphocyte surface glycoproteins, or chelate divalent cations. After this initial attachment phase, lymphocytes enter apical clefts between endothelial cells where they assume a motile configuration characterized by loss of microvilli and formation of irregular surface folds. Intramural lymphocytes adhere to adjacent endothelial cells through macular and villous contacts. Fibrillar electron-dense material traverses the 15 - 20 nm gap at these points of adhesion. Microtubules and microfilaments are also seen around areas of cytoplasmic constriction in these motile lymphocytes. The migrating lymphocytes show cytoplasmic polarity which is oriented {{in the direction of}} movement as they pass through extracellular spaces in the venular wall and <b>cross</b> successive <b>laminations</b> in the perivascular sheath to enter the node.

Plate 1 : Geologic map of {{the study}} area showing {{locations}} of major geographic features, measured stratigraphic sections, paleocurrent data measuring stations, and structural features Plate 2 : East-west profile through sandstones C and D at measured sections 37 through 45 showing architectural elements identifiedUp to 600 m (1970 ft) of non-marine Williams Fork Formation sedimentary rocks are exposed along the north-south trending Douglas Creek arch on {{the western edge of the}} Piceance Creek basin near Rangely, Colorado. Williams Fork deposits conformably overlie deltaic Iles Formation strata and are unconformably overlain by Eocene Wasatch Formation fluvio-lacustrine deposits. Williams Fork and lIes strata are interpreted to represent a prograding clastic wedge that advanced east-ward from the late Jurassic to early Late Cretaceous Sevier orogenic front, and onto the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway. An interval of Williams Fork deposits about 250 m thick (820 ft) that contains nine major sandstone bodies was studied. 	Sedimentary lithofacies recognized include sandstone, interlayered siltstone and mudstone, gray-brown claystone, and carbonaceous shale and coal. Sandstones have erosional bases, and are up to 1200 m wide (3370 ft) and 20 m thick (63 ft). Basal lag deposits include mudstone and siltstone rip-up clasts, bone fragments, and silicified logs. Sandstone beds are composed of very fine-to medium-size grains and show fining-upward trends. Sedimentary structures include large-scale trough cross beds, micro-trough <b>cross</b> <b>laminations,</b> horizontal laminae, and convolute bedding. Sedimentary structures decrease in size upward through sandstone intervals. Sandstone deposits are interpreted as fluvial channel, point bar, and crevasse splay deposits. 	Interbedded siltstone and mudstone deposits showing syndepositional dips of 5 ?? to 10 ?? are interpreted as lateral-accretion bedding, whereas similar deposits that are approximately horizontal are interpreted as flood deposits laid down proximal to active channels. Gray-brown claystone beds are also interpreted as flood deposits, based on their lateral extents, sharp bases, and horizontal nature. Carbonaceous shale and coal beds, and associated sandy lenses containing abundant snail shell casts, are interpreted as swamp and pond deposits. 	Paleocurrent directions from nine major sandstone trends were measured on trough axes, trough cross beds, parting lineations, flute casts, and ripple marks. Paleocurrent data show a shift in paleoslope direction upsection, with highly variable flow trends toward the southeast in the lower part of the section, and distinct flow trends toward the northeast in the upper part of the section. This is similar to the trend reported from Williams Fork-equivalent strata exposed on the east side of the Piceance Creek basin. There, the shift has been associated with the Laramide orogeny. This suggests that a reorientation in the paleoslope toward the northeast may have been synchronous throughout the Piceance Creek basin area. 	Thin sections studied show Williams Fork sandstones to be moderately sorted, subangular to subrounded chert and argillite litharenites, with argillaceous matrices, calcareous cements, and low porosities (1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{determination}} of relative permeability of CO 2 /brine fluids under reservoir condition {{is critical for}} the design of CO 2 injection strategy and prediction of CO 2 behavior underground through reservoir simulation. For some reservoirs only heterogeneous samples are available for measurement. Heterogeneity, such as layering or <b>cross</b> bedding <b>lamination</b> can commonly be seen in sandstone cores. The effects and mechanism of core-scale heterogeneities on macroscopic scale relative permeability must be well-addressed. Here we report two sets of laboratory core flooding experiments using Berea sandstone for steady-state measurement of relative permeability of CO 2 /Brine at reservoir condition [1]. Berea sandstone is relatively homogeneous but has strong bedding or lamination structures. Two Berea samples were used (cored along the directions parallel to and perpendicular to the bedding, and named Berea- 1 and Berea- 2 respectively). We recorded the pressure and discharge volume to get the relative permeability curves for both samples; and utilized the X-ray computed tomography to estimate the distributions of porosity and CO 2 (or Brine) saturation for Berea- 2. The measured phase relative permeability of Berea- 2 sample is greatly deviated from Berea- 1. To further investigate the effects of core-scale heterogeneity on the measurement of relative permeability, we carried out a series numerical simulation on core scale using Tough 2 ECO 2 N code with building models based on X-ray CT scan images. By comparing the numerical results, we found the heterogeneity of capillary pressure field under one injection direction plays a dominant role in CO 2 /brine saturation patterns, flow regime and apparent relative permeability model...|$|R

No sedimentary structures have been recognized except for few remnants of planar cross- eds. In the section of Ponsano, the Ponsano Sandstone can be subdivided into two parts. The lower part is characterized by marlstones (Ms facies) {{at the bottom and}} medium-fine sandstones (Sm facies) in the middle and upper parts.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Blade-stiffened {{composite}} plates {{have been}} analysed for transverse loads using the finite element method. An eight-noded isoparametric quadratic stiffened plate bending element has been employed for the analysis. The element can incorporate trans-verse shear deformation. First order shear deformation {{has been considered}} in the for-mulation; the stiffener can be placed anywhere within the plate element and need not necessarily follow nodal lines. Therefore, mesh divisions are independent of the stiffener location within the plate. The stiffness matrix of the stiffener element can be appropriately modified to include stiffness properties {{for all types of}} open-section stiffeners. The deflec-tions and bending moments have been presented for simply supported square laminated plates with one central stiffener and for stiffened skew plates. The results are compared with those obtained by modeling the stiffened plate by an assemblage of eight-noded isoparametric flat shell elements. The effect of the number of layers of the plate and the stiffener on the flexural response of the stiffened plate is presented. The element is used to show the flexural response of different open-section stiffened plates having the same area of the stiffener cross section. Also, the effect of depth-to-thickness ratio of the stiffener having the same <b>cross</b> section and <b>lamination</b> has been presented...|$|R
40|$|Anastamosing, low {{gradient}} distributary channels produce {approx} 30 gravity, paraffinic oils {{from the}} Middle Member of the lacustrine Eocene Green River Formation in the south-central {{portion of the}} Uinta Basin. This localized depocenter was situated along the fluctuating southern shoreline of Lake Uinta, where complex deposits of marginal-lacustrine to lower delta plain accumulations are especially characteristic. The Middle Member contains several fining-upward parasequences that can be recognized in outcrop, core, and downhole logs. Each parasequence is about 60 to 120 feet thick and consists of strata deposited during multiple lake level fluctuations that approach 30 to 35 feet in individual thickness. Such parasequences represent 300, 000 -year cycles based on limited absolute age dating. The subaerial to subaqueous channels commonly possess an erosional base and exhibit a fining upward character. Accordingly, bedding features commonly range from large-scale trough and planar <b>cross</b> bedding or <b>lamination</b> at the base, to a nonreservoir, climbing ripple assemblage near the uppermost reservoir boundary. The best reservoir quality occurs within the laminated to cross-stratified portions, and the climbing ripple phase usually possesses more deleterious micas and/or detrital clays. Diagenesis also exerts a major control on reservoir quality. Certain sandstones were cemented by an early, iron-poor calcite cement, which can be subsequently leached. Secondary intergranular porosity (up to 20 %) is {{largely responsible for the}} 10 - 100 millidarcy rock, which represents petrophysical objectives for both primary and secondary production. Otherwise, intense compaction, silicic and iron-rich carbonate cements, and authigenic clays serve to reduce reservoir quality to marginal economic levels...|$|R
40|$|Geosynclinal {{deposits}} well exposed {{along the}} valley of Akutagawa, Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, have been studied from the sedimentological {{point of view and}} its result is described in the paper. Geosynclinal deposits of this area consist of two types; shale-chert facies in the lower part and flysch-like facies in the upper, the former being recognized as the exenic-volcanic suite which is composed of deeper marine sediments such as shale, chert and a small amount of sandstone, and greenstone, the latter consisting of bedded alternations of sandstone and shale layers. In greenstone layers occur some limestone lenses in which permian fusulinids and corals relatively well preserved are found and the range of faunas is from the lowermost Lower Permian to the upper Middle Permian. In this area a thick chert bed first was deposited in the lowermost and then a large quantity of lava flows and tuffs of greenstone succeeded. At the same time, fine clastic material introduced into the geosynclinal area, but soon afterward coarse clastics gradually increased, and at last the geosyncline was filled up by these clastics. Flysch-like deposits of this area are rather different from the BOUMA's type of flysch; his five divisions of flysch are not found in the Akutagawa flysch, and the latter has fine sandstone layers ungraded and is almost absence of the <b>cross</b> and parallel <b>laminations</b> of sandstone.

40|$|Based on {{observations}} from seven measured stratigraphic sections and 230 thin sections over 37. 3 kilometers, we recognize two sequences that encompass six parasquences and six distinct facies. The facies include bioturbated peloidal packstones, containing ostracods, rare occurrences of planar <b>laminations,</b> plane tabular <b>cross</b> bedding, microbial <b>laminations</b> and fine grain silt and sand. This facies is inferred {{to have been}} deposited in a semi-restricted lagoon environment. Interbedded microbial boundstones and finely crystalline dolomitic mudstone facies contain dolomitic microbial laminations, rare stromatolites, rip-up clasts, mudcracks, and soft sediment deformation. This facies was likely deposited in a supratidal setting. The medium grained, well-rounded quartz arenites and sand-rich packstone facies range from 5 - 40 cm thick and can be traced throughout the study area which may be marginal marine to eolian. There are three variations of grainstones. First, peloidal grainstones containing planar <b>laminations,</b> plane tabular <b>cross</b> bedding, ostracods and discontinuous lenses of black chert and gray chert. This is interpreted to have been deposited in a shallow beach/tidal flat setting. A second variety includes skeletal/peloidal grainstones containing bi-directional current ripples, crinoids and other skeletal fragments. This indicates deposition in an open marine tidal setting. Crinoidal grainstones contain rugose corals, brachiopods, one-meter thick sets of plane tabular cross bedding, and grey chert. This facies was deposited in an open-marine shoal environment. Within this reservoir-scale study, lateral variations of facies thicknesses were larger than then lateral variations of parasequence thicknesses. Grainstone facies thicken towards the northern sections, whereas thicker dolomitic mudstones/microbial boundstones dominate in southern sections. Similar facies variations may occur in the subsurface where total thickness may not vary significantly, but younger, grain-rich facies prograde to fill in depositional lows. When this sequence-scale facies variation is synthesized with the susceptibility of facies to diagenesis and fracturing, reservoir characterization and predictability should be significantly enhanced...|$|R
