40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the distribution, concentration and toxicity of cinnamaldehyde in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) refill fluids and aerosols. Methods The distribution and concentration of cinnamaldehyde were determined in 39 e-cigarette refill fluids plus 6 duplicates using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A cinnamaldehyde toxicity profile was established for embryonic and adult cells using a live cell imaging assay, immunocytochemistry, the comet assay and a recovery assay. Results Twenty of the 39 refill fluids contained cinnamaldehyde at concentrations that are cytotoxic to human embryonic and lung cells in the MTT assay. <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>Ceylon</b> aerosol produced in a cartomizer-style e-cigarette was cytotoxic. <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>Ceylon</b> aerosols and refill fluid aerosols (80 % propylene glycol or cinnamaldehyde/propylene glycol) made using a tank/boxmod e-cigarette were more cytotoxic at 5  V than 3  V. Using GC/MS, aerosols produced at 5  V contained 10 additional peaks not present in aerosol generated at 3  V. One of these, 2, 3 -butandione (diacetyl), was confirmed with an authentic standard. Cinnamaldehyde depolymerised microtubules in human pulmonary fibroblasts. At concentrations that produced no effect in the MTT assay, cinnamaldehyde decreased growth, attachment and spreading; altered cell morphology and motility; increased DNA strand breaks; and increased cell death. At the MTT IC 50 concentration, lung cells were unable to recover from cinnamaldehyde after 2  hours of treatment, whereas embryonic cells recovered after 8  hours. Conclusions Cinnamaldehyde-containing refill fluids and aerosols are cytotoxic, genotoxic and low concentrations adversely affect cell processes and survival. These data indicate that cinnamaldehyde in e-cigarette refill fluids/aerosols may impair homeostasis in the respiratory system...|$|R

5000|$|European health {{agencies}} have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark, {{one of the}} four main species of cinnamon, because of its coumarin content. According to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BFR), 1 kg of (cassia) cinnamon powder contains about 2.1 to 4.4 g of coumarin. [...] Powdered cassia cinnamon weighs 0.56 g/cm3, so a kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder equals 362.29 teaspoons. One teaspoon of cassia cinnamon powder therefore contains 5.8 to 12.1 mg of coumarin, which may be above the tolerable daily intake value for smaller individuals.

The competition pertaining to <b>Ceylon</b> <b>Cinnamon</b> in world trade has already become significant, as the worlds ’ total Cinnamon market is comprised not only of True Cinnamon, but of Cassia; the closest substitute and a spice inferior to True Cinnamon as well. Sri Lanka has to compete with three Cassia producing countries in the total Cinnamon market, as China, Indonesia and Viet Nam; the three major Cassia producers are the major producers of the total Cinnamon market as well. According to the experts, lack of productivity of <b>Ceylon</b> <b>Cinnamon</b> cultivated lands and insufficient production to fulfill the worlds ’ demand for Cinnamon {{is one of the}} major issues and, which have to be immediately addressed to be cope up with and to withstand the competition in the total Cinnamon market.

40|$|Since 1988 {{there has}} been a {{statutory}} maximum level for coumarin in Europe of 2 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) food. Discussions are currently ongoing on the European level about which values should be laid down for coumarin in the forthcoming amendment to the flavourings legislation. The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection had asked BfR to submit corresponding proposals. Coumarin can harm the liver and higher levels trigger cancer in animal experiments. Hence a dose was established that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without any negative effects on health. This TDI value is 0. 1 mg/kg body weight. Measurements by the regional health control bodies from 2006 had detected high levels of coumarin in many cinnamon-containing foods. In some cases they were far higher than the currently valid maximum level of 2 mg/kg food and were caused by the predominant use of Cassia cinnamon. An exposure assessment by BfR showed that consumers {{with a high level of}} consumption of cinnamon and cinnamon-containing foods exceed the safe coumarin dose based on the levels detected. Four action options (options A-D) were proposed which either envisaged the exclusive use of low-level coumarin <b>Ceylon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (A), the laying down of a general maximum level for coumarin in cinnamon (B), the raising of the existing maximum level to 4 mg/kg food (C), or – option D – the laying down of maximum levels for individual food categories. In the case of options A-D the additional laying down of a maximum level for coumarin in cinnamon powder is recommended in order to protect those consumers who also use cinnamon directly as a spice. In principle, the Institute advises consumers to use <b>Ceylon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> with a low level of coumarin instead of Cassia cinnamon with a higher cinnamon content.

40|$|Cinnamon {{capsules}} {{are sold}} as food supplements or as dietetic foods to reduce {{blood sugar levels}} in type II Diabetes mellitus, a severe chronic disease. The manufacturers recommend a daily long-term dose in the gram range although {{the safety of a}} cinnamon dose of this amount has not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, the claimed ability of cinnamon to reduce blood sugar has not been sufficiently proven up to now. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was, therefore, asked to assess the daily intake of high amounts of cinnamon from the angle of consumer health protection. Small amounts of cinnamon have been used for thousands of years as a spice without any reports of side effects.

Identifying food that can reduce blood glucose and insulin, and increase satiety can help in the prevention and reduction of diabetes and overweight. The aim of this research was to gain further knowledge of the role of nutritional interventions, in particular, to find functional foods that reduce postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels in order to improve glycaemic control. One of the studies was to gain an understanding of food factors affecting postprandial satiety. The ingestion of 6 g turmeric increased postprandial serum insulin levels, but did not seem to affect plasma glucose levels or glycaemic index (GI) in healthy subjects.

40|$|The {{inner bark}} of <b>Ceylon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (Cinnamomum {{zeylanicum}} L.) {{is commonly used}} as a spice and has also been widely employed in the treatment and prevention of disease. The positive health effects associated with the consumption of cinnamon could in part be due to its phenolic composition; proanthocyanidins (PA) are the major polyphenolic component in commercial cinnamon. We present a thorough study of the PA profile of cinnamon obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. In addition to the advantages of MALDI-TOF as a sensitive technique {{for the analysis of}} high-molecular-weight compounds, the tandem arrangement allows the identification of the compounds through their fragmentation patterns from MS/MS experiments. This {{is the first time that}} this technique has been used to analyze polymeric PA. The results show that cinnamon PA are more complex than was previously thought. We show here for the first time that they contain (epi) gallocatechin and (epi) catechingallate units. As gallates (galloyl moieties) and the pyrogallol group in gallocatechins have been related to the biological activity of grape and tea polyphenols, the presence of these substructures may explain some of the properties of cinnamon extracts. MALDI-TOF/TOF reveals that cinnamon bark PA include combinations of (epi) catechin, (epi) catechingallate, (epi) gallocatechin, and (epi) afzelechin, which results in a highly heterogeneous mixture of procyanidins, prodelphinidins, and propelargonidins.

40|$|Historically, {{the spice}} sector (consisting mainly of cinnamon, pepper, clove, cardamom, nutmeg and mace) {{has played a}} key role in the economy of Sri Lanka In the current {{international}} trading situation; the sector is facing several challenges and threats related to spice marketing. The traditional value chain of spice in Sri Lanka is characterized by decentralized purchasing, low quality product, wastage, low price, low essential oil quality, bad pre harvest technology and post harvest technology and presence of a number of intermediaries without value adding to functions, such as village collectors, village traders, wholesale buyers, commission agents and auction brokers. This has resulted in low value adding in the supply chain and brand deterioration. In the international spice trade ongoing changes are occurring in the export procurement systems and world trade agreements in terms of increased quality, food safety due to the development of high quality, high value demanded market. These factors have created a new demand pattern shifting the focus towards continuous supply of high quality and safe value added products with improved processing technology & packaging. The impact of modem and restructured markets has a number of repercussions on farmers who are unable to keep up with emerging marketing trends. This situation has triggered the need for new innovative processing practices and appropriate technologies working with farmers in improving their ability to face restructured market conditions. The research primarily focuses on the qualitative, descriptive analysis of the problem. The locations Matale district is selected in terms of provincial secretary divisions. There are some limitations due to time frame and human errors. Research is an empirical study conducted with four objectives, namely; (a) the post harvest technology of spices in the perspectives of Quality management, "Food safety, Technology management. (b) the current Spice industry situation against global competition. (c) strengths and weaknesses to propose basics of a niche marketing strategy. (d) key factors to develop Ceylon spices as a reputed brand. Assessment of the post harvest technology evidently indicated that there is a general degradation in most of the factors related to quality, food safety, and technology management. The quality parameters which are recommend by the American Spice Traders Association (ASTA) such as macro cleanliness, microbial load, pesticides metal contamination and aflatoxin possibility of contamination in pre harvest and post harvest operations is high due to ineffective handling of the pre and post harvest processes. The model practices set by ISO 22000 /HACCP is not complied with in the current practices of pre harvest and post harvest operations. The overall conclusion of the study is that it is necessary to launch a holistic action plan to overcome these unhealthy practices. There is a considerable deficiency of the current spice industry situation against global competition. In the analysis of form basics of niche marketing strategy it is clearly evident that Sri Lankan spices are quite popular in the world market due to its intrinsic quality and therefore international marketing can be done by capitalizing on this aspect.
