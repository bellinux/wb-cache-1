50|$|There are six {{groups of}} tool steels: water-hardening, <b>cold-work,</b> shock-resistant, high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose. The choice of group to select depends on cost, working temperature, {{required}} surface hardness, strength, shock resistance, and toughness requirements.

50|$|The D-series of the <b>cold-work</b> {{class of}} tool steels, which {{originally}} included types D2, D3,D6, and D7, contains between 10% and 13% chromium (which is unusually high). These steels retain their hardness up to {{a temperature of}} 425 C. Common applications for these tool steels include forging dies, die-casting die blocks, and drawing dies. Due to their high chromium content, certain D-type tool steels are often considered stainless or semi-stainless, however their corrosion resistance is very limited due to the precipitation {{of the majority of}} their chromium and carbon constituents as carbides.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cold-work</b> {{tool steels}} include the O-series (oil-hardening), the A-series (air-hardening), and the D-series (high carbon-chromium). These are steels used to cut or form {{materials}} that are at low temperatures. This group possesses high hardenability and wear resistance, and average toughness and heat softening resistance. They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching. More alloying elements are used in these steels, {{as compared to the}} water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels' hardenability, and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack. They have high surface hardness and are often used to make knife blades. The machinability of the oil hardening grades is high but for the high carbon-chromium types is low.|$|E
50|$|American {{glass artist}} Harvey Littleton was a tenured {{professor}} of art at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when, in June 1974, he taught a workshop in cold-working techniques for glass artists. To <b>cold-work</b> glass is to shape or sculpt cold (as opposed to hot or molten) glass, or to produce texture or decoration on its surface. Cold-working is done by carving, grinding or engraving glass with various tools, or by selectively blasting it with abrasives. As a result of experimenting with various resists for sandblasting, Littleton became intrigued {{by the possibility of}} printmaking from glass. He asked his colleague at the University of Wisconsin, printmaker Warrington Colescott, to ink five of the sandblasted plates from the workshop and print them onto paper in his etching press. The first plate broke under pressure, but after making some adjustments to the press, the rest of the glass plates printed “like dreamboats,” Colescott said. Editions printed from the plates looked promising, and Littleton was awarded a research grant from the University of Wisconsin to continue the development of printing from glass.|$|E

40|$|The stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) behavior of <b>cold-worked</b> AISI type 316 L (UNS S 31603) stainless steel (SS) in a concentrated lithium salt solution at elevated temperature was investigated. Using the slow strain rate technique, SCC experiments were carried out on 20 % and 40 % <b>cold-worked</b> materials in a solution of 10 g lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and 100 cm 3 H 2 O at 95 -degrees-C under conditions with controlled electrochemical potential. Observation of the fracture surfaces by scanning electron microscope indicated the SCC behavior of the <b>cold-worked</b> steel was essentially {{different from that of}} the solution-annealed steel. A ductile fracture of cold worked samples occurred under open-circuit conditions (approximately - 280 mV(SCE)) and at 200 mV(SCE).

40|$|Extralow sulfur, {{cold-rolled}} 304 {{stainless steel}} SS samples, annealed and cold-worked to different degrees in an industrial plant, together with a ferrite-rich SS, have been studied by electrochemical and microscopic techniques to analyze the effect of cold- working on its passive behavior in sulfate media. The techniques employed were potentiostatic and cyclic polarization, optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, ex situ scanning tunneling microscopy, and ex situ and in situ atomic force microscopy. The cyclic polarization measurements showed that the passive currents in neutral sulfate chloride and in sulfuric acid solutions were similar and increased with <b>cold-work.</b> The pitting susceptibility also increased with <b>cold-work,</b> this effect being more evident as the chloride concentration increased. The dependence of the pitting potential on <b>cold-work</b> was explained using the bilayer model, the sulfate ingress in the passive film during anodic oxidation forming a coulombic barrier against chloride penetration. The microscopic examination of the samples after long time polarization in 1. 0 M sulfuric acid showed that the surface profile of the passive film depended on the metallurgical structure of the metallic substrate. The higher passive currents and the increased susceptibility to pitting corrosion of the work-hardened samples were explained by the forma- tion of a much more defective oxide during its anodic oxidation, with easy paths that enhanced sulfate ingress. The growth of such a much more imperfect oxide {{was related to the}} formation of defects in the grains and of more defective interfaces in the bulk of the material, both resulting from the accumulation of internal stresses during cold-rolling.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pre-ageing}} deformation {{on the size}} and distribution of beta-prime precipitates and subsequently on the resulting strength and ductility have been measured in a Mg- 3. 0 at. %Zn- 0. 5 at. %Y alloy. The alloy was extruded and then subjected to a T 8 heat treatment comprised of a solution-treatment, <b>cold-work</b> and artificial ageing. Extrusion was used to introduce texture, ensuring that deformation occurred via slip rather than twinning. Samples were subjected to controlled uniaxial deformation and then isothermally aged to peak hardness. Precipitate length, diameter and number density were measured and evaluated {{in terms of the}} strength and ductility of the alloy. The nucleation of the beta-prime precipitates in peak-aged condition without pre-ageing deformation (i. e. T 6 treatment) was poor, with only 0. 5 % volume fraction, compared to approximately 3. 5 % in T 6 treated binary Mg- 3. 0 at. %Zn alloy. The microstructure of the Mg-Zn-Y alloy was less refined, with larger diameter precipitates and lower beta-prime number densities compared to a binary Mg- 3. 0 at. %Zn alloy. Deformation to 5 % plastic strain increased the volume fraction of beta-prime precipitates to approximately 2. 3 % and refined the beta-prime precipitate length and diameter. The combination of these effects increased the yield strength after isothermal ageing from 217 MPa (0 % <b>cold-work)</b> to 287 MPa (5 % <b>cold-work).</b> The yield stress increased linearly with reciprocal interparticle spacing on the basal and prismatic planes and the alloy showed similar strengthening against basal slip to Mg-Zn.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>cold-work</b> and of 3 MeV {{electron}} irradiation {{on the internal}} friction and the shear modulus of polycrystalline copper was measured at 1 Hz. The general features of {{the results will be}} briefly discussed. Figure 1 a gives the decrement as a function of temperature for the undeformed sample, the sample after 7 % <b>cold-work</b> at 78 °K, and the annealed sample. The main structure of the curve after deformation (filled circles) is the peak P 2 at about 160 °K. The peak temperature is shifted to lower values by increasing plastic deformation and can be related to the dislocation density of the samples. For temperatures above 200 °K there is no pronounced structure, several damping processes seem to increase the background without yielding well-defined peaks. In particular, we cannot resolve that relaxation process, that was interpreted to be due to the relaxation of the -split interstitial. Figure 1 b gives the corresponding decrement curves for a sample irradiated with 3 MeV electrons at 100 °K up to a defect concentration of 3 x 10 - 7. Between 120 °K and 330 °K the difference between the irradiated and the unirradiated sample gives a very broad peak. A 10 min. anneal at 360 °K reduces the radiation-induced increase of decrement completely above 100 °K, and the curve of the unirradiated sample is reproduced. The fact that here the irradiation increases the internal friction does not fit the commonly accepted views on dislocation damping. It must be assumed that the point defects themselves or in interaction with dislocations produce this very broad peak. This smeared-out increase of internal friction due to electron irradiation is very similar to that after <b>cold-work,</b> as can be seen by comparing the full-circle-curves in figure 1 a and 1 b...|$|E

In non-deformed samples we observe a complex behaviour of the Snoek-relaxation peak intensity, which indicates the existence of carbon redistribution governed by the copper precipitation.
