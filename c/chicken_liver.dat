5|$|Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is a {{restaurant}} in London, England. Opened in January 2011, it gained a Michelin star within a year, and in April 2014 was listed fifth on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in Restaurant magazine. It received a second Michelin Star in the 2014 Guide. The restaurant is headed by former Fat Duck head chef Ashley Palmer-Watts. Menu options are based on historical British dishes, which were researched by food historians and through the British Library. The restaurant's opening drew interest within the industry, and reviews have been positive. Particular dishes have received praise, including the meat fruit, a <b>chicken</b> <b>liver</b> mousse created {{to look like a}} mandarin orange.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{intends to}} change the menu every three months, each menu containing historical dishes ranging from the 14th to 19th centuries. Prior to opening, rumours were abound regarding the dishes to be served at Dinner, including one report from The Guardian which claimed that an ice-cream meat pie was {{to appear on the}} menu. Dishes that do appear include scallops and peas with cucumber ketchup and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a <b>chicken</b> <b>liver</b> mousse made to look like a textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming to increase production to be able to supply up to 1200 a week. During the Christmas period, the Meat Fruit is decorated to appear like a plum rather than a mandarine to accord with the holiday season.|$|E

40|$|Few recent {{outbreaks}} in Europe and the US involving Campylobacter and Salmonella {{were linked}} to the consumption of <b>chicken</b> <b>livers.</b> Studies investigating Staphylococcus aureus in <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> and gizzards are very limited. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence of S. aureus and MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in retail <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> and gizzards in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In this study, 156 <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> and 39 <b>chicken</b> gizzards samples of two brands were collected. While one of the brands showed very low prevalence of 1 % (1 / 100) for S. aureus in <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> and gizzards, the second brand showed prevalence of 37 % (31 / 95). No MRSA was detected since none harbored the mecA or mecC gene. Eighty seven S. aureus isolates from livers and 28 from gizzards were screened for antimicrobial resistance to 16 antimicrobials and the possession of 18 toxin genes. Resistance to most of the antimicrobials screened including cefoxitin and oxacillin was higher in the chicken gizzards isolates. While the prevalence of enterotoxin genes seg and sei was higher in the gizzards isolates, the prevalence of hemolysin genes hla, hlb, and hld was higher in the livers ones. The lucocidin genes lukE-lukD was equally prevalent in <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> and gizzards isolates. Using spa typing, a subset of the recovered isolates showed that they are not known to be livestock associated and, hence, may be of a human origin. In conclusion, this study stresses the importance of thorough cooking of <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> and gizzards since it might contain multidrug resistant enterotoxigenic S. aureus. To our knowledge this is the first study to specifically investigate the prevalence of S. aureus in <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> and gizzards in the US...|$|R

25|$|Meat {{and fish}} are the richest sources of dietary CoQ10; levels over 50mg/kg {{may be found}} in beef, pork, chicken heart, and <b>chicken</b> <b>liver.</b> Dairy {{products}} are much poorer sources of CoQ10 compared to animal tissues. Vegetable oils also are quite rich in CoQ10. Within vegetables, parsley and perilla are the richest CoQ10 sources, but significant differences in their CoQ10 levels {{may be found in}} the literature. Broccoli, grapes, and cauliflower are modest sources of CoQ10. Most fruit and berries represent a poor to very poor source of CoQ10, with the exception of avocados, which have a relatively high CoQ10 content.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian {{chicken soup}} {{is a clear}} soup, a consommé, called Újházi chicken soup. A consommé with entire pieces of chicken, <b>chicken</b> <b>liver</b> and heart, with chunky {{vegetables}} and spices like whole black peppercorn, bay leaves, salt and ground black pepper. The vegetables boiled along with the pieces of chicken are usually carrots, celeriac, parsley root and parsnip. Soup vermicelli, semolina dumplings or thin Spätzle noodles or small dumplings are also added to the soup. Even other vegetables may be used, such as green peas, a whole tomato and whole onions boiled along with the soup, mushrooms, asparagus, celery, green pepper, cauliflower, kohlrabi, green beans or parsley, in different combinations.|$|E
25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried <b>chicken</b> <b>liver</b> with chopped giblet, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|E
40|$|In the United Kingdom, {{outbreaks}} of Campylobacter infection are increasingly attributed to undercooked <b>chicken</b> <b>livers,</b> yet many recipes, {{including those of}} top chefs, advocate short cooking times and serving livers pink. During 2015, we studied preferences of chefs and {{the public in the}} United Kingdom and investigated the link between liver rareness and survival of Campylobacter. We used photographs to assess chefs' ability to identify <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> meeting safe cooking guidelines. To investigate the microbiological safety of livers chefs preferred to serve, we modeled Campylobacter survival in infected <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> cooked to various temperatures. Most chefs correctly identified safely cooked livers but overestimated the public's preference for rareness and thus preferred to serve them more rare. We estimated that 19...|$|R

The Paris {{newspaper}} Le Monde reports that it is made from <b>chicken</b> <b>livers,</b> fresh thyme and thyme flowers, full cream, white Dijon mustard, butter, and water, plus salt and pepper. According to Le Monde, the <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> are blanched in one pan with the thyme until they start to turn colour. In a second pan, the cream is reduced on low heat with the mustard and infused with the flavour of the thyme flowers. The <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> are then finely minced and pressed through a strainer into the reduced cream. As the sauce thickens, the butter is incorporated into {{it with a little}} water, it is beaten smooth, and fresh-ground salt and pepper are added. The London newspaper The Independent, however, reports that Hélène Godillot has dismissed the Le Monde report as inaccurate.|$|R

60|$|Two days later. This {{comes from}} Kobé (thirty hours from Nagasaki), the European portion {{of which is}} a raw American town. We walked down the wide, naked streets between houses of sham stucco, with Corinthian pillars of wood, wooden verandahs and piazzas, all stony grey beneath stony grey skies, and keeping guard over raw green saplings miscalled shade trees. In truth, Kobé is hideously American in externals. Even I, who have only seen {{pictures}} of America, recognised at once that it was Portland, Maine. It lives among hills, but the hills are all scalped, and the general impression is of out-of-the-wayness. Yet, ere I go further, let me sing the praises of the excellent M. Begeux, proprietor of the Oriental Hotel, upon whom be peace. His is a house where you can dine. He does not merely feed you. His coffee is the coffee of the beautiful France. For tea he gives you Peliti cakes (but better) and the vin ordinaire which is compris, is good. Excellent Monsieur and Madame Begeux! If the Pioneer were a medium for puffs, I would write a leading article upon your potato salad, your beefsteaks, your fried fish, and your staff of highly trained Japanese servants in blue tights, who looked like so many small Hamlets without the velvet cloak, and who obeyed the unspoken wish. No, it should be a poem--a ballad of good living. I have eaten curries of the rarest at the Oriental at Penang, the turtle steaks of Raffles's at Singapur still live in my regretful memory, and they gave me <b>chicken</b> <b>liver</b> and sucking-pig in the Victoria at Hong-Kong which I will always extol. But the Oriental at Kobé was better than all three. Remember this, and so shall you who come after slide round a quarter of the world upon a sleek and contented stomach.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of Campylobacter outbreaks caused by contaminated <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> has recently increased. We aimed to investigate where contamination occurs, {{and the drug}} resistance and genetic characteristics of Campylobacter from <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> sold in Beijing, China. The bacteria were isolated from 103 raw <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> bought from the retail market in two districts of Beijing. The E-test, Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis techniques (PFGE) were used to study the antibiotic susceptibility and genetic sub-typing of the obtained isolates. A total of 42 Campylobacter isolates (30 C. jejuni and 12 C. coli) were obtained from 38 samples of the 103 samples tested (37 %, 38 / 103). The rates of resistance against the tested antibiotics were as follows: erythromycin (2. 38 %, 1 / 42), azithromycin (4. 76 %, 2 / 42), streptomycin (4. 76 %, 2 / 40), gentamicin (40. 47 %, 17 / 42), chloramphenicol (11. 90 %, 5 / 42), ampicillin (23. 81 %, 10 / 42), nalidixic acid (92. 85 %, 39 / 42), ciprofloxacin (90. 48 %, 38 / 40), doxycycline (78. 57 %, 33 / 42), and tetracycline (83. 33 %, 35 / 42). The isolates were obtained both from the interior and exterior of the liver samples. Seven sequence types were identified among the 42 isolates; 23 PFGE patterns were found among 32 of the 42 isolates. Different PFGE patterns were identified in isolates from the interior and exterior of the same sample. In conclusion, both the interior and exterior of <b>chicken</b> <b>livers</b> can be contaminated with Campylobacter. They may therefore be a major food source of human campylobacteriosis in Beijing...|$|R
