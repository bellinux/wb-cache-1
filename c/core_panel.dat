40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{critical}} buckling loads {{for various}} core densities and materials of honeycomb composite panels are experimentally and numerically investigated in this study. The surface plates of honeycomb composite panels are of polyester/glass fiber composite. Polyester resin-impregnated paper or aluminum {{is used as}} the honeycomb <b>core</b> material. Honeycomb <b>panels</b> with different cell sizes, but approximately the same volume, are produced {{and the effect of}} the honeycomb core density on the critical buckling load is investigated by compression tests. The critical buckling load of paper <b>core</b> <b>panels</b> is determined to be higher than that of aluminum <b>core</b> <b>panels.</b> It is seen that the buckling strength of the specimens increases by the increase of core density. As the critical buckling load exceeds a certain limit, regional core cell buckling and core crushing are seen in aluminum <b>core</b> <b>panels.</b> In paper <b>core</b> <b>panels,</b> regional cracks are seen, in addition to these failures. The study also calculates the numeric buckling loads of the panels using theANSYS finite element analysis program.

A Bifurcation in the load versus engineering strain curve was noted in all cases. For all sandwich panels tested using corrugation core, the type of failure was easily identified as face sheet delamination followed by core shear failure. In the failed <b>core</b> <b>panels</b> there was little or no evidence of core remaining on the FRP face sheet, however, lower strain rate in the PVC foam <b>core</b> <b>panels</b> there were ample amounts of foam left on the FRP face sheet.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} of the automotive industry is reduction in structural weight of automobiles. Reduction of weight on vehicles has been proven to lower the usage of fuel, and therefore {{save a lot of}} energy in order to move from one place to another. At the same time, reduction of weight often means reduction in material usage, often regarded to be threatening structural strength of parts, components or vehicle’s body in white (BIW). Truss <b>Core</b> <b>Panel,</b> which has been developed from the study of origami engineering, specifically plane-tilings and space fillings, is a suitable candidate because it can be produced from thin sheet metals and can be joined using spot welding. In this paper, method for evaluating truss core panels for crashworthiness has been established based previous research on crashworthiness evaluation on thin shells. The effect of different configuration of spot welding has been investigated. The number of spot weld (n) along central member and side members of truss <b>core</b> <b>panel</b> has been varied and modeled from n = 2, 4, 6 … to n = 30, and compared to a truss <b>core</b> <b>panel</b> model that is fully welded along central member and side members.

40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) is becoming, {{especially}} in the last years, a field of major interest, both for research and for industry. The purpose of this thesis work is to understand the AM process starting from powders in a support mean, usually a gel (in this case powders were of a material similar to polypropylene) and then illustrate the buckling behaviour of a honeycomb <b>core</b> <b>panel</b> produced with this technique (with particular focus {{to the definition of}} a model which can be used in general, also with different base materials). Starting from the properties of base material (powder), the behaviour of the material deposed by AM was studied, with an initial hypothesis of material isotropy, later confirmed with the calculation of elastic properties. Afterwards, since the base material is similar to polypropylene, it was defined an elastic-plastic law to describe the non-linear behaviour of the material, based on data given by the producer and on similar curves found in literature. Those assumptions were verified with traction tests on specimens produced by AM, and therefore the model was validated. With the same microstructural model the compression behaviour of the material was estimated using a curve comparable to the traction one (with estimated values of base material properties derived from compression and bending data given by the producer) : this material model was used for the buckling study of a honeycomb <b>core</b> <b>panel</b> in transverse compression...|$|E

40|$|The Swann and Pittman semi-empirical {{relationship}} 1 {{has been}} used as a standard in aerospace industry to predict the effective thermal conductivity of honeycomb core panels. Recent measurements of the effective thermal conductivity of an adhesively bonded titanium honeycomb <b>core</b> <b>panel</b> using three different techniques, two steady-state and one transient radiant step heating method, at four laboratories varied significantly from each other and from the Swann and Pittman predictions. Average differences between the measurements and the predictions varied between 17 and 61 percent in the temperature range of 300 to 500 K. In order to determine the correct values of the effective thermal conductivity and determine which set of the measurements or predictions were most accurate, the combined radiation and conduction heat transfer in the honeycomb <b>core</b> <b>panel</b> was modeled using a finite volume numerical formulation. The transient radiant step heating measurements provided the best agreement with the numerical results. It was found that a modification of the Swann and Pittman semi-empirical relationship which incorporated the facesheets and adhesive layers in the thermal model provided satisfactory results.

Ill. (some col.) Steel sandwich panels with integrated structural and thermal insulating performance offer several advantages over conventional construction methods for residential roofs. These advantages include improved energy efficiency, reduced construction time, architectural benefits, and amenability to other energy-saving {{technologies such as}} integrated solar photovoltaic <b>panels.</b> Traditional foam <b>core</b> <b>panels</b> are unsuitable for roofs, however, because they rely on the core material (which has low stiffness and is subject to creep) for long-term structural performance. This work focuses on an alternative solution, web <b>core</b> <b>panels,</b> consisting of foam-filled panels with interior webs, with or without an additional insulating layer. The structural performance of web <b>core</b> <b>panels</b> {{is provided by the}} face sheets and webs. The core is used both as an insulating material and to strengthen the thin sheet metal components against local buckling failure. The webs, in particular, must be thin and widely-spaced to minimize their impact on thermal performance. As a result, they are subject to a variety of potential local failure modes that limit the range of feasible roof designs. The influence of the core material on local failure modes is examined in this work. Models are developed by treating the webs as plates on a Pasternak elastic foundation, with expressions for the foundation constants derived using energy methods. The models are validated through finite element analysis and prototype testing. The factors that limit the range of feasible web core designs are investigated. The limiting factors for design are thermal performance, panel deflection, face sheet buckling, and shear buckling of the webs. Thermal performance is particularly limiting due to the high thermal conductivity of the steel webs, and large panel depths are generally required. Panel depth can be reduced by using a web material with lower thermal conductivity, such as stainless steel, or by providing an external insulating layer. Design procedures are developed for panels with and without an external insulating layer and used to investigate the tradeoff between panel depth and weight. Based on minimum weight design, panels with stainless steel webs are recommended, especially as the applied load and R-value requirements increase...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} investigations and finite element analyses {{is presented in}} the compression response and subsequent failure modes in foam-filled corrugated <b>core</b> sandwich <b>panels.</b> The corrugated <b>cores</b> based on carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) were fabricated using a hot press molding process and then bonded to face sheets based on the same material, to produce a range of lightweight sandwich panels. A liquid of low-density Rigid Polyurethane (PUR) foam was injected to fill the empty space of the panels, where to investigate the influence of filling the corrugation with the foam. The experiments also provide an insight into the post-failure response of the sandwich panels. The results are compared with the numerical predictions offered by a finite element analysis (FEA).

These parallel-acting cis-regulatory modules are responsive to a multitude of distinct trans-acting factors. Neuronal gene expression programs therefore fall into two fundamentally distinct classes. Neuron-type-specific genes are generally controlled by discrete and non-redundantly acting regulatory inputs, while pan-neuronal gene expression is controlled by diverse, coincident and seemingly redundant regulatory inputs...|$|E

The tuned chamber core concept incorporates low-frequency noise control directly within the primary structure and is applicable to sandwich constructions with a directional core, including corrugated-, truss-, and fluted-core designs. These types of sandwich structures have long, hollow channels (or chambers) in the core. By adding small holes through one of the facesheets, the hollow chambers can be utilized as an array of low-frequency acoustic resonators. These resonators can then be used to attenuate low-frequency noise (below 400 Hz) inside a vehicle compartment without increasing the weight or size of the structure. The results of this test program demonstrate that the tuned chamber core concept is effective when used in isolation or combined with acoustic foam treatments. Specifically, an array of acoustic resonators integrated within the <b>core</b> of the <b>panels</b> was shown to improve both the low-frequency absorption and transmission loss of the structure in targeted one-third octave bands...|$|R
