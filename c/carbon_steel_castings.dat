40|$|A {{gate valve}} {{can be used}} {{for a wide variety of}} fluids and {{provides}} a tight seal when closed. Gate Valves are designed to suit a wide range of applications in Refineries, Petro-chemical Complexes, Fertilizer Plants, Power Generation Plants (Hydro-electric, Thermal and Nuclear) Steel Plants and Allied Industries. They are made from high quality <b>Carbon</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Castings</b> and embody design features that contribute to strength and durability. Gate valves are used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. Gate valves are so named because the part that either stops or allows flow of fluid through the valve acts somewhat like the opening or closing of a gate and is called, appropriately, the gate. The objective of this paper is to perform a literature review on optimization of various mechanical parts...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the potential for}} strip casting in the steel industry and to develop the fundamental knowledge necessary to allow the role of strip casting in the modern steel industry to be understood. Based upon a study of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> strip <b>castings</b> that were either produced for the program at British Steel or were received from a pre-commercial production machine, the following conclusions were made. Strip casting of <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> is technically feasible for sheet material from slightly less than 1 mm thick to 3 mm thick, and, assuming that it is economically viable, it will be first applied in <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> markets {{that do not require}} stringent surface quality or extensive forming. The potential of strip casting as a casting process to be developed for <b>steel</b> <b>castings</b> is very high as the cast strip has some very novel characteristics. Direct cast carbon strip has better surface quality, shape and profile than any other casting process currently available. The more rapidly solidified structure of direct cast strip tends to be strong with low ductility; however, with adequate thermal treatment, it is possible to develop a variety of properties from the same grade. The process is more amenable at this time to production tonnages per year of the order of 500, 000 tons and as such will first find niche type applications. This technology is an additional technology for steel production and will be in addition to, rather than a replacement for, current casting machines...|$|R

Steel can be hardened by rapid cooling, but loses its toughness, becoming brittle. <b>Steel</b> <b>castings</b> can not usually be cooled rapidly, for irregular shapes can warp or crack. Mangalloy proved to be extremely suitable for casting, as it did not form gas pockets called [...] "blow-holes", and did not display the extreme brittleness of other castings.|$|R
