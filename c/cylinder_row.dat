5000|$|The Ruf R Kompressor (Ruf RK) is {{a sports}} car built by Ruf Automobile of Germany. It {{is based on the}} Porsche 997 3.6 or 3.8 liter engine, amended by a radial {{compressor}} (supercharger) with an inter-cooler for each <b>cylinder</b> <b>row.</b> The 3.6 provides 435 bhp.

5000|$|The cams were {{operated}} by rotating shafts {{leading from the}} crankshaft {{at the back of}} the engine to the top of each <b>cylinder</b> <b>row.</b> The shaft was directly geared to one of the two camshafts, using another driven shaft to transmit power to the second camshaft on the [...] "other side" [...] of the cylinder heads. The arrangement was somewhat complex, but no more so than a pushrod-based system. A side-effect of the use of the overhead cams was that the cylinders were [...] "in-line", whereas radials typically rotated the second bank of cylinders in relation to the first in order to expose them more fully to the airflow for cooling.|$|E
5000|$|The R-4360 was a 28-cylinder four-row {{air-cooled}} radial engine. Each row {{of seven}} air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rows</b> behind them, inspiring the engine's [...] "corncob" [...] nickname. A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 {{so that the}} tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{targeted}} at output powers between 120 bhp to 1,000 bhp. The cylinder diameter for these engines was 180mm. As for many radial engines, <b>cylinder</b> <b>rows</b> could be stacked for greater power. In most aircraft radial engines this {{is restricted to}} {{only one or two}} rows, by the need for air cooling of the rear rows. The Michel engine, being water-cooled, had no such restriction. A further advantage of the multiple rows was improved dynamic balance.|$|R
50|$|The H-1640 was an {{air-cooled}} 12 cylinder two-row radial {{with the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>rows</b> aligned rather than staggered {{as in most}} multi-row radials. One piece cylinder heads shared a single overhead camshaft and the propeller was directly driven. By aligning the cylinders {{the diameter of the}} engine was less than more conventional radial engines, and it was thought that the use of a Townend ring could make the engine more aerodynamically efficient than an inline engine. The engine first ran in 1927.|$|R
40|$|The surface {{vorticity}} method (SVM), {{which is}} a fast and practical grid-free two-dimensional (2 -D) method, and a fluid-structure interaction model incorporating the effects of cylinder motions and displacements is used to simulate the vortex-induced vibration of cylinder arrays at sub-critical Reynolds number Re = 2. 67 × 1 04. The SVM {{is found to be}} most suitable for simulating a 2 -D <b>cylinder</b> <b>row</b> with large-amplitude vibrations where the vorticity field and the fluid forces of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>row</b> change drastically, and the effect of the stream on the transverse direction vibration is very significant. The fluidelastic instability of a flexible <b>cylinder</b> <b>row</b> at small pitch ratio is also investigated, and the critical reduced velocity of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>row</b> at a reduced damping parameter SG = 1. 29 is calculated, which is in good agreement with experimental and analytical results of the unsteady model. Vortex-induced vibration of a staggered cylinder array is simulated using different structural parameters. When the cylinders are relatively more flexible, the flow pattern changes dramatically and the fluid-structure interaction has a dominant impact on the flow field. Compared with grid-based methods, the grid-free SVM is a fast and practical method for the simulation of the FIV of cylinder arrays due to vortex shedding at sub-critical Reynolds numbers.

40|$|According to {{the current}} {{literature}} on the cooling of two <b>cylinders</b> in <b>row,</b> by a uniform flow of air, the first cylinder is always a heat transfer promoter versus the second one. The aim of the present paper is to summarize the state of art {{of the literature on}} the cooling of two <b>cylinders</b> in <b>row</b> by a slot jet of air. Additional experiments are carried on in order to investigate the possible application of jet cooling to heat transfer apparatuses, including electronics, in order to study the positions of the two <b>cylinders</b> in <b>row</b> which realize the same heat transfer on each cylinder. In the experiments a slot jet of air with low turbulence is employed with a slot height, S, equal to the impinged cylinder diameter, D, i. e. D/S = 1. 0. The first cylinder is set at two distances H from the slot exit, H/S = 4 and 6, while the distance of the second cylinder from the first one, L, is variable from L/S = 2 – 11. The Reynolds number, Re, defined with the cylinder diameter D, spans in the range Re = 11, 000 – 22, 200. If the first cylinder is set at the dimensionless distance from the slot exit which realizes the maximum mean heat transfer on the first cylinder, i. e. H/S = 6, the second one has generally a lower mean Nusselt number. The only exception is when the second cylinder is set at the dimensionless distance L/S = 4 and the Reynolds number is at the maximum value experimented, i. e. Re = 22, 200. If the first cylinder is set at the dimensionless distance H/S = 4 the mean Nusselt number on the second cylinder is greater if its distance from the first one is in the range L/S = 3. 5 – 7 for Re = 14, 300 – 22, 200.

The EMD 16-338 developed [...] at 1600 rpm. On the top was an air intake then four layers of four cylinders each. Each cylinder had a 6 in bore and a 6+1/2 in stroke. On the bottom of the crank shaft was an Elliot generator which developed 817 kW at a maximum of 710 volts DC. This proved problematic as the engine fluids ran down into the generator. The whole engine weighed just over eight tons. Being 4 feet wide it allowed for four engines in an engine room only 22 ft long and also allowed design engineers to eliminate a submarine engine room. The [...] and the research submarine [...] used the troublesome EMD 16-338.

The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire, making the motion more uniform. If an even number of cylinders were used, an equally timed firing cycle would not be feasible.
