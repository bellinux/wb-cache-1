5|$|Prior to the 1848 {{division}} of land known as the Great Māhele, {{during the reign of}} Kamehameha III, all land in Hawaii was owned by the monarchy. The Great Māhele subdivided the land among the monarchy, the government, and acreage to allow private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for the monarchy became known as the <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands</b> of Hawaii. When Hawaii was annexed, the <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands</b> were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her power of attorney in 1898 as part of her legal defense team in seeking indemnity for the government's seizure of the <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands.</b> She filed a protest with the United States Senate on December 20, 1898, requesting their return and claiming the lands were seized without due process or recompense.|$|E

Introduction In March 2014, the NSW Government announced substantial changes to the management of <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> in NSW, following a review by an inter-agency Steering Committee. The Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Stoner, said: "The NSW Government will cut red tape, return decision making to local communities and protect community land uses such as surf clubs, scout halls and bowling clubs under the most significant reforms to <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> management in a generation. " Over 600 submissions were made {{in response to the}} reform proposals, reflecting the economic, social and environmental significance of <b>Crown</b> <b>land.</b> The Government has indicated that new legislation will not be introduced until 2015.

5000|$|Within Canada, <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> is a {{designated}} territorial area {{belonging to the}} Canadian Crown. Though the monarch owns all <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> in the country, it is divided in parallel with the [...] "division" [...] of the Crown among the federal and provincial jurisdictions, so that some lands within the provinces are administered by the relevant provincial Crown, whereas others are under the federal Crown. About 89% of Canada's land area (8,886,356 km²) is Crown Land: 41% is federal <b>crown</b> <b>land</b> and 48% is provincial <b>crown</b> <b>land.</b> The remaining 11% is privately owned. Most federal <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> is in the territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon) and is administered by Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. Only 4% {{of land in the}} provinces is federally controlled, largely in the form of National Parks, Indian reserves, or Canadian Forces bases. In contrast, provinces hold much of their territory as provincial <b>Crown</b> <b>Land,</b> which may be held as Provincial Parks or wilderness.|$|R
50|$|Much of Canada is <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> {{owned by}} the provinces. Some is leased for {{commercial}} activity, such as forestry or mining, but on much of it there is free access for recreational activities like hiking, cycling, canoeing, cross-country skiing, horse back riding, and licensed hunting and fishing, etc. At the same time access can be restricted or limited for various reasons (e.g., to protect public safety or resources, including the protection of wild plants and animals).In the Canadian Territories <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> {{is administered by the}} Canadian Federal Government. Canadian National Parks have been created from <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> and are also administered by the Federal Government. There are also provincial parks and nature reserves that have been similarly created.

5|$|After the Mongol withdrawal, Béla IV {{abandoned}} his policy of recovering former <b>crown</b> <b>lands.</b> Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and {{urged them to}} construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated {{a new wave of}} colonization that resulted in the arrival of a number of Germans, Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the ancestors of the Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to occupy the}} neighboring Principality of Halych.

Béla IV succeeded his father in 1235. His attempt to reacquire <b>crown</b> <b>lands</b> alienated by his predecessors created a deep rift between the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes.|$|E

40|$|Throughout Australia {{freehold}} land interests {{are protected by}} statutory schemes which grant indefeasibility of title to registered interests. Queensland {{freehold land}} interests are protected by Torrens system established by the Land Title Act 1994. However, no such protection exists for <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> interests. The extent of Queensland occupied under some form of Crown tenure, in excess of 70 %, means that Queensland <b>Crown</b> <b>land</b> users are disadvantaged when compared to freehold land users. This article examines the role indefeasibility of title has in protecting interests in <b>Crown</b> <b>land.</b> A comparative analysis is undertaken between Queensland and New South Wales land management frameworks to determine whether interests in <b>crown</b> <b>land</b> are adequately protected in Queensland...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to his colonization policies, Stephen restored <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> that had been lost {{during the civil war}} that followed Alexander the Good's rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other hand, he granted much landed property to the Church and to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His itinerant lifestyle enabled him to personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.|$|E

He graduated from Nowodworski College in Kraków and Kraków Academy, then traveled and studied in Western Europe.

40|$|Security {{of tenure}} is the {{cornerstone}} of the land management system in Australia. Freehold title is protected throug indefeasibility of title entrenched in legislation and protection of registrable interests in land is offered through the Statutory Assurance Fund. For those with interests pertaining to <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> no such protection is offered, although this position is not uniform across Australia. Notably those with Crown leasehold interests or a profit a prendre on <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> in Queensland are not protected through registration on the freehold land register and do not have the benefit of indefeasibility of title. The issue of management of interests pertaining to <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> has become increasingly relevant due to the complexities associated with balancing public interests including native title with more commercial interests in land generated through carbon sequestration, forestry and mining. This paper considers the framework for the management of <b>Crown</b> <b>Land</b> in Queensland and the adequacy of this framework for commercial interests that pertain to <b>Crown</b> <b>Land...</b>|$|R

5|$|The losses {{impacted}} severely {{the trade}} and customs income of the Great Duchy of Lithuania.

The Swedish advance resulted in the take-over of the Baltic coastline up to Puck. Danzig (Gdańsk), which had remained loyal to the Commonwealth, was subjected to a naval blockade.|$|E

5|$|Much of this wealth {{was spent}} by Henry on {{maintaining}} his court and household, including {{many of the}} building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland hung just 200. Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 handguns. Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government {{out of their own}} income. This income came from the <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like tonnage and poundage, granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around £100,000), but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.|$|E
5|$|The area of Princes Street {{between the}} Exchange and Market Reserve was a {{frequent}} source of dispute {{in the early years}} of European settlement. This area, at that time on the foreshore of Otago Harbour was a traditional landing site for Māori waka. Captain Cargill, the founder of the new city, wished to follow the British practice of keeping the foreshore as public land. As the town spread, the area around the landing site became populated by settlers, and visiting Maori relied on the coastal strip as a place to set up their encampments. The southern Commissioner for <b>Crown</b> <b>Lands,</b> Walter Mantell noted the problem and proposed to his superiors in Wellington that a site be found at which the Māori could erect permanent structures, naming the Princes Street foreshore as the preferred site. Mantell and Cargill, who had been bitter political opponents for the control of the early settlement, quickly found themselves at loggerheads over the proposal, and disputes over the ownership and allocation of the land dragged on for over two decades, finally being settled in the courts in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and <b>Crown</b> <b>lands</b> would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E
