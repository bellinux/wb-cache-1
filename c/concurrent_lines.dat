It uses 62. 24 % of the area required by a conventional dual-port memory and is only 7. 6 % larger than a single-port 2 K x 8 memory. The block-access mode combines address decoders and generators, yielding block-access mode times 26 % faster than conventional schemes for a 256 words x 32 bits memory size. Despite some preferred-access-order restrictions, the designs incur no loss of generality because video algorithms possess high data parallelism and low dependence. ...|$|R

50|$|Rational {{trigonometry}} follows {{an approach}} {{built on the}} methods of linear algebra to the topics of elementary (high school level) geometry. Distance is replaced with its squared value (quadrance) and 'angle' is replaced with the squared value of the usual sine ratio (spread) associated to either angle between two lines. (Spread also corresponds to a scaled form of the inner product between line segments taken as vectors). The three main laws in trigonometry: Pythagoras's theorem, the sine law and the cosine law, given in rational (square-equivalent) form, are augmented by two further laws: the triple quad formula (relating the quadrances of three collinear points) and the triple spread formula (relating the spreads of three <b>concurrent</b> <b>lines),</b> giving the five main laws of the subject.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEuler {{diagrams}} are {{an accessible}} and effective visualisation of data involving simple set-theoretic relationships. Efficient algorithms to quickly compute the abstract regions of an Euler diagram upon curve addition and removal have previously been developed (the single marked point approach, SMPA), but a strict {{set of drawing}} conventions (called well-formedness conditions) were enforced, meaning that some abstract diagrams are not representable as concrete diagrams. We present a new methodology (the multiple marked point approach, MMPA) enabling online region computation for Euler diagrams under the relaxation of the drawing convention that zones must be connected regions. Furthermore, we indicate how to extend the methods {{to deal with the}} relaxation of any of the drawing conventions, with the use of <b>concurrent</b> <b>line</b> segments case being of particular importance. We provide complexity analysis and compare the MMPA with the SMPA. We show that these methods are theoretically no worse than other comparators, whilst our methods apply to any case, and are likely to be faster in practise due to their online nature. The machinery developed for the concurrency case could be of use in Euler diagram drawing techniques (in the context of the Euler Graph), and in computer graphics (e. g. the development of an advanced variation of a winged edge data structure that deals with concurrency). The algorithms are presented for generic curves; specialisations such as utilising fixed geometric shapes for curves may occur in applications which can enhance capabilities for fast computations of the algorithms' input structures. We provide an implementation of these algorithms, utilising ellipses, and provide time-based experimental data for benchmarking purposes...|$|R
