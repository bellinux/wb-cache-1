Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and {{have the freedom to}} release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E

Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're {{not going to get}} it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E
2500|$|RWBY {{had been}} a long-standing concept of Oum's for years before it began development. Towards {{the end of his}} work on the 10th season of Rooster Teeth's Red vs. Blue, he {{developed}} the color-coding approach to character names and design as a hook for the series. During production on Red vs. Blue season 10, Oum asked series creator Burnie Burns if they could produce RWBY following the conclusion of that season. Burns, worried for the production schedule, told Oum [...] "If you finish Season 10, then you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want." [...] Production on RWBY began as intended, with the first trailer being finished within two weeks and premiering after the credits of the Red vs. Blue season 10 finale on November 5, 2012.|$|E

Also, I like you, who are not a flat-faced fool like these Amaboona, but have a brain that turns in and out through difficulties, as a snake does through reeds; {{and it would be a}} pity to kill one who can shoot birds {{wheeling}} high above him in the air, which no one else <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> So <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> see and <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> hear, remember that you are safe, and shall go safely from this land, or stay safely in it if you will, to be my voice to speak with the Sons of George.|$|R

Albarn said: [...] "All of the vocals were sung outside ... It was nice. When its nice weather, its nice to be outside. I think the big studios are a con. They charge people to make less exciting records. That doesnt {{make any sense to}} me. I mean, recording as it is now, you dont need studios. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it on <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want, whenever you want. Thats a great liberation that computers and technology have given us. It basically means that its just going back to where it comes from, which is music on the streets and in the houses." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 55. You must {{expect at}} first {{that there will be}} {{difficulties}} and inconsistencies in carrying out the new style; but they will soon be conquered if you attempt not too much at once. Do not be afraid of incongruities--do not think of unities of effect. Introduce your Gothic line by line and stone by stone; never mind mixing it with your present architecture; your existing houses will be none the worse for having little bits of better work fitted to them; build a porch, or point a window, if you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing else; and remember that it is the glory of Gothic architecture that it <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> really and seriously want, Gothic will do for you; but it must be an earnest want. It is its pride to accommodate itself to your needs; and the one general law under which it acts is simply this,--find out what will make you comfortable, build that in the strongest and boldest way, and then set your fancy free in the decoration of it. Don't do anything to imitate this cathedral or that, however beautiful. Do what is convenient; and if the form be a new one, so much the better; then set your mason's wits to work, to find out some new way of treating it. Only be steadily determined that, even if you cannot get the best Gothic, at least you will have no Greek; and in a few years' time--in less time than you could learn a new science or a new language thoroughly--the whole art of your native country will be reanimated.|$|R
5000|$|Raine {{said in an}} {{interview}} that most of the lyrics on Gravity were rewritten because producer Bob Rock felt that the songs would be stronger with simpler lyrics, so that listeners could understand what Raine was talking about. [...] "I was really open to him musically, but I wasn't ready to be challenged lyrically like he challenged me. He kept telling me to rewrite stuff because he didn't understand what I was trying to convey in my lyrics. He would say, 'Raine, I don't have a fucking clue what you're talking about. Convince me. Explain to me what you're trying to say in your lyrics better.' I would keep rewriting and rewriting, and sometimes I felt I would never please him. I would say, 'Jesus, I don't know what you're asking me to do here. I don't think I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> it is <b>you</b> want.' He would say, 'Yes, you can, get back in there.' And I did it. Looking back now, I'm a better writer for it." [...] The stress caused by this challenge eventually led to Raine having to go to a hospital; contracting shingles. Raine had also cited his and his wife Chantal Kreviazuk's recent trips to Iraq with War Child Canada as inspiration to simplify his lyrics and to 'get to the point'. The results were considered some of Raine's most personal lyrics to date while others lamented the loss of Maida's more ambiguous lyrical style.|$|R
