40|$|Integrated <b>contract</b> <b>forms</b> {{are seen}} as a {{solution}} to various problems in the construction industry. Some studies found that building projects delivered with integrated <b>contract</b> <b>forms</b> show better performances on time, cost and quality. Other studies state that projects developed with integrated <b>contract</b> <b>forms</b> do not perform better on time, cost or quality when compared to projects developed with traditional <b>contract</b> <b>forms.</b> Conclusions from the studies analyzed vary and these studies have their shortcomings. This study reflects critically on these previous studies in order to promote better research and to reveal a small piece of the puzzle called ‘integrated contract forms’. Empirical findings from a case control study of thirty secondary schools indicate that the use of integrated <b>contract</b> <b>forms</b> do not provide the expected benefits to time performance when compared to traditional <b>contract</b> <b>forms.</b> The data was collected from project managers via online questionnaires. However, when there is above average time pressure during the development process, parties tend to choose for integrated contracts because they assume that projects developed in this way have faster processes than projects developed with traditional contracts.

40|$|The use of <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> of {{auxiliary}} verbs {{is widely}} presented as typical of informal speech (Biber et al. 1999, Carter and McCarthy 2005). Some {{studies have shown}} that learners of English appear to be somewhat reluctant to use <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> in informal spoken productions (De Cock 2007, Götz 2007). This paper sets out to investigate the use of <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> in native and non-native informal spoken English using two comparable corpora of informal interviews, namely LOCNEC (the Louvain Corpus of Native English Conversation, Centre for English Corpus Linguistics, Université catholique de Louvain) and the recently published LINDSEI CD-ROM (Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage, Gilquin et al. 2010). The focus is on verb contractions (BE, HAVE, will and would) with pronoun subjects (I’m, you’ve, it’s, we’ll, they’re, etc.) in LOCNEC and in the various subcorpora included on the LINDSEI CD-ROM (spoken productions by learners from eleven mother tongue backgrounds: Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Spanish and Swedish). The corpora used contain between 60, 000 and 100, 000 words of interviewee speech and the interviews all follow the same set pattern. The forms under study were retrieved from the corpora using the Concord tool in WordSmith Tools 4. 0 (Scott 2004). The ’s and ’d forms were disambiguated manually as they can correspond to the verb forms is or has and had or would respectively. When investigating <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> in the varieties under study, proportionate frequency is taken into consideration, i. e. the frequency of occurrence of a <b>contracted</b> <b>form</b> (e. g. ’re) as a percentage of both its contracted and full occurrences (’re + are) (see Kjellmer 1997). Proportionate frequency makes it possible to compare {{the extent to which the}} <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> are used as the preferred forms by the speakers in the corpora. The results confirm learners’ reluctance to use <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> compared with the native speakers: overall there is a greater proportion of <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> in the native corpus than in the learner varieties. It is noteworthy that there are differences in the proportion of <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> used between the various learner varieties (e. g. higher proportions can be found in the Swedish and German components than in the Chinese component). The study also shows that the verbs under study can be seen to occur in their <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> to varying degrees (e. g. the learners tend to use greater proportions of BE contractions than HAVE or WILL contractions). The proportion of <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> involving BE and HAVE as lexical verbs vs. auxiliaries are examined as well. The paper then focuses on the <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> of BE in negative constructions and compares the use of ‘not-contractions’ with ‘operator contractions’ (i. e. it isn’t vs. it’s not) (Biber et al. 1999) in informal native and learner speech. Biber et al. (1999) and Carter and McCarthy (2005) have shown that ‘operator contraction’ is the preferred form when the subject is a pronoun and when the <b>contracted</b> <b>form</b> does not occur in clause-initial position. This study seeks to find out whether the use of ‘not-contractions’ and ‘operator contractions’ is determined by the same factors in LOCNEC and in the LINDSEI subcorpora. In an attempt to explore whether learners’ general underuse of <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> in informal speech could for example be connected with the type of input they are exposed to, the paper is concluded by an investigation of verb contractions with pronoun subjects in the TeMa corpus, a pedagogically annotated corpus of textbook materials (Meunier and Gouverneur 2007). The study examines the presence of <b>contracted</b> <b>forms</b> in listening comprehension transcripts and whether or not they are the focus of discussions and/or exercises in the textbooks...|$|R

50|$|Originally {{contracts}} {{in the civil}} engineering and construction industries were bespoke and drafted by Chancery pleaders using their knowledge of leases rather than building processes. In 1879, Royal Institute of British Architects for construction projects created RIBA forms which lead to the Joint Contracts Tribunal, JCT forms. For civil engineering {{the need for a}} formalized approach to contracts led the Institution of Civil Engineers to produce the ICE formalized set of conditions of contract. In 1986, the ICE commissioned {{the development of a new}} form of contract as it was felt that there was a need for a form that had clearer language, clearer allocation of responsibilities and reduced opportunities for contractual “gamesmanship”. In 1991, this resulted in a consultative form of the New Engineering <b>Contract</b> <b>form</b> of contract. The first edition was published in 1993.

40|$|Two {{opposing}} <b>contracting</b> <b>forms</b> {{in construction}} are DB (Design and build) and DBB (Design - bid - build).   The  first  one  provides  the  contractor  degrees  of  freedom  in  design,  which  enables innovation. DBB is the safe and traditional <b>contracting</b> <b>form,</b> where {{the client is}} responsible for the design and the contractor build accordingly. There is a lack of empirical studies comparing these <b>contracting</b> <b>forms</b> on efficiency and innovation. A first step in comparing is to define and separate the contracts. The straightforward solution is to use the client instigated definitions at face  value  i. e. a contract  is  a  DB  or  a  DBB according  to  the  client. This  is  shown to  be problematic  by  using five  road  construction projects  from Sweden. One  of the  DBB indicates more  degrees  of  freedom  in  design  than  a DB  contract  and  only  one  DB  project  invites  new methods  for  construction. The  paper  concludes  that contract  labelling is  not a  good proxy for degrees  of  freedomin  design,  which  is  was  theoretically  drives  innovation.   This insight facilitates future studies to evaluate <b>contracting</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
