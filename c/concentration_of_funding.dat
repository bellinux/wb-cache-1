However, these disadvantages are outweighed by the significant economies of scale that can be generated if the domiciliation <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> is concentrated in financial centers.

We exploit a novel test based on the relationship between industry-level private venture financing and the performance of government-subsidized R&D projects. If industries differ in their appropriability level, then private funding and subsidized project performance should be positively correlated. Our principal finding is that subsidized project performance is higher in industrial segments with higher rates of private venture capital investment. Industrial sectors therefore seem to differ in the degree of appropriability and this variation helps explain why venture capital is concentrated. * The latest version of this paper is available at [URL] Appropriability, Subsidy, Capital Constraints, Technological Opportunity, Venture Capital,...|$|E

During the second term of Malawi's current president, Bingu wa Mutharika, this trend has continued apace, with important implications for the consolidation of the country's nascent democracy. Donors providing democracy aid have assisted with the conduct of elections and improved the technical capacity of parliamentarians. However, inconsistency across programme cycles, the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> around elections, and a reluctance to support political parties hinders the size of democracy aid's long-term impact. Development aid, particularly general budget support, has tended to further sideline the role of parliament and indirectly has provided the incumbent party with an electoral advantage through support for the country's fertilizer input subsidy programme.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{whether the}} {{relative}} <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for small, research-oriented firms {{in a small}} number of high-tech industries is related to the differences across industries in the level of appropriability or capital constraints facing small firms. To do so, we exploit a novel test based on the relationship between industry-level private venture financing and the performance of government-subsidized R&D projects in those sectors. If the government funds projects on the margin (as it should under an optimal subsidy regime) and industries only differ in terms of the level of appropriability, then private funding and subsidized project performance are positively correlated. Conversely, if industries only differ in terms of the level of capital constraints, this correlation is negative. Our principal empirical result is that project-level performance is highest for those technologies that are in industrial segments that attract high rates of venture capital investment. This result suggests that industrial sectors differ in the degree of appropriability for research-oriented small businesses and that variation in the appropriability regime helps explain the concentrated nature of venture capital activity in the economy. ...|$|E

Among the first such systems, the UK's Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) from 1986 is now the Research Excellence Framework (REF). Highly-institutionalized, it holds research(ers) accountable. While studies describe the effects at different levels, this longitudinal analysis examines the gradual institutionalization and (un) intended consequences from 1986 to 2014. First, we analyze historically RAE/REF's rational, formalization, standardization, and transparency, framing it as a strong research evaluation system.

50|$|Following the {{founding}} of the People's Republic, government and education leaders strove to develop library services and make them available throughout the country. The National Book Coordination Act of 1957 authorized the establishment of two national library centers, one in Beijing (National Library of China) and the other in Shanghai (Shanghai Library), and nine regional library networks. Even so, libraries still were scarce, and those facilities that were available were cramped and offered only rudimentary services. Seeing the lack of libraries as a major impediment to modernization efforts, government leaders in the early 1980s took special interest in the development of library services. The special <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> and talent began to produce significant results. More than forty Chinese institutions of higher learning also had established library science or information science departments.

We analyse newly collected data from over 100, 000 public procurement contracts to develop objective corruption risk indicators and link them to agency-level data of the public sector. Propensity score matching estimations suggest that EU funds increase corruption risks by up to 34 %. The negative effects are largely attributable to overly formalistic compliance and EU Funds overriding domestic accountability mechanisms in public organisations entirely dependent on external funds.

However, there is very limited evidence about effective community-based interventions to support positive outcomes. In this paper, we review the empirical and theoretical evidence and propose a conceptual framework to guide longer term community-based interventions, modified from an already developed multidimensional framework for refugee integration. We demonstrate its relevance, with some adjustments, through alignment with the disaster literature, particularly as it relates to {{children and young people}}. We also pilot the framework by applying it to an analysis of the services and initiatives delivered to support children and young people following the 2009 Victorian bushfires in Australia. The results suggested a <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> on individually oriented, mental health programmes targeting secondary school-aged students. This may indicate under-resourcing of initiatives for younger children. There also appeared to be very limited inclusion of programmes aiming to re-establish a sense of safety and stability. Despite recognition of the important role of schools in supporting children and young people post-disaster, the analysis of initiatives indicated there was limited external funding support for school-based programmes. There were promising indications of programmes providing opportunities for children and young people to develop citizenship in the post-disaster recovery context, and scope for this to be extended to preparedness and response roles...|$|E
40|$|Many science systems {{witness the}} rise of {{excellence}} policies, funding instruments that selectively support high-performing and high-potential individuals or organizations, {{in order to increase}} differentiation. Scholars have expressed a number of concerns argueing that excellence policies may create a system where the ‘winner takes all’, that the focus on competition may hinder cooperation, or that the quality of education and broader impact recede into the background. To date, the systematic understanding of the effects of excellence policies on scientific practices is limited. The aim {{of this paper is to}} fill this knowledge gap by analyzing the interplay between excellence funding and academic research practices in The Netherlands. To this end we undertake three empirical endeavors.

40|$|The {{debate over}} the EU budget 2007 - 2013 made clear the need of an {{in-depth}} understanding {{of the distribution of}} the EU development funds. The scarce resources available need to be targeted more effectively towards the real needs of EU countries and regions in order to deliver the expected benefits. The literature on the impact <b>of</b> structural <b>funds</b> expenditure on regional growth and cohesion highlighted the reduced long-term impact <b>of</b> structural <b>funds</b> expenditure. One <b>of</b> the reasons for such result was identified in the biased allocation <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> among the different development axes. In this paper we assume a different perspective and focus the spatial structure of the expenditure for the Eu development policies under the 2000 - 2006 budget. For this purpose we collect a specific dataset for the EU- 15 regions, including not only structural funds (as in the existing literature) but also rural development funds under the CAP. This extended dataset allows us to assess the spatial structure of a significant percentage <b>of</b> the total <b>funds</b> targeted towards regional development. On the basis such dataset we are able: a) to analyse the spatial <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> structural expenditure as an important prerequisite for its effectiveness. A low degree <b>of</b> spatial <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>funds</b> may support the hypothesis of a distribution based on political equilibrium rather than effectiveness. In addition {{we will be able to}} test the spatial association of rural and regional development funds which are rarely analysed jointly thus shedding some light on the spatial coherence of the expenditure for different policies; b) to compare the spatial <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>funds</b> with a specifically developed indicator of socio-economic disadvantage of the EU regions. This analysis will allow us to analyse the coherence of the EU regional policies with regard to the structural disadvantage of EU regions thus uncovering a potential inconsistency between policy objectives (favouring disadvantaged areas) and the beneficiaries <b>of</b> the <b>funds.</b> The paper shows that although there a certain degree of spatial association between structural and rural development expenditure the factors of socio-economic disadvantage are more spatially concentrated than the funds aimed at addressing such disadvantage. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the sub-national impact of foreign aid on civil conflicts by asking the question: How does foreign aid committed to contested areas affect the intensity of violence in those areas? The main theoretical contribution {{is to focus on}} how aid influences warring parties’ decisions to engage in contests over territorial control and how that in turn influences violence intensity. The study introduces two concepts: funding concentration and barriers to exploiting aid. A contested area has greater <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> if warring parties expect a high value of aid to be distributed to only a few locations. Funding is instead diffused if the parties expect aid to be spread over many locations. A low barrier to exploiting aid is present if it is of a type that both state and non-state actors could potentially misuse. There is a high barrier if territorial control is required in order to exploit funding channels. The theory introduces three testable implications: First, greater funding concentration encourages conventional contests over territorial control, which increases military fatalities. The second proposal is {{that if there is a}} low barrier to exploiting aid (e. g. humanitarian and food aid) then there will be increased competition between warring parties and civilians, and hence more civilian fatalities. Third, high barrier funding (e. g. education aid) will motivate contests over territorial control and increase military fatalities. This dissertation uses geo-coded aid commitments data and introduces data of warring parties’ battleground control in sub-Saharan Africa, 1989 – 2008. The research design relies on propensity score matching where pairs of observations are matched based on a range of covariates. The results concerning barriers to exploitation are partially supported. High barrier aid increases military fatalities whereas low barrier aid has little impact on violence. Greater funding concentration increases military fatalities substantially compared to if there is low or no funding concentration. In line with theory, greater funding concentration does not increase civilian fatalities...|$|E
40|$|Beginning with 1 January 2007 a new {{programming}} {{period of the}} European Structural Funds {{is going to start}} (2007 - 2013). The negotiations about the contents and the re-gional structure of the funds are still in progress, but the European Commission has al-ready published her thoughts in the Third Cohesion Report and in some draft regulations (KOM 2004 / 492; KOM 2004 / 493; KOM 2004 / 494; KOM 2004 / 495). Main elements of the Commission’s proposal are the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> for the least developed regions and Member States, the thematic concentration on the strategies of Lisbon and Gothenburg as well as institutional capacity building (KOM 2004 : XXXVI). The Commission is willing to introduce a new priority (‘Regional Competitiveness and Employment’) as a successor of Objective 2 to strengthen the regional competitiveness and the employment. The new priority is following the Lisbon Strategy and therefore mainly promoting innovation and the knowledge society (ERDMENGER; ZIEGLER 2004 : 327). Besides the textual change of the funding the Commission’s proposal is making clear, that the evaluation of structural funding is – as {{it has been in the}} past programming pe-riods – a necessary condition to achieve the quality standards of funding. This means that ex-ante-, mid-term- as well as ex-post-Evaluations remain obligatory (KOM 2004 : XXXVII). At present a complete and consistent evaluation of the funding-effects can not necessar-ily take place, because of a lack of statistical information on the regional level as well as difficulties in comparing the regions’ funding achievements (z. B. TOEPEL 2000 : 400; BEYWL; TAUT 2000 : 359). These problems are especially true for the evaluation of innova-tion related actions, because the general problems are accumulated with problems of the measurability of innovation (PERRIN 2000 : 5 ff; DIEZ 2001 : 912 ff; AUTIO 1998 : 132). If the plans of the commission happen to turn into law on 1 January 2007, the importance of Innovation related actions will increase as well as the political requirement to measure and value their effects. The goal of this paper is to contribute to an alternative concept to evaluate innovation related actions under the EU Structural Funds. Main differences between the present evaluation concept and the paper’s proposal point to problems, which were identified by two case studies of existing evaluations of innovation related actions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen a number of {{transnational}} governance instruments aiming for excellence and innovation in research. This thesis examines three instruments adopted by several OECD countries: Centres of Excellence (CoEs), Centres of Excellence in Innovation and Research (CoEIRs), and third mission legislation. Reasoning primarily from institutional theory the thesis investigates how these instruments are translated and adapted to the public research systems of Norway and Sweden, and how {{and to what extent}} they affect university researchers’ identities and practices. The thesis applies a multilevel analysis and a qualitative research design using documents studies and interviews. The thesis shows that although policy aims and rhetoric have been the same in both countries, the instruments have had different impacts on the respective researchers. These differences are traced to the means and the goals of the instruments, the composition and design of the public research systems, and institutions conditioning the researchers’ environment. One general finding is that the third mission legislation has had little impact on researchers’ identity and practices as it affords researchers room for their own interpretation of the legislation's content and what it means for them. Another finding is that centre schemes have the propensity to intertwine with researchers’ identity and practices by imposing new ways of organising research, albeit under certain conditions. The thesis shows that the high level of block funding of the universities combined with a segmentation of research practices between the university and the research institute sector in Norway, has contributed to the legitimisation of the centres in the universities. By having the goal of excellence which complies with academic norms and values, the centre schemes legitimise a <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> on the best research group – an otherwise highly contested action in a research system characterised by equality in the distribution of funds. The schemes furthermore provide the opportunity to cross organisational and institutional boundaries. Similarly, the centre scheme with the goals of excellence and innovation offers the opportunity to bridge the logics of innovation and excellence and therefore legitimise practices associated with innovation. The Swedish public research system is characterised by competitive funding and a relatively small research institute sector. The centre schemes have a relatively limited role in inducing collaboration across organisational and institutional boundaries. Rather, they compete with other grants for the researchers’ attention, which seems to impede the institutionalisation process. Other factors also explain the perceived variance in the impact of the centre schemes on researchers’ identities and practice. These are, inter alia, the identity and the maturity of the academic field, the ripeness {{of the relationship between the}} university researchers and the industrial/public partners, and researchers’ job descriptions. Taking all factors together, the thesis demonstrates that the adoption of transnational governance instruments does not necessarily lead to convergence between national research systems; the instruments may rather strengthen the national characteristics. Furthermore, the thesis illustrates the importance of examining governance instruments on both the micro and the macro level in order to obtain a holistic picture of factors that enhance or impede the institutionalisation process. Concerning policy implications, the findings of the thesis underline the need for developing governance instruments that embed flexibility in terms of their adaptation to the institutional complexity inherent in the university and in national public research...|$|E

We show that pumping is particularly pronounced among the best- and worst-performing funds and that document a distinctive increase in this activity during the period 1997 - 2001.

The <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>funding</b> on the less developed regions, and on energy saving, innovation and social inclusion in the more developed regions receiving support, could be a fruitful mix for lifting the standards of living in the whole of Europe...|$|R

This paper reviews macroeconomic aspects of pension reforms in Latin America, focusing on financial market stability and fiscal sustainability. <b>Concentration</b> <b>of</b> pension <b>fund</b> portfolios in government bonds remains high, and the lack of new investment alternatives has distorted asset prices. Countries have gradually liberalized investments abroad, but remain wary of the impact on foreign currency markets. The fiscal costs of the transition to funded systems have been higher than expected, and have contributed to high debt levels. The paper highlights the importance of coordinating changes in portfolio limits with debt management policies and measures to develop securities markets...|$|R
40|$|We analyze a model where investors (e. g., hedge funds) need {{to borrow}} from lenders with {{heterogeneous}} risk-exposures and risk-management motives. Investors may obtain advantageous terms of borrowing by disclosing their investment strategy, thereby revealing its correlation to the lender's existing risk exposure. Investors risk being "front-run" by their lender if they disclose, however. We show that {{in the presence of}} front-running, the "unraveling" result of full disclosure may not hold. In addition, disclosure regulation results in a loss of welfare since investors compelled to disclose will mitigate front-running by choosing a lender with sufficiently high correlation, thus exacerbating <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> risk.

40|$|We {{construct}} a new measure that tightens {{the link between}} stock return patterns around quarter-ends and the likelihood that these patterns result from mutual fund portfolio pumping. Both the level and the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>fund</b> ownership explain temporary stock price increases {{at the end of}} the quarter. We show that pumping is particularly pronounced among the best- and worst-performing funds and document a distinctive increase in this activity during the 1997 – 2001 period. The sharp decrease in portfolio pumping after 2001 is most likely due to academic and media attention that spawned investor activism and SEC enforcement actions. These changes in regulatory attention and scrutiny markedly affected the behavior <b>of</b> mutual <b>fund</b> managers. JEL Classifications: G 23, G 28, K 22 Purchasing stocks already held for the purpose of driving up quarter-end portfolio values, a practice known as “portfolio pumping”, “marking the close”, “high closing”, “painting the tape ” or “leaning for the tape”, has attracted recent attention from regulators, consumer advocates, and the media, and is the focus of empirical studies (Carhart, Kaniel, Musto and Reed, 2002; Bernhardt and Davies, 2005) as well as theoretical modeling (Bhattacharyya and Nanda, 2006; Bernhardt...|$|R
