40|$|Abstract: Roosting Spix’s disk-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, use disks {{on their}} wrists and ankles {{to cling to}} smooth leaves. In 584 trials we tested the ability of 31 T. tricolor and 121 other bats lacking disks (461 trials with 18 species from three families) to adhere to (i) medium-grade sandpaper, (ii) Lexan polycarbonate, (iii) solid sheet alumi-num, and (iv) porous sheet aluminum. While T. tricolor readily adhered to smooth {{surfaces}}, the other species did not. Thyroptera tricolor did not show the same ability to adhere to rough surfaces as the other species that were tested. As was demonstrated by their performance on porous aluminum and sandpaper, the disks of T. tricolor worked by suction and sometimes by wet adhesion. In the course of adapting to adhere to smooth surfaces, T. tricolor appear to have lost some ability to roost on rough ones, although one adult T. tricolor climbed on a screen covering the inside walls of the polycarbonate cage by interlocking its thumb claws with the surface.

40|$|L'OBJECTIF FINAL DE CETTE ETUDE EST DE DETERMINER ET DE LOCALISER DES REGIONS CHROMOSOMIQUES IMPLIQUEES DANS LA DIRECTION ET/OU LE DEGRE DE LATERALITE MANUELLE CHEZ L'HUMAIN. DEUX PARTIES LA CONSTITUENT : LA PREMIERE CONSISTE A AFFINER LA DESCRIPTION ET LA MESURE DU PHENOTYPE DE LA LATERALITE, LA SECONDE EST UNE ETUDE GENETIQUE DE LA LATERALITE. DANS LA PREMIERE PARTIE, UNE ETUDE SUR LA MESURE DE LA LATERALITE EST MENEE AVEC 262 PARTICIPANTS (159 SE DECLARANT DROITIERS, 78 GAUCHERS ET 25 AMBIDEXTRES).

5000|$|After I.A. Smith's {{unexpected}} {{death in}} an automobile accident in 1958, he was succeeded by his brother W. Wallace Smith, the third son of Smith III to become the church's Prophet-President. Soon after coming into office, W.W. Smith appointed Graceland College professor Roy <b>Cheville</b> to be Presiding Patriarch of the church. The office had previously been held within the Smith family according to a principle of lineal succession.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cheville</b> {{was called}} {{to the office of}} Presiding Patriarch in the RLDS Church in 1958 by W. Wallace Smith and {{was the first person to}} serve in that office who was not a direct {{descendant}} of Joseph Smith In that role, he presided over the Order of Evangelists, which had 89 members at that time. He authored more than 345 articles, 20 pamphlets and 25 books on Christian family life, spirituality, church history, theology, scriptures, and other religious topics. He was an authority on the subject of religious socialization, but his position at Graceland University and later as Presiding Patriarch provided him with a platform from which he could be heard on a wide variety of subjects. His 1962 text “Did the Light Go Out?” represented a turn away from the traditional RLDS viewpoint regarding the great apostasy. He wrote numerous hymn texts published in Hymns of the Saints and prior hymnals, including “Afar in Old Judea” and had a reputation as a vigorous song leader and a self-styled humorist. The <b>Cheville</b> Chapel at Graceland University is named in his honor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the major}} {{denominations}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, {{the role of}} the Presiding Patriarch diminished substantially after the death of Hyrum Smith. Today, the Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), ordains a Presiding Evangelist who plays an important role as a world church leader, but it is not required that the person be a descendant of Joseph Smith's family. That tradition was discontinued in 1958 when RLDS Prophet-Presidents W. Wallace Smith, a grandson of Joseph Smith, presented Roy <b>Cheville</b> as a successor to Elbert A. Smith. Unlike Elbert A. Smith, <b>Cheville</b> was not a descendant of Joseph Smith, Sr. Prior to 1984 Presiding Patriarch and Presiding Evangelist were used interchangeably for the one presiding over the Order of Evangelists. In 1984, the Community of Christ dropped its use of the name Presiding Evangelist for this role, along with the change of name of the local office from Evangelist-Patriarch to simply Evangelist. The current Presiding Evangelist of the Community of Christ is David R. Brock.|$|R

60|$|The conjurer juggles {{with two}} oranges, and our {{pleasure}} in beholding him springs from this, that neither is {{for an instant}} overlooked or sacrificed. So with the writer. His pattern, which is to please the supersensual ear, is yet addressed, throughout and first of all, {{to the demands of}} logic. Whatever be the obscurities, whatever the intricacies of the argument, the neatness of the fabric must not suffer, or the artist has been proved unequal to his design. And, on the other hand, no form of words must be selected, no knot must be tied among the phrases, unless knot and word be precisely what is wanted to forward and illuminate the argument; for to fail in this is to swindle in the game. The genius of prose rejects the <b>cheville</b> no less emphatically than the laws of verse; and the <b>cheville,</b> I should perhaps explain to some of my readers, is any meaningless or very watered phrase employed to strike a balance in the sound. Pattern and argument live in each other; and it is by the brevity, clearness, charm, or emphasis of the second, that we judge the strength and fitness of the first.|$|R
