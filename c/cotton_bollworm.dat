5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest.

25|$|Historically, in North America, one of {{the most}} {{economically}} destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil. Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as <b>cotton</b> <b>bollworm</b> and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.|$|E
30|$|Combined {{releases}} of parasitoids and predators {{were found to}} be effective in managing pests of several crops. Adnan-Babi and Pintureau (2002) observed that Trichogramma principium Sugonyaeu and Sorokina and Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) could be successfully released together for management of <b>cotton</b> <b>bollworms</b> in Syria. Combined {{releases of}} Trichogramma sp. and C. carnea against Heliothis spp. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on cotton were made in the USA (Ridgway et al. 1973).

50|$|The larvae of many {{lepidopteran}} {{species are}} major pests in agriculture. Some {{of the major}} pests include Tortricidae, Noctuidae, and Pyralidae. The larvae of the Noctuidae genus Spodoptera (armyworms), Helicoverpa (corn earworm), or Pieris brassicae can cause extensive damage to certain crops. Helicoverpa zea larvae (<b>cotton</b> <b>bollworms</b> or tomato fruitworms) are polyphagous, meaning they eat a variety of crops, including tomatoes and cotton.|$|R
25|$|Caterpillars cause much damage, {{mainly by}} eating leaves.

Bacterial toxins such as those from Bacillus thuringiensis which are evolved to affect the gut of Lepidoptera have been used in sprays of bacterial spores, toxin extracts and also by incorporating genes to produce them within the host plants. These approaches are defeated over time by the evolution of resistance mechanisms in the insects.|$|E

40|$|Lepidopteran bollworms {{are a major}} {{constraint}} {{to increased}} and sustainable production of cotton in the savanna ecology of Ghana. Studies were conducted at the Experimental Farms of the University for Development Studies, Nyankpala in northern Ghana, during the 2009 cropping season to evaluate the effects of three commonly used insecticide formulations, namely, Betsulfan and Endosulfan (each at 3. 2, 3. 5 and 3. 9 l ha- 1), and Thionex (at 2. 3, 2. 5 and 2. 8 l ha- 1), on the population density and damage incidence of the bollworm complex, and their effects on the yield of cotton. The incidence and abundance of bollworms were significantly (P < 0. 05) affected by the different insecticide treatments. Bollworm infestation in all treated plots was significantly reduced. Among the insecticide treatments, Thionex at 2. 8 l ha- 1 was the most effective. This was followed by that of Betsulfan at 3. 9 l ha- 1, Betsulfan or Endosulfan (each at 3. 2 l ha- 1) recorded the highest infestation. Lint seed yield of cotton also increased significantly with increased concentrations of the insecticides, Thionex at 2. 8 l ha- 1 and Betsulfan at 3. 2 l ha- 1 recorded the highest and lowest yields, respectively.

50|$|Strains of the {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis produce over 200 different Bt toxins, each harmful to different insects. Most notably, Bt toxins are insecticidal to the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, <b>cotton</b> <b>bollworms</b> and ghtu flies but are harmless to {{other forms of}} life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton as a transgene, causing it to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the genetically modified cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.|$|R

In the present study, we isolated two insecticidal peptides, µ/ω-TRTX-Mb 1 a and -Mb 1 b, from venom of the African tarantula Monocentropus balfouri. Recombinant µ/ω-TRTX-Mb 1 a and -Mb 1 b paralyzed both Lucilia cuprina (Australian sheep blowfly) and Musca domestica (housefly), but neither peptide affected larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (<b>cotton</b> <b>bollworms).</b> Both peptides inhibited currents mediated by voltage-gated sodium (Na) and calcium channels in Periplaneta americana (American cockroach) dorsal unpaired median neurons, and they also inhibited the cloned Blattella germanica (German cockroach) Na channel (BgNa 1).
