By isotopically labeling plasma and tissue proteins valuable information concerning the turnover, transport, and equilibria of these proteins under normal basic conditions has been obtained.

The protein metabolic status of a group of normal dogs was modified by varying the protein content of the diet from 0 to 6 gm. of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Carbon- 14 - 1 abeled homologous plasma proteins were then injected intravenously. The daily plasma protein turnover rate in these animals was accelerated from 0. 65 to 1. 00 gm. per kilogram by increasing the oral protein intake from 0 to 2. 0 gin.

The Flux Of Nutrient And Sediment From Two Input Streams (Beriah Kanan And Beriah Kiri) Were Compared With The Output (Beriah). A Fortnightly And An Intensive Hourly Sampling On The 10 - 11 th October 1998 For 48 Hours, During High Water Conditions Were Carried Out.

40|$|In vitro and in vivo {{studies were}} made on the sputum of chronic bronchitics using a Ferranti-Shirley cone and plate {{viscometer}} and a new stress relaxation method. The latter utilized a modified <b>chemical</b> <b>balance</b> and permitted <b>study</b> at very low shear rates.

Significant reduction in four chosen parameters of viscosity occurred in vitro with N-acetylcysteine and with ascorbic acid-hydrogen peroxide-cupric ion complex (A. A. H.

40|$|The Mount Morgan Mine is a {{historic}} mine site located in Central Queensland, Australia which has heavily impacted portions of the adjacent Dee River. As part of overall closure planning a <b>chemical</b> load <b>balance</b> <b>study</b> was performed for the Mt. Morgan mine site. The contaminants of concern (COC) included in this analysis are sulphate (SO 4), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). The load balance model was developed based on detailed groundwater quality monitoring at the site (since 2003) and used groundwater flow estimates obtained from a 3 D groundwater flow model calibrated for the site. The analysis indicates that seepage from the flooded Open Cut/Sandstone Gully represents the single largest source of contaminants on the site exceeding all other contaminant sources {{by a wide margin}} (except for the Lower Mundic Waste, which contributes the highest iron loading). Seepage from the Western Dump and Shepherds Dump represent other dominant sources of contaminant loads, in particular with respect to sulphate, aluminum, and copper. The load balance further suggests that the Mundic West and Frog Hollow sumps intercept nearly 90 % of the contaminant load that is generated by the Open Cut/Sandstone Gully and downstream waste units. Seepage interception is less efficient in the Shepherd’s catchment, where the interception system removes only 20 - 40 % of the contaminant load supplied by seepage from the Shepherd’s Tailings Dam and the Shepherd’s Outer Dump. The load <b>balance</b> <b>study</b> also identified several data gaps which resulted in the installation of additional monitoring wells on site and along the Dee River. This new monitoring data is currently being used to refine the load balance model for the site and to assess the contaminant loading to the upper Dee River.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{difficult}} to weigh the light objects by weighing balance accurately when measured individually. If several light objects are weighed in groups rather than individually then the precision of the estimates increases quite considerably. There {{are two types of}} <b>balances</b> one is <b>chemical</b> <b>balance</b> and other is spring balance. Spring balance is similar when only one pan of <b>chemical</b> <b>balance</b> is used for weighing. Accordingly, design used for weighing is called <b>chemical</b> <b>balance</b> (two pans) weighing design and spring balance (one pan) weighing design. Constructions of some optimal weighing designs, which minimize the variance of the estimated weight, using Hadamard matrices, balanced incomplete block designs and other methods are discussed under different situations...|$|R
40|$|Ductile {{shear zone}} hosted mesothermal gold {{mineralization}} of the Okote area {{is located in}} southern Ethiopia. Three N-S striking ductile shear zones, with different intensity of shearing and hydrothermal alteration, cut the mafic rocks. The gold-mineralized parts of these shear zones reveal zonings: slightly altered but not sheared protolith at shear boundaries, transitional zone, and mylonite zones. Auriferous quartz-carbonate-tourmaline veins occur mainly in the mylonite zone. The ore minerals of the veins and their wall rocks are pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, gold, and accessory chalcocite, covellite, galena, and melonite (NiTe 2). The textural relationships among minerals in these alteration zones indicate that epidote, ferroamphiboles, and magnetite were formed first, followed by chlorite, ankerite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite I, and K-feldspar, and, finally, calcite, chlorite, biotite, tourmaline, gold, and galena. Primary fluid inclusion data from aurifer-ous type 2 quartz veins (qv 2) indicate aqueous-carbonic inclusions with low salinity (< 6. 59 wt % NaCl equivalent), 0. 38 to 0. 90 g/cm 3 in density that homogenized at 218 °C to 345 °C. Most of the inclusions decrepitate at 220 °C to 388 °C before or immediately after homogenization. Chlorite geothermometry gives temperatures of formation that range from 230 °C to 410 °C with modes at 250 °C and 380 °C, in good agreement with fluid inclusion data. <b>Chemical</b> mass <b>balance</b> <b>studies,</b> using samples from meta-gabbro and alteration products, reveal addition of K 2 O, P 2 O 5, volatile, Ba, Sr, V, and Cu into wall rock and loss of MgO, CaO, and SiO 2 from the wall rock to the veins accompanying gold mineralization.

40|$|International audienceA {{study to}} {{characterize}} {{primary particulate matter}} (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) from the French vehicular fleet was conducted during winter 2008, in a tunnel in Marseille, France. The carbonaceous fraction represents 70 % of the aerosol mass and elemental carbon fraction (EC) represent 60 % of the carbonaceous fraction. The organic carbon OC was characterized in term of its water soluble fraction, functionalization rate and HULIS content. Seventy trace organic compounds including alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), petroleum biomarkers and carboxylic acids were also quantified, {{in order to determine}} an organic emission profile for <b>chemical</b> mass <b>balance</b> modeling <b>studies.</b> Such source profiles were still missing in Europe and particularly in France. The profile obtained in this study is consistent with profiles determined in tunnel or dynamometer studies performed in other countries during the last ten years.

The chemical profile determined here is very similar to those obtained for diesel emissions with high concentrations of EC relative to OC (EC/OC = 1. 8) and low concentrations of the higher molecular weight PAH. These results are consistent with the high proportion of diesel vehicles in the French fleet (49 %) ...|$|R
