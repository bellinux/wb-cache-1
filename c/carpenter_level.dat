50|$|The modern {{electronic}} tiltmeter, {{which is}} slowly replacing all {{other forms of}} tiltmeter, uses a simple bubble level principle, as used in the common <b>carpenter</b> <b>level.</b> As shown in the figure, an arrangement of electrodes senses the exact position of the bubble in the electrolytic solution, to {{a high degree of}} precision. Any small changes in the level are recorded using a standard datalogger. This arrangement is quite insensitive to temperature, and can be fully compensated, using built-in thermal electronics.|$|E
40|$|Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms (OCS) and Disorder (OCD) occur {{frequently}} {{in patients with}} schizophrenia. Nevertheless the impact of OCS/OCD on clinical characteristics and outcome of schizophrenia remains controversial. The aim {{of the present study}} is to examine the effect of obsessive-compulsive dimension on symptom expression and functioning in schizophrenia. Sixty patients affected by schizophrenia completed the SCID-IV, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale and the Strauss and <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Level</b> of Functioning Rating Scale. Obsessive-compulsive dimension was associated neither with positive or disorganization symptoms nor with negative symptoms. By contrast, it adversely affected levels of functioning, with a major impact exerted by compulsions rather than obsessions. Obsessive-compulsive dimension appears to be independent from negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia and independently decreases social functioning...|$|E

In each experiment {{the position of the}} ARID on the trolley is fixed and the manipulator extends and retracts along the Orbiter's y-axis. A sensor platform consisting of four sonars arranged in a '+' pattern measures the platform pitch about the Orbiter's y-axis (angle b) and yaw about the Orbiter's x-axis (angle alpha). Corroborating measurements of the yaw error were performed using a <b>carpenter's</b> <b>level</b> to keep the platform perpendicular to the gravity vector at each ARID pose being measured...|$|R
40|$|At {{the centre}} of this {{research}} is an ethnographic study that saw the researcher embedded within the fabric of inner city life to better understand what characteristics of user activity and interaction could be enhanced by technology. The initial research indicated that the experience of traversing the city after dark unified an otherwise divergent user group through a shared concern for personal safety. Managing this fear and danger represented an important user need. We found that mobile social networking systems are not only integral for bringing people together, they can help in the process of users safely dispersing as well. We conclude however, that {{at a time when the}} average iPhone staggers under the weight of a plethora of apps that do everything from acting as a <b>carpenter’s</b> <b>level</b> to a pregnancy predictor, we consider the potential for the functionality of a personal safety device to be embodied within a stand alone artifact...|$|R

50|$|To {{check the}} {{accuracy}} of a <b>carpenter's</b> type <b>level,</b> a perfectly horizontal surface is not needed. The level is placed on a flat and roughly level surface and the reading on the bubble tube is noted.

The spirit level is then rotated through 180 degrees in the horizontal plane, and another reading is noted. If the level is accurate, it will indicate the same orientation with respect to the horizontal plane. A difference implies that the level is inaccurate.|$|R

40|$|Madsen and Madsen in Teaching/Discipline: A {{positive}} {{approach for}} educational development have advocated {{that teachers can}} "act their way into a newwayof thinking"(1983, p. 71). This idea has been realizedin recentmusicresearchconcerningstructuring, soliciting,and reacting in music teaching (Jellison & Wolfe, 1987) and sequential patterns of musicinstruction (Price, 1987; Yarbrough, 1988, Yarbrough & Price, in press). The premise {{of this study is}} that incorporating a three-step sequence into a classroom or applied music lessonsituation may assist teachers in "acting their way into a new way of thinking" regarding their own teaching effectiveness. The earliest model of a three step teaching sequence appeared in Teaching: A course in applied psychology (Becker, Englemann, and Thomas, 1971). This text presented the idea that a great deal of time needsto be spent on academic task presentation followed by immediate and related feedbackusingpraise. The model stressesthe importance of the pattern or sequenceof teacher task presentation, student response, and teacher feedback. Recentstudies haveintroduced this approach for teaching music at the elementary level (Madsen & Madsen. 1972; Moore, 1981; Rosenthal, 1982), and in classroom or ensemblerehearsals at higher grade <b>levels</b> (<b>Carpenter,</b> 1987; Price, 1983; Yarbrough & Price. 1981).

40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that sea level variations associated with EL Niño events are a response to wind changes in the central Pacific and that the signal is transmitted to the coast of South America by packets of equatorial Kelvin waves. A linear model is forced by wind stress anomalies composited from six EL Niños occurring between 1951 and 1972 (Rasmusson and <b>Carpenter).</b> Model sea <b>level</b> is compared with similar composites of tidegage measurements from selected equatorial Pacific stations. Although several vertical modes {{are included in the}} calculation, only the two gravest baroclinic modes make significant contributions to the sea level signal. Model results duplicate the pattern and timing of the observed sea level anomalies but amplitudes are systematically low. This is especially true at central and western Pacific stations, and it is suggested that the poor quality of the forcing data may be at fault there. Results at the east provide better support for the theory: in particular, the twin-peaked signal characteristic of El Niño sea-level anomalies is reproduced. The second peak is shown to be a response to the massive collapse of the trades occurring {{in the middle of the}} El Niño year and its amplitude is correctly hindcast by the model. The first peak is a response to the weaker wind changes occurring in the boreal fall preceding El Niño; its calculated amplitude is too small. The implication of this discrepancy is that the linear Kelvin wave theory will have to be modified if it is to account for the initial El Niño warning...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess how}} {{features}} of lakes and their watersheds influence winter oxygen decay {{rates and the}} frequency of anoxia in shallow prairie lakes, we measured lake and watershed characteristics for 21 south-central Alberta lakes and related these to measured oxygen decay rates during 1998 – 2000. Oxygen decay rates were functions of macrophyte biomass, percentage littoral area, and total phosphorus and ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 216 mg O 2 m� 3 d� 1. Oxygen decay rates were � 4 times higher in shallow polymictic lakes compared to deep, stratified lakes. Within shallow lakes, those classified as turbid had decay rates � 1. 5 times higher than those classified as clear. Chlorophyll a was not a predictor of the oxygen decay rate in shallow lakes; however, macrophyte-derived carbon averaged � 150 times more than phytoplankton-derived carbon in the shallow lakes we examined. Reasons that lakes frequently or never become anoxic are related to productivity and morphometry; however, processes explaining occasional anoxia appear not to be related to factors we measured. Dissolved oxygen (O 2) is a common water quality indicator. Nutrient enrichment enhances primary production, increases O 2 depletion rates, and leads to decreased water quality (Dillon et al. 1978; Snodgrass and Ng 1985; Lind 1987; Gelda and Auer 1996). When low O 2 concentration results in anoxia, fish die. Fish kills have resulted in a need to predict anoxia to proactively manage lakes with goals of sustaining productive fisheries and maintaining ecosystem stability. Loss of a top predator has consequences to lower trophic levels; hence anoxia can affect community structure. The frequency and extent of fish kills determine the structure of fish assemblages (Tonn and Magnuson 1982; Rahel 1984) with implications to lower trophic <b>levels</b> (<b>Carpenter</b> an...|$|R
40|$|Grazing lands" {{are areas}} capable of growing grasses and other forages. They are usually lands which {{cannot be used}} for other types of {{agricultural}} practices due to factors like insufficient rainfall, temperature and (or) soil quality (Buckley et al., 1996). In the State of Hawai'i, {{more than one million}} acres of land fit into this category, and Hawai'i's cattle industry represents the largest single business use of these grazing lands (Buckley et al., 1996). In 1982 there were about 230, 000 head of cattle in the State of Hawai'i and annual revenue from beef and milk totaled approximately $ 49 million (Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, 1983). Ten years later, in 1992, total cattle numbers in the state declined to 200, 000 head, but annual revenue from beef and milk was higher than 1982, at approximately $ 61 million (Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, 1993). Current statistics indicate that total cattle numbers and revenue are lower than the past. There are about 156, 000 head of cattle in the State of Hawai'i and at the farm level, the annual revenue from beef and milk sales is approximately $ 41 million (Hawai'i Agricultural Statistics Service, 2004). Although there has been a slight decline in cash revenues, current values show that the number of cattle on Hawai'i's ranches are up 3 % from 2003 (Hawai'i Agricultural Statistics Service, 2004). Based on the statistics presented above, there is potential to increase and create a more profitable and viable grazing animal industry in Hawai'i. This potential is further emphasized by the fact that lands available for cattle production are expected to increase due to the decline in the sugarcane and pineapple industries and the potential economic environmental need to move dairies off the island of Oahu (Mathews and Carpenter, 2003). However, as in many tropical regions, the nutritional value of Hawai'i's pasture grasses and grass-derived processed feeds varies greatly, and are often imbalanced or below the desired <b>levels</b> (<b>Carpenter</b> et al., 1997; Mathews and Carpenter, 2003). As seen in other tropical regions (McDowell, 1997), inadequate concentrations of nutrients in Hawai'i's grasses or grass-derived feedstuffs may result in less than optimal animal growth, reproduction and performance. The current literature related to the nutritional value of forages in the State of Hawai'i is limited. However, the lack of adequate nutrients in tropical soils and (or) variations in forage types is often recognized as the reason for lower quality forages, which can reduce animal production and health (McDowell, 1997). Along with deficiencies in energy and protein, forages grown in tropical regions are often deficient in a number of the macro- and micro-minerals needed by the animal (McDowell, 1997). Nutritional supplements, including minerals, are often given to grazing animals. However, supplements are an added expense to the producer and may provide less than optimal animal responses. The opportunity to improve and understand the soil-plant-animal relationship, the efficiency of grass conversion to animal products, and supplementation strategies in tropical regions, especially Hawai'i, is immense (Mathews and Carpenter, 2003). Furthermore, adjusting grazing and supplementation regimes for factors like pasture (geographical) location, forage species and maturity, management practices and climate is necessary to further enhance grazing animal performance in tropical regions...|$|R
