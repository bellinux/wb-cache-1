40|$|The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{has been}} {{supplying}} enriched stable and radioactive isotopes to the research, medical, and industrial communities for over 50 years. Very significant changes {{have occurred in}} this effort {{over the past several}} years, and, while many of these changes have had a negative impact on the availability of enriched isotopes, more recent developments are actually improving the situation for both the users and the producers of enriched isotopes. ORNL is still a major producer and distributor of radioisotopes, but future isotope enrichment operations conducted at the Isotope Enrichment Facility (IEF) will be limited to stable isotopes. Among the positive changes in the enriched stable isotope area are a well-functioning, long-term contract program, which offers stability and pricing advantages; the resumption of calutron operations; the adoption of prorated <b>conversion</b> <b>charges,</b> which greatly improves the pricing of isotopes to small users; SIO 9002 registration of the IEF`s quality management system; and a much more customer-oriented business philosophy. Efforts are also being made to restore and improve upon the extensive chemical and physical form processing capabilities that once existed in the enriched stable isotope program. Innovative ideas are being pursued in both technical and administrative areas to encourage the beneficial use of enriched stable isotopes and the development of related technologies...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the extent to which the capital city of Delhi has gained financial autonomy over the years. In order to better understand its progress, the paper compares the periods before and after the submission of the Third State Finance Commission Report of Delhi. The main findings suggest there have been some efforts to reduce reliance on transfers from upper tiers of government and to strengthen ‘own revenues’ atthe Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). A greater diversification of tax and non-tax revenue sources is responsible for this improvement. In the second period, other tax sources such as corporation tax and electricity tax gained in importance.  Non-tax revenues were also strengthened by higher collection of certain components such as <b>conversion</b> <b>charges.</b> However, own revenues have been inadequate to meet growing expenditure requirements, resulting in high revenue expenditure gaps. Further, the growth in Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP has not led to a rise in own revenues for MCD. Rather, the paper finds that higher GSDP and its tertiary sector components are associated with higher expenditures in MCD. As far as local revenues are concerned, higher GSDP is associated with higher transfers, but has no discernible impact on own revenues.  </p...|$|E

The porous film which is probably NiOOH can grow to thicknesses in excess of 1000 A. It is reduced to a lower oxidation state during galvano-static reduction, giving a distinct cathodic potential arrest.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a sample-and-hold design {{that is based}} on a switched-op-amp topology. Charge injection errors are greatly reduced by turning off transistors in the saturation region instead of the triode region as is the case for traditional MOS switches. The remaining clock feedthrough error is mostly signal-independent and is cancelled out by a pseudodifferential topology. Switched-op-amps are designed and fabricated in a 2 -µ CMOS technology. The measurement results show that the harmonics are at least 78 dB below the signal level. Both the measurement results from fabricated IC’s and simulation results suggest the potential benefits of this approach in comparison to traditional switched-capacitor circuits.
