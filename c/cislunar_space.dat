40|$|Since July 1967, {{knowledge}} {{concerning the}} distributions of picogram size particulate matter in selenocentric space has been {{obtained from the}} Lunar Explorer 35 dust particle experiment. For almost 40 % of the time, the mean sporadic cumulative flux is quite similar to the flux in interplanetary space. However, there are fluctuations of {{an order of magnitude}} during major meteor showers. The coincident increase of the flux in selenocentric space during the shower periods has been observed for the fourth year. The 100 -picogram sensor does not show an increase during shower times, indicating a mass threshold of less than 100 picograms for particles with velocities equal to or greater than lunar escape velocity. The flux values from Lunar Explorer 35 are compared to other long-lifetime measurements in selenocentric, <b>cislunar</b> and interplanetary <b>space</b> with excellent agreement for masses less than one nanogram...|$|R

40|$|Initial {{results from}} the {{measurement}} conducted by the dust particle experiment on the lunar orbiting satellite Lunar Explorer 35 (LE 35) were reported with the data interpreted as indicating that the moon is {{a significant source of}} micrometeroids. Primary sporadic and stream meteoroids impacting the surface of the moon at hypervelocity was proposed as the source of micron and submicron particles that leave the lunar craters with velocities sufficient to escape the moon's gravitational sphere of influence. No enhanced flux of lunar ejecta with masses greater than a nanogram was detected by LE 35 or the Lunar Orbiters. Hypervelocity meteoroid simulation experiments concentrating on ejecta production combined with extensive analyses of the orbital dynamics of micron and submicron lunar ejecta in selenocentric, <b>cislunar,</b> and geocentric <b>space</b> have shown that a pulse of these lunar ejecta, with a time correlation relative to the position of the moon relative to the earth, intercepts the earth's magnetopause surface (EMPs). As shown, a strong reason exists for expecting a significant enhancement of submicron dust particles in the region of the magnetosphere between L values of 1. 2 and 3. 0. This is the basis for the proposal of a series of experiments to investigate the enhancement or even trapping of submicron lunar ejecta in this region. The subsequent interaction of this mass with the upper-lower atmosphere of the earth and possible geophysical effects can then be studied...|$|R
40|$|Mars has fascinated people {{since the}} first viewing through a {{telescope}} by Galileo Galilei in 1609. Since 1971 unmanned space crafts have been successfully sent to Mars, but only since 2012 the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity is sending breath-taking images that let us think we know exactly how Mars looks like. The next natural step is to send humans to Mars. For this up to 1100 days long journey some steps in between are necessary to gain enough understanding and knowledge. NASA´s “Earth Reliant” exploration is focused on research aboard the International Space Station which includes human health and behavioural research, extravehicular operations and 3 -D printing. The focus lays there in long-term missions of a year and longer. In the “Proving Ground”, NASA plans complex operations in a deep <b>space,</b> <b>cislunar</b> environment that allows crews to return to Earth {{in a matter of}} days. NASA will send a robotic mission to capture and redirect an asteroid to orbit the moon. Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will explore the asteroid and return with samples in the mid- 2020 s. ESA regards the moon as the next logical destination for humans beyond low Earth orbit. Utilizing Earth's nearest neighbour should pave the way for human missions to Mars. The landing on Mars surface is planned for 2035 +. There are several risk factors for the astronauts going along which such a long mission. First of all space radiation is a major concern, because the crew may be exposed to high-energy particles, including infrequent, but potentially deadly, solar particle events and constant exposure to galactic cosmic rays. These high-energy particles can increase cancer risk and change the immune system. The different gravity fields is a challenge for the astronaut as he lives in microgravity for many months and landing on Mars with 1 / 3 of the earth´s gravity, which may lead to cardiovascular deconditioning and trauma. Microgravity itself normally increases the risks of bone loss density and muscular atrophy. The isolation and small crew (which not the astronaut but space agencies will decide on) will cause psychological problems that researches explore in long isolation studies around the world in different habitats. Also the communication delay of up to 20 minutes can create problems especially in difficult and unforeseen situations or medical problems where the support of the ground team is very important. The Visual Impairment and Intracranial Pressure Syndrome affects more than half of long term mission astronauts. Besides changes as e. g. optic disc edema, choroidal folds and a flattening of the eyeball it often also reduce the vision. For the time being we do not know the cause and we do also not know how impacted the vision may become. What will the vision be at the arrival on Mars? To address these increased risks, new diagnostic and treatment tools, as well as countermeasures must be developed to maintain crew health...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{challenges}} for NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite {{was to find a}} stable orbit in <b>cislunar</b> <b>space,</b> a region from outside the Earth's atmosphere to just beyond the Moon's orbit. The orbit in which the satellite was originally set could only be reliably predicted for about 3 years. Within <b>cislunar</b> <b>space</b> small changes in initial conditions could lead to very different trajectories years later. Because IBEX's original orbit was often closer to the Moon than the Earth, it was regularly performing gravity assists. The uncertainties in the initial orbit conditions would cause nearly identical trajectory predictions to eventually experience different gravity assist geometries, and the slightest change in that geometry during the encounter would cause huge differences in the subsequent satellite trajectory. Some predictions would hit the Earth and others would escape the Earth-Moon system. The new orbit keeps the apogee away from the Moon, reducing its sensitivity to gravity assists. IBEX can now predict this trajectory well beyond 11 years, allowing the satellite to easily observe the Sun's full solar cycle.|$|E
50|$|The US Department of Energy has {{conducted}} seawater tests {{and determined that}} the graphite casing, {{which was designed to}} withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur.

5000|$|On October 8, 2015, NASA {{published}} {{its official}} plan for human exploration and colonization of Mars.

50|$|Pioneer 2 was {{the last}} of the three project Able space probes {{designed}} to probe lunar and <b>cislunar</b> <b>space.</b> Launch took place at 07:30:00 UTC on November 8, 1958. After Pioneer 1 had failed due to guidance system deficiencies, the guidance system was modified with a Doppler command system to ensure more accurate commands and minimize trajectory errors. Once again, the first and second stage portion of the flight was uneventful, but the third stage of the launch vehicle failed to ignite, making it impossible for Pioneer 2 to achieve orbital velocity. An attempt to fire the vernier engines on the probe was unsuccessful and the spacecraft attained a maximum altitude of 1550 km before reentering Earth's atmosphere at 28.7 N, 1.9 E over NW Africa. A small amount of data was obtained during the short flight, including evidence that the equatorial region around Earth has higher flux and higher energy radiation than previously considered and that the micrometeorite density is higher around Earth than in space. The reason for the third stage failure was unclear, but it was suspected that the firing command from the second stage, which contained the guidance package for the entire launch vehicle, was never received, possibly due to damage to electrical lines during staging.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technological}} {{developments of the}} latter half of the 20th century are widely considered to have altered the public's perception of the Earth. Before space flight, the popular image of Earth was of a green world. Science fiction artist Frank R. Paul provided perhaps the first image of a cloudless blue planet (with sharply defined land masses) on the back cover of the July 1940 issue of Amazing Stories, a common depiction for several decades thereafter.Earth was first photographed from space by Explorer 6 in 1959. Yuri Gagarin became the first human to view Earth from space in 1961. The crew of the Apollo 8 was the first to view an Earth-rise from lunar orbit in 1968. In 1972 the crew of the Apollo 17 produced the famous Blue Marble photograph of the planet Earth from <b>cislunar</b> <b>space.</b> This became an iconic image of the planet as a marble of cloud-swirled blue ocean broken by green-brown continents. NASA archivist Mike Gentry has speculated that The Blue Marble is the most widely distributed image in human history. Inspired by The Blue Marble poet-diplomat Abhay K has penned an Earth Anthem describing the planet as a [...] "Cosmic Blue Pearl". A photo taken of a distant Earth by Voyager 1 in 1990 inspired Carl Sagan to describe the planet as a [...] "Pale Blue Dot." ...|$|E
5000|$|Spaceports {{have been}} {{proposed}} for locations on the Moon, Mars, orbiting the Earth, at Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon Lagrange points, and at other locations in the solar system. Human-tended outposts on the Moon or Mars, for example, will be spaceports by definition. The 2012 Space Studies Program of the International Space University studied the economic benefit {{of a network of}} spaceports throughout the solar system beginning from Earth and expanding outwardly in phases, within its team project Operations And Service Infrastructure for Space (OASIS). Its analysis claimed that the first phase, placing the [...] "Node 1" [...] spaceport with space tug services in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), would be commercially profitable and reduce transportation costs to geosynchronous orbit by as much as 44% (depending on the launch vehicle). The second phase would add a Node 2 spaceport on the lunar surface to provide services including lunar ice mining and delivery of rocket propellants back to Node 1. This would enable lunar surface activities and further reduce transportation costs within and out from <b>cislunar</b> <b>space.</b> The third phase would add a Node 3 spaceport on the Martian moon Phobos to enable refueling and resupply prior to Mars surface landings, missions beyond Mars, and return trips to Earth. In addition to propellant mining and refueling, the network of spaceports could provide services such as power storage and distribution, in-space assembly and repair of spacecraft, communications relay, shelter, construction and leasing of infrastructure, maintaining spacecraft positioned for future use, and logistics.|$|E
50|$|A {{solid core}} reactor's {{performance}} is ultimately {{limited by the}} melting point of the materials used in the reactor cores. The design needs to be constructed of materials that remain strong at as high a temperature as possible, as nuclear reactions can create much higher temperatures than most materials can typically withstand, meaning {{that much of the}} potential of the reactor for very high temperatures might not be realized. Additionally problematic, since there is no cooling medium at work (as would be found in say an Earth bound pressurized water reactor), is the cracking of fuel rod coatings due to the large temperature ranges they would experience (from 22 K up to 3000 K over the length of a 1.3 m fuel rod), and the necessity of matching coefficients of expansion in all the components of the reactor. Using hydrogen as a propellant, a solid core design would typically deliver specific impulses (Isp) on the order of 850 to 1000 seconds, which is about twice that of liquid hydrogen-oxygen designs such as the Space Shuttle main engine. Other propellants have also been proposed, such as ammonia, water or LOX, and while these propellants would provide reduced exhaust velocity (and, hence, performance) when compared to hydrogen, their generally greater availability could reduce payload costs by a very large factor, and perform adequately where the mission delta-v is not too high (such as within <b>cislunar</b> <b>space</b> or between Earth orbit and Martian orbit). Still, yet another mark in favor of hydrogen is that above about 1500 K, it begins to dissociate at low pressures, or around 3000 K at high pressures, which is a potential area of promise for increasing the Isp of solid core reactors.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this Advanced Mission Design Program is to define the general characteristics and phased evolution of a near-Earth space infrastructure. The envisioned foundation includes a permanently manned, self-sustaining base on the lunar surface, a space station at the Libration Point between earth and the moon (L 1), and a transportation system that anchors these elements to the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) station. The implementation of this conceptual design was carried out {{with the idea that}} the infrastructure is an important step in a larger plan to expand man's capabilities in space science and technology. Such expansion depends on low cost, reliable, and frequent access to space for those who wish to use the multiple benefits of this environment. The presence of a <b>cislunar</b> <b>space</b> infrastructure would greatly facilitate the staging of future planetary missions, as well as the full exploration of the lunar potential for science and industry.

40|$|Heretofore, {{discussions of}} space fuel depots assumed the depots would be {{supplied}} from Earth. However, {{the confirmation of}} deposits of water ice at the lunar poles in 2009 suggests the possibility of supplying a space depot with liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen produced from lunar ice. This architecture study sought to determine the optimum architecture for a fuel depot supplied from lunar resources. Four factors - the location of propellant processing (on the Moon or on the depot), {{the location of the}} depot (on the Moon or in <b>cislunar</b> <b>space),</b> and if in <b>cislunar</b> <b>space,</b> where (LEO, GEO, or Earth-Moon L 1), and the method of propellant transfer (bulk fuel or canister exchange) were combined to identify 18 potential architectures. Two design reference missions (DRMs) - a satellite servicing mission and a cargo mission to Mars - were used to create demand for propellants, while a third DRM - a propellant delivery mission - was used to examine supply issues.

40|$|The {{utilization}} {{of natural resources}} from asteroids is an idea that is older than the Space Age. The technologies are now available to transform this endeavour from an idea into reality. The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) is a mission concept which includes the goal of robotically returning a small Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) or a multi-ton boulder from a large NEA to <b>cislunar</b> <b>space</b> in the mid 2020 's using an advanced Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) vehicle and currently available technologies. The paradigm shift enabled by the ARM concept would allow in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) to be used at the human mission departure location (i. e., <b>cislunar</b> <b>space)</b> versus exclusively at the deep-space mission destination. This approach drastically reduces the barriers associated with utilizing ISRU for human deep-space missions. The successful testing of ISRU techniques and associated equipment could enable large-scale commercial ISRU operations to become a reality and enable a future space-based economy utilizing processed asteroidal materials. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the ARM concept and discusses the mission objectives, key technologies, and capabilities associated with the mission, as well as how the ARM and associated operations would benefit humanity's quest for the exploration and settlement of space...|$|E
40|$|Many {{interesting}} {{ideas have}} been conceived for building space-based infrastructure in <b>cislunar</b> <b>space.</b> From O'Neill's space colonies, to solar power satellite farms, and even prospecting retrieved near earth asteroids. In all the scenarios, one thing remained fixed - {{the need for}} space resources at the outpost. To satisfy this need, O'Neill suggested an electromagnetic railgun to deliver resources from the lunar surface, while NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission called for a solar electric tug to deliver asteroid materials from interplanetary space. At Made In Space, we propose an entirely new concept. One which is scalable, cost effective, and ensures that the abundant material wealth of {{the inner solar system}} becomes readily available to humankind in a nearly automated fashion. We propose the RAMA architecture, which turns asteroids into self-contained spacecraft capable of moving themselves back to <b>cislunar</b> <b>space.</b> The RAMA architecture is just as capable of transporting conventional-sized asteroids on the 10 -meter length scale as transporting asteroids 100 meters or larger, making it the most versatile asteroid retrieval architecture in terms of retrieved-mass capability. This report describes the results of the Phase I study funded by the NASA NIAC program for Made In Space to establish the concept feasibility of using space manufacturing to convert asteroids into autonomous, mechanical spacecraft. Project RAMA, Reconstituting Asteroids into Mechanical Automata, is designed to leverage the future advances of additive manufacturing (AM), in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and in-situ manufacturing (ISM) to realize enormous efficiencies in repeated asteroid redirect missions. A team of engineers at Made In Space performed the study work with consultation from the asteroid mining industry, academia, and NASA. Previous studies for asteroid retrieval have been constrained to studying only asteroids that are both large enough to be discovered, and small enough to be captured and transported using Earth-launched propulsion technology. Project RAMA is not forced into this constraint. The mission concept studied involved transporting a much larger approximately 50 -meter asteroid to <b>cislunar</b> <b>space.</b> Demonstration of transport of a 50 -meter-class asteroid has several ground-breaking advantages. First, the returned material is of an industrial, rather than just scientific, quantity (greater than 10, 000 tonnes versus approximately 10 s of tonnes). Second, the "useless" material in the asteroid is gathered and expended as part of the asteroid's propulsion system, allowing the returned asteroid to be considerably "purer" than a conventional asteroid retrieval mission. Third, the infrastructure used to convert and return the asteroid is reusable, and capable of continually returning asteroids to <b>cislunar</b> <b>space...</b>|$|E
40|$|In situ {{resource}} utilization (ISRU) in general, and asteroid mining {{in particular}} are ideas that {{have been around for}} a long time, and for good reason. It is clear that ultimately human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit will have to utilize the material resources available in space. Historically, the lack of sufficiently capable in-space transportation has been one of the key impediments to the harvesting of near-Earth asteroid resources. With the advent of high-power (or order 40 kW) solar electric propulsion systems, that impediment is being removed. High-power solar electric propulsion (SEP) would be enabling for the exploitation of asteroid resources. The design of a 40 -kW end-of-life SEP system is presented that could rendezvous with, capture, and subsequently transport a 1, 000 -metric-ton near-Earth asteroid back to <b>cislunar</b> <b>space.</b> The conceptual spacecraft design was developed by the Collaborative Modeling for Parametric Assessment of Space Systems (COMPASS) team at the Glenn Research Center in collaboration with the Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) team assembled to investigate the feasibility of an asteroid retrieval mission.
