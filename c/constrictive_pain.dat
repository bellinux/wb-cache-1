40|$|A 57 -year-old-woman was {{admitted}} to our ward for a daily tension-type headache, it was not responding to usual pharmacological treatment. Before 5 years, she had hys-terectomy and after 10 days, she had a domestic accident reporting an injury of the pelvis and the spine. Since then, she begun to suffer of muscular rigor of the neck and the shoulder girdle, daily, intense and <b>constrictive</b> <b>pain</b> local-ized in the occipital spine, not associated with vomiting, ocular symptoms, not worsened by exercise. The diagnosis of daily tension-type headache met the IHCD-II criteria. She also reported weakness of {{the upper and lower}} limbs, tingling, tremors and difficulties in walking and climbing. The patient’s medical history reported: Raynaud phenom-enon, chronic gastritis and dysphagia, hepatitis C virus infection, hyperhomocystenemia, homozygosis for MTHF...|$|E
40|$|Ref. : Ms. No. TJHP-D- 10 - 00029 R 1 A 57 years-old-woman was {{admitted}} to our ward for a daily tension-type headache, non responsive to usual pharmacological treatment. Five years ago she underwent a hysterectomy. Since then, she referred muscular rigor of the neck and the shoulder girdle, intense <b>constrictive</b> <b>pain</b> localized in the occipital spine. She also reported weakness of {{the upper and lower}} limbs, tingling, tremors and difficulties in walking and climbing. She referred widespread pain, unusually severe, above all at joints and muscles, without any sign of inflammation at clinical examination. The diagnosis of a connective tissue was excluded, remaining the diagnosis of tension-type headache in Fibromyalgia the most probable one. The patient has been treated with antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antiepileptic drugs with improvement of the symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de estudar os aspectos clínicos, a história {{familiar}} e o impacto da dor nas atividades laborativas, foi conduzido estudo de série de casos de 50 pacientes portadores de cefaléia do tipo tensional episódica (CTTE). Foram avaliados 40 mulheres e 10 homens, com idade média de 30 (± 12) anos. Dor constrictiva esteve presente em 40 pacientes (80 %). O enjôo foi o principal fenômeno acompanhante (20 %). A dor bilateral predominou; entretanto, a localização unilateral também esteve presente (10 %). Embora classicamente descrita como uma dor leve, observou-se que a CTTE pode se manifestar como crises de forte intensidade (16 %). A história familiar foi positiva em 12 pacientes (24 %). O impacto nas atividades laborativas foi detectado em 14 % da amostra. Os achados a respeito das características da dor estão de acordo com a literatura. O impacto representado pela CTTE a nível individual e na sociedade deve, entretanto, ser reconsiderado. A {{case series}} study of 50 consecutive patients with episodic tension type headache (ETTH) was conducted. Clinical aspects, family history and impact on work activities were studied. The casuistry {{was made up}} of 40 women and 10 men. The average age was 30 (± 12) years. <b>Constrictive</b> <b>pain</b> was present in 40 patients (80 %). Sickness was the most commonly reported related phenomenon (20 %). As expected, bilateral pain predominated; however, unilateral location was also present (10 %). Although classically described as a mild pain, we observed that ETTH can come in intense crisis (16 %). Family history of tension type headache was positive in 12 patients. The impact on work activities was substantial (14 %). Our findings regarding to clinical aspects are in agreement with the literature. It is important to mention that the impact of ETTH on the individual and society should be reconsidered, and is more substantial than has been reported to date...|$|E
40|$|Tako-tsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} or "transient {{left ventricular}} (LV) apical ballooning" clinically presents like {{acute myocardial infarction}} without angiographic stenosis on coronary angiogram and a transient (reversible) LV apical ballooning. We discuss here about a 56 -year-old woman complains of first <b>constrictive</b> chest <b>pain</b> with ST elevation in leads V 2 -V 6 and minimal enzymatic release. Coronary angiogram demonstrates vessels without stenosis and the left ventriculogram an extensive LV apical wall motion abnormalities. LV dysfunction will only be transient since 24 hours after admission echographic images demonstrate quite complete recovery of LV systolic function. The pain disappears 12 hours after admission and the creatine kinase level normalize after 48 hours...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of left bundle branch block (LBBB) {{is quite common}} in clinical practice. The changes in cardiac repolarization, caused by this disorder of electric conduction, may mask {{the presence of an}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI), delaying the diagnostic-therapeutic iter, with an important impact on prognosis. We describe the case of a woman of 59 years with LBBB, came to our observation for a <b>constrictive</b> chest <b>pain</b> associated with dyspnea. The diagnostic workup for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), initially conducted only on the analysis of the electrocardiogram (negative TnI at entry), showed the presence of coronary arteries free of stenosis. However, the diagnostic confirmation of AMI was completed after the rise of cardiac markers and the electrocardiographic changes. This case confirm the difficulty about the diagnosis of AMI in patients with LBBB and stresses, however, as the use of some criteria proposed in the literature [1 - 3] can guide to its identification, directing patient to an appropriate treatment...|$|R
40|$|There is accumulating {{evidence}} to implicate {{the importance of}} EphBs receptors and ephrinBs ligands were involved in modulation of spinal nociceptive information. However, the downstream mechanisms that control this process are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated whether phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), as the downstream effectors, participates in modulation of spinal nociceptive information related to ephrinBs/EphBs. Intrathecal injection of ephrinB 1 -Fc produced a dose- and time-dependent thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, accompanied by the increase of spinal PI 3 K-p 110 γ, phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) and c-Fos expression. Pre-treatment with PI 3 K inhibitor wortmannin or LY 294002 prevented activation of spinal AKT induced by ephrinB 1 -Fc. Inhibition of spinal PI 3 K signaling dose-dependently prevented and reversed pain behaviors and spinal c-Fos protein expression induced by intrathecal injection of ephrinB 1 -Fc. Inhibition of EphBs receptors by intrathecal injection of EphB 1 -Fc reduced formalin-induced inflammation and chronic <b>constrictive</b> injury-induced neuropathic <b>pain</b> behaviors accompanied by decreased expression of spinal PI 3 K,p-AKT and c-Fos protein. Furthermore, pre-treatment with PI 3 K inhibitor wortmannin or LY 294002 prevented ephrinB 1 -Fc-induced ERK activation in spinal. These data demonstrated that PI 3 K and PI 3 K crosstalk to ERK signaling contributed to modulation of spinal nociceptive information related to ephrinBs/EphBs...|$|R
