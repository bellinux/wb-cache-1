40|$|Abstract: This work {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} performance of <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates</b> used as stacks in standing wave thermoacoustic coolers. Thermoacoustic technology is proposed in this study as an alternative sustainable solution to current issues with vapour compression refrigerators because of its environmentally friendlier attributes. However, the main hindrance {{to the expansion of}} this technology is its current lack of efficiency. Hence, an experimental investigation is conducted in this study. The influence of the geometrical configuration of the stack, described as the heart of the device, is investigated. The device was equipped with different selected low-cost porous materials (<b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates)</b> for performance testing and studies. Porosity, length and position of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates</b> are variables that are considered in order to investigate {{the performance of}} the cooler. Eight cordierite honeycomb <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates</b> with square cross sections and of four different lengths (26 mm, 48 mm, 70 mm and 100 mm) were considered. Five different stack positions, measured from the hot ends of the stack to the pressure antinode in increments of 100 mm, were investigated. Measurement of temperature difference at steady state was used to determine the performance of a particular configuration. Guidance on the design of this sustainable solution for refrigeration and selection of the best geometrical configuration of <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates</b> are provided. In addition, clarity on the relation between the geometrical configurations and the frequencies of the sound wave is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Thin <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates</b> {{are widely}} used in {{engineering}} applications in modern industry. For example, they are used as molecular filters in fuel cells and solid oxide electrolyzers for oxygen generation. Development of high-reliability substrate materials inevitably requires the accurate characterization of their mechanical properties. The loading conditions in service on the <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates,</b> such as the solid oxide electrolytes with a thickness of much less than 2 mm, often involve multiaxial bending instead of simple tension or bending. In this dissertation, the ASTM standard piston-on- 3 -ball experimental technique at ambient temperature is employed to investigate the quasi-static biaxial flexural strength of pure 8 YSZ and Al₂O₃ or 3 YSZ doped 8 YSZ <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates.</b> Furthermore, this piston-on- 3 -ball experimental technique is developed into a dynamic piston-on- 3 -ball technique at ambient temperature and a quasi-static piston-on- 3 -ball technique at elevated temperatures. Stress distribution functions in the tensile surface of a specimen under piston-on- 3 -ball loading condition are formulated and used to develop statistical models, which are proven {{to be in the}} form of a Weibull distribution function, to describe the biaxial flexural strength behavior of <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates</b> under piston-on- 3 -ball loading condition. Analytical modeling was conducted on the dynamic piston-on- 3 -ball loading configuration. This analytical model can be used to guide the experimental design and judge the validity of experimental results. A new material constitutive model is developed to give a good description of the dynamic strength behavior of ceramic materials under constant stress-rate loading. Quasi-static experiments under piston-on- 3 -ball loading are conducted at both ambient temperature and elevated temperatures, while dynamic experiments are conducted at ambient temperature. Experimental results, as well as observations from SEM microstructure images and values of fracture toughness measured using a newly developed Vickers micro-indentation toughness technique, lead to a conclusion that no obvious overall improvement to the SYSZ <b>ceramic</b> <b>substrates</b> in the biaxial flexural strength can be observed by adding Al₂O₃ additive with amount up to 3 mol% or 3 YSZ additive with amount up to 30 wt%...|$|R
