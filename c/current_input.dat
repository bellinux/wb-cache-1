2500|$|Both {{types of}} BJT {{function}} by letting a small <b>current</b> <b>input</b> {{to the base}} control an amplified output from the collector. The {{result is that the}} transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the NPN transistor in what is called active mode, the base–emitter voltage [...] and collector–base voltage [...] are positive, forward biasing the emitter–base junction and reverse-biasing the collector–base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector–base junction. For a figure describing forward and reverse bias, see semiconductor diodes.|$|E

40|$|For the integrate-and-fire {{model and}} the Hodgkin [...] Huxley model, we {{consider}} how <b>current</b> <b>inputs</b> including #-wave and square-wave affect their outputs. Firstly the usual approximation is employed to approximate the models with <b>current</b> <b>inputs</b> which quantitatively reveals the difference between instantaneous and noninstantaneous (<b>current)</b> <b>inputs.</b> When the rising time of #-wave inputs is long or the ratio between the inhibitory and excitatory inputs is close to one, the usual approximation fails to approximate the #-wave inputs in the integrate-and-fire model.
