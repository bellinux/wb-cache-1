5|$|August 9, 1976- Hurricane Belle {{parallels}} the Delmarva Peninsula, prompting officials to issue hurricane warnings for the Delaware coastline. The {{core of the}} hurricane passes slightly {{to the east of}} the state, and <b>consequentially</b> produces lighter winds and less rainfall than expected but still a powerful storm.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone caused heavy damage {{near where}} it moved ashore and along its path, {{resulting}} in ten deaths. Fanele struck Madagascar {{just two days}} after Tropical Storm Eric brushed the northeastern portion of the country. The two storms affected over 50,000people, of which at least 4,000 were left homeless. Fanele struck the country during a series of government protests, and <b>consequentially</b> relief efforts were hindered.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the second season, Conrad and Wahler had ended their relationship, while Montag began dating Spencer Pratt. Montag increasingly spent more time with Pratt and neglected her friendship with Conrad, which placed a strain on the pair's friendship. <b>Consequentially,</b> Conrad strengthened her relationship with her friend Lo Bosworth and took a romantic interest in Pratt's friend Brody Jenner. Montag and Pratt moved into an apartment together in the season finale, at which point Patridge became Conrad's new housemate.|$|E
5|$|At the {{cemetery}} in Sampul (Chinese: 山普拉), ~14km from the archaeological site of Khotan in Lop County, Xinjiang, China, where the aforementioned Sampul tapestry was found, the local inhabitants buried their dead there from roughly 217 BC to 283 AD. Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis of the}} human remains has revealed genetic affinities to peoples from the Caucasus, specifically a maternal lineage linked to Ossetians and Iranians, {{as well as an}} Eastern-Mediterranean paternal lineage. Seeming to confirm this link, from historical accounts it is known that Alexander the Great, who married a Sogdian woman from Bactria named Roxana, encouraged his soldiers and generals to marry local women; <b>consequentially</b> the later kings of the Seleucid Empire and Greco-Bactrian Kingdom had a mixed Persian-Greek ethnic background.|$|E
5|$|Early in its life, forecasters had {{difficulties}} {{regarding the}} future track {{and intensity of}} Danielle, including a northeastward motion instead of its loop. After Danielle executed its loop, forecasters consistently predicted a landfall along the northeastern North Carolina coastline. As a result, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings for the coast of North Carolina on September 24, 36hours before the storm passed {{to the east of}} the state. The continued northward motion caught forecasters off guard, and <b>consequentially</b> tropical storm warnings were not issued for the Delmarva Peninsula until just 12hours before the storm made landfall. In addition, forecasters issued tropical storm warnings from Delaware through Watch Hill, Rhode Island, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|In its series premiere, The Hills first {{introduced}} Lauren Conrad, {{who moved from}} Laguna Beach, California to Los Angeles {{to pursue a career}} in the fashion industry. She and her housemate Heidi Montag originally planned to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, though the latter left the college after receiving employment with Bolthouse Productions. Montag befriended their neighbor Audrina Patridge, while Conrad bonded with her fellow Teen Vogue intern Whitney Port. The remainder of the first season highlighted romantic relationships, including Montag's and Patridge's brief relationships with Jordan Eubanks and Brian Drolet respectively. The season concluded with Conrad's rejection of a summertime internship in Paris to reunite with her former boyfriend Jason Wahler. <b>Consequentially,</b> Port was offered and accepted the position in Conrad's place.|$|E
5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that I wish {{to invert}} the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason <b>consequentially,</b> as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find employment, <b>consequentially</b> in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E
5|$|Due to the FCC's {{limits on}} station {{ownership}} {{at the time}} (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing agreements in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand their reach, and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – <b>consequentially</b> triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, broadcasters still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} tracked to {{the northwest}} through the Yucatán Channel into an area of increased wind shear, which left the center exposed and elongated. Despite its poor structure, the system maintained strong winds in its eastern semicircle. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto early on June 11 about 260miles (420km) southwest of the Dry Tortugas, based on Hurricane Hunters' reports of flight level winds of 50mph (80km/h) in a few convective bands. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation had become better defined, though forecasts predicted the wind shear would increase, preventing significant strengthening of the storm. One forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked the system resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, deep convection developed and built westward against the wind shear as the overall organization improved. At the same time Alberto turned northeastward {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. On June 12, the circulation abruptly reformed under the area of deepest convection, which coincided with the storm's passage over the loop current; <b>consequentially,</b> Alberto quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 70mph (115km/h) about 220miles (350km) west-northwest of Tampa, Florida.|$|E
25|$|ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposable Accessible Chromatin sequencing) {{uses the}} Tn5 {{transposase}} to integrate (synthetic) transposons into accessible {{regions of the}} genome <b>consequentially</b> highlighting the localisation of nucleosomes and transcription factors across the genome.|$|E

25|$|In the 1989 {{landmark}} case Street v Queensland Bar Association, {{the modern}} approach to interpretation was developed. The {{court held that}} the purpose of the section was national unity, and <b>consequentially,</b> residence should be given a broader meaning. In addition, the court overruled a case in which the historical approach was used.|$|E
25|$|Allodynia and {{dysaesthesia}} replace numbness {{between one}} {{week and a}} few months after a thalamic stroke. In general, once the development of pain has stopped, the type and severity of pain will be unchanging and if untreated, persist throughout life. <b>Consequentially,</b> many will undergo some form of pain treatment and adjust to their new lives as best they can.|$|E
25|$|In Janet Shibamoto's {{book review}} of Deborah Cameron's book Feminism and Linguistic Theory, Shibamoto {{discusses}} Cameron's {{study on the}} patriarchal context within language, which <b>consequentially</b> influences {{the way in which}} women continue to be contained by or subject to ideologies created by the patriarchy. Many scholars have presented information on how Baartman's life was heavily controlled and manipulated by colonialist and patriarchal language.|$|E
25|$|Polymerization {{also has}} been <b>consequentially</b> linked to catastrophic {{component}} failures such as injection pump shaft seizure and breakage, injector tip failure leading to various and/or combustion chamber components damaged. Most metallurgical problems such as corrosion and electrolysis are related to water based contamination or poor choices of plumbing (such as copper or Zinc) which can cause gelling- even with petroleum based fuels.|$|E
25|$|While {{industrial}} partnerships {{stand to}} amplify mutual interests and accelerate success, {{some forms of}} collaboration may be considered ethically problematic. When a politician, for example, partners with a corporation to advance the latter's interest in exchange for some benefit, {{a conflict of interest}} results; <b>consequentially,</b> the public good may suffer. While technically lawful in some jurisdictions, such practice is broadly viewed negatively or as corruption.|$|E
25|$|The Tbilisi Teaching University Gorgasali {{was founded}} in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 1995. It is a private company owned by Mzia Katamadze and Jovan Didier. From its very first beginning, Gorgasali University <b>consequentially</b> {{developed}} a high-profile through superior academic standards. Its renowned Law School, one of the country’s best Business Schools, but also its medical studies have resulted in high reputation in Georgia and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Eden's {{policy had}} four main aims: first, {{to secure the}} Suez Canal; second and <b>consequentially,</b> to ensure {{continuity}} of oil supplies; third, to remove Nasser; and fourth, to keep the Russians out of the Middle East. The immediate consequence of the crisis was that the Suez Canal was blocked, oil supplies were interrupted, Nasser's position {{as the leader of}} Arab nationalism was strengthened, and the way was left open for Russian intrusion into the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|In 1677, he was promoted, at his request, to Privy Counselor of Justice, a post he {{held for}} the rest of his life. Leibniz served three {{consecutive}} rulers of the House of Brunswick as historian, political adviser, and most <b>consequentially,</b> as librarian of the ducal library. He thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political, historical, and theological matters involving the House of Brunswick; the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 the Irish Government ordered two Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) from Vospers UK. When World War II {{began in}} September 1939 the Marine and Coastwatching Service was set up. In order for Ireland to remain neutral, {{it became clear}} that a full naval service would be required. The {{government}} <b>consequentially</b> ordered an additional 4 MTBs. By the end of 1940 the Irish Marine and Coastwatching Service consisted of 6 MTB's and 4 other assorted craft.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} automation of {{the crystal}} structure determination process has resulted in ever higher publishing rates of new crystal structures and, <b>consequentially,</b> new publishing models. Minimalistic articles contain only crystal structure tables, structure images, and, possibly, abstract-like structure description. They tend {{to be published in}} author-financed or subsidized open-access journals. Acta Crystallographica Section E and Zeitschrift für Kristallographie belong in this category. More elaborate contributions may go to traditional subscriber-financed journals. Hybrid journals, on the other hand, embed individual author-financed open-access articles among subscriber-financed ones. Publishers may also make scientific articles available online, as Portable Document Format (PDF) files.|$|E
25|$|Research in AI is {{concerned}} with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, handwriting, natural language, speech and facial recognition. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, knowledge mining, software applications, strategy games like computer chess and other video games. One of the biggest limitations of AI is {{in the domain of}} actual machine comprehension. <b>Consequentially</b> natural language understanding and connectionism (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.|$|E
25|$|Some educated parties {{note that}} the USL v. BSDi case had shown that the Unix {{copyrights}} are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed patent infringement, as according to the US Patent and Trademark Office database, no AT or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX trademark was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and <b>consequentially</b> a claim only against IBM. SCO {{was looking for something}} directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.|$|E
25|$|TRNA export is also {{dependent}} on the various modifications it undergoes, thus preventing export of improperly functioning tRNA. This quality control mechanism is important due to tRNA's central role in translation, where it is involved in adding amino acids to a growing peptide chain. The tRNA exporter in vertebrates is called exportin-t. Exportin-t binds directly to its tRNA cargo in the nucleus, a process promoted {{by the presence of}} RanGTP. Mutations that affect tRNA's structure inhibit its ability to bind to exportin-t, and <b>consequentially,</b> to be exported, providing the cell with another quality control step. As described above, once the complex has crossed the envelope it dissociates and releases the tRNA cargo into the cytosol.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscience {{studies the}} nervous system, the {{physical}} {{basis of the}} mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how biological neural networks form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. At a larger scale, efforts in computational neuroscience have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains. As of 2012, such models include the thalamus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and occipital cortex, and <b>consequentially</b> simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the hippocampus and limbic system, hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with long-term memory and crude emotions.|$|E

25|$|Thirty-seven of {{the wells}} were built {{on or near}} {{existing}} Aboriginal waters and were constructed in the European tradition, which made many of them inaccessible to Aboriginal people. Pulling the heavy buckets {{up from the bottom}} of the wells required the strength of three men or use of a camel. <b>Consequentially,</b> many Aboriginal people were injured or died while trying to access the water, either falling in and drowning or breaking bones on the windlass handle. In reprisal, buckets were cut off or timber set on fire, and by 1917 Aboriginal people had vandalised or dismantled approximately half of the wells in a bid to reclaim access to the water or to prevent drovers from using the wells. Canning's party had constructed the wells with the forced help of one of the Aboriginal peoples whose land the route traversed, the Martu.|$|E
25|$|On the event, at 50 meters, he contest smooth in rank 3 that clocked 26:03 seconds. At 100 meters, {{he climbs}} in rank 2 timed at 53:82 seconds on {{splitting}} of 27.79 seconds. Underway, he is flawless over rank 2 at 150 meters timed at 1 minute and 22.67 seconds with a split of 28.85 where he countered Peru in the chase. However, lacuna concludes time at 1:52.91 where he ranked 5 {{of the heat}} with splitting time of 30.24. <b>Consequentially,</b> he is at 36th in the results wherein he did not qualify for semi-finals. In contrast, lacuna's coach, Pinky Brosas stated that he was speedy at 100 meters but race inconsistent at the rest meters, coach Brosas adds through Lacuna's excitement and adrenaline-rush was his grounds to speed on the first half, although, {{he was in the}} mark of his presentation to learn the consequence.|$|E
25|$|During {{the process}} of state reporting, NGOs may {{indicate}} their interest to the secretariat on a particular state's report and then prepare a submission to be considered alongside the state report. The input of non-governmental organisations allows for an assessment {{on the state of}} civil, social and political rights and takes into account such assessments in the view of organisation that may to be affected by ICCPR principles. The utility of NGO input has been noted by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna 1993 in its concluding Declaration, in the protection of human rights and in humanitarian services. NGO reports also give the public an opportunity to assist in the assessment of the government's overall adherence to the covenant or on particular matters. These reports may be assessed prior to the meeting or in some circumstances an NGO may be admitted to the meeting. <b>Consequentially,</b> the NGO may take a record of the meeting, facilitating dissemination of information back to the state concerned.|$|E
25|$|Each {{star system}} has {{a space station}} where the Traveller can trade resources, multitools, and ships, and {{interact}} {{with one or more}} aliens from three different races that populate the galaxy. The player may also find active or abandoned alien bases on planets that offer similar functions. Each alien race has their own language, presented as a word-for-word substitution which initially will be nonsense to the player. By frequent communications with that race, as well as finding monoliths scattered on planets that act as Rosetta stones, the player can better understand these languages and perform proper actions when interacting with the alien non-player characters, gaining favour from the alien and its race for future trading and combat. <b>Consequentially,</b> improper responses to aliens may cause them to dislike the Traveller, and their space-bound fleets may attack the Traveller on sight. The game includes a free market galactic store accessible at space stations or alien bases, where some resources and goods have higher values in some systems compared to others, enabling the player to profit on resource gathering and subsequent trade.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010 season, Smith managed just 24runs from his first six innings opening for Lancashire. <b>Consequentially,</b> he was moved to the middle order, where he rediscovered his form. In his second match after moving down the order, Smith scored his maiden century in the County Championship. After his success, he stated {{that he would like to}} regain the opening position. Despite {{struggling}} for runs in first-class cricket at {{the start of}} the season, Smith was Lancashire's leading run-scorer in T20 cricket in 2010 with 543runs from 17matches, nearly 150runs more than his nearest competitor, Steven Croft. While Lancashire was knocked out in the quarter-finals of the competition, Smith scored three half-centuries including a personal best of 92not out against Worcestershire; he finished as the competition's fourth-highest run-scorer for 2010. Smith also claimed 13wickets in the T20 competition. In June 2010, Smith reached the landmark of 100first-class wickets when he dismissed Jonny Bairstow in a drawn Roses match. At the start of August, Smith was awarded his county cap by Lancashire.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the visit}} of the British Cabinet Secretary, Sir Maurice Hankey, to Australia in 1934, {{political}} interest in the Singapore Strategy debate rose. A copy of Wynter's 1927 paper came into the possession of Senator Charles Brand, who had it copied and circulated amongst {{the members of the}} Parliament of Australia. On 5 November 1936, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Curtin used the paper to bolster a strong attack on the policies of the Minister for Defence, Mr Archdale Parkhill. Parkhill was further embarrassed by an article in the Daily Telegraph written by Wynter's son Philip, that Parkhill believed contained classified information. In retaliation, in March 1937, Parkhill had Wynter posted to the staff of the 11th Mixed Brigade in Queensland at his substantive rank of lieutenant colonel, with a <b>consequentially</b> reduced salary. At the same time, Parkhill withdrew his recommendation for the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General John Lavarack, another opponent of the Singapore strategy, to be awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{demographic}} {{changes in the}} developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising welfare and hence, reduced inequality. According to Martin Wolf, {{in the developing world}} as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in fertility rates in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment. <b>Consequentially,</b> more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor. Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.|$|E
