Potential benefits would include increased short-term softwood timber supply, improved wildlife habitat and cutblock aesthetics, as well as reduced public criticism of previous logging practices. Stewart et al.

A discriminant model correctly classified 73% of the sites as to {{presence or absence of}} a white spruce understorey, based on the amount of spruce basal area, rotten wood, ecological nutrient regime, soil <b>clay</b> <b>fraction,</b> and elevation, although it explained only 30% of the variation in the data. On sites with a white spruce understorey, a regression model related the abundance of regeneration to rotten wood cover, spruce basal area, pine basal area, soil <b>clay</b> <b>fraction,</b> and grass cover (R² = 0.36). About half the seedlings surveyed grew on rotten wood, and only 3% on mineral soil, and seedlings were 10 {{times more likely to have}} established on these substrates than on litter.

50|$|Polymer {{treatments}} {{modify the}} size, shape, and cohesion of soil aggregates {{by changing the}} interactions between soil particles. Because polymer-soil interactions occur on the surfaces of soil particles, the amount of surface area in the soil (in other words, its dominant particle size) is of great importance.

Although polymers mainly interact with the <b>clay</b> <b>fraction</b> of soils, they do change the properties of sandy soils to a lesser degree. Polymer structure dictates how they will interact with clay particles. For example, block copolymers result in very different soil properties than homopolymers, as do ionic and nonionic polymers.

5000|$|Today Tibet is {{the most}} {{essential}} heating surface of the atmosphere. During the Last glacial period a c. 2400000 km2 ice sheet covered the plateau. This glaciation took place in correspondence to a lowering of the snowline by 1200 m. For the Last Glacial Maximum this means a depression of the average annual temperature by [...] at a minor precipitation compared with that one of today. Owing to this drop in temperature a supposed drier climate has partly been compensated {{with regard to the}} glacier feeding by a minor evaporation and an increased relative humidity.Due to its great extension this glaciation in the subtropics was the most important climatically foreign element on earth. With an albedo about 80-90% this ice area of Tibet has reflected an at least 4 times greater global radiation energy per surface into space than the further inland ices at a higher geographical latitude. At that time the most essential heating surface of the atmosphere - which at present, i.e. interglacially, is the Tibetan plateau - was the most important cooling surface. The annual low-pressure area induced by heat above Tibet as a motor of the summer monsoon was lacking. The glaciation thus caused a breaking-off of the summer monsoon with all the global-climatic consequences, e.g. the pluvials in the Sahara, the expansion of the Thar desert, the heavier dust influx into the Arabian Sea etc., and also the downward shifting of the timber line and all forest-belts from the alpine-boreal forests as far down as to the semi-humid mediterranean forest which has replaced the Holocene monsoon-tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent. But also the movements of animals including the Javan Rusa far into South Asia are a consequence of this glaciation.Despite a great evaporation ablation caused by heavy insolation, the discharge of the glaciers into the Inner-Asian basins was sufficient for the creation of meltwater lakes in the Qaidam Basin, the Tarim Basin and the Gobi Desert. The drop in temperature (see above) was in favour of their development. Thus, the <b>clay</b> <b>fraction</b> produced by the ground scouring of the important glaciation was ready to be blown-out. The blow-out of the limnites and the Aeolian long-distance transport were connected to the katabatic winds. Accordingly, the Tibetan glaciation was the actual cause of the enormous loess production and the transport of the material into the Chinese middle- and lowlands continuing to the east. During the Ice Age the katabatic air current - the name 'winter monsoon' is not quite correct - blew all year round. The enormous uplift of Tibet by approx. 10 mm/y measured by triangulations since the 19th century and confirmed by glaciogemorphological findings as well as by seismological investigations equals the uplift of the Himalaya. However, these amounts of uplift are far too important as to a primarily tectonic uplift of the high plateau which only takes place epirogenetically. Actually they can be understood the better by a superimposed glacioisostatic compensation movement of Tibet about 650 m.|$|E

The question we address in this work is whether different mineral species lead to different organo-mineral interactions and stabilize different quantities of SOM and different types of SOC. Here, benefiting from the unique opportunity offered by an INRA long term bare fallow (LTBF) experiment having started in 1928 in Versailles (France), we report the in-situ characterization of SOC dynamics in four <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> of this silty loam soil (total clays [TC, < 2 μm], coarse clays [CC, 0. 2 - 2 μm], intermediate clays [IC, 0. 05 - 0. 2 μm] and fine clays [FC, 0 - 0. 05 μm]).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{automatic}} method for parameterization of a 3 -D {{model of the}} subsurface, integrating lithological information from boreholes with resistivity models through an inverse optimization, {{with the objective of}} further detailing of geological models, or as direct input into groundwater models. The parameter of interest is the <b>clay</b> <b>fraction,</b> expressed as the relative length of clay units in a depth interval. The <b>clay</b> <b>fraction</b> is obtained from lithological logs and the <b>clay</b> <b>fraction</b> from the resistivity is obtained by establishing a simple petrophysical relationship, a translator function, between resistivity and the <b>clay</b> <b>fraction.</b> Through inversion we use the lithological data and the resistivity data to determine the optimum spatially distributed translator function. Applying the translator function we get a 3 -D <b>clay</b> <b>fraction</b> model, which holds information from the resistivity data set and the borehole data set in one variable. Finally, we use k -means clustering to generate a 3 -D model of the subsurface structures. We apply the procedure to the Norsminde survey in Denmark, integrating approximately 700 boreholes and more than 100 000 resistivity models from an airborne survey in the parameterization of the 3 -D model covering 156 km 2. The final five-cluster 3 -D model differentiates between clay materials and different high-resistivity materials from information held in the resistivity model and borehole observations, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Radiocaesium (137 Cs) {{dispersion}} and Cs+ fixation {{were studied}} in the sediments collected from the lagoon systems of “Ria de Aveiro”. The Cs+ sorption was tested for the fine mica grains and for the < 2 μm <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> extracted from silty clays. The Cs+ exchange is found strongly onto mica-rich fractions than smectite-rich fractions. The distribution coefficient increases if the silty material is constituted by rich-mica <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> or if the non-clay minerals are removed from the silty-clay material. The samples studied behave as multisite ion exchange, where Cs+ engages in ion-exchange reactions with hydrated cations on planar sites on expansible layer silicates. Higher concentrations of the 137 Cs were found associated with mica-rich silty clays. The 137 Cs ranges from 3. 2 to 3. 9 Bq kg− 1 in the < 38 μm fractions and from 2. 9 to 3. 3 Bq kg− 1 in the < 64 μm fractions...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative stimation {{of mineral}} {{concentrations}} {{was made for}} the <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> of Omega loamy sand (Brown Podzolic) and Ahmeek loam (Brown Forest). These soils are red atively oung and have developed from Pleistocene (late Wisconsin) outwash and till, re-spectively, innorthern Wisconsin. A mineral weathering depth function was found, in which illite and chlorite present at depth have weathered tovermiculite and montmorillonite n ar-er the surface, particularly in the <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> of Ahmeek loam. In the fine clay, the mont-morillonite content increases from 5 percent in the C 1 horizon to 44 percent in the A 1 hori-zon. Conversely, chlorite decreases from 11 percent in the C 1 to virtually none in the dl hor-izon. Weathering in these soils is also reflected by distribution ofminerals {{as a function of}} particle size. The occurrence ofmineral-weathering depth and size functions in these young soils is attributed to accelerated leaching made possible by the coarse texture of the soils...|$|R
40|$|Iron oxides {{with high}} {{specific}} surface areas promote the stabilisation of soil organic matter. We compared solid state 13 C {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectra of <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> from A horizons before and after demineralisation with 10 % hydrofluoric acid (HF) to study selective associations between Fe oxides and functional groups in soil organic matter. The samples were collected from soils under temperate forest conditions, classified as Cambisols, Leptosols, Luvisols and Phaeozem. After removal of Fe oxides by demineralisation, solid state 13 C NMR spectra of <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> from Leptosols and Luvisols showed {{an increase in the}} relative O/N-alkyl C intensity that ranged from 3 % to 20 %. A variable contact time experiment with a sample from a Luvisol without HF treatment showed that protons in the vicinity of O/N-alkyl C relaxed faster than in the vicinity of other functional groups. Therefore, part of the O/N-alkyl C was invisible unless very short contact times were applied. This demonstrated that Fe oxides and O/N-alkyl C are preferentially associated in soils. The O/N-alkyl C signal loss in the untreated samples was strongly correlated with the ratio of dithionite-extractable iron oxides and the organic carbon (OC) concentration. Our study showed that OC:Fe ratios > 1 do not necessarily assure that reasonable solid state 13 C NMR spectra will be obtained. In fact, <b>clay</b> <b>fractions</b> with OC:Fe ratios between 2. 2 and 3. 8 were affected by association between Fe oxides and O/N-alkyl C and had to be treated with HF to circumvent a selective signal loss of O/N-alkyl C.
