30|$|TOPSIS (Technique {{for order}} {{preference}} by similarity to an ideal solution) method was presented by Hwang and Yoon (Yoon and Hwang 1995). TOPSIS uses different weighting schemes and distance metrics to compares results of {{different sets of}} weights applied to set of multiple criteria data (Olson 2004; Önüt and Soner 2008). The basic principle is that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution. The ideal solution is a solution that maximizes the benefit criteria and minimizes the <b>cost</b> <b>criteria,</b> whereas the negative ideal solution maximizes the <b>cost</b> <b>criteria</b> and minimizes the benefit criteria.
