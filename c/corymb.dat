5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a <b>corymb.</b> The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
500|$|Alloxylon pinnatum, {{commonly}} known as Dorrigo waratah, is a tree of the family Proteaceae found in warm-temperate rainforest of south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales in eastern Australia. It has shiny green leaves that are either [...] (lobed) and up to [...] long, or [...] (spear-shaped) and up to [...] long. The prominent pinkish-red flower heads, known as inflorescences, appear in spring and summer; these {{are made up of}} 50 to 140 individual flowers arranged in <b>corymb</b> or raceme. These are followed by rectangular woody seed pods, which bear two rows of winged seeds.|$|E
500|$|The pinkish-red {{compound}} flowerheads, {{known as}} inflorescences, {{are up to}} 20cm (8in) across in spring to summer, and contain between 50 and 140 smaller flowers, arranged in a <b>corymb</b> or raceme. These individual flowers are [...] long and sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to [...] in length, which arise in pairs off the main stalk within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The flower parts are smooth and hairless. The pollen is crimson. After flowering, the [...] long woody seedpod develops. Cylindrical in shape, it splits down one side to release the seeds, which are ripe from February to June. They are arranged in two rows, with at least four seeds in each row. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species in}} the Maloideae, such as hawthorns and rowans, produce their flowers in <b>corymbs.</b> The Norway maple and yerba maté are also {{examples}} of <b>corymbs.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Corymbs</b> more lax, spreading, 4.5 – 10  cm long.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} yellowish-green, {{produced}} in <b>corymbs</b> {{of three to}} five together.|$|R
60|$|Two purple-flowered {{varieties}} {{were placed}} under a net in the greenhouse, and four corymbs on each were repeatedly brushed with flowers {{from the other}} plant, so that their stigmas were well covered with each other's pollen. Two of the eight corymbs thus treated produced very few seeds, but the other six produced on an average 41.3 seeds per <b>corymb,</b> and these germinated well. The stigmas on four other corymbs on both plants were well smeared with pollen from the flowers on their own corymbs; these eight corymbs produced altogether ten extremely poor seeds, which proved incapable of germinating. I examined many flowers on both plants, and found the stigmas spontaneously covered with pollen; but they produced not a single seed. These plants were afterwards left uncovered {{in the same house}} where many other Cinerarias were in flower; and the flowers were frequently visited by bees. They then produced plenty of seed, but one of the two plants less than the other, as this species shows some tendency to be dioecious.|$|E
6000|$|I {{never saw}} the Crab-Apple till May, 1861. I had heard of it through Michaux, but more modern botanists, so far as I know, have not treated it as of any {{peculiar}} importance. Thus it was a half-fabulous tree to me. I contemplated a pilgrimage to the [...] "Glades," [...] a portion of Pennsylvania where it was said to grow to perfection. I thought of sending to a nursery for it, but doubted if they had it, or would distinguish it from European varieties. At last I had occasion to go to Minnesota, and on entering Michigan I began to notice from the cars a tree with handsome rose-colored flowers. At first I thought it some variety of thorn; {{but it was not}} long before the truth flashed on me, that this was my long-sought Crab-Apple. It was the prevailing flowering shrub or tree to be seen from the cars at that season of the year,--about the middle of May. But the cars never stopped before one, and so I was launched on the bosom of the Mississippi without having touched one, experiencing the fate of Tantalus. On arriving at St. Anthony's Falls, I was sorry to be told that I was too far north for the Crab-Apple. Nevertheless I succeeded in finding it about eight miles west of the Falls; touched it and smelled it, and secured a lingering <b>corymb</b> of flowers for my herbarium. This must have been near its northern limit.|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} cymose <b>corymb</b> {{is similar}} to a racemose <b>corymb</b> but has a panicle-like structure. Another type of panicle is the anthela. An anthela is a cymose <b>corymb</b> with the lateral flowers higher than the central ones.|$|E

50|$|<b>Corymb</b> is a botanical {{term for}} an {{inflorescence}} with the flowers growing {{in such a}} fashion that the outermost are born on longer pedicels than the inner, bringing all flowers up to a common level. A cyme has a flattish top superficially resembling an umbel, and may have a branching structure similar to a panicle. Flowers in a <b>corymb</b> structure can either be parallel, or alternate, and form in either a convex, or flat form.|$|E
50|$|Cotoneaster franchetii var. cinerascens Rehd. Larger, to 4 m tall, {{with leaves}} up to 4 cm long, {{and up to}} 30 flowers per <b>corymb.</b>|$|E
50|$|In June {{it bears}} many flowered, {{compound}} <b>corymbs</b> of white, 5-6 mm flowers. The fruit grow as small, showy, apple-like, red pomes, ripening in September to October, and enduring into the winter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flowers are}} borne in small <b>corymbs</b> in the axils of the leaves. They are irregular, red or white, with four tepals, four short stamens {{and a long}} style that {{persists}} in fruit.|$|R
50|$|The nearly {{radially}} symmetrical flowers grow in a racemose many-flowered inflorescence or in <b>corymbs.</b> The white, pink or purple {{flowers are}} minute to medium-sized. The petals are {{longer than the}} sepals. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic.|$|R

50|$|Grindelia integrifolia is a {{perennial}} herb up to 100 cm (40 inches) tall. It has narrow, lanceolate leaves up to 8 cm (3.2 inches) long and yellow flower heads arranged like a <b>corymb.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{trial was}} {{repeated}} on another variety with white petals tipped with red. Many stigmas on two <b>corymbs</b> {{were covered with}} pollen from the foregoing purple variety, and these produced eleven and twenty-two seeds, which germinated well. A large number of the stigmas on several of the other <b>corymbs</b> were repeatedly smeared with pollen from their own corymb; but they yielded only five very poor seeds, which were incapable of germination. Therefore the above three plants belonging to two varieties, though growing vigorously and fertile with pollen from either {{of the other two}} plants, were utterly sterile with pollen from other flowers on the same plant.|$|R
50|$|The {{hermaphrodite}} flowers have 5 stamens and are borne in large, flat <b>corymbs</b> 10-25 cm diameter in {{late spring}} to mid summer, the individual flowers ivory white, 5-6 mm diameter, with five petals; they are pollinated by flies.|$|R
