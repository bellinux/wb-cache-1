40|$|Although infants' {{abilities}} to perceive contingencies within perceptual-cognitive contexts have been established, their sensitivities to contingency during social interactions are less well delineated. The present research {{consisted of three}} experimental and two control studies. Studies 1 and 2 confirmed that 7 - and 4 -month-olds could perceive and learn a contingent relationship during social adult-infant interactions. Infants in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> were reinforced through standardized tactile stimulation for gazing at an experimenter's neutral face. Yoked infants in the noncontingent condition received the same tactile stimulation regardless of their behaviours. Infants in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> learned the contingency; their level of gazing at the face was higher, and gazing away was lower, relative to infants in the noncontingent condition. Study 3 extended these results into more natural touch-alone interactions with 4 - and 7 -month-olds and their mothers. Mothers in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> played naturally with their infants using only touch. Mothers in the noncontingent condition imitated the touching of mothers in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition.</b> Reliability measures and control studies confirmed that mothers in the noncontingent condition successfully imitated mothers in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition.</b> Results revealed that 4 - and 7 -month-olds in the noncontingent condition displayed higher and more variable amounts of gazing away than infants in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> who exhibited lower, more stable, gazing away. Infants in the noncontingent condition displayed a linear increase in their fretting whereas infants in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> displayed low, stable amounts of fretting. During the normal period following the contingent or noncontingent interaction period, infants in the noncontingent condition spent more tune fretting than infants in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition,</b> and they exhibited a decrease in their fretting, indicating slower re-engagement with their mothers. In contrast, infants in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> displayed low, stable amounts of fretting. These results indicate that by 4 months of age infants are capable of perceiving, and respond differently to, the presence or lack of contingency during social interactions. Further, infants' motivations to engage in subsequent interactions after participating in noncontingent interactions may be compromised. Implications for infants' social awareness and the optimal contexts for their normal socio-emotional development are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Four college {{students}} {{were exposed to}} a Sidman avoidance procedure to determine if an avoidance contingency involving 20 % carbon dioxide-enriched air (CO 2) would produce and maintain responding. In Phase 1, two conditions (contingent and noncontingent) were conducted each day. These conditions were distinguished by {{the presence or absence}} of a blue or green box on a computer screen. In the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition,</b> CO 2 presentation were delivered every 3 s unless a subject pulled a plunger. Each plunger pull postponed CO 2 presentations for 10 s. In the noncontingent condition, CO 2 presentations occurred on the average of every 5 min independent of responding. Following stable responding in Phase 1, condition-correlated stimuli were reversed. In both conditions, plunger response rate was high during the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> and low or zero during the noncontingent condition. Furthermore, subjects avoided most CO 2 presentations. However, CO 2 presentations did not increase verbal reports of fear. Overall, the results from the present study suggest that CO 2 can be used effectively in basic studies of aversive control and in laboratory analogues of response patterns commonly referred to as anxiety...|$|E

Behavioral productivity of the self-determination condition was greater than that of the no-reinforcement condition. Further, no attenuation of the efficacy of contingent reinforcement occurred when performance standards were self-determined rather than externally imposed. Over six sessions, children became progressively more lenient in their self-imposed performance demands in the absence of social surveillance...|$|R
40|$|Both {{industry}} and academia consider Evidence Based Design (EBD) to {{be a positive}} way forward {{to improve the quality of}} the health service through better utilisation of rigorous evidence during the design process. The use of rigorous evidence is not a distinct activity of the design process; it materialises on different routes and activities scattered throughout the design process and which presents many prospects for improvement. The aim of the reported research is to identify how the evidence based design process could be improved. The research takes a critical realist's perspective. An overview of evidence based design, and critical realism are discussed in the back ground literature. Twelve semi-structured interviews with professionals working on healthcare built environment projects were used to gather data pertinent to their choice and application of different sources of evidence. Results validated a conceptually derived model of current practice of EBD and highlighted prospects for improvement. Interviews were thematically analysed to identify the rationale behind current practices and such themes were then used in deriving mechanisms and <b>contingent</b> <b>conditions</b> of the EBD. Six mechanisms that are causally efficacious prospects for improvement and four <b>contingent</b> <b>conditions</b> that flourish or suffocate these prospects were derived. Several suggestions are proposed several to improve EBD in the UK together with a discussion of the experience of adopting a critical realist's approach...|$|R

40|$|Previous natural {{observations}} {{have found}} a robust correlation between infantsโ spontaneous gesture production and vocabulary development: the onset and frequency of infantsโ pointing gestures are significantly correlated to their subsequent vocabulary size (Colonnesi, Stams, Koster, 2 ฬ 6 Noom, 2010). The present study first examined the correlations between pointing and vocabulary size in an experimental setting, and then experimentally manipulated responses to pointing, to investigate the role of pointing in infantsโ forming word-object associations. In the first experiment, we elicited 12 - to 24 -month old infantsโ pointing gestures to 8 familiar and 8 novel objects. Their vocabulary was assessed by the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) : Words and Gestures. Results showed that 12 - 16 month old infantsโ receptive vocabulary was positively correlated to infantsโ spontaneous pointing. This correlation, however, was not significant in 19 - 24 month old infants. This experiment thus generalizes the previous naturalistic observation findings to an experimental setting, and shows a developmental change in the relation between pointing and receptive vocabulary. Together with prior studies, it suggests a possible positive social feedback loop of pointing and language skills in infants younger than 18 months old: the bigger vocabulary size infants have, {{the more likely they}} point, the more words they hear, and then the faster they develop their vocabulary. In the second experiment, we tested whether 16 -month-old infantsโ pointing gestures facilitate infantsโ word learning in the moment. Infants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions: the experimenter labeled an unfamiliar object with a novel name 1) immediately after the infant pointed to it (the point contingent condition); 2) when the infant looked at it; or 3) at a schedule predetermined by a vocabulary-matched infant in the point <b>contingent</b> <b>condition.</b> After hearing the objectsโ names, infants were presented with a word learning test. Results showed that infants successfully selected the correct referent above chance level only in the point <b>contingent</b> <b>condition,</b> and their performance was significantly better in the point <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> than the other two conditions. Therefore, only words that were provided contingently after pointing were learned. Taken together, these two studies further our understanding of the correlation between early gesture and vocabulary development and suggest that pointing plays a role in early word learning...|$|E
40|$|Stanfordโs โpsi-mediated {{instrumental}} responseโ (PMIR) model {{proposes that}} psi is a largely unconscious process and is โneed servingโ, {{such that it}} is driven by rewards or punishments for the organism utilising it, usually in an evolutionarily adaptive manner. A series of successful experiments conducted by Luke and associates have explored the PMIR model with an automated non-intentional forced-choice psi task with outcome contingencies that vary in pleasantness commensurate with psi task success. Explorations of the salience of the contingency task, however, produced findings apparently contrary to the predictions of the PMIR model, so the present study aimed to replicate this experiment but monitor subjective judgements of task pleasantness to ascertain whether the contingent tasks were valid. An opportunity sample of 41 participants completed 10 trials each of the non-intentional forced-choice psi task, with 20 randomly allocated to the no <b>contingent</b> <b>condition</b> and 21 to the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition.</b> Findings {{were consistent with the}} previous experiment with above-chance psi scoring, although non-significant, and a higher psi score for the no-contingent condition as previously, though also non-significant. However, subjective task pleasantness ratings indicated that participants found the no-contingent condition significantly more pleasant than either of the contingent conditions, thereby supporting a PMIR interpretation of the unexpected findings. Out of a number of individual difference measures only sheepโgoat psi belief was found to predict psi score, as also found previously with this test paradigm. The findings are discussed in the light of previous studies, with suggestions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Even though {{information}} is spatially and temporally irrelevant, it {{can influence the}} processing of subsequent information. The present study used a spatial cuing paradigm to investigate the origins of this persisting influence by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. An irrelevant color cue that was either contingent (color search) or non-contingent (shape search) on attentional sets was presented prior to a target array with different stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOA; 200, 400, 800 ms). Behavioral results indicated that color cues captured attention only when they shared target-defining properties. These same-location effects persisted over time but were pronounced when cue and target array were presented in close succession. N 2 pc showed that the color cue generally drew attention, but was strongest in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition.</b> A subsequently emerging contralateral posterior positivity referred to the irrelevant cue (i. e. distractor positivity; Pd) was unaffected by the attentional set and therefore interpreted as an inhibitory process required to enable a re-direction of the attentional focus. CDA was only observable in the <b>contingent</b> <b>condition,</b> indicating the transfer of spatial information into working memory and thus providing {{an explanation for the}} same-location effect for longer SOAs. Inhibition of this irrelevant information was reflected by a second contralateral positivity triggered through target presentation. The results suggest that distracting {{information is}} actively maintained when it resembles a sought-after object. However, two independent attentional processes are at work to compensate for attentional distraction: The timely inhibition of attentional capture and the active inhibition of mental representation of irrelevant information...|$|E
