5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in <b>currency</b> <b>speculation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable paper currency at the time. In late 1861, to help finance the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue paper currency. After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the premium on gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 cents in gold. This fueled <b>currency</b> <b>speculation</b> (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting dollar bills in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging a premium for providing silver coins), or the issuance of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|E

40|$|A salient {{feature of}} recent <b>currency</b> <b>speculations</b> in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism {{is that the}} speculators can be big {{strategic}} players in the market, along with the central bank. This paper develops a game-theoretic model that captures this feature of the speculative market. For a regime with a narrow fluctuation band, the analysis identifies the following factors affecting the equilibrium exchange rate movement: the cost and benefit considerations for both the speculator and the central bank, and {{the credibility of the}} band. The analysis also provides a framework {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} different anti-speculation policy instruments, including reserves, interest rates, and capital controls. It suggests a potentially useful scheme that penalizes the speculators only on their post-speculation gains (a `windfall tax'). For a wide-band regime, this paper shows the possibility of multiple equilibria, giving rise to a `wall within the wide band'. Such a `wall' serves as a barrier to exchange rate movements and therefore helps stabilize exchange rate fluctuations, although it does not eliminate the possibility of the collapse of the system. The model implies a U-shaped unconditional distribution for the narrow band and a W-shaped distribution for the wide band. ERM; Exchange Rate; Speculative Attack; Target Zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the {{interaction}} of <b>currency</b> intervention, <b>speculation</b> and sentiment, and their influence on the exchange rate dynamics across the developed and developing countries. This thesis tackles the three factors attributable to the unsolved issues in the field, i. e., the lack of proper data set or proxies, theoretical foundation, and structural models. After reviewing the related literature, microstructure frameworks are built with theoretical set-ups, e. g., the international parities, the forward rate bias and central bank credibility. Then the transmission channels of currency interventions, the reaction functions of central banks, and the impacts of the speculators activity and psychology are examined with cointegrated VAR methodology. In doing so, this thesis offers thorough structural and identified analyses of developed and developing country currencies in a joint theoretical framework. Therefore, this thesis fills some methodological, theoretical and empirical gaps {{in the field of}} international finance. Furthermore, it provides not only suggestions for future empirical and theoretical research but also policy implications for central banks across developed and developing countries...|$|R

We use a model of a fixed exchange rate system that allows for multiple equilibria and, therefore, makes possible the identification of self-fulfilling speculation. The devaluation probability is computed using the "drift adjustment method". The model performs satisfactorily in tracking monthly devaluation expectations and presents some important advantages over a simple linear regression of macroeconomic variables on the devaluation probability. We do not find evidence that self-fulfilling speculation was at work in the period preceding the Brazilian currency crisis of January 1999. This suggests that the breakdown of the Brazilian managed exchange rate system was due to the deterioration of the fundamentals of the economy. <b>currency</b> crisis, self-fulfilling <b>speculation,</b> multiple equilibria, Brazilian exchange rate system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} classic {{question}} regarding {{the costs and}} bene¯ts of limiting exchange rate volatility starting from the premise that asset markets play an impor-tant role in aggregating information. I ¯nd that government trading, despite being completely observed, alters the ability of an asset market to reveal information. The main insight of the paper is that managing the exchange rate reduces the correlation and informational content of the exchange rate regarding persistent fundamentals and increases the correlation with short-run shocks. The result arises from the impact of government intervention on private <b>speculation.</b> <b>Currency</b> speculators {{have an incentive to}} di®erentiate shocks based on capital gains potential (which is related to persistence) and speculative trading therefore determines how exogenous shocks are re°ected in the equilibrium exchange rate. By smoothing the exchange rate, the government reduces the speculative incentive to separate shocks.

Primary data collection involved collection of data from a sample of 74 respondents, with 42 respondents returning the self - administered questionnaire. This was triangulated by data collected through interviews with 18 key informants. Secondary data in the form of literature relevant to the topic as well as document review was utilised. The following were the major findings of the study; In order to survive during the period of hyperinflation pension funds changed portfolio composition and diversified investments into non core activities. Pension funds also adopted decentralisation of decision making in order to make faster decisions and allow for quick adaptation to changes in the economic environment. Retrenchment strategies, differentiation of services and short term planning horizons were adopted as survival strategies in the hyperinflation period. Conversion of Zimbabwe dollars to foreign <b>currencies</b> and <b>speculation</b> in commodities were also adopted as survival strategies. Under sudden currency change in the economy pension funds changed their costing structures through variation in the level of charges, employing innovation strategies and changing planning horizons to medium term and long term plans.
