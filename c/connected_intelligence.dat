50|$|The {{essential}} part of transreality gaming {{is considered to be}} the fluidity between physical and virtual stages of gameplay, making it more and more difficult to see the distinction between what is allegedly 'virtual' and what is allegedly 'real' while playing. Looking at a transreality game from that perspective it may also integrate (big) data feeds into the storylines of games as a means to make the gameplay more immersive, like in the setup of Liping Xie's experimental scientific simulations in which a population of sample individuals search a real-world optimum in a virtual problem space, driven by real world forces in that space. Further on it could benefit from new layers of reality mining, <b>connected</b> <b>intelligence</b> and ubiquitous computing that incorporate machines into our lives like the Internet of things and wearable computing (both using sensors that are able to immediately re-create the actual world on and around a player on his or her device), cryptocurrencies, micropayments and nanopayments (for handling transmedial game credits), deployment of cleverbots, mind files and intelligent agent systems (to enhance the natural feel and learning skills of game characters) and games using kinetics (through motion controllers or through haptics).|$|E

As a system it seeks to overcome overload or excess of irrelevant information in Internet, in order to facilitate specific or pertinent research. It is an extension of the existing Web in which the aim is for cooperation between and the computer and people (the dream of Sir Tim Berners –Lee) where machines can give more support to people when integrating and elaborating data in order to obtain inferences and a global sharing of data. It is a technology that is able to favour the development of a “data web” in other words the creation of a space in both sets of interconnected and shared data (Linked Data) which allows users to link different types of data coming from different sources. It is a technology that will have great effect on everyday life since it will permit the planning of “intelligent applications” in various sectors such as education and training, research, the business world, public information, tourism, health, and e-government. It is an innovative technology that activates a social transformation (socio-semantic Web) on a world level since it redefines the cognitive universe of users and enables the sharing not only of information but of significance (collective and <b>connected</b> <b>intelligence)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{believe that}} the major problem facing {{traditional}} artificial intelligence (and the functional theory of mind) is how to <b>connect</b> <b>intelligence</b> to the outside world. Some turned to robotic functionalism and a hybrid response, that attempts to rescue symbolic functionalism by grounding the symbol system with a connectionist hook to the world. Others turned to an alternative approach, embodied cognition, that emerged from an older tradition in biology, ethology, and behavioural modelling. Both approaches are contrasted here before a detailed exploration of embodiment is conducted. In particular we ask whether strong embodiment is possible for robotics, i. e. are robot "minds" similar to animal minds, or {{is the role of}} robotics to provide a tool for scientific exploration, a weak embodiment? We define two types of embodiment, Loebian and Uexkullian, that express two different views of the relation between body, mind and behaviour.

40|$|We are {{studying}} the problem of <b>connecting</b> <b>intelligence</b> to performance {{in the context of}} autonomous agents with very limited capabilities, where performance is suspected to include very few parameters and be easier to quantify than in more complex cases. We are reviewing and comparing three behavioral models that solve three typical autonomous agent problems, the explorer robot [1][2], the food-collector ant [3] and the cooperative tit-for-tat agent [4]. In all three cases and despite the apparent differences between them, we have defined a single problemdependent performance measure and, on that basis, we have found that the most intelligent among several alternative models, i. e., the one that to the eyes of an observer achieves better performance, is a selfregulatory model involving a two-level regulatory process and an internal variable representing the state of the problem-solving process, thus self-assessing recent performance. The power of the agent lies in the second level and re [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a charged Higgs boson (H±) would be a clear indication for physics beyond the Standard Model. This thesis describes searches for charged Higgs bosons with the ATLAS experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The first data collected during the LHC Run 1 is analysed, searching for a light charged Higgs boson (mH±<mtop), which decays predominantly into a tau-lepton and a neutrino. Different final states {{with one or two}} leptons (electrons or muons), as well as leptonically or hadronically decaying taus, are studied, and exclusion limits are set. The background arising from misidentified non-prompt electrons and muons was estimated from data. This so-called "Matrix Method'' exploits the difference in the lepton identification between real, prompt, and misidentified or non-prompt electrons and muons. The Matrix Method is used in all charged Higgs boson searches in this thesis. In 2024 the LHC will be upgraded into a High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The ATLAS detector is expected to collect around 300 fb- 1 of collision data until 2022, whereas the HL-LHC will deliver about 250 - 300 fb- 1 of data per year.  This will increase the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing, resulting in larger particle fluxes. This puts challenging requirements on the electronics. In order to keep trigger and data rates at manageable levels, new trigger concepts require more intelligence at early stage which possibly results in more cables and connectors, inside the detector which lead to degraded performance of the detector system. This thesis presents new concepts using wireless technology at 60 GHz, in order add more data links inside the detector system without adding much material. Patch antennas have been developed, operating at 60 GHz. Manufacture methods have been investigated, and the fabrication tolerances and bandwidth of these antennas have been studied. Also, concepts of using passive repeaters have been investigated, to make the 60 GHz signal pass boundaries. These repeaters can be used to <b>connect</b> <b>intelligence</b> inside the detector, but also for reading out data from the whole detector radially...|$|R
