25|$|Tort law in India is a {{relatively}} new common law development supplemented by codifying statutes including statutes governing damages. While India generally follows the UK approach, there are certain differences which may indicate judicial activism, hence creating controversy. Tort is breach of some duty independent of contract which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to <b>civil</b> <b>cause</b> of action and for which remedy is available. If there is no remedy it cannot be called a tort because the essence of tort is to give remedy to the person who has suffered injury.|$|E

25|$|Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corporation, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court, relying on Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, held that to {{establish}} standing under the civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision that creates a <b>civil</b> <b>cause</b> of action for any person or entity injured in their business or property by reason of a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she was the direct victim of the defendant's RICO violation (e.g., a business may not sue a competitor that may have gained a competitive advantage by not paying taxes). The Court explained that this construction will save district courts from the difficulty of determining an indirect victim's damages caused by attenuated conduct.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} privacy is {{protected}} by Article 30 of the Basic Law and Article 14 of the Bill of Rights. At statutory level, protection is mainly offered by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which has quite a limited scope. It stipulates six data protection principles which must be adhered to when dealing with personal data. Non-compliance with the principles is not a criminal offence but the party concerned may be served with an enforcement notice by the Privacy Commissioner. Non-compliance with an enforcement notice is punishable by a penalty of a fine at Level 5 and imprisonment for 2 years. The statute also creates a <b>civil</b> <b>cause</b> of action: an individual who suffers damage, including injured feeling, by reason of a contravention of the Ordinance in relation {{to his or her}} personal data may seek compensation from the data user concerned.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court disagreed. In {{the words}} of Justice Kennedy, [...] " [...] {{analysis}} begins -- and...largely ends -- with Holmes." [...] In [...] the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) claimed that Petitioner Robert Holmes conspired with others to manipulate stock prices. Share prices dropped when the fraud was detected, causing two broker-dealers great financial difficulty, which led to their liquidation. SIPC thus had to advance nearly $13 million to cover the broker-dealers' customer claims. SIPC sued Holmes claiming that he participated {{in the conduct of}} an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of section 1962(c) and conspired to do so in violation of section 1962(d). The Court looked to legislative history to interpret section 1964(c)'s provision of a <b>civil</b> <b>cause</b> of action for people injured [...] "by reason of" [...] a defendant's RICO violation.|$|E
2500|$|They next {{tackled the}} {{question}} {{of the role of the}} Courts in the judicial review process. Under the Act, parents are provided a <b>civil</b> <b>cause</b> of action in courts when other administrative appeals are exhausted. The Court rejected the petitioners' contention that this right to judicial review only applied to procedural review of the administrative appeals and whether the decision was based on sufficient evidence. However they likewise stopped short of the denovo review that the Rowleys had advocated for which would allow the courts to prescribe particular educational methods like the District Court had. Rather, the majority held that a court must assess two question: [...] "First, has the State complied with the procedures set forth in the Act? And second, is the individualized educational program developed through the Act's procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits? If these requirements are met, the State has complied with the obligations imposed by Congress, and the courts can require no more." [...] Quoting San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, the Court reiterated that the judicial branch lacks the expertise [...] "to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy." ...|$|E
