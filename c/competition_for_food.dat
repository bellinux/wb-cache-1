5|$|A large, diverse {{family of}} wading birds. Different lengths of legs and bills enable {{multiple}} species {{to feed in}} the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> There are about 89 species worldwide, 32 {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Scolopacidae is a {{large and}} diverse family of small to {{medium-sized}} shorebirds which includes the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. Most eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or sand. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} {{that there is}} serious <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, and {{the large numbers of}} larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E

5|$|Scolopacidae is a {{large and}} diverse family of small- to {{medium-sized}} shorebirds, including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> Fourteen species have been recorded in Tasmania, five as vagrants only.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{threatened}} by fires, used to maintain crop fields in the vicinity, which frequently {{get out of control}} and destroy part of the viscacha's habitat on the Cerro, and by <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> with grazing cattle. However, the species is unknown to the local people and is not hunted. In view of its small range and population, Ledesma and colleagues recommended the species be assessed as critically endangered under the IUCN Red List criteria and recommended immediate conservation action to protect the Cerro El Ahuaca population and further research into its biology.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E
50|$|The {{offspring}} of the Kawau Island population {{are smaller than}} their fully wild relatives, even when provided with ample food: it appears that <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> limited <b>food</b> resources on the island selected for smaller individuals, an incipient example of the phenomenon of insular dwarfism.|$|R
50|$|They {{are thought}} to have evolved this feeding habit because few other animals eat {{mushrooms}} and therefore there is little <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> the <b>food</b> resource. When mushrooms were placed near nests of E. procera they were by far the main consumer of the mushrooms with other animals barely feeding on them.|$|R
30|$|Results of shorter studies draw a {{clear picture}} of {{negative}} invasive crayfish effects on fish. <b>Competition</b> <b>for</b> shelter and <b>food</b> can be identified as the main reasons for fish decline.|$|R
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> are reduced.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|The major {{risks to}} the jaguar include {{deforestation}} across its habitat, increasing <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> with human beings, especially in dry and unproductive habitat, poaching, hurricanes in northern parts of its range, and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock. When adapted to the prey, the jaguar {{has been shown to}} take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a declining}} species now due to <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> its {{invertebrate}} <b>food</b> from introduced trout, pollution, forest destruction, and damming of mountain rivers for hydroelectric schemes. The Chilean population {{seems to be}} relatively stable.|$|R
5000|$|The ornate box turtle is an omnivore, with no {{particular}} dietary preferences; as an opportunistic feeder, it eats whatever {{is available in}} any given location or season. [...] Grasses, berries, insects and other invertebrates (caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles, earthworms), fruits, vegetables, and carrion (mammals, birds, amphibians, snakes, and even other turtles). [...] This varied diet means the turtle has very little <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> available <b>food</b> resources.|$|R

5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> An Italian study showed that the {{vegetable}} part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. <b>Competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus casuarius is {{widespread}} throughout the lower {{unit of the}} Dinosaur Park Formation. In it, Corythosaurus {{was found to be}} closely associated with the ceratopsid Centrosaurus apertus. Their associating was found in the Dinosaur Park, Judith River, and Mesaverde formations, and also in the Wind River Basin and the Wheatland County area. Corythosaurus lived alongside numerous other giant herbivores, such as the hadrosaurids Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, the ceratopsids Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, and ankylosaurids Scolosaurus, Edmontonia and Dyoplosaurus in the earliest stages of the formation, Dyoplosaurus, Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus in the middle age, and Euoplocephalus alone in later stages of the formation. Studies of the jaw anatomy and mechanics of these dinosaurs suggests they probably all occupied slightly different ecological niches in order to avoid direct <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> in such a crowded eco-space. The only large predators known from the same levels of the formation as Corythosaurus are the tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus libratus and an unnamed species of Daspletosaurus.|$|E
40|$|Although caribou and muskoxen coexist {{in close}} {{proximity}} on southeastern Victoria Island, they appear primarily adapted to different diets and foraging strategies. Visual inspection and analysis of rumen contents for fiber and lignin from the study (unpubl.) also indicate a predominantly graminoid diet in the muskoxen and a more varied diet with a substantial browse component in the caribou. This should {{reduce the likelihood of}} <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> limited <b>food</b> resources in winter...|$|R
50|$|A few species, such as Anelosimus eximius, {{are also}} {{known to have}} {{reproductive}} skew, {{where some of the}} females reproduce and others do not. Even though these spiders cooperate by caring for each other's young, cooperating in prey capture and sharing food, they are not considered eusocial as they do not have defined castes. Any female has the potential to reproduce, therefore differences in the reproductive success is due to <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> scarce <b>food</b> resources rather than the existence of physically distinct castes.|$|R
5000|$|This {{division}} {{consists of}} those Histeridae {{that live in}} close proximity with social colonies of arthropods such as ants and termites. Histeridae that live near ants can live in a harmonious or hostile relationship. The hostile Hister beetles feed on the ants. The harmonious Hister beetles eat the same food as the ants, however {{they may not be}} in direct <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> the <b>food.</b> [...] These beetles have an excretory organ that produces an odor telling the ants they mean no harm.|$|R
5|$|For a while, Red and {{her pack}} are happy, feeding off the {{plentiful}} carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack's {{way of life}} is upset by an invasion of large Acrocanthosaurus, huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death of one of the chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red's sister. Red, torn between a prospective mate and her kin, tries to defuse the situation. Two Acrocanthosaurus watch the commotion and take the opportunity to attack the Utahraptor. Meanwhile, a Kronosaurus ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures the female Acrocanthosaurus into deep water where the larger predator is dragged under by the Kronosaurus. Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.|$|E
5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs dug from the ground, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate crane fly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages.|$|E
40|$|McDonald's {{operates}} in the Czech Republic already eighteen years. This publication describes the {{position on the}} Czech market for catering services. The main task is to determine what effect this pattern of Czech cuisine, and which age group visit it most. This thesis analyzes through the questionnaire survey {{the current state of}} culinary job market in Prague and the views and preferences of residents of the capital. Furthermore, it also deals with the ongoing globalization, the big U. S. chains like McDonald's reinforcing and the presence of <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> fast <b>food</b> chains...|$|R
50|$|There is also {{greater risk}} to the owl when it is out during the daytime. All of the diurnal raptors see owls as mortal enemies in <b>competition</b> with them <b>for</b> <b>food</b> and territory. Accordingly, wild birds of prey will attack an owl mercilessly if given the opportunity, even killing it if they're able to do so.|$|R
50|$|The diet of Geoffroy's tamarin {{is similar}} to some species of tyrant flycatcher birds in Panama, and they share similar vocalizations. The {{tamarins}} may use the flycatcher calls to help find favorable food sources. The flycatchers and tamarins have different patterns of activity, which minimizes <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> similar <b>food</b> sources. The flycatchers are most active shortly after dawn and tend {{to rest in the}} middle of the day. The tamarins do not become active until about 45 minutes after full daylight, but remain active for most of the remaining daylight hours until an hour or less before sunset.|$|R

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, {{although}} it will occasionally {{feed on the}} ground. Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory, flying back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills. Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When not breeding, they may also hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes, flies, Hymenoptera, ants and beetles. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300may form where food is abundant, such as agricultural areas, wetlands and sewage works. The pale crag martin drinks in flight as it skims the water surface, although {{at least some of}} its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes. Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry, rocky areas in which the pale crag martin nests, so there is little <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a {{courtship}} flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending {{while the other}} is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of time, and then copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three-coloured and red-throated parrotfinches, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but can be at any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at {{the upper and lower}} corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots. Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side, but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> from other nestlings.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} platyfish {{has been}} released probably due to fish farm or aquarium releases. Specimens in Louisiana were collected near a tropical fish farm. Southern platies, and other introduced poeciliids, have been implicated in the decline of native damselflies on Oahu, Hawaii. Often the distributions of the damselflies and introduced fishes {{were found to be}} mutually exclusive, probably resulting from <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> limited insect <b>food.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elephant beetles {{are black}} {{in color and}} covered with a coat of fine {{microscopic}} hairs. The hairs grow particularly thick on the beetle's elytra. The hairs give the beetle's body a yellowish color. Males have two horns protruding from the head and another from the prothorax. Females have no horns. The horns are used for defense, and in <b>competition</b> among males <b>for</b> <b>food</b> and mates.|$|R
5000|$|Celeus filled an {{ecological}} niche of ant and termite foraging. [...] Most are diurnal foragers whilst the helmeted woodpecker (C. galeatus) {{has been noted}} to be crepuscular. [...] Diet varies between species but may include arthropods, larvae of wood boring insects, ants and termites, plant material, fruit and berries, nectar and sap. Some species of Celeus will sympatrically forage, with other species, as <b>competition</b> <b>for</b> their <b>food</b> is limited due to their specialised foraging strategies. [...] The rufous-headed woodpecker ( [...] C. spectabilis) and Kaempfer's woodpecker (C. obrieni) feed on ants from bamboo canes. [...] Finding prey is by optical cues or sounds made by probing taps. Celeus are similar to other Picidae genera {{in their use of}} anvils and tools <b>for</b> <b>food</b> preparation. Forks in trees (anvils) have been used by this genus to hold <b>food</b> <b>for</b> preparation e.g. removal of stones from cherries. Some cache food in the anvil area.|$|R
