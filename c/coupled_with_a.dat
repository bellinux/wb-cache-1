40|$|The {{correlation}} between depression and dysfunctional marital interaction is well documented, {{but only a}} few studies have examined gender-related differences in marital interaction patterns of <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> depressed partner. In this paper we examined differences in observed marital communication in a sample of 62 Swiss couples presenting for treatment of depression. There were 16 maritally distressed <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> depressed wife, 21 maritally nondistressed <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> depressed wife, 18 maritally distressed <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> depressed husband, and 7 maritally nondistressed <b>couples</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> depressed husband. Marital interaction behavior was found to depend on gender, depression, marital distress, as well as gender of the depressed partner. Our results suggest the need for a gender-sensitive model of the link between marital interaction and depression...|$|R

5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, <b>coupled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, <b>coupled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E

Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply. A large shale oil extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910.

The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her self-sacrifice– sometimes <b>coupled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> maternal element– sexual dominance, and self-destructive fury.|$|E
5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, <b>coupled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> substantial increase in people moving into the area, {{has led to a}} sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24.

5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, <b>coupled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> formidable feeding apparatus, {{made it an}} apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to say it was higher up in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the time}} of its {{discovery}} in 1905, there have been many attempts to estimate the population size of this species. Results varied greatly, but the more recent ones suggest a very reduced number of individuals. This <b>coupled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very restricted distribution have led to the listing of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered or threatened species. Humans frequently invade its habitat, though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures. Recent efforts in conservation include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline size as well as maintaining captive populations.|$|E

Some modern sources note that the accident is not fully explained However, as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the Polish Biographical Dictionary in 1997, no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski's official cause of death is listed as an accident.|$|E
