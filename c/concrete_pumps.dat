25|$|While the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant had {{operated}} safely since 1971, {{an earthquake}} and tsunami {{well beyond the}} design basis resulted in failure of AC power, backup generators and batteries which defeated all safety systems. These systems were necessary to keep the fuel cool after the reactor had been shut down. This resulted in partial or complete meltdown of fuel rods, damage to fuel storage pools and buildings, release of radioactive debris to surrounding area, air and sea, and resorting to the expedient use of fire engines and <b>concrete</b> <b>pumps</b> to deliver cooling water to spent fuel pools and containment. During the incident, pressure within the containments of reactors 1-3 rose to exceed design limits, which despite attempts to reduce pressure by venting radioactive gasses, resulted in breach of containment. Hydrogen leaking from the containment mixed with air into an explosive mixture which resulted in explosions in Unit 1,3 and 4, complicating attempts to stabilize the reactors.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive <b>concrete</b> <b>pumps</b> and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material. Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of <b>pumping</b> to place <b>concrete,</b> the development and refinement of the industry practice to ensure successful <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> are becoming important needs for the concrete construction industry. To date, research on <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> has been largely limited to a few theses and research papers. The major obstacle to conduct research on <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> is that it requires heavy equipment and large amounts of materials. Thus, developing realistic and simple measurement techniques and prediction tools is a financial and logistical challenge that is out of reach for small research labs and many private companies in the concrete construction industry. Moreover, because <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> involves the flow of a complex fluid under pressure in a pipe, predicting its flow necessitates detailed knowledge of the rheological properties of concrete, which requires new measurement science. This paper summarizes the technical challenges associated with <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> and the development in <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> that have been published in the technical literature and identifies future research needed for the industry to develop best practices for ensuring successful <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> in the field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} problem of piston {{striking}} cylinder and pumping insufficiency, an optimization method of <b>concrete</b> open-loop <b>pumping</b> displacement control is derived and presented. In order to control piston stroke effectively, the optimization model of <b>concrete</b> open-loop <b>pumping</b> displacement control parameters is built based on considering the system’s open-loop characteristics. Satisfying the physical constraint of preventing piston striking cylinder and maximizing piston’s effective stroke are taking as the evaluation criterion during the modeling process. Using this method, simulation and experimental research has been proceeded in a type of <b>concrete</b> <b>pump.</b> The result shows that <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> piston can not only meet the noninterference physical constraint, but also increase the pumping efficiency significantly under variable loads. The optimization model provides a new method {{that can be used in}} engineering practice for solving the design problem of <b>concrete</b> <b>pumping</b> open-loop control system under variable loads...|$|R

50|$|The first type of <b>concrete</b> <b>pump</b> is {{attached}} to a truck or longer units are on semi-trailers. It is known as a boom <b>concrete</b> <b>pump</b> because it uses a remote-controlled articulating robotic arm (called a boom) to place <b>concrete</b> accurately. Boom <b>pumps</b> are used on most of the larger construction projects as they are capable of pumping at very high volumes and because of the labour saving nature of the placing boom. They are a revolutionary alternative to line-concrete pumps.|$|R
50|$|The second main type of <b>concrete</b> <b>pump</b> {{is either}} {{mounted on a}} truck or placed on a trailer, and it is {{commonly}} referred to as a line <b>pump</b> or trailer-mounted <b>concrete</b> <b>pump.</b> This pump requires steel or flexible concrete placing hoses to be manually attached to the outlet of the machine. Those hoses are linked together and lead to wherever the concrete needs to be placed. Line <b>pumps</b> normally <b>pump</b> <b>concrete</b> at lower volumes than boom pumps and are used for smaller volume concrete placing applications such as swimming pools, sidewalks, and single family home concrete slabs and most ground slabs.|$|R
