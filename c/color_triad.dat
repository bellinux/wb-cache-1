2500|$|Violent martyrdom {{would have}} been rare among Irish saints until the Norse invasions of the 8th century. A 7th-century Irish homily {{describes}} three kinds of martyrdom: white (bloodless), a separation from all that one loves; blue (or green), the mortification of one's will through fasting and penitential labor; and red (bloody), undergoing physical torture or death. Early Christian theologians such as Basil of Ancyra regarded the forms of martyrdom as external to true virtue. By these criteria, Begnet's description as virgo, non martyr {{may not be a}} self-evident rejection of the status of martyrdom for her. The story of how she left behind her former life, carrying with her only the bracelet that marked her service to the cross, suggests a form of [...] "white" [...] martyrdom. The homily's <b>color</b> <b>triad</b> of martyrdom appears with a fragment of a Latin triad on ethical martyrdom requiring [...] "self-control in abundance, generosity in poverty, chastity in youth." [...] The rejection of marriage by the beautiful young Begnet would be categorized as castitas in iuventute, a form of martyrdom acquired by [...] "chastity in youth" [...] and in early Ireland not considered inferior to that brought about through violence.|$|E

It took three decades and organic light-emitting diodes for Sony to introduce an OLED TV, the Sony XEL-1 OLED screen which was marketed in 2009. Later, at CES 2012, Sony presented Crystal LED, a TV with a true LED-display (in which LEDs are used to produce actual images rather than acting as backlighting for other types of display, as in LED-backlit LCDs which are commonly marketed as LED TVs).|$|E
50|$|Similarly to split-complementary colors {{mentioned}} above, <b>color</b> <b>triads</b> involve three <b>colors</b> in a geometric relationship. Unlike split-complementary colors, however, {{all three}} colors are equidistant {{to one another}} on the color wheel in an equilateral triangle. The most common triads are the primary colors. From these primary colors are obtained the secondary colors.|$|R
50|$|In color theory, color harmony {{refers to}} the {{property}} that certain aesthetically pleasing color combinations have. These combinations create pleasing contrasts and consonances that {{are said to be}} harmonious. These combinations can be of complementary colors, split-complementary <b>colors,</b> <b>color</b> <b>triads,</b> or analogous <b>colors.</b> Color harmony has been a topic of extensive study throughout history, but only since the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution has it seen extensive codification. Artists and designers make use of these harmonies in order to achieve certain moods or aesthetics.|$|R

40|$|The {{system for}} {{colorimetry}} {{adopted by the}} Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) in 1931, along with its subsequent improvements, represents a family of light mixture models that has served well for many decades for stimulus specification and reproduction when highly controlled color standards are important. Still, with regard to color appearance many perceptual and cognitive factors are known to contribute to color similarity, and, in general, to all cognitive judgments of color. Using experimentally obtained odd-one-out triad similarity judgments from 52 observers, we demonstrate that CIE-based models can explain a good portion (but not all) of the color similarity data. Color difference quantified by CIELAB ΔE explained behavior at levels of 81 % (across all colors), 79 % (across red colors), and 66 % (across blue colors). We show that the unexplained variation cannot be ascribed to inter- or intra-individual variations among the observers, {{and points to the}} presence of additional factors shared by the majority of responders. Based on this, we create a quantitative model of a lexicographic semiorder type, which shows how different perceptual and cognitive influences can trade-off when making color similarity judgments. We show that by incorporating additional influences related to categorical and lightness and saturation factors, the model explains more of the triad similarity behavior, namely, 91 % (all colors), 90 % (reds), and 87 % (blues). We conclude that distance in a CIE model is but the first of several layers in a hierarchy of higher-order cognitive influences that shape <b>color</b> <b>triad</b> choices. We further discuss additional mitigating influences outside the scope of CIE modeling, which can be incorporated in this framework, including well-known influences from language, stimulus set effects, and color preference bias. We also discuss universal and cultural aspects of the model as well as non-uniformity of the color space with respect to different cultural biases...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the interactive {{contribution of the}} color {{and size of the}} three areas occupied by the primary colors red, yellow, and blue in adaptations of abstract compositions by Mondrian to the perceived weight of the areas and the location of the balance centers of the compositions. Thirty-six art stimuli were created by experimentally changing the colors in the three areas of six original works so that the resulting five variations and the original constituted the six possible spatial arrangements of the three colors in the three locations. In experiment 1, design-trained and untrained participants determined the location of the balance center of each composition seen on a computer screen and rated the apparent weight or heaviness of each color area. In experiment 2, untrained participants determined the location of the balance centers of the compositions when projected to their actual size. It was found that, for both trained and untrained participants, the perceived weight of a color, especially red and yellow, varied {{as a function of the}} size of the area it occupied. Furthermore, participants in both experiments perceived shifts in the locations of the balance centers between the originals and their altered versions. Only the trained participants, however, perceived significant shifts in balance centers among the five variations of the compositions, demonstrating their superior sensitivity to the contribution of color to balance structure. Taken together, the findings demonstrate the existence of a color - area - weight relationship among <b>color</b> <b>triads</b> in abstract displays and the influence of this relationship on color balance in abstract compositio...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{measures}} for quantifying human color constancy and computational color constancy are very different. The former relate to measurements on individual object colors whereas the latter {{relate to the}} accuracy of the estimated illuminant. To bridge this gap, we propose a psychophysical method in which observers judge the global color fidelity of the visual scene rendered under different illuminants. In each experimental trial, the scene is rendered under three illuminants, two chromatic test illuminants and one neutral reference illuminant. Observers indicate which of the two test illuminants leads to better color fidelity in comparison to the reference illuminant. Here we study multicolor scenes with chromatic distributions that are differently oriented in color space, while having the same average chromaticity. We show that when these distributions are rendered under colored illumination they lead to different perceptual estimates of the color fidelity.

Seventy <b>triads</b> were constructed from 21 equal-lightness Munsell samples, at equal hue steps, forming a rough ellipse in the CIE-LAB plane, and presented to 51 males and 53 females (half young, half elderly adults) who indicated each triad’s “odd-one-out”. Principal Components Analysis, followed by MDS, revealed group differences in judgment reliability, with better performance for female and younger groups. Gender differences in color similarity were more pronounced with age, and specific to sectors of the color circle, arguably involving the use of conventional knowledge of color relationships.

50|$|Dubois-Pillet and Louis Hayet {{were the}} two Neo-impressionists who were most focused on the {{theoretical}} aspects and scientific basis of their art. Starting around 1887, Dubois-Pillet explored the science of color perception as it related to Pointillism by investigating the work of English polymath Thomas Young (1773-1829), who concluded that the eye has three color receptors, each sensitive {{to one of the}} primary colors of light (green, red, and violet). Dubois-Pillet applied Young's findings into a <b>triad</b> <b>color</b> theory which he referred to as passage, whereby a touch of pigment corresponding to each of the primary light colors is included in the passage from one hue to the next. Colors are scientifically decomposed by the artist, then they are recomposed in the viewer's eye, but with a greater luminosity than would have been possible if the colors had simply been mixed on the palette. How to apply his theory in practice wasn't entirely clear, and his fellow Neo-impressionists were not convinced.|$|R
40|$|Context Colors are an {{important}} aspect of video games, they have a key roll when designing everything from characters to world objects. Therefore designers and developers need to know what colors that are preferred over others. Objectives This paper tries to determine which color setting that is the most preferred on a game avatar. Methods To do this an experiment conducted with 15 participants. They conducted a two alternative forced choice test (2 AFC) with 236 pairs of pictures. All of the 236 pairs were based on color harmonies and displayed on an avatar and a cube. The different color harmonies that were used sprung from the three primary colors of the RGB-color wheel that worked as a base in this experiment. The results that were collected went through a Chi-square test. Result Some interesting results were generated from the experiment. For instance, the most preferred color harmony for the avatar was the split complementary with the base in the primary color red. Second to that was the <b>color</b> harmony <b>triad,</b> built on the three primary colors red, green and blue. The color harmonies that had their base in the color green were with zero percent the least preferred of all harmonies. On the other hand the color harmonies that had their base in the color blue were generally the most preferred among all of the harmonies. Conclusion The main conclusion that was made and that could answer the research question was that the most preferred color harmony for the avatar was split complementary red. There were also some conclusions made that could help to create a more general preference for all kind of avatars, if this experiment would be remade on a larger scale...|$|R
40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 8 : 27 in length. The piece selected for this conducting recital was Richard Strauss' Allerseelen, with symphonic band setting by Albert Oliver Davis, edited by Frederick Fennell. The title, German for "All Soul's Day", {{was one of}} the four final pieces of the Op. 10 song set. These songs, dedicated to the famed Munich Opera tenor Heinrich Vogl, were the first of Strauss' Lieder to be published. The last four of these works were penned in November in Meinengen just after Strauss' appointment to assistant conductor under Hans von Bulow. Allerseelen, along with three other works from the set, was debuted in a chamber music recital in Meiningen on March 5, 1886. The original song is a straight forward incipient binary which lasts about three minutes. In contrast, the Davis/Fennel! version for Symphonic Wind Band is much larger. This expansion is achieved through the addition of an introduction, development section, recapitulation, and coda. Thematically much of the piece is based on a four note statement, a descending triad in second inversion with the terminal note repeated, which is heard in the lead horn at the third measure. Beginning at measure fourteen, we are introduced to a process in which the motif is repeated four times, rising from trombones to trumpets, then woodwinds, and finally the horn section. At each <b>color</b> change, the <b>triad</b> is inverted to begin with the chordal member one leap below that which began the previous statement, effectively leading us from first inversion to root position, second inversion, and back to first inversion as a climax. In addition to the preparation of the introduction's closing, this is significant because it foreshadows the added development section based upon the same process, leading to a continuity among the sections added to the original work. At measure twenty-four the original four note fragment is expanded into a full statement of the A theme, thus revealing the previous material to have been introductory in nature. This A section is delivered in two parts and then returned to after a brief 8 section, yielding the incipient binary structure of the original piece. Following this a developmental section is heard based upon the aforementioned inverting process. The development section is followed by an exuberant return of the A theme in varied repetition. It {{should be pointed out that}} while this section is heard as a kind of recapitulation, the structure is not sonata form due to the return of the A section prior to the development. The piece ends with the return of Strauss' original ending, first heard before the development section and now serving as a quasi coda. Faced with such an homogenous piece, the challenge to the conductor lies in balance, pacing, and tone, with the purpose of illustrating for the audience the evolutionary process through which the work is realized. Maintaining the proper balance of color and emphasis is significant in this work due to its thick scoring. Without proper attentiveness in this area the piece can quickly become bogged down beneath its own weight. Related to this is the crucial task of pacing, for the true communication of the piece lies in its struggle to rise above its conflicts. Without careful pacing, the piece has a tendency to feel repetitive, something which is avoided by the meticulous guiding of the piece's energies toward the consummation of the primary theme at measure ninety-one. Lastly, the piece undergoes a series of tone changes, progressing respectively through solemnity, yearning, insecurity, satisfaction denied, anger, strife, celebration, and finally satisfied peace. As mentioned earlier, it is this evolution which communicates with the audience. With so little contrast in the piece these changes in tone become the subject matter of the work, and thus the ability to convincingly portray this process defines the communicative success of the experience...|$|R
