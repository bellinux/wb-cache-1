5|$|Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides {{that are}} of {{interest}} to the medical field, because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for <b>cancer</b> <b>prevention</b> or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T.mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, protecting against radiation, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Lane began advocating <b>cancer</b> <b>prevention</b> through diet, thereby drew {{conflict}} with British Medical Association, and resigned {{from it in}} 1924, renouncing his lucrative private medical and surgical practice, 10 000 pounds a year. In 1925, Lane founded New Health Society, the first organized body for social medicine, which German pathologist and statesman Rudolf Virchow had pioneered in late 19th century to undo disease's sociopolitical causes. The term New Health largely referred to nonsurgical healthcare against constipation. Advertising forbidden of physicians, to avert accusation and disciplining by General Medical Council, Lane had his name deleted from the Medical Register. Lane then promoted his views on healthful diet and lifestyle, including greater intake of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, return to farm land, ample sunlight exposure and physical exercise, and nutritional yeast for B vitamins—Lane's plan to foster defecation thrice daily, <b>cancer</b> <b>prevention,</b> general health, and longevity. Meanwhile, colectomy for constipation was abandoned amid low success rates but high complication rates.|$|E
25|$|Many parents {{opposed to}} {{providing}} the HPV vaccine to their pre-teens agree the vaccine {{is safe and}} effective, but find talking to their children about sex uncomfortable. Dr. Elizabeth Lange, of Waterman Pediatrics in Providence, RI, addresses this concern by emphasizing what the vaccine is doing for the child. Dr. Lange suggests parents {{should focus on the}} <b>cancer</b> <b>prevention</b> aspect without being distracted by words like 'sexually transmitted'. Everyone wants <b>cancer</b> <b>prevention,</b> yet here parents are denying their children a form of protection {{due to the nature of}} the cancer—Lagne suggests that this much controversy would not surround a breast cancer or colon cancer vaccine. The HPV vaccine is suggested for 11-year-olds because it should be administered before possible exposure to HPV, yes, but also because the immune system has the highest response for creating antibodies around this age. Dr. Lange also emphasized the studies showing that the HPV vaccine does not cause children to be more promiscuous than they would be without the vaccine.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{epigenetic}} mechanisms can be perturbed {{in different types}} of cancer. Epigenetic alterations of DNA repair genes or cell cycle control genes are very frequent in sporadic (non-germ line) cancers, being significantly more common than germ line (familial) mutations in these sporadic cancers. Epigenetic alterations are important in cellular transformation to cancer, and their manipulation holds great promise for <b>cancer</b> <b>prevention,</b> detection, and therapy. Several medications which have epigenetic impact are used in several of these diseases. These aspects of epigenetics are addressed in cancer epigenetics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Prevention</b> of <b>cancers</b> can be {{separated}} into primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention preemptively reduces {{exposure to a}} risk factor for liver cancer. One of the most successful primary liver <b>cancer</b> <b>preventions</b> is vaccination against hepatitis B. Vaccination against the hepatitis C virus is currently unavailable. Other forms of primary prevention are aimed at limiting transmission of these viruses by promoting safe injection practices, screening blood donation products, and screening high-risk asymptomatic individuals. Aflatoxin exposure can be avoided by post-harvest intervention to discourage mold, which has been effective in west Africa. Reducing alcohol abuse, obesity, and diabetes would also reduce rates of liver cancer. Diet control in hemochromatosis could decrease the risk of iron overload, decreasing the risk of cancer.|$|R

25|$|HIPAA {{restrictions}} on researchers have affected {{their ability to}} perform retrospective, chart-based research {{as well as their}} ability to prospectively evaluate patients by contacting them for follow-up.

Another study, detailing the effects of HIPAA on recruitment for a study on <b>cancer</b> <b>prevention,</b> demonstrated that HIPAA-mandated changes led to a 73% decrease in patient accrual, a tripling of time spent recruiting patients, and a tripling of mean recruitment costs.|$|E
25|$|The Greens {{base their}} health {{policies}} on prevention, and claim to consider health {{in areas such}} as organic agriculture, active transportation, urban planning, and education. In particular, party policy closely links the areas of disease prevention and environmental health, with policies such a ban on cosmetic pesticides, a <b>Cancer</b> <b>Prevention</b> Act, and doubling funding for the Ministry of Health Promotion. Policies on health care include expanding the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) system, increasing support for multidisciplinary clinics (those with doctors, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, and other health care professionals), and increasing support for midwifery, along with a number of administrative reforms. GPO policy emphasizes a reduction in health care costs through avoidance of illness and expansion of alternative access models (such as CCACs), rather than simply closing facilities or increasing expenditures.|$|E
