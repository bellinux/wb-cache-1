40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{theoretical}} and computational investigation is {{conducted to examine}} {{the performance of a}} fuel injection system fitted with a <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve,</b> used to power a high speed direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The delivery valve (conventional layout) in the fuel injection system of diesel engines is used to provide a residual pressure in the fuel pipeline for the next injection. However, this layout often results in secondary injections which have a serious effect on engine performance. This problem is more severe in the cases of maintaining high residual pressure values. The use of a secondary valve placed inside the delivery valve, called the <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve,</b> eliminates this problem by relieving the fuel pipe from the high pressure fluctuations caused by the pressure waves reflected at the injector end and the delivery valve chamber. A relevant experimental investigation is conducted with such a fuel injection system on a high speed direct injection diesel engine, examining the effect of load and speed on the performance of the fuel injection system. The experimental results compare well with the theoretical results obtained from a comprehensive simulation model developed by the present authors. Also, results are presented using the simulation model for the same fuel injection system without being fitted with the <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve,</b> revealing the occurrence of secondary injections at a high engine speed. The simulation model offers very useful information concerning the design of such a fuel injection system and may be used during the development procedure providing economy in time and {{a better understanding of the}} entire injection process...|$|E

Sudden pressure fluctuations arising from flashing or cracking are controlled by the <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> which release pressure if it exceeds the set-pressure.

5000|$|For example, if the {{temperature}} in the evaporator increases, the pressure in the diaphragm increases causing the needle to lower. Lowering the needle allows more of the working fluid into the evaporator to absorb heat. The pressure at the inlet of the evaporator affects the position of the needle and prevents the working fluid from flowing back into the compressor. Since the <b>pressure</b> before the <b>valve</b> is higher than the <b>pressure</b> after the <b>valve,</b> the working fluid naturally flows into the evaporator. The pressure at the inlet of the evaporator acts on the diaphragm. There is also a spring providing a <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> closing the <b>valve</b> needle.

Lu et al. [14] presented a <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> control system {{that consisted of}} frictionless cylinders, a large tank and a pneumatic proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> A hybrid controller combined with Bang-Bang, PD controller and fuzzy PID was proposed to minimize the pressure fluctuations in cylinders. The pneumatic-pressure-load system researched in Ref.

In the pneumatic pressure signal generator [16], electro-pneumatic proportional directional valve was used to control the air-flow rates of injecting and outflowing the chamber to regulate the pressure. Because of the nonlinear characteristics, an intelligent coordinate control method, combining expert intelligent coordinator, expert controller, and fuzzy neural network controller, was designed to improve dynamic response and steady state accuracy of the generator.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess CSF dynamics of different shunt constructions in patients with adult hydrocephalus syndrome and correlate these findings to clinical outcome, neuroradiology, and the specifications of the shunts provided by the manufacturer. Thirty four patients with idiopathic adult hydrocephalus (normal pressure hydrocephalus) syndrome were included in a prospective, consecutive case series. A differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> (Cordis Hakim standard system) was used in 28 patients and a variable resistance valve (Cordis Orbis-Sigma) in six. A <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> infusion method was used; CSF pressure and conductance were determined before surgery. Three months after shunt placement CSF pressure, the "pressure v flow" curve, and gravity induced flow were measured. There {{was no difference between}} mean preoperative and postoperative resting CSF pressures in patients with Hakim shunts. The opening pressures of the Hakim shunts were higher than the value proposed by the manufacturer. A pronounced gravity effect induced CSF flow and decrease of the CSF pressure. In functioning variable resistance valves, CSF dynamics normalised postoperatively. There was no gravity effect and the characteristics shaped "pressure v flow" curve was sometimes seen. Six patients (three differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves,</b> three variable resistance valves) had non-functioning shunts. Four of these patients were improved after the operation but improvement was transient in three. In all patients, there was no relation between the width of the ventricles and clinical improvement or CSF pressure. In conclusion, the differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> system does not behave according to the specifications provided by the manufacturer. A decrease in CSF pressure in patients with this shunt was solely due to the effect of gravity. Eleven percent of the differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves</b> and 50 % of the variable resistance valves were non-functioning.

40|$|Background: Sophisticated shunt valves {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and antisiphon control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential <b>pressure</b> or flow-regulated <b>valves</b> for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves,</b> 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves</b> assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R
