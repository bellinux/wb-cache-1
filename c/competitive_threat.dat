25|$|When the Scottish Clan Line {{shipping}} company became {{a joint venture}} partner in the Hunting Group's air transport business in late-1953, {{this resulted in a}} split of the group. As a consequence, Hunting's aircraft manufacturing activities were not transferred to the new holding company that took control of the airline and its maintenance support. At that time, the Clan Line was one of two UK shipping lines controlled by the Cayzer shipping magnates. Sir Nicholas Cayzer, who headed the Cayzer family's shipping businesses, viewed his stake in one of Britain's leading contemporary independent airlines as a defensive move to ward off air transport's growing <b>competitive</b> <b>threat</b> to the shipping industry. During that period, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the contemporary Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, signalled the Government's willingness to let Hunting-Clan shift its base to London Airport (now London Heathrow).|$|E
25|$|The {{city had}} a {{deepwater}} port. In the early 19th century, many business leaders in Maryland were looking inland, toward the western frontier, {{for economic growth}} potential. The challenge was to devise a reliable means to transport goods and people. The National Road and private turnpikes were being completed throughout the state, but additional routes and capacity were needed. Following {{the success of the}} Erie Canal (constructed 1817–25) and similar canals in the northeastern states, leaders in Maryland were also developing plans for canals. After several failed canal projects in the Washington, D.C. area, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C) began construction there in 1828. The Baltimore business community viewed this project as a <b>competitive</b> <b>threat.</b> The geography of the Baltimore area made building a similar canal to the west impractical, but the idea of constructing railroads was beginning to gather support in the 1820s.|$|E
25|$|Post {{deregulation}} Lothian experienced alternating {{periods of}} competition and stability with the other major bus operator in Edinburgh, First in Edinburgh (First), and its previous incarnations SMT/Eastern Scottish. During this time Lothian acquired a number of smaller Edinburgh operators. In 2001, Lothian alleged anti-competitive practises by First. This claim was later rejected. Other operators such as Stagecoach Fife, E Horsburgh, Perryman's Buses and MacEwans also operate stage services into Edinburgh, but as these tend to be long-distance routes or subsidised local services they are not generally a <b>competitive</b> <b>threat.</b> One lasting effect of competition was the extension of Lothian services beyond the City of Edinburgh boundaries, in response to incursion by Eastern into Edinburgh city services. However, Lothian subsequently withdrew from West Lothian, leaving this area to First, with the sole exception of a night bus service between Longstone depot and Livingston which is operated primarily {{for the use of}} staff who live in West Lothian. Although this service is not widely advertised to the public, they are permitted to use this service. Withdrawal from this area and not the others that Lothian extended into has caused concern amongst residents who had experienced low fares and greater choice of services during the period when Lothian and Eastern Scottish were competing. During the time in which it was not served by Lothian Buses, West Lothian Council remained a shareholder of the company. In 2014, Lothian Buses began to again serve to the historical area of the county after taking over a contracted service to South Queensferry and Kirkliston. However, these towns are located in the City of Edinburgh council area under present-day municipal boundaries.|$|E

From February to May 1967, this included Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's Are You Experienced, the Velvet Underground's The Velvet Underground and Nico, and the Beatles' Sgt.

Up until this point, the Beatles were the only act that posed a <b>competitive</b> <b>threat</b> to the Beach Boys, and Wilson was concerned that if Smile followed in the wake of another critically successful release by the Beatles, that his album would be received with unjust comparisons.

2500|$|Spanish ships plying the China trade {{probably}} {{stopped in}} California every year after 1680. Between 1680 and 1740, Spanish merchants out of Mexico City financed thriving trade between Manila, Acapulco and Callao. [...] In Manila, {{they picked up}} cotton from India and silks from China. [...] The Spanish Crown viewed too much imported Asian cloth to Mexico and Lima as a <b>competitive</b> <b>threat</b> to the Spanish American markets for cloth produced in Spain, and as a result, restricted the tonnage permitted on the ships from Manila to Acapulco. [...] Mexico City merchants in retaliation overstuffed the ships, even using the space for water to carry additional contraband cargo. [...] As a result, the ships coming from Manila had enough water for two months, but the trip took four to six months. (Hawaii was unknown to the Spanish navigators). The sea currents take ships sailing from Manila to Acapulco up north, so that they first touch land at San Francisco or Monterey, {{in what is now}} California. [...] By the late 18th century, imperial war was heating up between Britain and Spain. [...] In 1762, Britain occupied Manila in the Pacific and Havana in the Atlantic. [...] This was probably a stimulus for Spain to build presidios at San Francisco and Monterey in 1769. The British, too, stepped up their activities in the Pacific.
