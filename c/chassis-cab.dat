Of course, the <b>chassis-cab</b> could also be ordered on its own, again in a choice of lengths, so that bespoke bodywork could be fitted, with the added option of either single or double cabs. The 200 series continued to be offered as minibus or crewbus.|$|E

50|$|The FDNY Bureau of EMS {{utilizes}} Type I Ambulances, {{which are}} based on the <b>chassis-cabs</b> of light duty pickup-trucks, This type was chosen over the Type II ambulance that are based on a passenger/cargo van chassis and the Type III {{which are based}} on <b>chassis-cabs</b> of light duty vans due to the ability to fully customize the passenger compartment. Type I ambulances also offer a higher load-capacity and additional compartment space when compared to the two other types. These ambulances are also more resilient to the stresses placed on them in a high volume EMS system in an inner city environment.|$|R
50|$|Bridge {{transporting}} trucks had a {{stake body}} 20 ft long for carrying bridging equipment and components. In the M939 series {{there were no}} standardized bridge models, instead specialized bodies were mounted on <b>chassis-cabs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Two {{models have}} been used as rocket launchers. During World War II US6 <b>chassis-cabs</b> carried the {{impressive}} [...] "Stalin's Organ" [...] Katyusha rocket launchers. In 1959-1964 the M35 series M398 was the launcher for the unsuccessful Lacross guided missile.|$|R

50|$|Most models had 11.00x20 size tires with dual rear tires, bridge {{trucks and}} some <b>chassis-cabs</b> had 14.00x20 with dual rear tires. Early M939s used 11.00x20s with dual tires, but M939A1s had 14.00x20s with single rear tires and M939A2s {{introduced}} a central tire inflation system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{short-lived}} K2 Sherpa had a neater {{appearance and}} much improved side-access to the load bay. The Sherpa van {{could now be}} bought in 200, 230, 250 and 280 versions. The crewbus and minibus continued in 250 form. Loadspace remained at , but a new [...] "Hi Capacity" [...] walk-thru body was also offered, built on either the 255 or 280 <b>chassis-cab,</b> and offering [...] of loadspace. An optional Luton body took loadspace up to , again {{with a choice of}} basic <b>chassis-cab</b> GVWs.|$|E
50|$|The 1972 D Series {{was made}} {{famous in the}} {{television}} show Emergency!, where a D300 <b>chassis-cab</b> was the featured paramedic rescue squad vehicle for all seven seasons.|$|E
50|$|Chassis Cab: The <b>chassis-cab</b> {{is used as}} a {{flatbed truck}} and a box van. The box van {{can be used as a}} street vending van, an ambulance, or a {{delivery}} van. It is available in all sizes.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} applications of Avia trucks was the Klöckner Humboldt Deutz Spanish subsidiary designed Avia-Deutz firefighting engine. Based on an Avia 3500L <b>chassis-cab,</b> it featured an air-cooled Deutz engine built with German Magirus firefighting equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, the Super Duty name {{made its}} return as Ford {{developed}} a dedicated <b>chassis-cab</b> model, slotted high enough above the F-350 {{to become a}} Class 4 truck. Badged F-Super Duty, the 1987-1997 vehicle was never sold as a pickup truck.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 {{came the}} Alouette version {{which was a}} simpler version of the minibus with {{removable}} seats that could convert it into a camper van and was indeed popular with French conversion companies. Finally a <b>chassis-cab</b> version was introduced onto which innumerable bodies could be fitted.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} needed yet more space, a Luton-style body was offered, built {{on either the}} 255 or 350 chassis-cabs, {{providing}} capacities of 11.3 m³ (400 cu. ft) (with 200 series cab) or 15.6 m³ (550 cu. ft) (300 series), and a maximum payload of almost 2 tonnes. The <b>chassis-cab</b> also {{formed the basis for}} a standard- and wide-bodied drop-side pick-up, in 255, 280, 285, 310 and 350 versions, again available with either short- or long-wheelbases. Of course, the <b>chassis-cab</b> could also be ordered on its own, again in a choice of widths and lengths, so that bespoke bodywork could be fitted, with the added option of either single or double cabs. The 200 series continued to be offered as minibus or crewbus, but the 300 series was also offered as a minicoach seating up to 18 people.|$|E
50|$|The Ram was {{redesigned}} {{again for}} 2002 (the Dakota in 2005), basically as an {{evolution of the}} original but now featuring the revival of Chrysler's legendary Hemi V8 engine. New medium-duty <b>chassis-cab</b> models were introduced for 2007 (with standard Cummins turbo-diesel power), {{as a way of}} gradually getting Dodge back in the business truck market again.|$|E
50|$|The {{panel van}} {{configuration}} {{is available in}} all sizes, while the <b>chassis-cab</b> and cut-away configurations are offered only in 136 in and 159 in wheelbases. The window van is available only in the 159 in wheelbase and 99 in roof height. The ProMaster is produced in Chrysler’s manufacturing facility in Saltillo, Mexico, and was first available in October 2013.|$|E
50|$|The FMTV {{is based}} on the Austrian Steyr 12 M 18 (4x4) truck, but {{substantially}} modified to meet U.S. Army requirements that included a minimum 50% US content. The original 15 FMTV prototypes were assembled in Austria and while based on the 12 M 18 <b>chassis-cab,</b> were fitted with a number of US-supplied/specification components including a Caterpillar diesel engine, Allison automatic transmission and Meritor drive axles.|$|E
50|$|For the 2015 model year, the Ford Transit was {{introduced}} {{for sale in}} North America for the first time, replacing the E-Series passenger and cargo vans in the US and Canada. Although the Transit was also introduced in cutaway and <b>chassis-cab</b> configurations for North America, Ford has continued commercial production of the E-Series in cutaway cab and stripped chassis configuration; no planned date is set {{for the end of}} production.|$|E
50|$|In September 2011, Ford of Europe {{confirmed}} that Southampton {{would continue to}} make the short and medium wheelbase, and Tourneo minibus versions, of the Transit for two more years. Production of these was then to be consolidated to Turkey with the new model in 2014, while Southampton was to continue as the European centre for the <b>chassis-cab</b> variant of the new Transit, with production ramped up to 35,000 units a year.|$|E
50|$|In late 2006, the Super Duty {{trucks were}} also given an all-new platform. While {{using the same}} bed and cabin as before, these are {{distinguished}} from their predecessors by an all-new interior and a much larger grille and head lamps. Previously available only as a <b>chassis-cab</b> model, the F-450 now was available as a pickup directly from Ford.From 2004 to 2006 offered a different bed style as well.|$|E
5000|$|The Cowley name never {{appeared}} on the commercial vehicles but became associated nomenclature in 1950 when a range of commercial vehicles based on the Morris Oxford MO was introduced [...] The Cowley MCV was offered in van, pick-up and <b>chassis-cab</b> versions. The 10cwt MCV van was a replacement for the Morris Y-series van and had a capacity of 120 cuft L or 138 cuft L without the passenger seat.|$|E
50|$|The original, {{integral}} pick-up had {{now been}} dropped {{in favour of}} a drop-side pick-up built on the Sherpa <b>chassis-cab.</b> The 255 and 280 chassis-cabs were also available on their own, ready to receive bespoke bodywork. Engine availability continued unaltered, with 1.7 and 2.0-litre O-series petrol units, the 1.8-litre B-series diesel and the option of a Landi-Hartog LPG conversion, first introduced at the launch of Freight Rover the year before. A 4WD Sherpa van was also now offered.|$|E
50|$|The initial Sherpa line-up {{consisted}} of vans in 185, 215 and 240 versions (where 185 denotes a GVW of 1.85 tons, and so on); pick-ups in 215 and 240 versions; a 240 crewbus and minibus; and various <b>chassis-cab</b> options in 220 and 250 versions. Payloads were quoted as 13/14cwt for the 185; 18/19cwt for the 215 and 220; and 22/23cwt for the 240 and 250. Loadspace, at , was considerably {{higher than that}} of the J4 and only just short of the 250JU's.|$|E
50|$|The URO VAMTAC {{comes with}} four-wheel drive capability, and is {{available}} in three primary configurations - command and control, <b>chassis-cab,</b> and pick-up. The first comes with a four-door cab. The latter two versions are available with three cab types: two-door, four-door, or a four-door version with smaller rear doors and less cab space. Shelter type or cargo bodies such as hardtops {{can be added to}} the rear compartment, as well as weapons. It can accommodate a wide range of weapons including machine guns, grenade launchers, anti-tank missiles, 81 mm mortars, M40 recoilless rifles and light air defence missiles.|$|E
50|$|The Morris ½-ton series III was a {{commercial}} vehicle {{variant of the}} Morris Oxford series III. It was introduced in 1956, replacing the Morris Cowley MCV and was offered in van, pick-up and <b>chassis-cab</b> body styles. The series III {{was replaced by a}} Morris version of the Austin A55 van in 1962. The commercials never had the series III bonnet and headlamp cowels. Again the Cowley name never appeared on the vehicles and it is very likely that no more left the factory after 1960. A gown van based on this vehicle appears in the Peter Sellars film Wrong Arm of the Law.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a switch}} to an aluminum-intensive body {{similar to the}} F-150, Ford created a {{potential}} 700 lbs of weight savings; {{in spite of the}} addition of heavier-duty frame and driveline components, the 2017 Super Duty weighs in at up to 350 lbs less than comparable 2016 models. Ford strengthened the frame and drivetrain with fortified drive shafts, axles, brakes and the 4WD transfer case. [...] F-250 and F-350 pickups are built on a fully boxed frame; <b>chassis-cab</b> models are produced on a frame boxed up {{to the rear of the}} cab and of C-channel design rearward.|$|E
50|$|For 2008, Dodge {{introduced}} {{two more}} Chassis Cab models, the 4500 and 5500. These were Class-4 and Class-5 trucks with a gross weight of 16500 lb and 19500 lb, respectively. Both trucks came {{equipped with the}} same version of the Cummins 408 cuin L diesel as the 3500 <b>chassis-cab</b> model. Sterling, who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the Sterling Bullet with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of Freightliner LLC which, like Dodge, was owned by the former DaimlerChrysler. Sterling Trucks was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the Sterling brand was phased out by Chrysler Corporation, the Bullet was discontinued.|$|E
