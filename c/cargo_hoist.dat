It displayed nose art depicting an elephant carrying a large crate on its back labeled [...] "supplies". During World War II, the XC-105 carried freight and personnel to and from Florida, and throughout the Caribbean, based out of Albrook Field beginning in June 1943. Hundreds of young women were flown in [...] "Grandpappy" [...] from Miami to the Canal Zone to engage in US government work; these trips were dubbed the [...] "Georgia Peach Run". [...] "Grandpappy" [...] traveled to the Galapagos, landing on Baltra Island at the same airfield built following the XB-15 aerial survey of May 1940.|$|E

50|$|The C-47 {{differed}} from the civilian DC-3 in numerous modifications, including being fitted with a <b>cargo</b> door, <b>hoist</b> attachment, and strengthened floor, along with a shortened tail cone for glider-towing shackles, and an astrodome in the cabin roof.|$|R
50|$|By 1918, the boilers on Bellingham were {{considered}} too worn {{out for the}} vessel to be of any further service as a powered ship. The fittings and machinery was therefore removed and scrapped by the firm of Neider & Marcus. In March 1919 Bellingham was sold to H.C. Strong who was doing business as the Sunny Point Packing Company. The powerless vessel {{was taken to the}} King and Winge shipyard in West Seattle which converted the ship into an unpowered sailing barge which still retained the name Bellingham. A donkey engine with steam driven by a vertical boiler was installed, which powered two <b>cargo</b> <b>hoists.</b> The vessel was also rigged with auxiliary sails, although these appear to not have been used very much.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{official}} opening occurring in 1846, {{the construction of}} the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a hydraulic <b>cargo</b> handling <b>hoist</b> system, {{the first of its kind}} in the world. Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the piermaster, his assistant & the warehouse superintendent; and a cooperage.

40|$|Abstract: The wave-induced {{motions of}} a ship can cause large pendulations of <b>cargo</b> being <b>hoisted</b> by a ship-mounted crane. In this paper, the authors show that {{controlling}} the boom-luff angle can reduce these pendulations significantly. A planar pendulum with a rigid massless cable and massive point load is used to model the system. A control law using delayed position feedback is developed, and the controlled system is simulated on a computer using the full nonlinear equations of motion. The computer simulation results are verified experimentally using a three-degree-of-freedom ship-motion simulation platform and a 1 / 24 th scale model of a T-ACS crane.

50|$|In the commando-transport configuration, the Panther {{may carry}} up to 10 fully armed {{soldiers}} on board {{at a time}} in addition to the two pilots flying the aircraft. The main cabin can be rapidly reconfigured to conduct various roles, such as troop-transport, SAR, and MEDIVAC missions; optional equipment includes a full medical suite, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera, emergency flotation, loudspeaker, variable-speed <b>hoist,</b> <b>cargo</b> sling, search light, and a stretcher-support structure.|$|R
5000|$|Conifers {{engineering}} plant {{consisted of}} two Cooper-Bessemer straight-8 cylinder, 4-cycle diesel engines. Because of their distinctive rumble, the Coopers were {{referred to as the}} [...] "rock-crushers". Each diesel drove a Westinghouse DC generator. The DC electricity powered a single Westinghouse main-motor, which was coupled directly to the propeller shaft. The 5-bladed prop measured 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m) in diameter. The <b>cargo</b> boom and <b>hoist</b> winches were electric powered. The boat davits were hand-cranked, while the falls were fair-led to the aft towing capstan.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{auxiliary}} power unit installed on the AW169; instead, the transmission features a clutch to allow the rotors to be stopped while the engines continue to run to power the avionics and onboard electrical systems. On customer request, the AW169 can be equipped with a comprehensive full ice protection system; a limited ice protection system may also be alternatively integrated. To meet differing customer's requirements and preferences, the AW169 can be configured with numerous optional items of equipment, such as auxiliary fuel tanks, rescue <b>hoist,</b> <b>cargo</b> hook, emergency flotation aids, external cameras, rappelling fittings, wire strike protection system, mission consoles, external loudspeakers, and external lighting arrangements.|$|R
25|$|The AW139 {{is powered}} by two FADEC-controlled Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C {{turboshaft}} engines; the FADEC system seamlessly adjusts the engines for pilot convenience and passenger comfort, and can automatically handle a single-engine failure without noticeable deviation. It was constructed with maintenance requirements in mind; critical systems can be readily accessed, where possible the number of parts has been reduced, and many components have been designed for an extended lifecycle; a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) is also equipped. In excess of a thousand customizable items of equipment can be configured per customer demand, including auxiliary fuel tanks, rescue <b>hoists,</b> <b>cargo</b> hooks, search and weather radar, ice protection systems, external cameras and search lights, and seating arrangements.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a modern}} {{airplane}} {{one can find}} numerous mechanical systems with gears, power drive units, drive shafts, actuators, hoists and other mechanical parts. People used to call helicopters [...] "flying transmissions". Today an average airplane has more transmission components than a helicopter. The common transmission mechanical components of an airplane are: high lift system, bay door actuation system, cargo door actuation system, landing gears, <b>hoists,</b> <b>cargo</b> door actuation systems and sometimes primary flight control system. The overall cost and weight of the mechanical system of an airplane can {{be similar to the}} cost and weight of the helicopter transmission. Reduction of weight and cost of mechanical systems is important for reduction of the overall operating cost of the airplane.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{a landing}} ship, {{infantry}} would transport its cargo of infantry from its embarkation port to {{close to the}} coast to be invaded. This location (known as a [...] "transport area" [...] in a US Navy task force, or [...] "lowering position" [...] in a Royal Navy task force) was approximately 6-11 miles off shore (11 miles was amphibious doctrine for the USN by mid-war, while the RN tended to accept {{the risks associated with}} drawing nearer the shore). The troops would then transfer to landing craft, most commonly LCAs, for the journey to the beach. The landing craft would return to the LSI after disembarking their <b>cargo</b> and be <b>hoisted</b> up to embark additional troops.|$|R
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, <b>hoist,</b> <b>cargo</b> hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|R
50|$|When the Flying Dutchman falls {{behind the}} Black Pearl during a chase, Jones calls upon the Kraken {{to finish it}} off; whereupon Will orders the crew to fire the deck guns into the monster's tentacles, forcing the Kraken to retreat. Moments later, the Kraken destroys the cannons before attacking {{the rest of the}} ship. Will then has kegs of gunpowder, rum, and other {{combustibles}} loaded into a <b>cargo</b> net and <b>hoisted</b> aloft; and when the Kraken returns, Sparrow shoots the barrels, blasting the monster's tentacles in the resulting explosion, whereupon the Kraken again withdraws. However, knowing that they have only enraged the beast, Sparrow orders the crew to abandon ship; but recognizing that the Kraken is only hunting Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann distracts Jack with a kiss and chains him to the mast, then escapes with the crew. The Kraken makes its final assault just as Sparrow frees himself, after which the Kraken drags Sparrow and the Black Pearl to Davy Jones' Locker.|$|R
50|$|Dependent on the configuration, the AW189's cabin can {{accommodate}} up to 19 passengers and two crew members on crashworthy seats. According to AgustaWestland, the AW189 possesses the largest cabin in its class, which is accessed via large sliding doors {{on either side}} of the fuselage; a separate externally accessed baggage compartment is also present. The interior is customised to the mission role being undertaken, these include a self-contained emergency medical service (EMS) layout, passenger configurations (with in-flight entertainment systems offered), mission consoles for SAR and law enforcement operations, and an optional dividing wall between the cockpit and main cabin may also be installed. Under certain conditions and limitations, the rotorcraft can be flown by a single pilot. Various pieces of optional equipment can be installed upon the AW189, including fast roping kits, external electric <b>hoist,</b> <b>cargo</b> hook, air conditioning, auxiliary fuel tanks, mission console, emergency flotation system (certified up to Sea State 6), external life rafts, emergency lighting, external search light, main cabin bubble windows, wire strike protection system, de-icing systems providing multiple levels of protection.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} powered by three Caterpillar Diesel Generator sets. One ran {{at all times}} {{providing}} power for the station. Multiple storage tanks were situated around the station to hold fuel for these generators. On a lower level from the station was a boat house and a crane engine building. The crane was operated by another Caterpillar engine. The island had no landing place with sheer cliffs rising on all sides. To get on or off the island, other than by helicopter, the crane was {{hooked up to a}} sixteen-foot fiberglass boat with an outboard engine, The men would climb into the boat and be swung by the crane {{over the edge of the}} island and dropped the sixty feet to the water. To get back on the boat had to be maneuvered under the hook at the base of the cliff, attached and lifted back up. Needless to say this was not any easy feat and was seldom done in rough weather. Resupply was accomplished the same way, <b>hoisting</b> <b>cargo</b> nets of supplies up onto the boathouse deck.|$|R
40|$|Ship-mounted cranes {{are used}} to {{transfer}} cargo from large container ships to smaller lighters when deep-water ports are not available. The wave-induced motion of the crane ship produces large pendulations of <b>hoisted</b> <b>cargo</b> and causes operations to be suspended. In this work, we show that in boom type ship-mounted cranes, {{it is possible to}} reduce these pendulations signicantly by controlling the slew and lu angles of the boom. Such a control can be achieved with the heavy equipment that is already part of the crane so that retrotting existing cranes would require a small eort. Moreover, the control is superimposed on the commands of the operator transparently. The successful control strategy is based on delayed-position feedback of the cargo motion in-plane and out-of-plane of the boom and crane tower. Its eectiveness is demonstrated with a fully nonlinear three-dimensional computer simulation and with an experiment on a 1 / 24 scale model of a T-ACS (The Auxiliary Crane Ship) crane mounted on a platform moving with three degrees of freedom to simulate the ship roll, pitch, and heave motions of the crane ship. The results demonstrate that the pendulations can be signicantly reduced, and therefore the range of sea conditions in which cargo-transfer operations could take place can be greatly expanded...|$|R
