The nation borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo for most of its southern border, the coastal nation of Cameroon to its west, South Sudan to its east, and Chad to its north.

It sent a single male athlete to participate at those games, and did not send another delegation again for another three Olympics. The nation returned at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and sent its largest delegations (15 athletes) at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, and sent its first female athletes to the Barcelona games. In total, the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic competed at eight games between its 1968 debut and its appearance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

5|$|<b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic President David Dacko, Bokassa's cousin, {{took over}} the country in 1960, after winning a power {{struggle}} against Abel Goumba. Bokassa left the French army to join the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now commander-in-chief of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a gendarmerie headed by police chief Jean Izamo, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, after the exiled <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. This move was met with international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from Côte d'Ivoire in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the <b>Central</b> <b>African</b> Republic attained formal independence from France.|$|E
