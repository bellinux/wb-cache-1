40|$|Statement of the Problem: Water {{purification}} {{systems for}} domestic use have drawn significant attention {{over the past}} few years. This can be related to the improvement of public health and concern for water contamination. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether home water purification systems eliminate the essential materials such as fluoride besides filtrating the heavy ions and other unwanted particles out of water. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, six most frequently used com-mercial brands of water purifiers were evaluated and compared. Specimens were collected right before and after setting up the device, and 6 months later. Then, spec-trophotometry (the Harrison device) was performed to compare fluoride clearance by each home water <b>cleaner</b> <b>device.</b> Results: Based on the data collected from all water purification devices in different locations, the amount of fluoride was significantly different before and right after using home water purifier and six months later (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 00, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{designed}} and tested a system called the Bag and Belt <b>Cleaner</b> <b>Device</b> (B&BCD) to reduce dust levels {{in and around}} the bag conveying and stacking process. The device physically cleans either 22. 7 kg (50 lb) or 45. 4 kg (100 lb) paper bags by using a combination of brushes and air jets. It is completely self-contained and is kept under negative pressure by a baghouse to ensure that dust and product removed from the bags during cleaning does not flow into the work environment and contaminate workers. The bags travel through the device on a chain conveyor, which permits any product or dust cleaned from the bags to fall into a hopper {{at the bottom of the}} device and be recycled back into the process via a screw conveyor. Once exiting the B&BCD, the outside of the bags and the conveyor are essentially product and dust free. The B&BCD was evaluated at two mineral processing plants to determine reductions with the device in use. The results of both field evaluations showed that the amount of product removed from the outside of the bags varied from 77 to 93 pet...|$|E

40|$|American {{consumers}} {{have started to}} {{recognize the value of}} improved indoor air quality. Consequently, many Americans have purchased portable air <b>cleaners,</b> including <b>devices</b> that remove particles by generating ions. Portable ion generators are appealing because they are quiet and use considerably less energy than HEPA filters and other air <b>cleaners.</b> However, these <b>devices</b> often do not remove enough particles to be effective, do generate enough ozone (a byproduct of their operation) to be of concern, and can generate ozone reaction products including secondary organic aerosols. This paper summarizes our recent research as well as the work of others. We demonstrate that portable ion generators have low clean air delivery rates (CADRs) for 5 nm- 10 µm particles, generate levels of ozone in typical indoor environments that may lead to adverse health effects, and can act as particle generators. Results strongly suggest that ion generators do not have a role in sustainable indoor environments...|$|R
40|$|The turbine {{technology}} improvements from 1980 onwards have considerably increased {{mechanical and}} thermal stresses on turbine oils which, cause oil oxidation and thereby turbine oil degradation (Livingstone et al., 2007; Sasaki & Uchiyama, 2002). If the oil degradation problem is ignored, this {{might result in}} serious turbine system erratic trips and start-up operational problems (Overgaag et al., 2009). Oil oxidation by-products, in other words, sludge and varnish contaminants, lead stated turbine operation-tribological problems. Hence, sludge and varnish presence in turbine oil become {{a major reason for}} declining turbine reliability and availability. In the power generation industry, heavy-duty gas turbines as well as steam turbines have been lubricated with mineral based turbine oils for many decades (Okazaki & Badal, 2005). First, generally Group I oils (mineral base oils produced by solvent extraction, dewaxing) were used. Nevertheless, this group of oils has lower oxidation resistance. Therefore, modern gas turbines demand oils which have better oil oxidation resistance, and lower sludge and varnish contaminants tendency (Hannon, 2009). Today, there are many turbine lubricants available on the market. Besides Group I oils, more and more Group II oils (mineral base oils produced by hydro cracking and hydro treating) are selected in service, and having increased oil oxidation resistance. However field inspections demonstrate that Group II oils also experience sludge and varnish problems as well as Group I oils. Primary reason for these phenomena is the antioxidant additive packages that are used in Group II oils (Overgaag et al., 2009). In any case with recent oil formulations, oil degradation products still exist in current turbine oils, {{and will continue to do}} so in natural process. These sludge and varnish contaminants are less than 1 micron in size. Thus, they can pass turbine oil system standard mechanical filters without obstruction. With regard to keep the turbine systems in best operational conditions, external turbine oil cleaning practices became crucial to remove these less than 1 micron size oil degradation products from turbine oils. Current effective method for removing the sludge and varnish is to use electrostatic oil cleaners (Moehle & Gatto et al., 2007). Since the majority of turbine user and operator population have been shifted to use Group II based oils to counter the increased sludge and varnish problems, traditional oil cleaners became insufficient to remove sludge and varnish from Group II. (Due to Group II oils have different oil characteristics such as oil oxidation stability and solvency capability). With this awareness, thesis project is looking for ways to introduce and develop an Advanced Electrostatic Oil Cleaner to increase the availability and reliability figures of heavy-duty gas turbines against the rising amount of oil degradation products in modern formulated turbine oils. ECC (Electrostatic Cooled Cleaner) is an electrostatic oil <b>cleaner</b> <b>device</b> to clean and cool mineral based turbine oils for heavy-duty gas turbine applications by removing the sludge and varnish - oil contaminants from turbine oils. The basic principle of the ECC is based on the electrostatic force produced by parallel positioned electrodes which are charged with a high D. C. voltage. Oil contaminants- sludge and varnish have polar nature. Therefore, they are attracted by electrostatic forces whose intensity is proportional to the voltage applied. With the oil flowing in parallel to these electrodes, the polar particles in the oil (which is only neutral /no polar) are caught by filter media positioned between these electrodes. Small investments on advanced oil cleaner result in big savings on turbine system performance. Increased turbine availability and reliability predominantly reduce maintenance costs and risks besides, and thus maximizing revenue by extending heavy-duty gas turbine operational life. An introduced prototype of the ECC-D 4 model was tested using two Group II and one Group I oils. The amounts of 200 liter (each) test oils were circulated approximately 300 times through the ECC-D 4. In each 3 oil cleaning test sessions, it is proved that the oil insolubles content decreased approximately 40 % in tested turbine oils within about 240 ECC-D 4 operating hours. With taken base of heavy-duty gas turbine characteristics such as 400 MW power production capacity, annually 8000 operating hours, and 15000 liter oil reservoir volume; it is estimated that the ECC-D 4 can extend the oil service-life from 24000 to 48000 operating hours (which is approximately the oil service end-life). In addition to that, assuming the ECC-D 4 investment cost as 30 k€, about 15 k€ savings per year through the new turbine oil and component replacement costs, besides turbine operation profit losses. Moreover, the ECC-D 4 returns on investment with a rate of 39 % for defined heavy-duty gas turbine. In general perspective of ECC-D 4, it makes heavy-duty gas turbine infrastructure innovative, fully integrated and committed to fulfilling the need for clean, efficient, reliable power production practices in an environmental manner. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: This {{study was}} carried out to compare three {{different}} ultrasonic <b>cleaner</b> <b>devices</b> in the cleaning process of endodontic instruments by scanning electron microscope (SEM). METHODS: In this study, 120 unused brand new hand and rotary instruments were examined after removing from the sealed package. The instruments were randomly divided into six groups of 20 rotary or hand files each and observed by SEM before ultra-sonication. Then, every pair of hand and rotary instruments was cleaned {{using one of the}} ultrasonic cleaner brands. Again the instruments were examined by SEM and assessed in three different parts, tip, middle and distance 16 (D 16). SEM data were analyzed by Kurskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests. RESULTS: The tip of the endodontic instruments was the most contaminated area before ultrasonic cleaning. Statistical analysis showed that all of the tested ultrasonic devices were significantly effective machines for debris removal from endodontic instruments. The hand and rotary instruments cleaned by one of the <b>devices</b> were significantly <b>cleaner</b> than the others (P < 0. 050). There was a significant difference in cleaning of the separate parts of the instruments during ultra-sonication among ultrasonic cleaners. The tips of the instruments were significantly cleaner than the D 16 parts (P < 0. 050). CONCLUSION: Various ultrasonic devices have different ability for cleaning of endodontic instruments.

40|$|Abstract – In this work, the {{performance}} of three kinds of integrated optical ring-resonator based slow-light structures for sensing applications is theoretically studied using the transfer matrix method and the complex transmission coefficient approach. Enhancement of sensing performance due to the slow-light phenomenon is quantitatively formulated. The modeling results show that using realistic structure parameters, a refractive index detection limit of one order better than {{the state of the}} art Mach-Zehnder interferometer sensing structure is possible by the inclusion of such a slow-light structure. The role of ring(s) attenuation constant in limiting the usable light slowness and the achievable sensor resolution is also discussed. For a sufficiently small ring attenuation constant, the optimal sensing performance of a single-resonator circuit can be better than that of multiple resonator circuits, while offering less fabrication complexities, <b>cleaner</b> spectra, shorter <b>device</b> length, and higher figure of merit...|$|R

40|$|People spend {{approximately}} {{one third of}} their life sleeping. Exposure to pollutants in the sleep environment often leads {{to a variety of}} adverse health effects, such as development and exacerbation of asthma. Avoiding exposure to these pollutants by providing a sufficient air quality in the sleep environment might be a feasible method to alleviate these health symptoms. We performed full-scale laboratory measurements using a thermal manikin positioned on an experimental bed. Three ventilation settings were tested: with no filtration system operated, use of portable air cleaner and use of a temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) device. The first part of the experiment investigated the air-flow characteristics in the breathing zone. In the second part, particle removal efficiency was estimated. Measured in the breathing zone, the room air cleaner demonstrated high turbulence intensity, high velocity and turbulence diffusivity level, with a particle reduction rate of 52 % compared to baseline after 30 minutes. The TLA device delivered a laminar airflow to the breathing zone with a reduction rate of 99. 5 %. During a periodical duvet lifting mimicking a subject's movement in bed, the particle concentration was significantly lower with the TLA device compared to the room air <b>cleaner.</b> The TLA <b>device</b> provided a barrier which significantly reduced the introduction of airborne particles into the breathing zone.

40|$|Currently {{there are}} no {{standards}} for testing efficacy of medical <b>device</b> <b>cleaners.</b> With fears of prion transmission, residual protein on medical devices needs to be minimised. A bioreactor model was used to grow Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on polytetrafluoroethylene coupons. The biofilm was subjected to various cleaners and residual biofilm was detected either by Crystal Violet assay (CrV) or a commercially available protein assay (PA) following hydrolysis of the biofilm. Percentage reduction of biofilm was compared with untreated controls in three independent tests. There {{was no significant difference}} in percentage biofilm reduction irrespective of whether the CrV or PA was used to detect residual biofilm. Processing of coupons attached to the bioreactor rod and position of coupon within the rod had no significant effect on cleaning efficiency or detection of residual biofilm. Both within-run and between-run variation was very low for good cleaners such as 10 g/L NaOH, Zen, and 3 M Rapid Multi-Enzyme Cleaner (RMEC) 70500 but was higher for poor cleaners such as Tween 20 which removed less than 20 % of the biofilm. Confocal microscopy and electron microscopy provided visual confirmation of the assay results. We propose that this method is suitable as a test method for evaluating the efficacy of surgical instrument cleaners in removing biofilm, as both within-run and between-run variation was low, detection of residual biofilm can be done using either CrV or PA, and the apparatus is easy to use, cheap and readily available. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Domotic Robotic <b>Cleaners</b> are {{autonomous}} <b>devices</b> {{that are}} designed to operate almost entirely unattended. In this paper we propose a system that aims to evaluate the performance of such devices by analysis of their trails. This concept of trails is central to our approach, and it encompasses the traditional notion of a path followed by a robot between arbitrary numbers of points in a physical space. We enrich trails with context-specific metadata, such as proximity to landmarks, frequency of visitation, duration, etc. We then process the trail data collected by the robots, we store it an appropriate data structure and derive useful statistical information from the raw data. The usefulness of the derived information is twofold: it can primarily be used to audit the performance of the robotic cleaner –for example, to give an accurate indication of how well a space is covered (cleaned). And secondarily information can be analyzed in real-time to affect the behavior of specific robots – for example to notify a robot that specific areas have not been adequately covered. Towards our first goal, we have developed and evaluated a prototype of our system that uses a particular commercially available robotic cleaner. Our implementation deploys adhoc wireless local networking capability available through a surrogate device mounted onto this commodity robot; the device senses relative proximity to a grid of RFID tags attached to the floor. We report on the performance of this system in experiments conducted in a laboratory environment, which highlight the advantages and limitations of our approach. 1...|$|R
