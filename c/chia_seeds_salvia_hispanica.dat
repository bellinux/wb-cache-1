Universidade Nova de LisboaDue to {{its high}} {{nutritional}} value and technology capacities, <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L.) {{are considered a}} promising food {{for the development of}} functional products, based on its gelling properties. Characterization of the gelling ability and optimal concentration of chia flour used in formulation of new products, was performed by analysis of physical and chemical properties of the flour and respective gels for different ranges concentrations and different processing conditions. The result of chemical composition of chia flour reinforces the already widespread knowledge about its nutritional value, increasing their potential for the development of new functional products. Considering the raw material used, the optimal conditions for the production of gels are 13 % (w/w) chia flour hydrated for 30 minutes, followed by thermal treatment at 90 °C/ 30 min and subsequent cooling to 5 °C. It was also found that the presence of salt or sugar in the formulation of product allows obtaining culinary preparations with acceptable sensorial characteristics, being possible innovate in many ways in application of chia flour as a food ingredient...|$|E
40|$|Chia seed gum (CSG), an anionic heteropolysaccharide, was {{isolated}} from the seed coat of <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L.). The physicochemical, thermal and rheological properties of the purified CSG were studied. CSG {{was found to be}} composed of a tetrasaccharide repeating unit consisting of ȕ- D-xylose, Į-D-glucose and 4 -O-mehtyl-Į-D-glucuronic acid. FTIR and zetapotential analyses revealed the presence of a large proportion of carboxylic acid groups in CSG indicating polyelectrolyte functionality. CSG samples produced weak gel-like mechanical spectra, with G&# 039; > G" and a weak frequency-dependence in both moduli. The complex dynamic viscosity (|K*|) values of CSG solutions were higher than the corresponding steady-shear viscosity (K), i. e. K(J) 0. 3 g dL- 1). Acid hydrolysis yielded various molecular weight fractions with fairly uniform polydispersity giving the Mark-HouwinkSakurada relationship of [K]= 1. 52 × 10 - 4 M 0. 803 dL g- 1. Differential scanning calorimetric and thermogravimetric analyses showed that CSG was resistant to thermal degradation below 244 o C. Due to the high intrinsic viscosity and low critical concentration, CSG can be considered as a promising stabilizer in many food formulations...|$|E
40|$|A new one-pot {{synthesis}} {{of a novel}} A 3 B-type asymmetric zinc phthalocyanine (AZnPc) was developed. The phthalocyanine complex was characterized unambiguously and used to prepare a TiO 2 hybrid photocatalyst to enhance its photocatalytic activity in the visible range. Different compositions of the phthalocyanine dye were tested {{in order to find}} the optimum amount of sensitizer to get the highest activity during the photocatalytic tests. The hybrid photocatalyst was characterized by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and its photocatalytic activity was compared with that of the individual components considering the effects of sensitization on their efficiency to degrade Rhodamine B as a model reaction. A synergic improvement of the photocatalytic activity for the hybrid system was explained in terms of an improved electron injection from the photo-activated phthalocyanine to the TiO 2. Considering the structural features of the phthalocyanine sensitizer and their effect on aggregation, some mechanistic aspects of its binding to TiO 2 are suggested to account for the photocatalytic activity enhancement. Finally, the inhibitory effect on the sprouting of <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica)</b> was evaluated in order to test the toxicity of the water effluent obtained after the photodegradation process.

40|$|Overweight indices have {{increased}} in the recent years, and thus the occurrence of non-communicable diseases related to them. The recommendation of fat reduction in food may contribute {{to reduce the risk}} of these diseases. Attention has focused on bakery products, such as pound cake, which contains up to 17 g fat/ 100 g product. A novel ingredient, <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L), has been studied for its high water-absorbing and viscous mucilaginous external layer, in order to evaluate its potential as fat substitute in bakery products. We investigated the effects of the replacement of 25, 50, 75 and 100 g/ 100 g of vegetable fat by chia mucilage gel (CMG) on the technological properties of pound cakes. CMG was produced by rehydration with water of lyophilized chia mucilage (LCM). Replacement of vegetable fat by CMG did not significantly alter the specific volume, symmetry, uniformity, moisture and water activity (a(w)) of the cakes. Color parameters, as well as crumb firmness of cakes, were influenced by higher levels of fat replacement with CMG. We concluded that the replacement of up to 25 g/ 100 g of fat by CMG is technologically feasible in pound cakes, with no significant alterations on their quality characteristics.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} effect of the mucilage extracted from chia <b>Chia</b> <b>seeds</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L.) as soil amendment on soil physical properties and on the sorption-desorption behaviour of four herbicides (MCPA, Diuron, Clomazone and Terbuthylazine) used in cereal crops. Three soils of different texture (sandy-loam, loam and clay-loam) were selected, and mercury intrusion porosimetry and surface area analysis were used to examine changes in the microstructural characteristics caused by the reactions that occur between the mucilage and soil particles. Laboratory studies were conducted to characterise the selected herbicides with regard their sorption on tested soils added or not with the mucilage. Mucilage amendment resulted in a reduction in soil porosity, basically due to a reduction in larger pores (radius > 10 µm) and an important increase in finer pores (radius < 10 µm) and in partcles’ surface. A higher herbicide sorption in the amended soils was ascertained when compared to unamended soils. The sorption percentage of herbicides in soils treated with mucilage increased in the order; sandy-loam < loam < clay-loam. The increase in the organic carbon content upon amendment and the natural clay content of the soils are revealed to be responsible for the higher adsorption of Diuron when compared with Terbuthylazine, Clomazone and MCPA. Desorption of the herbicides was higly inhibited in the soils treated with mucilage; only Terbuthylazine showed a slight desorption in the case of loam and clay loam-soils. This study leads to the conclusion that mucilage from Chia seeds used as soil conditioner can reduce the mobility of herbicides tested in agricultural soils with different physico-chemical properties...|$|E

Streszczenie Pacjenci geriatryczni są specyficzną grupą chorych ze względu na to, iż w organizmie starszych osób dochodzi do wielu zmian związanych ze starzeniem się organizmu. Pogarsza się wydolność wielu układów m. in. układu pokarmowego, oddechowego oraz pojawiają się zmiany w naczyniach. Zmiany w motoryce przełyku zwane przełykiem starczym są skutkiem chorób występujących w tej grupie wiekowej. Zmniejsza się kwasowość soku żołądkowego co jest przyczyną zmian atroficznych w błonie śluzowej oraz nadużycia inhibitorów pompy protonowej. Dochodzi również do obniżenia liczby hepatocytów a tym samym zmniejszenia masy wątroby. Do zmian w układzie moczowym zaliczamy zmniejszoną zdolność do zagęszczania i rozcieńczenia moczu a także regulacji pH [1]. Osoby starsze często chorują na nadciśnienie, miażdżycę czy inne schorzenia sercowo-naczyniowe. Do produktów, będących źródłem wielu witamin, minerałów czy składników pożądanych w diecie seniorów możemy zaliczyć nasiona chia. Małe ziarenka, bogate w białko oraz kwasy tłuszczowe omega- 3 i omega- 6, zawierające w 100 g więcej wapnia niż mleko mogą stać się ważnym elementem w diecie osób starszych. Zawarty w nich kwas alfa-linolenowy (ALA) może obniżać ciśnienie tętnicze krwi u osób z nieleczonym nadciśnieniem, wspomaga pracę mózgu, poprawia pamięć i koncentrację oraz posiada działanie protekcyjne na układ krążenia. Badanie GISSI-Prevention Study wykazało, że kwasy omega- 3 mogą zmniejszać ryzyko nagłego zgonu, umieralności całkowitej oraz sercowo-naczyniowej u chorych po świeżo przebytym zawale mięśnia sercowego [2]. Abstract Geriatric patients are a special group of patients, due to the fact that the body of older people there are many changes associated with aging of the body. Deteriorating performance of many systems including the gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory changes occur in the vessels. Changes in the motility of the esophagus called esophageal senile are the result of diseases that occur in this age group. This reduces the acidity of the gastric juice which is the cause of atrophic mucosa and misuse of proton pump inhibitors. This leads also to a reduction in the number of hepatocytes and thereby reduce the weight of the liver. Changes in the urinary system include reduced ability to concentrate and dilute urine and pH adjustment [1]. Older people often suffer from hypertension, atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Products, which are the source of many vitamins, minerals or desirable ingredients in the diet of seniors can include chia seeds. Small grains, rich in protein and fatty acids omega- 3 and omega- 6, containing 100 g more calcium than milk can become an important element in the diet of older people. Included in these alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) may lower blood pressure in people with untreated hypertension, supports the work of the brain, improves memory and concentration and has protective effects on the cardiovascular system. GISSI-Prevention Study showed that omega- 3 may reduce the risk of sudden death, total mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients after recent myocardial infarction [2]...|$|E

40|$|<b>Chia</b> <b>seed</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>Hispanica</b> L.) oil was {{obtained}} by supercritical CO 2 (SC-CO 2) extraction and conventional solvent extraction (CSE). The seeds were from Brazil (seeds and stabilized flour), Sweden and the Netherlands. The processing parameters related to chia oil extraction using different seeds countries have not been studied yet. The chia oils were characterized with regard to fatty acid (FA) composition, antioxidant properties (ABTS, DPPH and FRAP), Peroxide Index (PI), TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and tocopherol. The yield of the extracted oil was 25. 7 - 32. 2 % with CSE and 27. 8 - 31. 8 % by SC-CO 2. The oils mainly contained unsaturated fatty acids (84. 6 - 88. 1 %), the total concentration was similar between the different extraction methods. The ratio of omega- 6 /omega- 3 fatty acid was 0. 40, being markedly better than that reported for other vegetable oils. The SC-CO 2 extracted oil showed greater antioxidant capacity compared with CSE extracted oil, whereas {{no significant differences were}} observed for levels of TBARS and PI. The total tocopherol content ranged from 141 to 601 mg/Kg and consisted mainly of gamma-tocopherol (88 %). This study reveals that <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> oil could be an interesting functional food ingredient. We also propose that SC-CO 2 extraction is a better option than CSE for extraction of <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> oil as it does not require use of organic solvents and is more environmentally friendly...|$|R

The samples with chia addition significantly increased the levels of proteins, lipids, ash and dietary fibre in the final product compared to the control sample. Breads with seeds or ground seeds showed similar technological quality to the control bread, except for the increase in specific bread volume, decrease in crumb firmness and change in crumb colour. Sensory analysis showed that the inclusion of chia increased overall acceptability by consumers. The thermal properties of the starch did not alter substantially with the inclusion of chia. However, the incorporation of chia inhibited the kinetics of amylopectin retrogradation during storage, which would be directly related to the delay in bread staling.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine and compare differences in fat, fatty acids, crude protein and amino acids concentrations for <b>chia</b> and flax <b>seeds.</b> Study was carried out using brown and gold seeds of Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and Chia (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L.). The mean protein content in tested seeds ranged from 211. 8 to 252. 5 g/kg dry matter and in <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> was about 13. 10 % higher than the average value of crude protein content in brown and gold flax seed (223. 25 g/kg dry matter). Differences in the content of individual amino acids among the seeds were not statistically significant (P < 0. 05), except that for glutamic acid. Percentage of the essential to the total amino acids, which is considered as indicator of protein quality, was 37. 87 %, 33. 76 % and 35. 18 %, for chia, brown and gold flax seed respectively, which demonstrates the high quality of these proteins. The average fat content of flax seeds was about 71. 42 g/kg higher than that in <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> (321. 37 g/kg dry matter). The fatty acids composition showed the presence of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, α- linolenic and arachidic fatty acids in all tested samples. The α-linolenic acid constitutes on average 54. 38 % of the total fatty acids of flax seeds and 63. 79 % of <b>chia</b> <b>seed,</b> and for linoleic acid it was 15. 30 % and 18. 89 %.

40|$|Chia (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L.) is an {{expanding}} functional food crop from Central America, but {{little is known}} about effects of new growing environments and agronomical treatments on seed quality. The quality of seeds produced in Europe has never been reported and there’s a lack of information on secondary metabolites of leaves, an emerging product of Chia. In this work, the nutritional quality and oxidative stability of <b>Chia</b> <b>seeds</b> produced in Southern Italy (Basilicata region) have been evaluated, taking into account also different nitrogen fertilization strategies. The quality of seeds produced in Basilicata has been also compared with that of commercially available seeds from traditional and new production areas. Oil extracted from Italian <b>Chia</b> <b>seeds</b> was not quantitatively significantly different, but more rich in chlorophyll, carotenoids and α-linolenic acid than in commercial seeds. Oxidative stability, polyphenols and antioxidant activity were also influenced by seed source. Fertilization system affected free acidity, chlorophyll and carotenoids, whereas it reduced p-Anisidine value, phenols and oxidative stability. Moreover, the metabolic profile of Chia leaves has been reported for the first time; in particular, several flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids, and the two uncommon flavonoids acetyl vitexin and acetyl orientin were found...|$|R
40|$|Chia (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L.) {{constitutes}} a potential alternative raw material and ingredient in food industry applications {{due to its}} dietary fiber content. Gum can be extracted from its dietary fiber fractions for use as an additive to control viscosity, stability, texture, and consistency in food systems. The gum extracted from <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> was characterized to determine their quality and potential as functional food additives. The extracted chia gum contained 26. 2 % fat and a portion was submitted to fat extraction, producing two fractions: gum with fat (FCG) and gum partly defatted (PDCG). Proximal composition and physicochemical characterization showed these fractions to be different (P< 0. 05). The PDCG had higher protein, ash, and carbohydrates content than the FCG, in addition to higher water-holding (110. 5 [*]g water/g fiber) and water-binding capacities (0. 84 [*]g water/g fiber). The FCG had greater oil-holding capacity (25. 7 [*]g oil/g fiber) and water absorption capacity (44 [*]g water/g fiber). In dispersion trials, the gums exhibited a non-Newtonian fluid behavior, specifically shear thinning or pseudoplastic type. PDCG had more viscosity than FCG. <b>Chia</b> <b>seed</b> is an excellent natural source of gum with good physicochemical and functional qualities, and is very promising for use in food industry...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chia</b> <b>seed</b> {{polysaccharide}} (CSP) was {{extracted from}} <b>chia</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica)</b> <b>seeds,</b> and its rheological and microstructural properties in aqueous solutions were studied. CSP solution exhibited Newtonian and shear thinning flow patterns depending on shear rate when the concentration was ≤ 0. 06 % (w/v). CSP solutions at concentrations > 0. 06 % (w/v) exhibited strong shear thinning behaviour within the shear rate tested (0. 001 - 300 s- 1). The transition from dilute to semi-dilute regime {{occurred at a}} critical concentration (C*) of 0. 03 gdL- 1. The intrinsic viscosity was high (~ 16 dLg- 1) and concentration dependence of zero shear viscosity in the semi-dilute regime followed η 0 ∝C 2. 7 relationship. The storage modulus (G&# 039;) was higher than the loss modulus (G″) at all experimental frequencies and their frequency dependence was negligible at all tested concentrations. Apparent shear viscosity was smaller than dynamic complex viscosity at equivalent values of deformation and G&# 039; varied with the square of concentration indicating a gel-like behaviour in CSP solutions within 0. 02 - 3. 0 % (w/v) concentrations. Controlled acid hydrolysis of purified CSP yielded various low molecular fractions with fairly uniform polydispersity giving a Mark-Houwink-Sakurada relationship of intrinsic viscosity equaling to 1. 52 × 10 - 4 (molecular weight) 0. 803 (dLg- 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil on heat shock protein (HSP) and related parameters in diet-induced obese rats. Methods: Animals were divided in six groups: control, high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFF), and HFF with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>chia</b> oil in short (6 -wk) and long (12 -wk) treatments. Plasma indicators of glucose tolerance and liver damage, skeletal muscle expression of antioxidant enzymes, and proteins controlling oxidative energy metabolism were determined. The limit of significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results: The HFF diet induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and altered parameters related to obesity complications. The consumption of <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>chia</b> oil did not reduce body weight gain or abdominal fat accumulation. However, <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil in both treatments improved glucose and insulin tolerance. Chia oil in both treatments induced expression of HSP 70 and HSP 25 in skeletal muscle. Short treatment with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> increased expression of HSP 70, but not HSP 25. Chia oil in both treatments restored superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase expression. Extended treatment with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and short treatment with chia oil restored peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator- 1 alpha (PGC- 1 alpha) expression. Conclusion: Chia oil restored the antioxidant system and induced the expression of a higher number of proteins than <b>chia</b> <b>seed.</b> The present study demonstrated new properties and molecular mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil consumption in diet-induced obese rats.

Freya) root exudates were collected using an aerated hydroponic method and compared to <b>chia</b> (<b>Salvia</b> <b>hispanica</b> L.) <b>seed</b> exudate, a commonly used root exudate analogue. Sandy loam soil passed through a 500 -μm mesh was treated with each exudate at a concentration of 4. 6 mg exudate g- 1 dry soil. Two sets of soil samples were prepared, One set of treated soil samples was maintained at 4 oC to suppress microbial processes. To characterize the effect of decomposition, {{the second set of}} samples was incubated at 16 C for 2 weeks at – 30 kPa matric potential. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the exudates found that barley had the largest organic acid content and chia the largest content of sugars (polysaccharide-derived or free), and maize was in between barley and chia. Yield stress of amended soil samples was measured by an oscillatory strain sweep test with a cone plate rheometer. When microbial decomposition was suppressed at 4 oC, yield stress increased 20 -fold for <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> exudate and two-fold for maize root exudate compared to the control, whereas for barley root exudate it decreased to half. The yield stress after 2 weeks of incubation compared to soil with suppressed microbial decomposition increased by 85 % for barley root exudate, but for chia and maize it decreased to by 87 % and 54 %, respectively. Barley root exudation might therefore disperse soil and this could facilitate nutrient release.
