This paper presents experimental results for the response a simple <b>cable</b> <b>catcher</b> system subject to impact loads delivered using a drop-hammer testing facility. The objectives of this experimental programme were to investigate the loaddeformation behaviour of steel strand cables and to evaluate the dynamic performance of <b>cable</b> <b>catcher</b> systems in reference to their ability to absorb blast energy. Two steel cable arrangements (compacted and normal spiral strand) have been tensile tested in order to provide load-deformation curves as well as experimental values for the breaking load and Modulus of Elasticity. The <b>cable</b> <b>catcher</b> systems with rigid attachments as well as using simple energy absorbing connections were tested under impact loading. It was found that different cable arrangements have different failure modes while properties such as the cable breaking load and Modulus of Elasticity are vital in determining the capacity and behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>catcher</b> systems under loading. Through impact testing, it was found that simple energy absorbing devices are highly effective in reducing the tensile force experienced by the cables. These devices limit the force in the cables to below breaking load and also provide a longer impact time which reduces the likelihood of the cables failing, but also slicing the failed glass panel upon impact...|$|E
