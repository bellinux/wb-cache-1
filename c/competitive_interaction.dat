The <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> of some species pairs were affected even by ambient solar UV-B radiation when compared to control pairs grown without UV-B.

40|$|The primary aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{investigate}} how the human brain handles and distributes limited processing resources among different sensory modalities. Two main hypothesis have been conventionally proposed: (1) common processing resources shared among sensory modalities (supra-modal attentional system) or (2) independent processing resources for each sensory modality. By means of four EEG experiments, we tested whether putative <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> between sensory modalities – regardless of attentional influences – are present in early sensory areas. We observed no <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> between sensory modalities, supporting independent processing resources in early sensory areas. Consequently, we tested the influence of top-down attention on a cross-modal dual task. We found evidence for shared attentional resources between visual and tactile modalities. Taken together, our results point toward a hybrid model of inter-modal attention. Attentional processing resources seem {{to be controlled by}} a supra-modal attentional system, however, in early sensory areas, the absence of <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> strongly reduces interferences between sensory modalities, thus providing a strong processing resource independence...|$|R
40|$|Competition {{is a major}} {{determinant}} of plant growth and is often used in studies of tree growth and species coexistence. However, these approaches are usually temporally static, i. e., assessed at a single point or period in time. While constantly changing forest conditions due to natural and human-induced disturbances potentially alter competition among individuals, static approaches cannot qualify the temporal variability of <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions.</b> Here we present a longitudinal analysis of <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> among trees and discuss the implication of our results for ecological interpretation. Spatially-explicit tree growth data were obtained from 18 study plots (0. 4  ha each) in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) stands in Quebec, Canada. During the studied period (1980 - 2003), these stands had been disturbed by insect outbreaks (forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria Hubner) and by commercial partial harvest. We analyzed radial growth rates (outcome of competition) on an annual basis and as a function of tree biology (bole diameter, crown position), competition (above- and belowground competition from neighbours) and environmental conditions (light availability, harvest disturbance). <b>Competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> changed throughout the studied period. Canopy disturbance from partial harvest interacted with defoliators and influenced competition symmetry by favoring smaller trees. <b>Competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> seemed to have switched from below- to above-ground following canopy recovery after harvest. Release from competition due to partial harvest increase neighbourhood size (radius of effective competition) and enhanced the competitive pressure from larger individuals. The temporal variability in parameter estimates may be used for setting confidence intervals on competitive success (growth rates), thereby yielding a more robust basis for ecological interpretation. Our results also show that temporal variability in <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> could contribute to the maintenance of high tree species diversity and structural complexity in some ecosystems by temporally altering species-specific responses to environmental change and disturbance...|$|R

50|$|Affinity {{chromatography}} is {{a method}} of separating biochemical mixtures based on a highly specific interaction between antigen and antibody, enzyme and substrate, or receptor and ligand. It {{is a type of}} chromatographic laboratory technique used for purifying biological molecules within a mixture by exploiting molecular properties. Biological macromolecules such as enzymes and other proteins, interact with other molecules with high specificity through several different types of bonds and interaction. Such interactions including hydrogen bonding, ionic interaction, disulfide bridges, hydrophobic interaction, and more. The high selectivity of affinity chromatography is caused by allowing the desired molecule to interact with the stationary phase and be bound within the column in order to be separated from the undesired material which will not interact and elute first. The molecules no longer needed are first washed away with a buffer while the desired proteins are let go {{in the presence of the}} eluting solvent (of higher salt concentration). This process creates a <b>competitive</b> <b>interaction</b> between the desired protein and the immobilized stationary molecules, which eventually lets the now highly purified proteins be released.|$|E
5000|$|This drug has ki values {{lower than}} 500 nM for all M1-M4 subtypes demonstrating that {{it acts as}} a {{powerful}} muscarinic compound. ANAVEX2-73 was originally tested in mice against {{the effect of the}} muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine, which induces learning impairment. [...] M1 receptor agonists are known to reverse the amnesia caused by scopolamine. Scopolamine is used in the treatment of Parkinsons Disease and motion sickness by reducing the secretions of the stomach and intestines and can also decreases nerve signals to the stomach. This is done by a direct <b>competitive</b> <b>interaction.</b> Muscarinic receptors are involved in both the short term and long term memories. Researchers in mice have found that M1 and M3 receptor agonists have shown to inhibit formation of amyloid-beta, and to target GSK-3B. Furthermore, M1 receptor activates AF267B, which in turn blocks B-secretase which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein to produce the amyloid-beta peptide. These amyloid-beta peptides aggregate together to form plaque. This enzyme is involved in the formation of Tau plaques common in Alzheimer disease, so therefore M1 receptor activation decreases tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-beta accumulation. Sigma1 activation appears to be only involved in long-term memory processes. This explains partly why ANAVEX2-73 seems to be more effective in reversing long-term memory problems caused by scopolamine compared to short-term memory deficits. Sigma 1 receptor is on the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes and acts as a modulator the ER stress responses and local calcium exchanges with the mitochondria. This compound prevented Aβ25-35-induced increases in lipid peroxidation levels, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cytochrome c release into the cytosol, which are indicative of elevated toxicity. This drug appears to be an important target in Alzheimer's disease to protect against mitochondrial damage. ANAVEX2-73 inhibits mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and therefore prevents against oxidative stress and apoptosis. This drug prevented the appearance of oxidative stress. ANAVEX2-73 also exhibit anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant activity. This is due in part because sigma1 agonists stimulate the anti-apoptoic factor Bcl-2 due to reactive oxygen species dependent transcriptional activation of nuclear factor kB. Results from Marice (2016) demonstrate that sigma1 compounds offer a protective potential, both alone and possibly with other agents like donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, or the memantine, a NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E

40|$|Understanding <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> for {{resources}} within an ecological community is fundamental {{for understanding the}} life histories of organisms in that community. Interspecific competition (competition between members of different species over a limiting resource) is often studied between species of similar size or close evolutionary relationship. <b>Competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> between species of distant taxonomic relationship or very different sizes have been rarely studied. For 22 sites along three transects in the Colorado Front Range and San Juan Mountains, signs of potential <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> between small mammals and ants along elevational gradients were examined. Abundances of ants and small mammals were determined through pitfall (trap sunk into the ground) and mark-and-recapture (trapping, tagging and releasing of animals for recapture to estimate population size) trapping techniques. Proportions of pitfall traps containing ants were determined and compared to the minimum number of mammals known alive (MNKA, number of individuals marked in a trapping effort) using Spearman’s rank-order correlation tests to determine correlations between variables. No direct evidence was found for competition between ants and small mammals (Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient was 0), indicating little to no competition between ants and small mammals in these areas whether food or space resources are readily available.

40|$|The root {{microbiome}} {{is composed}} of an incredibly diverse microbial community that provides services to the plant. A major question in rhizosphere research is how species in root microbiome communities {{interact with each other}} and their host. In the nutrient mutualism between host plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), competition often leads to certain species dominating host colonization, with the outcome being dependent on environmental conditions. In the past, it has been difficult to quantify the abundance of closely related species and track <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> in different regions of the rhizosphere, specifically within and outside the host. Here, we used an artificial root system (in vitro root organ cultures) to investigate intraradical (within the root) and extraradical (outside the root) <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> between two closely related AMF species, Rhizophagus irregularis and Glomus aggregatum, under different phosphorus availabilities. We found that <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> between AMF species reduced overall fungal abundance. R. irregularis was consistently the most abundant symbiont for both intraradical and extraradical colonization. Competition was the most intense for resources within the host, where both species negatively affected each other's abundance. We found the investment ratio (i. e. extraradical abundance/intraradical abundance) shifted for both species depending on whether competitors were present or not. Phosphorus availability did not change the outcome of these interactions. Our results suggest that studies on <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> should focus on intraradical colonization dynamics and consider how changes in investment ratio are mediated by fungal species interactions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|International audienceQuestions: Is {{productivity}} {{linked with}} clonal traits through their indirect effect on <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions?</b> Are clonal traits better predictors of productivity than foliar traits? Location: Rennes, France. Methods: We used a wide-scale mesocosm experiment based on several assemblages of species differing in clonal traits, and evaluated if {{the relationship between}} biomass production and clonal traits is consistent at different ecological scales. Results: Results showed that at the individual level, foliar traits were independent from clonal traits in most studied species. Community specific above-ground net primary productivity was significantly correlated to community-aggregated values of clonal and foliar traits. Nevertheless, a stronger relationship with clonal traits was indicated, emphasizing a plant foraging strategy along the horizontal plant plane, which was a determinant of community productivity. An inverse relationship between clonal traits and biomass production was observed at the individual and community levels, which was attributed to modifications in resource acquisition processes resulting from <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions.</b> Conclusions:We demonstrated that clonal traits are correlated with productivity at the individual and community scales.

40|$|One way {{the effects}} of both ecology and {{environment}} on species {{can be observed in}} the fossil record is as changes in geographical distribution and range size. The prevalence of <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> and species replacements in the fossil record has long been investigated and many evolutionary perspectives, including those of Darwin, have emphasized the importance of <b>competitive</b> <b>interactions</b> that ultimately lead one species to replace another. However, evidence for such phenomena in the fossil record is not always manifest. Here we use new quantitative analytical techniques based on Geographical Information Systems and PaleoGIS tectonic reconstructions to consider this issue in greater detail. The abundant, well-preserved fossil marine vertebrates of the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of North America provide the component data for this study. Statistical analysis of distributional and range size changes in taxa confirms earlier ideas that the relative frequency of competitive replacement in the fossil record is limited to non-existent.
