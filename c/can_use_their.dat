5|$|There {{are several}} other formats used for bouldering {{competitions}}. Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each {{problem with a}} timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> allotted time however they choose. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed {{amount of time to}} complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.|$|E
5|$|Trapper: The Trapper-class {{characters}} <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> gear {{to track}} the Monster's movements. As the Monster occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the trapper can use these 'signs' to find {{the location of the}} monster. Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow the movements of the Monster. Following the release of the Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained the ability to use the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to the monster's smell.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{married his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) over New Year's. However, {{when he returns}} to New York {{following}} the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress. As {{a result of what}} Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. He informs Liz that the minister married the two of them instead of him and Avery. The two set out for a divorce, however, TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> marriage to her advantage as TGS—a show she is the head writer for—is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the fictional network company Kabletown. She demands that Jack, an executive at NBC, give the show its lost budget but he denies the request, as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested the spines represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted the neural spines supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of the spines. The presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a striation pattern {{on the surface of}} the spines similar to the bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that the spines, if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E

25|$|The {{epipelagic zone}} is vast, {{and is the}} home for most pelagic fish. The zone is well lit so visual predators <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> eyesight, is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action, and {{can be a good}} habitat for algae to grow. However, it is an almost featureless habitat. This lack of habitat {{diversity}} results in a lack of species diversity, so the zone supports less than 2% of the world's known fish species. Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish, so epipelagic fish tend to be found in coastal water above the continental shelves, where land runoff can provide nutrients, or in those parts of the ocean where upwelling moves nutrients into the area.|$|E

25|$|The {{burrowing}} owl (Athene cunicularia) is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls {{can be found}} in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.). Unlike most owls, {{burrowing owl}}s are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting.|$|E
25|$|Retaliation has {{occurred}} when {{a sexual harassment}} victim suffers a negative action {{as a result of}} the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects sabotaged, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be fired from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and cyberstalking of the victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.|$|E
25|$|Web-based spiders have poor spatial {{appreciation}} and {{get much of}} their information from reading tensions and movement in their web. P. africana, P. fimbraba and P. labiata <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> eight legs and two palps to pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of movements, using a trial and error method, until it finds and repeats a set of movements that either lures the prey {{out into the open}} or calms the prey while the Portia walks slowly close enough to bite the victim. If the prey stops being controlled by the sequence, the Portia tries new combinations until one works, and then repeats the new sequence. While such hunting shows use of least short-term memory, as of 2011 researchers do not know how long a Portia can retain such memories nor whether a Portia may use different trial and error starts for some prey species.|$|E

25|$|The {{arena is}} divided between Stocke's three-strong {{party and the}} enemy group. The {{battlefield}} itself is laid out on a 3x3 grid, with enemy units being positioned in different squares of the grid, with some enemy types taking up multiple squares. The player party's position is fixed, but enemy units <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> turn to change position on the grid. The battle system itself is turn-based, with each unit on either side being {{given a chance to}} perform an action. Rather than each unit acting once an action is decided, each action is queued once selected, and when all actions are selected the two sides perform their actions. The type of actions an enemy unit can perform depends upon their position on the grid; enemies positioned further back have weaker attack power and strong defence, while those at the front will receive more damage while having a higher attack power.|$|E
25|$|Units {{that can}} attack, do so either {{directly}} (can attack adjacent to another unit where standing or moved, but be counter-attacked {{by the enemy}} unit), or in-directly (must remain still to attack, and have an enemy in firing range). The amount of damage done by a unit to an enemy unit in combat, {{comes down to a}} number of factors: the number of hit points the attacker has, whether they <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> main weapon (if not, they either cannot, or will use their secondary weapon instead), the type of unit the attacker and the defender are, and the terrain the enemy unit is on; by contrast, if the enemy unit is directly attacked, the same factors determine the damage done when they counter-attack the attacking unit. The majority of units have main weapons with a limited supply of ammunition, with the amount of ammo {{depending on the type of}} unit. Units with secondary weapons will resort to these when their primary weapon's ammunition runs out, until they are resupplied.|$|E
500|$|Razor shells can dig {{themselves}} into the sand with great speed to escape predation. When a Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats.

500|$|Skilled ninja {{can learn}} how to use other elements; ninja of the Jonin (lit. [...] "high ninja") rank are {{typically}} able to manipulate at least two elements. Kakashi Hatake has been shown using all 5 different elements in the Naruto series. Although these ninja <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> different elements separately with little effort, combining the two elements is impossible for ninja who do not have a genetic predisposition for it. Ninja with one of these genetic abilities can mix two specific elements to create an entirely new one. Haku, an antagonist introduced {{at the start of the}} series, can mix water and wind to create ice. Wood Style, a combination of earth and water unique to the First Hokage, Danzo, and Yamato, allows the user to produce wood. There is also the Yin-Yang Style and its splintered forms, Yin Style and Yang Style, that only few master, which can counter the other chakra natures.|$|E
500|$|To get a {{new version}} of Spider-Man as a [...] "card", players <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> vials or ISO-8 to open portals to an {{alternate}} dimension from which a randomly selected Spider-Man arrives. Each card can be leveled up and has a star rating called the level cap. To level up a card, players can earn experience points during a run. A card can also be sacrificed to level up another, and by fusing two equal cards, players can increase a card's level cap. By using vials, which usually gives players a 3- or 4-star character, players have a small chance of acquiring a rare version of Spider-Man, while ISO-8 ensures they get a rare one. Each card has a score multiplier that is raised once a Spider is leveled up and a special ability. For example, Spider-Armor increases by 30% the score earned by running. Each card occupies a character slot, of which six are available. Players can unlock slots by completing an issue, or can buy it using vials and, as the price increases, ISO-8s.|$|E

While the game includes its own soundtrack, the player <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> own music stored on the PSP; as noted by Jeff Hasson of Sniper Studios, [...] "for those hard core fans that must have The Offspring playing, they have that option with the Custom Music Player." [...] The player can also record up to a minute of gameplay footage that can then be shared with friends. The game includes a multiplayer feature over the PSP's ad-hoc wireless system, allowing players to vie for fares within the same map, including the ability to steal passengers from another player. Multiplayer games such as time trials or [...] "C-R-A-Z-Y" [...] runs (a variation of the game [...] "Horse") can also be played sharing a common PSP, with each player taking turns within the game.|$|E
