5|$|Martine is {{the head}} of Galbadia Garden. His superior, Balamb Garden's master NORG, orders him to use SeeD members to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{assassination}} plot against Sorceress Edea. When Squall and his team travel to Galbadia Garden after fleeing Timber, Martine orders them to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> mission. He hopes that using Balamb Garden's SeeDs would deflect responsibility for the plot onto NORG. His actions trigger the conflict within Balamb Garden when Garden Master NORG tries to kill Headmaster Cid to appease Sorceress Edea after the mission fails. Afterward, the Galbadian military seizes Galbadia Garden and Martine flees to the pacifist city of Fishermans Horizon.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there would}} be only one chance to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a {{rehearsal}} should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, but gave permission, and later agreed that it contributed {{to the success of}} the Trinity test.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E

5|$|OPCW {{director-general}} Ahmet Uzumcu {{stated in}} early October that completing the destruction process by the mid-2014 deadline {{will depend on}} whether temporary cease-fires can be arranged between opposition and government forces.

5|$|Salah {{planned to}} attempt another attack against Budapest on October 8, and al-Mezahi, whose {{battalion}} would <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> second attempt, took the necessary preparations.

The Sa'iqa company continued to hold its positions east of Budapest for four days, until Salah decided to withdraw it due to the casualties it had sustained.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the raid was to destroy three objectives: the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire {{together}} with the water pumping machinery and other installations, and any U-boats or other shipping in the area. The initial Combined Operations plan required one specially lightened destroyer to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> raid. It would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates.|$|E
5|$|Theodore himself {{remained}} in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially {{he was treated}} with honour, {{but at some point}} during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen and blinded as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.|$|E

5|$|While {{induction}} {{entails the}} transient activation of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) {{is characterized by}} their persistent activation. During this stage, PKMz (Protein kinase Mζ) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, {{they are able to}} <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of naval attacks, {{it was decided that}} ground forces were {{necessary}} to eliminate the Turkish mobile artillery and allow minesweepers to clear the waters for larger vessels. The British Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) that was to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> mission. The MEF consisted of Birdwood's ANZAC, British 29th Division, British Royal Naval Division and the French Corps expéditionnaire d'Orient.

5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the TAB.|$|E
