5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys. When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In the Florida Keys, state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also <b>closed.</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E

Paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> {{parallel runways}} can effectively improve capacity of terminal, and also can solve congestion of busy airport, {{but it also}} increases the complexity of air traffic control. For ensuring safety operation of paired departure, the longitudinal collision risk of paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways was studied. Based on the acceleration error distribution and requirements on wake avoidance during paired departure, a longitudinal collision risk safety assessment model of <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways paired departure was built. The parameters in this model were determined by providing the calculation models. In the end, an example was calculated to verify the model, {{and it turns out}} that this model is feasible. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of the air transport industry, most of the domestic airport, especially hub airports are facing increasingly serious traffic congestion problems. Paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways can effectively improve capacity of terminal, however, due to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways distance between the two runways is less than 760 m, it increases the complexity of runway operation. There were significant differences between paired departure an...|$|R

25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a <b>closed</b> <b>space.</b> They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E

25|$|Barotraumas of ascent {{are also}} caused when the free change of {{volume of the}} gas in a <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> {{in contact with the}} diver is prevented. In this case the {{pressure}} difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system. This pulmonary barotrauma (PBt) of ascent is also known as pulmonary over-inflation syndrome (POIS), lung over-pressure injury (LOP) and burst lung. Consequent injuries may include arterial gas embolism, pneumothorax, mediastinal, interstitial and subcutaneous emphysemas, not usually all at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation into}} the disaster discovered {{that a large number}} of potassium superoxide chemical cartridges, used to absorb carbon dioxide and chemically release oxygen to enable survival, were found in the ninth compartment. But the level of carbon monoxide in the compartment exceeded what people can produce in a <b>closed</b> <b>space.</b> Divers found ash and dust inside the compartment when they first opened that hatch, evidence of a fire. But this fire was separate from that caused by the exploding torpedo. This and other evidence found in the salvaged wreck suggested that the crew were killed when they accidentally dropped one of the chemical superoxide cartridges into the seawater slowly filling the compartment. When the cartridge came in contact with the oily sea water, it triggered a chemical reaction and flash fire. The investigation showed that some men temporarily survived this fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. Captain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov's body was badly burned from below the waist up, and his head and neck were severely disfigured by burns. The fire consumed all remaining oxygen, so that the remaining survivors all died, of burns, asphyxiation, or carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{development}} of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of infectious diseases spread from animals to humans are influenza, smallpox, and measles. In concordance with a process of natural selection, the humans who first domesticated the big mammals quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside Eurasia and Africa. For instance, the population of most Caribbean and several Pacific Islands have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were wiped out by European and African diseases before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the Inca Empire did have a large domestic mammal, the llama, but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental {{to the same extent}} as in other world regions.|$|E

2500|$|The Proto-Indo-European root {{from which}} this noun is derived is *steh₂- (older {{reconstruction}} *stā-) [...] "to stand" [...] (or [...] "to stand up, to step (somewhere), to position (oneself)"), {{which is also the}} source of English to stand, Latin , and Ancient Greek [...] (...) , all meaning [...] "to stand" [...] and Russian [...] (stan, meaning [...] "settlement" [...] or [...] "semi-permanent camp"). English state originates from the same root, through Old French estat, from Latin status ("manner of standing, attitude, position, carriage, manner, dress, apparel; and other senses"), from stare. In Polish, Belarusian and Ukrainian, [...] means [...] "state" [...] or [...] "condition", while in Serbo-Croatian it translates as [...] "apartment" [...] (a Slovenian word [...] "stanovanje" [...] means apartment or other <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> of living is an obvious derivative of stan) in its modern usage, while its original meaning was [...] "habitat". In Czech and Slovak, it means [...] "tent" [...] or, in military terms, [...] "headquarters". Also in Germanic languages, the root can be found in Stand ("place, location"), and in Stadt (German), stad/sted (Dutch/Scandinavian), stêd (West Frisian) and stead (English), all meaning either [...] "place" [...] or [...] "city".
