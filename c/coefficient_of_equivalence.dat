40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{analysis of}} {{the impact on the}} quality of the fuel spray of droplets on the number and the value of the surface area of the droplets that have a direct impact on the efficiency of the combustion process. It presents a change in the level of toxic exhaust emissions with an increase in the so-called. Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of fuel droplets. The presented figures show that the increase in the average droplet diameter SMD in particular causes an increase of toxic exhaust gases emissions, i. e. mainly nitrogen oxides NO, carbon monoxide CO, hydrocarbons HC and Particulate Matter (PM). This tendency is not constant, because it is changing according to changes of the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> Φ. For example, emissions of nitrogen oxides for the lean mixtures (Φ 1), this trend is significantly changed, i. e. the level of this emission decreases...|$|E

Archival response sets collected from individuals with extensive experience in leadership who were administered either the full-length SALSA© or Form A or B in previous studies. A total of 80 individual response sets comprised the final sample. Items were categorized by p-value and Subject Matter Expert ratings gathered from the previous study. Items were then selected based on a combination of difficulty and item-total correlation (ITC) values. Selected items were paired based on ITC, and randomly assigned to either Form A or Form B.

There are two objectives of the thesis: verifying the test-retest stability and assessment of the equivalency of the two alternate forms, form A and B of the Czech version of the RBANS. The theoretical part deals with neuropsychological diagnostics and its methods, it also presents a neuropsychological battery RBANS, describes a test method, testing materials and organization of the scale, and it reminds RBANS use in clinical practice {{through a number of}} foreign studies.

It was specifically {{carried out to}} examine consumer buying decision making process and assess cultural, economic as well as personal factors influencing clothes buying behavior. Data for the study were gathered through structured questionnaire administered by the researcher {{with the help of}} two research assistants, on a sample of 192 clothes buyers, out of which, 174 were duly filled and returned. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi square, Analysis of variance and multi-stage regression. Findings revealed a highly significant influence of {{cultural factors}} (T= 14. 83, P< 0. 000) on consumer buying behaviour of which the relative regression <b>coefficient</b> influences <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> societal norms (24. 6 %) was the highest. The findings also indicated a highly significant influence of economic factors (T= 11. 89, P< 0. 000) factor on consumer buying behaviour with the highest relative regression coefficient influence equivalence exerted by income (20 %). The study further revealed that age was the sole personal (endogenous) factor variable influencing buying behaviour with the highest relative regression <b>coefficient</b> influence <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> over 65 %. The study concluded that culture, either acting independently or in conjunction with economic and personal factors significantly influences buying behaviour of clothes.
