40|$|PURPOSE. To {{characterize}} the transcriptome of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> mediated by eosinophil-related chemokine receptor CCR 3 {{and to identify}} a candidate for possible therapeutic intervention in eosinophilic inflammation of the eye.

The induction of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> <b>was</b> used to determine whether an inhibition of CCR 3 would suppress eosinophilic inflammation and the allergen-induced immediate hypersensitivity reaction.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{compare the}} effects of topical {{antiallergic}} eyedrops in relieving the {{signs and symptoms of}} patients with allergic conjunctival pathology. METHODS. In this multicenter, single-masked, randomized study, 240 patients with signs and symptoms of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> <b>were</b> randomized to receive 1 of the following 8 treatments twice daily: cromolyn sodium/chlorpheniramine maleate, diclofenac, epinastine, fluorometholone, ketotifen, levocabastine, naphazoline/antazoline, and olopatadine. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated by a masked operator using a 10 -point scale at the moment of enrollment (day 0) and at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The percentage of patients achieving at least a small (at least 50 % reduction of the total scale score) or a good (at least 75 %) improvement of signs and symptoms was calculated at each visit. Tolerability was also evaluated as the duration of discomfort after instillation. RESULTS. All drugs gave some improvement in symptoms in more than 85 % of cases. Epinastine and olopatadine obtained at least a good relief of symptoms in 37 % and 33 % of cases at week 1. At the end of the study, good improvement of symptoms was obtained in at least 70 % of patients by epinastine, ketotifen, fluorometholone, and olopatadine, whereas a 75 % improvement for signs was obtained only by fluorometholone and ketotifen. Naphazoline/antazoline induced higher discomfort compared to the other study treatments (p< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS.
