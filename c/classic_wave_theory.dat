This approach uses propagation and transmission of elastic waves, and fully exploits the presence of cyclic symmetry to determine the vibrating response. Sensor sensitivity is highly degraded {{by the presence of}} damping. Support loss is one of the important sources of damping in MEMS resonators and takes account of the energy dissipated through the supporting structure. Using <b>classic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theory</b> in a two-dimensional thin plate, analytical expressions are obtained for substrate displacements due to shear and normal stresses being applied to its edge, and these displacements are used to determine the support loss. Numerical results for the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a MEMS ring-based rate sensor are provided and it is shown that they are in very good agreement with a finite element analysis. The corresponding support losses are also presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{this essay}} I examine and criticize Jeffrey Kaplans fifth <b>wave</b> <b>theory</b> of terrorism, {{the theory is}} an {{addition}} and through the elaboration of professor David C. Rapoports <b>classic</b> Fourth <b>wave</b> <b>theory.</b> I have chosen to do that   by comparing al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State using their corresponding magazines Inspire and Dabiq. The goal of this exercise is to prove that what we experience with the Islamic State is not {{the beginning of a}} new wave of terrorism as Kaplan call it, but a state in making. Kaplans fifth wave gives us a good method to analyze terror organizations in between the state of organization and state but fails to live up to a new wave of terrorism. I therefore argue that what we are seeing for the movement is not the birth of a fifth wave, but rather a new development of a fourth...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{numerical}} N-body {{simulations of}} spiral galaxies {{have shown that}} spiral arms in N-body simulations do not rotate rigidly as expected in <b>classic</b> density <b>wave</b> <b>theory,</b> but instead seem to rotate at a similar speed to the local rotation speed of the stellar disc material. This in turn yields winding, transient and recurrent spiral structure, whose co-rotating nature gives rise {{to changes in the}} angular momentum (radial mi-gration) of star particles close to the spiral arm at many radii. From high resolution N-body simulations, we highlight the evolution of strongly migrating star particles (migrators) and star particles that do not migrate (non-migrators) around a spiral arm. We investigate the individual orbit histories of migrators and non-migrators and find that there are several types of migrator and non-migrator, each with unique ra-dial evolution. We find the important quantities that affect the orbital evolution to be the radial and tangential velocity components in combination with the azimuthal distance to the spiral arm at the time the star particle begins to feel tangential force. We contrast each type of orbit to compare how these factors combine for migrator...|$|R

Different patterns of sheet and rim configurations were presented to shed light into the underlying physics, including liquid chain, closed rim, open rim, unstable rim and flapping sheet. In addition, stationary asymmetrical waves were observed and compared with existing theories. The generation of stationary capillary wave in respect to the liquid rim were explained by the <b>classic</b> shallow water <b>wave</b> <b>theory.</b> The atomization process caused by development of the impact waves were observed in detail, including fragmentation of liquid sheet, formation of liquid ligaments, and breakup of ligament into droplet.

40|$|We {{study the}} star forming {{regions in the}} spiral galaxy NGC 4321, taking {{advantage}} of the spatial resolution (2. 5 arcsec FWHM) of the Swift/UVOT camera and the availability of three UV passbands in the region 1600 - 3000 A, in combination with optical and IR imaging from SDSS, KPNO/Ha and Spitzer/IRAC, to obtain a catalogue of 787 star forming regions out to three disc scale lengths. We determine the properties of the young stellar component and its relationship with the spiral arms. The Ha luminosities of the sources have a strong decreasing radial trend, suggesting more massive star forming regions in {{the central part of the}} galaxy. When segregated with respect to NUV-optical colour, blue sources have a significant excess of flux in the IR at 8 micron, revealing the contribution from PAHs, although the overall reddening of these sources stays below E(B-V) = 0. 2 mag. The distribution of distances to the spiral arms is compared for subsamples selected according to Ha luminosity, NUV-optical colour, or ages derived from a population synthesis model. An offset is expected between these subsamples as a function of radius if the pattern speed of the spiral arm were constant - as predicted by <b>classic</b> density <b>wave</b> <b>theory.</b> No significant offsets are found, favouring instead a mechanism where the pattern speed has a radial dependence.

40|$|This paper studies {{a problem}} of {{controlling}} trajectories of a platoon of vehicles on a highway segment with connected and automated vehicles. This problem is complex because each vehicle trajectory is an infinite-dimensional object and neighboring trajectories have complex interactions (e. g., car-following behavior). A parsimonious shooting heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct vehicle trajectories on a signalized highway segment that comply with boundary conditions for vehicle arrivals, vehicle mechanical limits, traffic lights and vehicle following safety. This algorithm breaks each vehicle trajectory into a few sections and each is analytically solvable. This decomposes the original hard trajectory control problem to a simple constructive heuristic. Then we slightly adapt this shooting heuristic algorithm to efficiently solve a leading vehicle problem on an uninterrupted freeway. To study theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms, the time geography theory is generalized by considering finite accelerations. With this generalized theory, {{it is found that}} under mild conditions, these algorithms can always obtain a feasible solution to the original complex trajectory control problem. Further, we discover that the shooting heuristic solution is a generalization of the solution to the <b>classic</b> kinematic <b>wave</b> <b>theory</b> by incorporating finite accelerations. We identify the theoretical bounds to the difference between the shooting heuristic solution and the kinematic wave solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and to draw additional insights into the potential of trajectory control in improving traffic performance. Building upon this foundation, an optimization framework will be presented in a following paper as Part II of this study...|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) {{observation}} of a gravitationally lensed spiral galaxy A 1689 B 11 at redshift z= 2. 54. It {{is the most}} ancient spiral galaxy discovered to date and the second kinematically confirmed spiral at z≳ 2. Thanks to gravitational lensing, this is also by far the deepest IFS observation with the highest spatial resolution (∼ 400 pc) on a spiral galaxy at a cosmic time when the Hubble sequence is about to emerge. After correcting for a lensing magnification of 7. 2 ± 0. 8, this primitive spiral disk has an intrinsic star formation rate of 22 ± 2 M_ yr^- 1, a stellar mass of 10 ^ 9. 8 ± 0. 3 M_ and a half-light radius of r_ 1 / 2 = 2. 6 ± 0. 7 kpc, typical of a main-sequence star-forming (SF) galaxy at z∼ 2. However, the Hα kinematics show a surprisingly tranquil velocity field with an ordered rotation (V_ c = 200 ± 12 km/s) and uniformly small velocity dispersions (V_σ, mean = 23 ± 4 km/s and V_σ, outer-disk = 15 ± 2 km/s). The low gas velocity dispersion is similar to local spiral galaxies and {{is consistent with the}} <b>classic</b> density <b>wave</b> <b>theory</b> where spiral arms form in dynamically cold and thin disks. We speculate that A 1689 B 11 belongs to a population of rare spiral galaxies at z≳ 2 that mark the formation epoch of thin disks. Future observations with JWST will greatly increase the sample of these rare galaxies and unveil the earliest onset of spiral arms.
