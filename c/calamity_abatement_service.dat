40|$|Mosquitoes are {{nuisance}} {{pests and}} a public health concern, {{with the potential to}} transmit viruses to humans through blood feeding. Mosquito control programs (MCPs) provide services to control and reduce mosquito populations by performing mosquito surveillance and using ultra-low volume insecticide sprays to treat neighborhoods. In July 2011, North Carolina (NC) disbanded the Public Health Pest Management (PHPM) section of the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (DENR). As a result state-wide resources were no longer available to MCPs. Without state-wide coordinated mosquito management, local residents without county or municipal control programs must handle mosquito control on their own. Private mosquito control companies offer <b>abatement</b> <b>services</b> to residents, using barrier sprays to treat their properties, but may have limited time to perform mosquito surveillance. The goal {{of the present study was}} to determine the efficacy of the barrier spray to control mosquitoes. Ten residential properties in Greenville, NC were sampled weekly for host-seeking mosquitoes. Five properties received barrier spray treatment and five did not. Leaf samples were collected weekly from treatment properties and pesticide residue was quantified by gas chromatography (GC). Weekly total host-seeking mosquito collections from treatment properties were consistently lower than control properties with mean reduction 53. 6 % (SE= 0. 039, range 24. 0 - 75. 0 %). The difference between mean values for total mosquitoes over all weeks was significant (p< 0. 000), but varied among genera. Bifenthrin residue was detected on leaves from treatment properties, but quantities were not correlated (p< 0. 05) with total mosquito collections. Immature mosquitoes (primarily Aedes albopictus) were collected monthly and reared to adulthood for use in pesticide resistance assays. Although field-collected mosquitoes were more resistant than colonized mosquitoes during the CDC bottle bioassay test, results during the initial 30 minute diagnostic time did not suggest resistance. Findings from this study may have implications for mosquito control and could potentially be used to guide future mosquito management strategies. M. S. E. H...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the political}} economy of environmental policies in the presence of an eco-industry pressure group. Previous studies have dealt with two types of lobbies: capitalists and environmentalists. We introduce a third pressure group representing the eco-industry sector. Under this type of economy, the incumbent government maximizes its chances of being re-elected. Its objective functions include social welfare as well as political contributions. The introduction of the eco-industry lobby introduces a new political contribution and modifies the incentives of the traditional lobbies. Furthermore, we underline the conditions under which environmentalists and eco-industries can become political allies. We also explain that, considering the overall profit of a vertical structure, an industrial lobby group can be favourable to a more stringent environmental policy. Next, we assume an open economy. In two countries, two polluting sectors are subject to an environmental policy. Therefore, an eco-industry sector which supplies pollution <b>abatement</b> goods and <b>services</b> arises. <b>Abatement</b> goods and <b>services</b> are assumed to be internationally traded, creating the only industrial interaction between both countries. The pollution, which can be transboundary or purely local, affects consumers in both countries; we analyse both cases. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, eco-industries lobby in favour of more stringent environmental policies, except if the impact of foreign competition more than compensates the turnover increase induced by a tighter environmental policy. Polluting firms always lobby against tighter environmental policies. However, an industrial pressure group, representing the industry as a whole and considering upstream and downstream profits, can sometimes be favourable to an increase in the environmental policy, as it leads to increased profits. We also show that an environmental pressure group can ask for a decrease in the environmental policy at home to decrease pollution abroad. This result does not rely on interactions between countries within the polluting sector. Interaction within the eco-industry sector is a sufficient condition for demonstrating that environmentalists can be favourable to a decrease in the local environmental policy. The impact of lobbying activities on the politically optimal environmental policy is ambiguous and depends on the relative concentration of each pressure group.

40|$|There is extreme {{heterogeneity}} of firms regulated under the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{in terms of}} emissions evels and employed technology. We present a model that shows that behavior of firms under quantity regulation can differ strongly, dependent {{on the characteristics of}} the firms when the assumption of full information is relaxed. If there are informational costs with regard to abatement options and costs, relatively small emitters and emitters with relatively complex technology will face a threshold for evaluating abatement options and costs. We compare the EU ETS to the US SO 2 trading scheme and show that 'adjoining' markets to quantity regulation, supplying goods (i. e. <b>abatement</b> technology) or <b>services</b> (i. e. assistance in permit trading), play a crucial role to reduce transactions costs. Given high complexity of technology and/or strongly limited demand for certain technologies, markets will fail to provide appropriate assistance, generating efficiency losses. The presence of technological complexity and heterogeneous firms can have major consequences for the design of environmental regulation, when considering transaction costs.

40|$|Pollution from nonpoint sources (NPS), and {{agriculture}} in particular, remains {{as one of}} the largest sources of water quality impairments in the United States. As is well known in the literature, there are many difficulties with designing regulations for reducing nonpoint source pollution (i. e., Tomasi, Segerson, and Braden, 1994). Uncertainty and asymmetric information are the key regulatory difficulties in the control of NPS. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} describe a potential incentive scheme that can be applied in limited information situations. The incentive scheme involves a contract written between a point source of pollution and a small group of other nonpoint polluters in the watershed to reduce a specific load of pollution. The contract allows the nonpoint sources to enter the contract voluntarily. To handle the incentive problems typical in many principal agent problems, it incorporates joint liability, and peer pressure/monitoring to induce the nonpoint sources of pollution to meet their contractual obligations. For this paper, we propose a group contract built upon the ideas of Stiglitz (1990) and Varian (1990), and originally applied to micro-lending arrangements in developing countries. As we hypothesize with nonpoint source pollution, joint liability contracts for micro-lending assume that individuals have more information about each other than the principal has about them, and they take advantage of joint liability and peer monitoring concepts to eliminate or reduce the moral hazard problem. Joint liability contracts have been shown to be successfully applied in practice in several situations (Ghatak and Guinnane, 1999; Van Tassel, 1999). The contract proposed for this paper assumes that a principal (a point source of pollution) offers a contract that specifies a price for each ton of pollution abated by individuals who participate. The contract is offered to individual farmers in a specified sub-watershed upstream from the discharge point. Farmers in the watershed decide whether or not to participate, and if they decide to participate, they bid into the contract the level of <b>abatement</b> <b>services</b> they will provide. The principal will form the group from these bidders, and will agree to pay the total amount if they meet the target. Given the fixed price for the contract, the bids determine the sharing rule for payments at the end of the season. With this basic idea, this paper explores the implications of moral hazard under several contractual arrangements. In particular, we are interested in the trade-offs between participation in the contract and shirking. At one extreme, existing voluntary incentive programs involve fixed payments with no requirements for performance. They will thus lead to high levels of participation, but likely to large levels of shirking as well. For example, in a typical year all of the money available for existing federal conservation programs is used by farmers, but there is little evidence available to prove that pollution declines as a result. At the other extreme, one could write a contract that specifies that payments will only be made if the target is met, following Holmstrom (1982) or Segerson (1988). Such an extreme, nonlinear contract such as this likely would eliminate most shirking, but it may lead to little participation among farmers. This paper thus explores the relationship between the participation constraint in principal agent problems and moral hazard with a simple theoretical model and numerical simulations. First, we propose a contract with a fixed initial payment and a bonus payment if the farmers meet the agreed upon target. The effects of the fixed payments upon the participation constraint and the consequent implications for shirking are shown theoretically and numerically. Fixed payments enhance the likelihood that individual farmers join the group, but fixed payments can also induce incentives to shirk. Second, we hypothesize that farmers can engage in other nonpecuniary penalties to punish farmers who shirk their responsibilities. For example, if someone in the group shirks, we assume that the group members can figure out whom, and take appropriate action to punish him or her. The numerical simulations show how the success of the proposed mechanism depends crucially on size of the fixed and bonus payments, group structure (i. e. ability and willingness to monitor each other) and group size. While not having any direct penalty in the contract, and having fixed payment plus bonus can increase the participation for the program, it can also increase free-riding problems in the group. Group size is also important, in that groups that are too large cannot take advantage of nonpecuniary penalties. Regions that have strong social ties are the most promising candidates for this kind of group contracts. They can be better able to apply social pressure on potential shirkers (Prescott, 1997). In addition to showing a theoretical model, and numerical simulations, we provide some results from recent focus groups providing data from actual farmers on their willingness to participate in the types of contracts proposed in this paper.

40|$|The {{two year}} Feral Hog Abatement Project was {{implemented}} in January 2006. On-site technical assistance (direct control) {{was provided to}} landowners at three pilot sites (Post Oak Savannah/Pineywoods, Blacklands Prairie and Coastal Prairie) while group educational events (indirect control) emphasizing adoption of efficient landowner-initiated control methods were conducted statewide. Both groups of clientele participating in the project and were surveyed to measure the overall economic impact of this Texas Department of Agriculture-funded initiative. Data spanned the period 2005 - 2007 so as to estimate {{the economic impact of}} technical assistance and educational programs to the agricultural community. Wildlife Service technicians worked with a total of 48 cooperators {{during the course of this}} project. However, eight participants did not provide data for a variety of reasons for all three years concerned. Data from all cooperators are included in the main body of this report as results from these eight participants do not significantly impact totals. The 48 participating cooperators owned or controlled 230, 017 acres and estimated damages and expenditures totaling $ 2, 228, 076 directly attributable to feral hogs at the three pilot sites for 2005. These same cooperators estimated a decline in damage to $ 1, 261, 520 in 2006 as a direct result of Wildlife <b>Service</b> <b>abatement</b> efforts that included the removal of 1, 930 feral hogs. In 2007, a decline in damage of $ 513, 935 from the previous year (2006) was noted following the removal of 1, 869 hogs. As a result, cooperators saved a total of $ 966, 556 through the direct technical assistance provided by Wildlife Services during Year 1 and $ 513, 935 in Year 2 of the project for a total savings of $ 1, 480, 491. On a scale of 0 to 10, cooperators participating in technical assistance efforts via Wildlife Services rated the services provided as a 9. 1 based on the likelihood of their recommending Wildlife Services to friends, family and colleagues as a source of technical assistance for feral hog control. A Net Promoter Score of 71 % among the cooperator group also indicated that Wildlife Services was efficiently assisting landowners with direct control via on-site technical assistance. The benefit to cost ratio of direct control efforts was 6. 2 to 1. 0 ($ 6. 20 saved for each $ 1. 00 invested). Texas AgriLife Extension Service (formerly Texas Cooperative Extension) educational/ outreach efforts/technical assistance (indirect control) were conducted statewide for 5, 197 landowners attending 67 educational events in 66 counties and by one-on-one contacts. Educational program efforts included seminars, workshops, field days and pesticide recertification trainings. Participants were surveyed to determine damage type, control methods employed, number and type of practices to be adopted, knowledge gained and economic value of knowledge gained. A total of 2, 281 participants (return rate = 44 %) completed surveys. While this rate of survey return was considered to be high, it was actually higher then reported because multiple program participants often represented a single landholding, thus only one survey was completed per landholding/family in attendance at an educational event. Indirect control programming resulting in knowledge gained were valued at $ 2, 978, 821 by landowners, based on previous year’s damage estimates ($ 6, 252, 044) vs. the upcoming year’s damage estimates ($ 3, 273, 223). This equates to an average information value/economic savings of $ 2, 108 per each of the 1, 413 survey respondents answering the economic impact questions. The benefit to cost ratio of indirect control efforts was 19. 6 to 1. 0 ($ 19. 60 saved for each $ 1. 00 invested). On a scale of 0 to 10, landowners participating in educational events scored AgriLife Extension with a Customer Satisfaction Rating of 8. 7 (on a 0 to 10 Likert scale) based on the likelihood of their recommending our agency as an information source and for feral hog control to their family, colleagues and friends. A Net Promoter Score of 51 % among the landowner group also indicated that AgriLife Extension was efficiently reaching the needs of clientele with educational/outreach information on abating feral hog damage. The feral hog website ([URL] was a popular source of information on feral hogs, their control and the project’s progress with 31, 374 unique hits and 76, 830 pages accessed.
