5|$|At {{the turn}} of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the {{emergence}} of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), {{on the banks of the}} Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely <b>controlled</b> <b>for</b> over two centuries.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now <b>controlled</b> <b>for</b> gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something theNew Scientisthas coinednominative determinism. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points {{when it comes to}} names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society.

Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are <b>controlled</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E

On February 19, 1939 Kallio lost the championship to EMLL wrestler Octavio Gaona, to create EMLL's main championship for the middleweight division. In 1952 EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the middleweight championship was rebranded as the NWA World Middleweight Championship from that point forward. In 1989 EMLL left the NWA because the promoters {{did not want to}} deal with the internal politics of the NWA at the time.

5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer <b>controlled.</b> <b>For</b> example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} the complex and highly {{uncertain}} nature of dynamical systems requiring controls, {{it is not surprising}} that reliable system models for many high performance engineering and life science applications are unavailable. In the face of such high levels of system uncertainty, robust controllers may unnecessarily sacrifice system performance whereas adaptive controllers are clearly appropriate since they can tolerate far greater system uncertainty levels to improve system performance. In this dissertation, we develop a Lyapunov-based direct adaptive and neural adaptive control framework that addresses parametric uncertainty, unstructured uncertainty, disturbance rejection, amplitude and rate saturation constraints, and digital implementation issues. Specifically, we consider the following research topics: direct adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems with exogenous disturbances; robust adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain systems with actuator amplitude and rate saturation constraints; adaptive reduced-order dynamic compensation for nonlinear uncertain systems; direct adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear matrix second-order dynamical systems with state-dependent uncertainty; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with applications to general anesthesia; direct adaptive control of nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with time delay; adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with applications to clinical pharmacology; neural network adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems; passivity-based neural network adaptive output feedback <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems; neural network adaptive dynamic output feedback <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear nonnegative systems using tapped delay memory units; Lyapunov-based adaptive <b>control</b> framework <b>for</b> discrete-time nonlinear systems with exogenous disturbances; direct discrete-time adaptive control with guaranteed parameter error convergence; and hybrid adaptive <b>control</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear uncertain impulsive dynamical systems.
