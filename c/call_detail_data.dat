For example, Daytona is managing a 4 terabyte data warehouse whose largest table contains over 10 billion rows. Daytona’s architecture is based on translating its high-level query language Cymbal ™ (which includes SQL as a subset) completely into C and then compiling that C into object code. The system resulting from this architecture is fast, powerful, easy to use and administer, reliable and open to UNIX ™ tools. In particular, two forms of data compression plus robust horizontal partitioning enable Daytona to handle terabytes with ease. 1. Daytona The Daytona ™ data management system is used by AT&T to solve a wide spectrum of data management problems. On the tiny end, Daytona provided the data manager for the DACS VI switch which only had 64 MB of memory at the time. Since DACS VI used a real-time UNIX operating system, virtual memory could not be paged to swap disk.

40|$|Abstract—Transportation mode {{inference}} is {{an important}} research direction and has many applications. Existing methods are usually based on fine-grained sampling [...] collecting position data from mobile devices at high frequency. These methods can achieve high accuracy, but also incur cost and complexity {{in terms of the}} system implementation and computational resource requirements. Finally, fine-grained sampling is not always available, especially for large-scale deployment. This paper proposes a novel method to infer transportation mode based on coarse-grained <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records. The method allows estimating the transportation mode share from a given origin to a given destination, looking also at how the share changes over time. The method can achieve acceptable accuracy with trivial cost and complexity and is suitable for the statistical analysis on transportation modes of a large population. The method can also be used as a complementary tool in situations where fine-grained sampling is unavailable or the balance between accuracy and complexity is critical. A case study using real <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records <b>data</b> for the city of Boston shows the performance of the proposed method. M I...|$|R

The proposed techniques are experimentally tested on a large-scale, real life telco data set containing both networked (<b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records <b>data)</b> and non-networked (customer related) information about millions of subscribers. The results indicate {{the existence of a}} limited yet highly relevant impact of social network eects on customer churn behavior, including non-Markovian network eects.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of military logistics planning models offers {{a great deal}} of information about the modelling state of art. Such tools include both analytic and simulation model types. They can deal with both static and dynamic characteristics of the environment. They require highly <b>detailed</b> <b>data</b> for their operation and can compute over a large number of interacting variables. Unfortunately, these models do not satisfy adequately the requirements of the particular logistics issue for which they were assessed, which is whether such models can be used in early logistics planning for new weapon systems. One difficulty is that such planning must make extensive use of tradeoffs and sensitivity analysis to take account of the flexibility and uncertainties existing at the early stages. Another is that the existent models <b>call</b> for <b>detailed</b> <b>data</b> which is usually not available at that time. Therefore, although the models do fulfill a particular useful planning function, they must be replaced or augmented by a new class of models that will much more closely satisfy the planning need. This new capability requires a serious research effort that will benefit not only the military logistics planners, but also other planners dealing with large capital development programs. ...|$|R

The authors found the transition point of cooperation between layered networks [23]. Strano et al. analyzed the coupling property between street and subway networks in London and New York [24]. An optimal operation speed is determined for London subway [24]. How operation speed of subway influences passenger travel time and road traffic congestion was studied using CDR (<b>Call</b> <b>Details</b> Records) <b>data</b> [27].

Such measurement was performed at the LNS superconducting cyclotron, covering a wide angular range from 0 to 150 degrees and a complete neutron energy interval from thermal to beam energy. Neutrons with energy above 0. 5 MeV were measured by liquid scintillators exploiting their Time of Flight to determine the kinetic energy. For lower energy neutrons, down to thermal energy, a $^ 3 $He detector was used. The obtained data are in good agreement with previous measurements at 0 degree with 66 MeV proton beam, covering neutron energies > 10 MeV, as well as with measurements at few selected angles with protons of 46, 55 and 113 MeV energy.

40|$|International audienceThe recent {{availability}} of large-scale <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> record <b>data</b> has substantially improved our ability of quantifying human travel patterns with broad applications in epidemiology. Notwithstanding {{a number of}} successful case studies, previous works have shown that using different mobility data sources, such as mobile phone data or census surveys, to parametrize infectious disease models can generate divergent outcomes. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent epidemic modelling results may vary when using different proxies for human movements. Here, we systematically compare 658 [*] 000 simulated outbreaks generated with a spatially structured epidemic model based on two different human mobility networks: a commuting network of France extracted from mobile phone data and another extracted from a census survey. We compare epidemic patterns originating from all the 329 possible outbreak seed locations and identify the structural network properties of the seeding nodes that best predict spatial and temporal epidemic patterns to be alike. We find that similarity of simulated epidemics is significantly correlated to connectivity, traffic and population size of the seeding nodes, suggesting that the adequacy of mobile phone data for infectious disease models becomes higher when epidemics spread between highly connected and heavily populated locations, such as large urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—CDR (<b>Call</b> <b>Detail</b> Records) <b>data</b> is {{more easily}} {{available}} than other network related data (such as GPS data) as most telecommunications service providers (TSPs) maintain such data. By analyzing it {{one can find}} mobility patterns {{of most of the}} population thus leading to efficient urban planning, disease and traffic control, etc. But its granularity is low as the latitude and longitude (lat-lon) of a cell tower is used as the current location of all mobile phones that are connected to the cell tower at that time. Granularity can range between 10 s of metres to several kms depending on population density of a locality. This is one reason why, although there are many existing systems on visualizing mobility of people based on GPS data, there is hardly any existing system for CDR. We develop a Mobility Visualization System (MoVis) for visualizing mobility of people from their CDR records. First of all, given the CDR records of a user, we determine her stay regions (places where she stays for a significant amount of time). Trajectories of phone events (and lat-lon of cell towers) between stay regions are extracted as her trips. Start and end times of a trip are estimated using linear extrapolation. Based on the start and end times, temporal patterns are extracted. Trips with sufficient number of intermediate points are mapped to transport network that consists of train lines, bus routes and expressways. We use Kernel density estimation to visualize the most common path for a given origin and destination. Based on this we create a round-the-clock visualization of mobility of people over the entire city separately for weekdays and weekends. At the end we show the validation results. I...|$|R
