50|$|He {{wanted to}} design a ceramic <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> which was {{electrically}} heated, and consulted Bill Russell. A <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> would provide constantly hot coffee, and would rival the best-selling Goblin Teasmade. In October 1952 they set up Russell Hobbs together as partners in the business in Croydon, Surrey. The world's first <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> was launched {{at the end of}} 1952. Although the sales director of the company, he was responsible for the early innovation of new products. Russell would develop them to market. In 1963 the company was bought by Tube Investments.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinction}} must be {{made between}} the chemical process of percolation and the <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> as a device. In 1880, Hanson Goodrich invented the <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator.</b> His percolator {{was one of the}} earliest coffee brewing devices to use percolation rather than infusion or decoction as its mode of extraction, and he named it accordingly. Other brewing methods based on percolation followed, and this early naming convention can cause confusion with other percolation methods.|$|R

25|$|The type of grind {{is often}} {{named after the}} brewing method {{for which it is}} {{generally}} used. Turkish grind is the finest grind, while <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> or French press are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between these two extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>percolators</b> once enjoyed great {{popularity}} {{but were}} supplanted {{in the early}} 1970s by automatic drip <b>coffee</b> makers. <b>Percolators</b> often expose the grounds to higher temperatures than other brewing methods, and may recirculate already brewed coffee through the beans. As a result, coffee brewed with a percolator is particularly susceptible to over-extraction. Percolation may {{remove some of the}} volatile compounds in the beans, resulting in a pleasant aroma during brewing, but a less flavoursome cup. However, percolator enthusiasts praise the percolator's hotter, more 'robust' coffee, and maintain that the potential pitfalls of this brewing method can be eliminated by careful control of the brewing process.|$|R
25|$|A <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> {{is a type}} of pot used to brew coffee. In {{the case}} of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the {{permeable}} substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma. In 1806, Benjamin Thompson Rumford invented the percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve to strain away the grounds.|$|R
25|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>percolators</b> and {{automatic}} coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that {{are held in}} a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. The liquid drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.|$|R
50|$|The {{domestic}} appliance manufacture {{was moved to}} the Swinton Works at Mexborough, and in 1970 the original factory in St Mary Cray, which employed around 1,200 people, was closed. The nearby Ruxley factory manufactured kettles and <b>coffee</b> <b>percolators.</b> In January 1970 it was decided to remove the Morphy Richards brand from the fridges. It was argued that GEC had little interest in Morphy Richards. On 25 May 1975 Donal Morphy died, aged 74.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name comes}} {{from that of the}} {{original}} manufacturer, S. Sternau & Co. of Brooklyn, New York, a maker of chafing dishes, <b>coffee</b> <b>percolators</b> and other similar appliances since 1893. It had previously applied the name to its [...] "Sterno-Inferno" [...] alcohol burner. In 1918, it promoted its Sterno Stove as being a perfect gift for a soldier going overseas. In his book With the Old Breed, E. B. Sledge describes its use on the battlefields of the Pacific Theatre in 1944 and 1945.|$|R
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} well {{supplied}} with dishes, cutlery, utensils, {{pots and pans}} and bake ware (including roasting pans, cookie sheets, <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator,</b> bread pans and muffin pans). There is a full size propane oven, {{as well as some}} two-burner propane stoves for cooking. Propane is supplied by the Alpine Club via a large outdoor tank. Drinking water is available from a small stream fed by Kiwetinok lake (a day hike) running through the meadow 60 m south of the hut. It is advisable to boil or treat the water before drinking it. In the winter you can dig down to the creek or melt snow for water.|$|R
2500|$|The {{essential}} part of any improvised firearm is the barrel and chamber. For small, low-pressure cartridges, like the common [...]22 caliber (5.5mm) rimfire cartridges, even very thin-walled tubing will suffice. Author Harlan Ellison describes the zip guns used by gangs in 1950s New York City as being made from tubing used in <b>coffee</b> <b>percolators</b> or automobile radio antennas, strapped to a block of wood {{to serve as a}} handle. A rubber band provided the power for the firing pin, which is pulled back and released to fire. The use of such weak tubing results in a firearm that can be as dangerous to the shooter as the target; the poorly fitting smoothbore barrel provides little accuracy and is liable to burst upon firing.|$|R
50|$|After {{working with}} REME in World War II and leaving in 1947 as a major, Bill Russell (22 July 1920 - 16 February 2006), from High Wycombe, joined Morphy Richards {{and helped to}} design a pop-up toaster, an {{electric}} iron and a hairdryer, when working as Chief Development Engineer. Peter Hobbs (3 May 1916 - 11 April 2008), from Tunbridge Wells, was a major {{during the war in}} the Royal Engineers, and also worked for the home appliance manufacturer, Morphy Richards, as manager of the South African division of the company. He had returned to the UK in 1952, after a disagreement with Charles Richards over sales policy, and worked for another company, where he was trying to design a <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator,</b> with reference to a German patent. Later in 1952 Bill Russell had a disagreement with Donal Morphy and joined Hobbs to form Russell Hobbs Ltd.|$|R
50|$|In 1663 Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester {{published}} a book of 100 inventions which described a method for raising water between floors employing a similar principle {{to that of a}} <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator.</b> His system was the first to separate the boiler (a heated cannon barrel) from the pumping action. Water was admitted into a reinforced barrel from a cistern, and then a valve was opened to admit steam from a separate boiler. The pressure built {{over the top of the}} water, driving it up a pipe. He installed his steam-powered device on the wall of the Great Tower at Raglan Castle to supply water through the tower. The grooves in the wall where the engine was installed were still to be seen in the 19th century. However, no one was prepared to risk money for such a revolutionary concept, and without backers the machine remained undeveloped.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Newcomen {{a number}} of small steam devices of various sorts had been made, but most were {{essentially}} novelties. Around 1600 {{a number of}} experimenters used steam to power small fountains working like a <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator.</b> First a container was filled with water via a pipe, which extended through the top of the container to nearly the bottom. The bottom of the pipe would be submerged in the water, making the container airtight. The container was then heated to make the water boil. The steam generated pressurized the container, but the inner pipe, immersed at the bottom by liquid, and lacking an airtight seal at top, remained at a lower pressure; expanding steam forced the water {{at the bottom of the}} container into and up the pipe to spurt out of a nozzle on top. These devices had limited effectiveness but illustrated the principle's viability.|$|R
50|$|At the brownstone, Wolfe tests {{one of the}} {{capsules}} {{by placing}} it in a <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> and lighting its fuse; it explodes violently enough to damage the percolator and hurl its lid across the office, barely missing him. Wolfe dispatches Archie to take two of the others to Cramer, who threatens to get a warrant for the last one. Wolfe takes a sudden interest in a newspaper article about a man found dead in White Plains with his head crushed, and calls the local district attorney to confirm his identity as Arthur Howell, {{an employee of the}} company that had manufactured the capsules. Once the body has been identified, Wolfe sends Archie to see Martha with a photograph of Poor (obtained by Saul) that has the last capsule taped to it. Archie warns Martha that he has orders to deliver her to either Wolfe or the police, but she instead kills herself by putting the capsule in her mouth and setting it off.|$|R
50|$|However, {{a credit}} crunch in 1968 made real estate {{financing}} {{much more difficult to}} obtain, which hurt Glazer's and Marotta's business. Marotta pondered an alternative business to real estate due to the credit squeeze of 1968. His thoughts turned to a new, potential household coffee maker. During the late 1960s, the <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator,</b> a mainstays in American homes, the commercially available consumer alternative to instant coffee. Many drinkers disliked the coffee brewed by the common household percolator. A percolator reuses the same water and coffee grounds over and over, resulting in a bitter taste as some grounds are used three or four times. Marotta and his partner sought to replicate a replacement coffeemaker, based on the drip coffee makers utilized in restaurants and other commercial establishments, but not available to consumers. His wife, Ann Marotta, who also disliked the coffee available at the time, became an inspiration for Marotta's new business plan as well, according to their daughter, Susan Parente.|$|R
40|$|Bubble pump (BP), an {{essential}} component in <b>coffee</b> <b>percolators,</b> is used to drive solar water heating systems and single pressure absorption refrigerators. However, its mass flow rate cannot be readily predicted. Heat input, tube diameter and submergence ratio affect its mass flow rate. BP has the same working concept as air-lift pump, but its flow is complicated due to the condensation of vapour bubbles. Neither curve fitting models, nor air-lift pump models, can predict the mass flow rate with high fidelity. A new model based on the pumping characteristics of BP is presented and verified by a water based setup at atmospheric pressure. Results show that the average errors for the BP with tube diameter of 6 - 12 mm, and for the BP with submergence ratio of 0. 5 - 0. 8 are 13 % and 11 %, respectively. The BP performance increases when the tube diameter decreases or the submergence ratio increases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Paper coffee filters {{were invented}} in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908 and are {{commonly}} used for drip brew all over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany being the first electrical drip brewer. Drip brew coffee makers replaced the <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> in the 1970s due to the percolators' tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are now also common, made of thin perforated metal sheets or fine plastic mesh that restrain the grounds but allow the coffee to pass, thus eliminating {{the need to have}} to purchase separate filters which sometimes cannot be found {{in some parts of the}} world. These add to the maintenance of the machine, but reduce overall cost and produce less waste.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s he toured Europe {{several times during}} the height of the British blues craze, backed on a number of {{occasions}} by the Authentics (see American Folk Blues Festival), recording with the Yardbirds (for the album Sonny Boy Williamson and The Yardbirds) and The Animals, and appearing on several TV broadcasts throughout Europe. Around this time he was quoted as saying of the backing bands who accompanied him, [...] "those British boys want to play the blues real bad, and they do". According to the Led Zeppelin biography Hammer of the Gods, while in England Sonny Boy set his hotel room on fire while trying to cook a rabbit in a <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator.</b> The book also maintains that future Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant purloined one of the bluesman's harmonicas at one of these shows. Robert Palmer, writing in [...] "Deep Blues", stated that during this tour Williamson allegedly stabbed a man during a street fight and left the country abruptly.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, Glazer and Marotta {{purchased}} a coffee delivery {{company in the}} Cleveland metropolitan area. Included in the sale were the coffee companies trucks, which brewed coffee in giant, stainless steel coffee dispensers which were not portable. According to Glazer's son, customers would ask if there were household coffee makers available, giving Glazer and Marotta {{the idea for a}} new home drip brew coffee maker. Glazer and Marotta sold off much of their real estate holdings to finance research and development for their coffee making venture. Before Glazer and Marotta developed Mr. Coffee, there were only two main ways that consumers could make coffee at home: a <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> or instant <b>coffee.</b> The partners hired away two engineers from Westinghouse, Edmund Abel and Erwin Schulze, to develop a consumer coffee maker that could fit in any kitchen. The engineers developed the Mr. Coffee machine, which used a heating element to drip brew coffee through grounds into a glass coffee pot. The machine was designed to not heat the water over 200 F, which lessened the chances of brewing bitter coffee.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} newer {{restaurants}} on the Boulevard des Italiens were the Maison Dorée, the Café Riche and the Café Anglais, {{the latter two}} of which faced {{each other across the}} boulevard. They, and the other cafés modelled after them, had a similar arrangement. Inside the door, the clients were welcomed by the dame de comptoir, always a beautiful woman who was very elegantly dressed. Besides welcoming the clients, she {{was in charge of the}} distribution of pieces of sugar, two for each demitasse of coffee. A demitasse of coffee cost between 35 to 40 centimes, to which clients usually added a tip of two sous, or ten centimes. An extra piece of sugar cost ten centimes. The floor of the café was lightly covered with sand, so the hurrying waiters would not slip. The technology of the coffee service was greatly improved in 1855 with the invention of the hydrostatic <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator,</b> first presented at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855, which allowed a café to produce 50,000 demitasses a day.|$|R

50|$|Aromatic {{compounds}} and other flavour compounds are extracted from coffee grains by the Moka using {{a process known}} as percolation. In order to percolate or brew the <b>coffee</b> the <b>percolator</b> is placed on a stove element and heated until pressure in the water compartment increases causing the water to rise through a funnel, through the coffee grains, through a filter and, finally, into the top compartment. According to the Bialetti corporate lore the mechanical design for the Moka was inspired by the primitive washing-machines used by housewives: linens were boiled in tubes built around a central conduit that drew the boiling soapy water up through it and redistributed it across the linen through a radial opening.|$|R
40|$|Serendipity was {{recently}} voted {{the most popular}} word in the English language. From {{only a handful of}} references in the late 1950 s, a Google search today reveals nearly 8 million references (up from 3 million references a year ago). Ironically, ‘serendipity’ {{is also one of the}} most frequently queried words in the dictionary, and one of the hardest to translate. It is typically used as synonymous with luck, chance or coincidence. Thus, nearly one in ten of the most cited scientific papers mention serendipity as contributing to breakthrough innovations (Campanario 1996). Aside from bringing us such powerful agents as aspirin, the contraceptive pill, penicillin, laughing gas, vaccination, vitamin K, amphetamine, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, quinine, insulin, sulfa drugs, valproic acid, propafenone, magainins, nitrogen mustard, nitroglycerin, warfarin, the smallpox vaccine and cloretazine, it produced Scotchgard, Teflon, Velcro, Nylon, the Post-it Note, Kodak’s Weekender camera, the technology behind the HP Inkjet printer (based on seeing a <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> at work), electromagnetism, photography, dynamite, the phonograph, X-rays, radioactivity, and even Ivory Soap, liquorice allsorts and Coca Cola (patented, in 1886, as ‘Pemberton’s French Wine Coca’ for medicinal purposes, as a nerve and tonic stimulant and a possible cure for headaches). In sum, the proposition that the process of discovery has a distinct logic may have been vastly overstated (Simontan 2004 : 7). Yet, being what we are – fallible human beings with a penchant for predictability and control – we continue our vast investments into powerful statistical tools, automation, advances in molecular biology and novel technologies, so as to squeeze every last drop of success out of scientific discovery programmes. In today’s research, how much scope, if any, remains for serendipity? Looking behind, how justified are we to attribute past discoveries to serendipity? What is serendipity really...|$|R
50|$|In 1962, {{they needed}} to expand the company to {{increase}} production and needed more capital. They were forced to sell the company to Tube Investments (TI), a conglomerate of electrical appliance brands who also owned Creda (a competitor of Hotpoint's range of products - GEC at the time owned both Hotpoint and Morphy Richards). Production was moved to Wombourne in Staffordshire, where it was shared with Creda and to Blythe Bridge in Stoke-on-Trent, in a former aircraft factory later owned by Indesit which closed in December 2007. The Blythe Bridge site on Grindley Lane was shared with Simplex Electric Co Ltd (owner of Creda), and Simplex-GE, a joint venture of TI with GE of America that made electrical switching equipment. Simplex also made tungsten-iodine floodlighting (halogen lamp). Russell became technical director of Creda, then managed Turnright. As part of the Electrical Division of TI, it was headquartered at Simplex House on Ealing Road in Alperton, Middlesex. The Domestic Appliance division of TI was later based at Radiation House on the North Circular Road in Neasden. In the mid-1970s Dimplex diversified into <b>coffee</b> <b>percolators</b> and electric kettles due to former Russell Hobbs engineers joining the company. In the mid-1970s the company tried to persuade the French to buy its electric kettles, but they still preferred to boil water with saucepans (and did so for the next twenty years). The use of electric kettles across Europe was sporadic. In the late 1970s the Managing Director was David Durham. The heyday of the TI Group was in 1978, but by the early 1980s, the TI Group was facing difficulties, with its workforce halving. TI Group formally referred to Russell Hobbs as TI Russell Hobbs.|$|R
40|$|A novel way {{of cooking}} rice to {{maximize}} {{the removal of the}} carcinogen inorganic arsenic (Asi) is presented here. In conventional rice cooking water and grain are in continuous contact, and it is known that the larger the water:rice cooking ratio, the more Asi removed by cooking, suggesting that the Asi in the grain is mobile in water. Experiments were designed where rice is cooked in a continual stream of percolating near boiling water, either low in Asi, or Asi free. This has the advantage of not only exposing grain to large volumes of cooking water, but also physically removes any Asi leached from the grain into the water receiving vessel. The relationship between cooking water volume and Asi removal in conventional rice cooking was demonstrated for the rice types under study. At a water-to-rice cooking ratio of 12 : 1, 57 ± 5 % of Asi could be removed, average of 6 wholegrain and 6 polished rice samples. Two types of percolating technology were tested, one where the cooking water was recycled through condensing boiling water steam and passing the freshly distilled hot water through the grain in a laboratory setting, and one where tap water was used to cook the rice held in an off-the-shelf <b>coffee</b> <b>percolator</b> in a domestic setting. Both approaches proved highly effective in removing Asi from the cooking rice, with up to 85 % of Asi removed from individual rice types. For the recycled water experiment 59 ± 8 % and 69 ± 10 % of Asi was removed, on average, compared to uncooked rice for polished (n= 27) and wholegrain (n= 13) rice, respectively. For coffee percolation {{there was no difference between}} wholegrain and polished rice, and the effectiveness of Asi removal was 49 ± 7 % across 6 wholegrain and 6 polished rice samples. The manuscript explores the potential applications and further optimization of this percolating cooking water, high Asi removal, discovery...|$|R
