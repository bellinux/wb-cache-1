60|$|After {{the session}} Mr. Gladstone {{had gone on}} a visit to Dunrobin, and there he was laid up with illness for many days. It was the end of September before he was able to travel south. At Dingwall they {{presented}} him (Sept. 27) with the freedom of that ancient burgh. He spoke of himself as having completed the twenty-first year of his political life, and as being almost the youngest of those veteran statesmen who occupied the chief places in the counsels of the Queen. At Inverness the same evening, he told them that in <b>commercial</b> <b>legislation</b> he had reaped where others had sown; that he had enjoyed the privilege of taking a humble but laborious part in realising those principles of free trade which, in the near future, would bring, in the train of increased intercourse and augmented wealth, that closer social and moral union of the nations of the earth which men all so fervently desire, and which must in the fulness of time lessen the frequency of strife and war. Yet even while the hopeful words were falling from the speaker's lips, he might have heard, not in far distance but close at hand, the trumpets and drums, the heavy rumbling of the cannon, and all the clangour of a world in arms.|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. The first {{difficulty}} which meets us in {{the attempt}} to apply experimental methods for ascertaining the laws of social phenomena, is that we are without the means of making artificial experiments. Even if we could contrive experiments at leisure, and try them without limit, we should do so under immense disadvantage; both from the impossibility of ascertaining and taking note of all the facts of each case, and because (those facts being in a perpetual state of change), before sufficient time had elapsed to ascertain the result of the experiment, some material circumstances would always have ceased to be the same. But it is unnecessary to consider the logical objections which would exist to the conclusiveness of our experiments, since we palpably never have the power of trying any. We can only watch those which nature produces, or which are produced for other reasons. We can not adapt our logical means to our wants, by varying the circumstances as the exigencies of elimination may require. If the spontaneous instances, formed by contemporary events and by the successions of phenomena recorded in history, afford a sufficient variation of circumstances, an induction from specific experience is attainable; otherwise not. The question to be resolved is, therefore, whether the requisites for induction respecting the causes of political effects or the properties of political agents, are to be met with in history? including under the term, contemporary history. And in order to give fixity to our conceptions, it will be advisable to suppose this question asked in reference to some special subject of political inquiry or controversy; such as that frequent topic of debate in the present century, the operation of restrictive and prohibitory <b>commercial</b> <b>legislation</b> upon national wealth. Let this, then, be the scientific question to be investigated by specific experience.|$|E
6000|$|... (M24) Though {{the idea}} of putting a tax on the income of {{charitable}} endowments was rejected, the budget of 1863 was the record of a triumph that was complete. The American civil war by arresting the supply of cotton had half ruined Lancashire. The same cause had diminished the export trade to America by six millions sterling. Three bad seasons spoiled the crops. There was distress in Ireland. Yet the chancellor had a revenue in excess of expenditure by the noble figure of three millions and three quarters. Mr. Gladstone naturally took the opportunity of surveying the effects of four years of his financial policy. He admitted that they had been four years of tension, and this tension had been enhanced by his large remissions of duty, and by taking in hand the completion of the great work of <b>commercial</b> <b>legislation.</b> The end of it all was a growth of wealth, as he called it, almost intoxicating. The value of British goods sent to France had risen from four millions and three quarters to nearly nine millions and one quarter, in other words had about doubled under the operations of the treaty of commerce.(45) If to this were added foreign and colonial produce sent through us, and acquired by us in exchange for our own produce, the value had risen from nine and a half in 1859 to twenty-one and three quarters in 1862. In Mr. Gladstone’s own description later, the export trade of 1860, in spite of a bad harvest, was so stimulated by the liberating customs act, that it rose at once from a hundred and thirty millions to a hundred and thirty-five. The next year it fell to a hundred and twenty-five, and in 1862 it fell by another million owing to the withdrawal, by reason of the American war, of the material of our greatest manufacture. In 1866 it rose to a hundred and eighty-eight millions.(46) Then under the head of income-tax, and comparing 1842 with 1862, over the same area, and with the same limitations, the aggregate amount of assessed income had risen from one hundred and fifty-six millions to two hundred and twenty-one. Other tests and figures need not detain us.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Commercial {{arbitration}} {{is growing}} in importance in the modern world. People often use arbitration to ensure adjudication by {{an expert in the}} field and although arbitration may not always be quicker, its importance continues to grow especially in international commercial disputes. 1 Effective arbitration procedures will have positive consequences for the economical and political relationships between countries. 2 The Arbitration Act 42 of 1965 might have sufficed in the past, but as international commercial arbitration is ever increasing and changing, this act has become out–dated. It does not effectively facilitate international commercial arbitration. The Act was primarily designed with domestic commercial arbitration in mind and therefore it is of limited assistance in the international commercial arbitration sphere. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 3 has developed the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. 4 This Model Law or variations thereof can be adopted by a country to regulate international commercial arbitration. 5 Many countries choose to adopt the Model Law. The reasons vary but some are that the country’s own arbitration laws were out–dated and needed replacement. The Model Law has proved to be effective and it has become a benchmark for good arbitration legislation. 6 Some countries have even adopted the Model Law for use in domestic commercial arbitration disputes. The South African Law Commission 7 published a report in 1998 dealing with the possible application of the Model Law on international commercial arbitration in South Africa. It drafted a Draft Bill on International Arbitration (not as of yet promulgated) based on the Model Law. 9 One of the points of discussion in the report of the Commission was whether the Model Law should also be made applicable to domestic commercial arbitration in South Africa. The conclusion was that domestic and international arbitration should be dealt with separately and that the present Act regulating domestic arbitration should be amended but not replaced by the Model Law. This implies two arbitration regimes: the International Arbitration Act (dealing only with international commercial arbitration); and the Arbitration Act (dealing only with domestic commercial arbitration) After the Commission’s report had been studied and South Africa’s legal position had been compared with Australia’s legal position, it is conlcuded that Australia is a good example to follow in regard to arbitration practices. It is, however, important to keep South Africa’s own background in mind. A good point made by Australia, is the fact that international <b>commercial</b> arbitration <b>legislation</b> and domestic <b>commercial</b> arbitration <b>legislation,</b> should be kept separate. This will bring about effectiveness and clarity for the users of the said legislation. Furthermore, as end conclusion, the Commission’s view is not favoured in regard to the fact that South Africa’s domestic arbitration legislation should not be based on the UNCITRAL Model Law. It {{would be a good idea}} to follow suit with Australia and base both South Africa’s international and domestic <b>commercial</b> arbitration <b>legislation</b> on the UNCITRAL Model Law.

The autonomy was given {{in the name of}} Lithuania, which was a significant Lithuanian diplomatic achievement, and the four international signatories just confirmed it. Matters specifically placed under local authority included public worship and education, local administrative divisions, health and social welfare, roads and public works, civil, criminal, and <b>commercial</b> <b>legislation,</b> local police, taxes (except custom duties). The region had its own legislative body (Memel Landtag) elected for a three-year term in free democratic elections. The President of Lithuania appointed a governor of the region.

The reasons for a veto did not include laws contrary to the interest of Lithuania.
