40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} a responsible investment index (FTSE 4 Good) on corporate social responsibility (CSR). In the first study I investigate the impact of the FTSE engagement reinforced by the threat of exclusion from the index on companies’ improvements in environmental management. The results show that FTSE involvement doubles the probability that a company will meet stricter environmental management requirements within the three-year period 2002 to 2005. Both the dialogue and the exclusion threat stimulate compliance but the dialogue appears to be more effective where the perceived threat of exclusion is higher. The engagement effect persists {{for at least five years}} and is positively related to low concentrated ownership and to domicile in a coordinated market economy. In the second study I examine FTSE 4 Good’s effect on the probability that a company will implement strong countering bribery practices within the two-year time period 2007 to 2009. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of engagement and exclusion threat is significant in promoting compliance and the two act independently. Stronger anti-bribery provisions are positively associated with companies based in liberal market economies, with better internal governance and higher reputational concerns related to ethical controversies. In the third study I investigate FTSE 4 Good’s impact on companies’ compliance with climate change criteria. The results show that the index is able to stimulate compliance and the dialogue appears to contribute more than the exclusion threat. I also find that the likelihood of the company adopting the required practices is negatively associated with concentrated ownership and with strong internal governance. Finally, the results offer some evidence that compliance is related to subsequent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. These studies contribute to the understanding as to how different CSR areas are promoted or discouraged by the managers and the owners, and how the institutional environment influences this.

40|$|The {{importance}} of community conversation explores {{the characteristics of}} community building and engagement activities as understood and applied in some organisations by senior representatives in the Victorian Public Service. The broader community building and social capital agenda is explored through theoretical literature and empirical data. The community communication model offers future direction for addressing the gap in symbolic and systemic communications as a fundamental component of community development activity. Elements of interpretivism, structuration and semiotic theory have been utilised {{in an attempt to}} create a methodology to understand that that community conversations can occur. This eclectic approach {{is referred to as the}} paradigmatic architecture throughout the text. The body of work was guided by two research questions: What are the understandings of senior representatives from government agencies regarding community building and its application within their organisation and more broadly across government? Do gaps emerge from the theoretical literature and empirical body of knowledge on community building and its logic? The {{importance of}} community communication introduces a paradigmatic framework in which to apply the knowledge of community building in two portfolios within the Victorian Public Service, the portfolios of Environment and Transport. The empirical data was generated through deep peer-constructed conversations with senior representatives in the state bureaucracy, and the theoretical data through a wide ranging review of community development, social capital building and semiotic literature. The research juxtaposes key elements of Interpretivism, structuration and semiotic theories to build the narrative of the community building agenda being implemented in parts of the Victorian public service. The ontologies of the research paradigm and two theories used to generate data and build the narrative of community conversation are subtly different but aligned, as together they recognise that the construction of social reality is created by individuals and their <b>collective</b> <b>monitoring</b> and adaptation of social structures. The data generated by the in-depth conversations have been thematically arranged around five key concepts in order to build the narrative of the community conversation. Findings from the research include three main points: the logic for community strengthening in the two portfolios has not been consistently applied; the reform of government business is not intellectually contextualised by an understanding of social capital; and communication is not recognised as a foundation principle in policy or practice. The researcher proposes a response to the inconsistent application of community building and the limited system-based thinking on communications through the generation of the community communication model. Taking social communication as a foundation principle, the model is an attempt to bring together the process of making meaning in public places and community development methods, to provide guidance in the design of community relationships. Within the formation of the paradigmatic architecture, the argument of the thesis utilises the following logic; &bull; Semiotics considers action to be socially constructed and when juxtaposed with interpretivism and structuration enables an explanatory architecture to be theorised &bull; The paradigmatic architecture can be used as a methodology to explore cultural constructions, and in this instance community engagement &bull; The analysis of community building through using a community communication model can address gaps in the current understanding and implementation of community building activity. This thesis commences the building of a community communication model. The model serves as the starting point for additional research into government attempts at community building and as a conceptual framework for practitioners to explore as they continue to search for innovation in generating social capital...|$|E
40|$|Commonsense {{says that}} {{monitoring}} systems {{should be able}} to provide feedback that can help correct ineffective actions. But practice shows that when dealing with complex rural development issues that involve collaborative action by a changing configuration of stakeholders, monitoring practice often falls short of its potential. In this thesis, I describe my search to understand why practice is so limited and what might be needed to design monitoring processes that foster learning in concerted action around equitable and sustainable development. I examine the contradiction between monitoring as the basis for learning in ‘messy partnerships’ and the reality of monitoring driven by a concern for upward financial accountability. The environment – natural, organisational and socio-political – constantly gives feedback. But feedback needs to be perceived and interpreted for learning in rural resource management. Monitoring can be viewed as designing and implementing the feedback loops necessary to ensure that collective learning is fed by ongoing information flows within and among members of ‘messy partnerships’ and enables concerted action. However, neither monitoring nor learning are, by and large, described in neither comprehensive nor precise enough terms for implementation as part of sustainable resource management. The promising potential of more participatory approaches, if based on the same logic as mainstream M&E as is commonly the case, does not provide sufficient innovation. In Chapter 1, I introduce the focus of the thesis via a metaphor that emerged during fieldwork in Brazil – ‘tiririca’ (Cyperus rotundus) a pernicious weed that sprouts back more ferociously the more it is cut back. ‘Tiririca’ represents the complexity of developing a learning process based on monitoring concerted action, as well as the need for structural solutions. In this chapter, I introduce concepts – institutional transformation, messy partnerships, monitoring and (collective) learning – that have spawned my quest for monitoring alternatives. I outline the growing relevance of the topic, which brings me to my research questions: 1. How is ‘monitoring’ viewed by rural development and resource management discourses that advocate more adaptive forms of rural resource management? On what assumptions and presuppositions about processes of monitoring, collective learning and improved action are these discourses based? What practical orientation do they give for learning-oriented monitoring? 2. What is the underlying logic – with related presuppositions – of mainstream monitoring approaches and hence what is the monitoring theory that is expected to guide practice? 3. What can practical experience from small scale rural change processes in Brazil and from a large rural development organization show about what is needed for monitoring to contribute to collective learning? 4. What insights are offered by studies on cognition and organizational learning that can help fill the theoretical gaps and overcome the practical challenges of learning-oriented monitoring? 5. Given these empirical and theoretical insights, what would an alternative monitoring approach require so that it can trigger the forms of learning needed to ensure adaptive and collaborative rural resource management? In Chapter 2, I explain how the thesis evolved from questions emerging from my involvement from 1994 to date in diverse interventions and organisations. I have sought to fuse the strands of experience into a cohesive argument by discussing the key experiences and theories on which I draw in this thesis, and the methodologies used. I make use of four aspects of theory to interpret experiences: contextualising discourses, the espoused theory and theory-in-use of monitoring, theoretical building blocks, and methodological theory. In Chapter 3, I argue why the focus of this thesis is so critical. I examine three key discourses that are currently guiding much of the thinking and practice in rural resource management – adaptive management, collaborative resource management, and sustainable rural livelihoods. These discourses are concerned with adaptive behaviour, collective learning and interactive decision–making. They are value-driven and focus on environmental conservation, equitable resource use, and poverty alleviation. The adaptive management discourse highlights four features in monitoring for resource management: the hypothesis-refining effect of models by using simulated monitoring data; the role of indicators to make tangible the visions, targets and resource states; the importance of investing in long-term data collection and deliberative processes on that data; and the focus on scientific experimentation and surprise. However, in practice various problems occur, including the time and expense of the necessary data; inadequate ecological monitoring; difficulty of agreeing on what merits experimentation and should be monitored; and naivety about the challenges of jointly designing monitoring systems and information analysis. For collaborative resource management (CRM), monitoring efforts should combine a logic model perspective and hypothesis testing. The logic model perspective is used to plan initiatives and structure their monitoring. Such models focus on monitoring indicators for specific pre-determined results to prove progress and ensure accountability. Joint articulation and continual assessment of indicators is central to monitoring CRM. Criticism of CRM includes: naivety about ‘community’ and consensus and simplifying the complexity of <b>collective</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The sustainable rural livelihoods approach (SLA), or framework, calls for an M&E system, with accompanying indicators, to assess progress towards livelihood sustainability. Livelihood approaches rely on mainstream M&E practice, which, in the case of externally-driven/initiated development interventions, means using programme logic models. The role of monitoring is couched in general terms, such as using the livelihoods framework to structure M&E processes. The livelihoods literature offers a set of desirable monitoring practices, which constitutes an idealised and overly simplified perspective, and refers uncritically to existing methods and approaches that perpetuate the problems they bring and no guidance on integrated use. Notwithstanding the mentioned limitations, ‘learning’ with and by stakeholders is an important principle in all three approaches and is expected to help identify actions that, in turn, are expected to be more effective for goal achievement. Such learning is assumed to require systematic seeking and sharing of information, hence the need for feedback loops for which monitoring is considered the prime vehicle. However, none of the discourses identifies how these feedback loops need to be constructed. Monitoring is expected to provide raw data and spaces for reflection to create insights. How learning should occur is articulated mainly in terms of intentions and principles, with practical references being made towards existing logic models or hypothesis-testing approaches and to participatory methods. The discourses rely on an unclear mix of monitoring as a research process and monitoring of set objectives based on programme logic models. In Chapter 4, I discuss programme-logic based monitoring by drawing on several monitoring guidelines, representative of those widely used in the development sector. I identify 13 presuppositions that underpin the espoused theory of mainstream monitoring. These presuppositions relate to: the definitional boundaries of monitoring, how information is viewed, and how monitoring processes are perceived to be constructed and implemented. A definitional boundary is created between ‘monitoring’ and ‘evaluation’, presumed to be a useful enough distinction to construct feedback mechanisms and information systems (Presupposition 1). A link is assumed to exist between monitoring and how it is to serve management (Presupposition 2). Strategic analysis and sense-making are presumed to not require explicit inclusion when developing a monitoring process (Presupposition 3). The second cluster of presuppositions relate to how information is viewed. Monitoring systems are designed to fill information needs, rather to interpret information (Presupposition 4). Stakeholders are expected to be able to anticipate their information needs adequately, in terms of a comprehensive and fairly stable set of indicators, with related methods and processes, irrespective of the diversity of actors or issues at stake (Presupposition 5). Monitoring guidelines overwhelmingly ignore processes to analyse, reflect critically, interpret, and communicate information (Presupposition 6). Indicators are considered an appropriate form in which to express and convey a balanced picture of information that enables learning (Presuppositions 7 and 8). The third set of presuppositions relate to how monitoring processes are expected to be constructed and implemented, which are summarised as a series of standardised steps. Stakeholders are presumed to have sufficient time, expertise, clarity and willingness to follow the basic steps in sufficient detail for effective results (Presupposition 9). Mainstream monitoring presumes that the steps have a generic validity, irrespective of socio-cultural context (Presupposition 10). Power relations between those involved in monitoring are ignored other than, at most, to say they matter (Presupposition 11). Mainstream monitoring presumes that people will {{know how to deal with}} and effectively use informal monitoring that occurs through daily interactions outside the prescribed formal processes and channels (Presupposition 12). Monitoring systems are not viewed as needing to learn from, or adapt to, the environment in which they are being implemented (Presupposition 13). Mainstream monitoring based on these presuppositions is expected to provide the feedback or information that is supposed to trigger learning in development initiatives. No distinction is made in terms of the validity of this model of monitoring for different types of development processes or for different types of organisational configurations. Empirical material is discussed in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 : M&E efforts in 36 IFAD projects operating on the basis of mainstream monitoring, and a three-year action research project with a ‘messy partnership’ in Brazil based on participatory monitoring as a possible alternative. Evidence from 36 IFAD projects indicates that the presuppositions on which mainstream monitoring is premised are problematic. Two types of difference can be found: between the monitoring theory about the operational context and the surrounding realities, and between monitoring theory and monitoring practice. Difficulties result from insufficient attention is given to the ‘fit’ of monitoring processes and their underlying logic with the operational contexts of IFAD projects. Furthermore, the linear cause-effect perspective and procedural focus on how to construct and implement monitoring does not recognise the reality of dynamic partnerships having to construct a shared understanding of the initial intentions of development intervention. Finally, monitoring practice is not based on a clear understanding of what learning is, how it can be designed and how it occurs in relation to monitoring. The action research work in Brazil showed that participatory monitoring is not necessarily the answer. Five important issues need to be addressed if more participatory forms of monitoring are to contribute to collective learning. First, learning must be seen to result from the process of developing monitoring and from the data. Valuing both is important for ‘messy partnerships’, who must continually articulate, refine and (re) align understandings and priorities. Second, messy partnerships require finding an interpretation of ‘participation’ that fosters concerted action, yet respects the uniqueness of partners and their own cultures and rhythms of reflection. Third, dialogue between partners is critically important if data are to be useful. Therefore, participatory monitoring requires shifting from a view of monitoring as a data system to monitoring as a communication process. Fourth, approaching all monitoring through one type of data process (i. e. indicators stacked in an objective hierarchy) and a static image of partnership in concerted action does not fulfil the need for diverse learning processes that occur in institutional transformation (e. g., technical innovation, dissemination, organisational change). Finally, setting up the participatory monitoring process proved more costly and less sustainable than initially expected. The dynamics within and between the partners, and the shift in strategic focus as understanding emerged (in part as a result of monitoring) mean that activities come and go, and so does the related monitoring. Participatory monitoring only provides some advantages as it replicates, at least in part, several of the questionable presuppositions of mainstream monitoring. The empirical material brings me to suggest that programme-logic based monitoring – whether as mainstream or participatory practice – might benefit from insights drawn from other theoretical areas. Chapter 7 offers a set of ideas drawn from two fields: one, cognitive studies, that has not yet influenced monitoring practice in the development sector, and another, organisational learning, that is slowly being ‘courted’ as potentially interesting. Monitoring constitutes a deliberate and collective attempt to guide our ‘knowing’ or ‘cognition’ by seeking and processing information. Organisational learning examines how a group of people communicate and deal with information that is vital for the survival of their organisation, and in so doing draws on cognitive science. Therefore, both fields have potential to help reconsider beliefs about monitoring. Drawing insights from the two fields together brings me to four ideas with thought-provoking potential for rethinking monitoring: (1) messy partnerships as collective cognitive agents; (2) distributed cognition; (3) sense-making; and (4) cognitive dissonance. The ideas can be summarised as follows. Messy partnerships must maintain coherence in their organisational and collective cognition, and correspondence with the external environment. Cognition in a messy partnership is distributed, which requires convergence in order to come to effective concerted action. Sense-making is critical for convergence for which different approaches are needed, depending on the complexity of the circumstances and issues faced. Cognitive dissonance, or ‘surprise’, is an important indicator where coherence or correspondence are awry. Monitoring systems could be more purposively designed based on valuing cognitive dissonance as an important trigger for learning. Monitoring requires innovation if it is to contribute to its much lauded potential to enable learning. A shift is needed to see monitoring as: dialogical (not only a singular rationality), multi-ontological (not only assuming an ordered universe), distributed (not centralized), functioning through relationships and heuristics (not only through data and the hope of omniscience), essential for impact (not just a contractual obligation), sustaining collective cognition (not only the tracking of implementation), and seeking surprise (not only documenting the anticipated). Chapter 8 integrates the empirical and theoretical strands of the thesis by suggesting a set of eight design principles that are needed for collective learning in adaptive rural resource management. These design principles have been identified to offset the identified limitations found in the dominant paradigm of mainstream monitoring and in participatory monitoring. They are not a comprehensive set of design principles for learning-oriented monitoring. The first three principles relate to the purpose of monitoring, the next three principles relate to operational concerns, and the last two relate to sustaining monitoring practice. 1. Understand the nature of institutional transformation being pursued as a social change process, in order to know the degree of complexity one is dealing with, and the extent to which information needs can be anticipated and learning functions will be significant. 2. Recognise the nature of actors and partnerships on monitoring, by analysing the commitment of partners to concerted action, governance structures and decision making processes of each partner, allocation of responsibilities in the partnership, degree of overlap of information needs, way in which information is shared, and monitoring capacities. The reality of ‘messy partnerships’ forces a questioning of a hierarchical, intra-organisational model that underpins mainstream monitoring. 3. Specify distinct monitoring processes in terms of learning purposes to enable a more precise definition of tasks, protocols, responsibilities, time frames, formality and degree of ‘collectiveness’. For institutional transformation on the basis of deliberate concerted action undertaken by a messy partnership, nine learning purposes are likely to be relevant (though not all necessarily simultaneously or equally prominently) : financial accountability; operational improvement; strategic adjustment; contextual understanding; capacity strengthening; research; self-auditing; advocacy; and sensitisation. 4. Plan for sense-making as well as information. The sense-making process must be appropriate for the type of situation and issue being considered (i. e. multi-ontological). Seek to understand what is needed for critical reflection to be possible among and between the partners and how insights are best communicated, which capacities must be built to make this possible, which additional communication processes are needed, and allocating resources to this end. 5. Balance formal protocols and informal processes, incorporating everyday interactions of sharing and debate into the monitoring system, and linking the informal sphere to formal processes and channels. Informal processes are not only crucial for ongoing sense-making but also a source of information sharing. 6. Value and seek diverse types of information, related specifically to the nature of development (principle 1) and the learning function (principle 3) that has to be met, and understand which processes exist and/or are needed to ensure that such information is shared and debated and informs decisions. 7. Ensure the institutionalisation of learning-oriented monitoring. Concerted efforts are needed to ensure that policies, practices, methodologies, responsibilities, and incentives are all helping make monitoring as discussed in this thesis possible. 8. Approach monitoring as an evolving practice, thus allowing it to become a dynamic knowledge production process, which when subjected to regular critical reviews and adaptations retains relevance and usefulness. These design principles must be translated into practice by the key actors in development if the future of monitoring is to be more useful. Development implementers, facilitators, funding agencies and academics have distinct roles to play in the transformation of the ‘DNA’ of monitoring. The issues discussed in this thesis have relevance far beyond the approaches and initiatives discussed in this thesis. The notion of development-as-project is being replaced by the recognition that social injustices require institutional transformation. ‘Messy partnerships’ and other types of alliances are the new configurations through which institutional transformation increasingly must unfold. Monitoring, when conceived as a socially negotiated, evolving methodology for structuring information flows and knowledge production and use, offers an approach to help construct ‘pathways to sustainability’. However, we need to significantly revise mainstream beliefs and practices about how monitoring can create feedback to harness its potential to deepen and sustain the learning that societies need to deal with ‘wicked problems’. This requires reassessing the epistemic and ontological perspectives and principles that underpin monitoring, and determine its feasibility, relevance and ultimately, usefulness...|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{presented}} a large-scale study on collective attention {{as well as}} an investigation of data sampling for <b>monitoring</b> <b>collective</b> attention. We provide a new definition of collective attention and systematically studied the changing patterns of collective attention during disasters, and salient features - including five types of changes in attention network structure - were observed from multiple events. Our study design based on network statistics can be used to systematically observe collective attention dynamics across various conditions. Our examination of the attention sampling problem suggested that, while {{it is not difficult to}} capture collective attention under exogenous shocks due to the public’s concentration on attentive topics, <b>monitoring</b> <b>collective</b> attention dynamics across normal and event periods could be challenging. We proposed a novel sampling scheme that considers several aspects of how individuals normally share interest with their social network (activeness, connectedness, and adaptiveness) and demonstrated the utility of our approach through an extensive experimentation. We further provide a practical data sampling strategy such that the desirable monitoring effectiveness can be achieved given various sampling constraints imposed by the data sources. Moreover, the study framework as well as the sampling scheme we proposed can be applied to other social media platforms that have a hashtag feature, like Facebook and Instagram. Our model can also be applicable to non-social-media data. For example, we can trace the shift between keywords of papers to study the collective attention shift in research interests over time. For e-commerce systems where products have tags, we can study the users’ collective purchasing patterns by tracing the shifts between different tags from their purchasing history.|$|R

These information sources can be exploited to under- stand and <b>monitor</b> <b>collective</b> behaviors. In this work, we focus on polarization classes, i. e., those topics that require the user to side exclusively with one position. The proposed method provides an iterative classification of users and keywords: first, polarized users are identified, then polarized keywords are discovered by monitoring the activities of previously classified users. This method thus allows tracking users and topics over time. We report several experiments conducted on two Twitter datasets during political election time-frames. We measure the user classification accuracy on a golden set of users, and analyze the relevance of the extracted keywords for the ongoing political discussion. Comment: SIGIR 1...|$|R

The System for <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Collective</b> Bargaining, under the Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Economic Studies (SACC-Dieese), was used to analyze collective bargaining clauses (1990 - 2005) that deal with innovative processes. Interviews were held with leaders of unions belonging to the SACC-Dieese, seeking to understand what actually occurred following formal agreement to the clauses. We observed that the agreed-upon terms were not enforced in practice, revealing that the trade unions' influence in innovative processes was merely "apparent". The article seeks {{to demonstrate that the}} limited success of Brazilian trade unions in affecting technological and organizational innovations has been due not only to external constraints, but also to the unions' own limitations in formulating and interacting with technical and organizational changes...|$|R

Using an interpretation framework that puts the emphasis on <b>collective</b> learning and <b>monitoring</b> devices, we highlight the value of this type of approach in situations of great uncertainty where a coordinated process of innovation is required to achieve ambitious environmental targets. The implementation of this theoretical approach in the end-of-life vehicles (ELV) case, which has been the subject of several voluntary agreements in Europe, offers a fuller understanding of the characteristics and driving forces of the collective innovation process in action, as well as the obstacles that have still to be overcome. In particular, we explain why monitoring of innovation by the authorities, focusing on coordination mechanisms, is a crucial issue on which further research should be carried out...|$|R
40|$|Accomplishing useful tasks with a {{collection}} of decentralized mobile robots will require control methods that deal effectively with a number of unique problems that impede the system's progress. Reactive control architectures can easily cause the problems of stagnation and cyclic behaviour, both characterized by a lack of progress in achieving a task. In this paper we present one possible solution to stagnation recovery, motivated from the study of group transport in ants and demonstrate its use in a box-pushing task. By using stagnation recovery behaviours, which are triggered by a lack of progress in the task-achieving activity of the system, the <b>collective</b> system can <b>monitor</b> its own advancement in a decentralized manner. A set of such behaviours are progressively ordered using timeouts, with each set designed for a specific recovery strategy. The stagnation recovery behaviours have been tested in simulation with the results to be mapped onto a set of ten autonomous robots presently [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Non-adherence {{is a well}} {{recognised}} avoidable precipitant {{of emergency}} admissions in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. CHF patients often have multiple co-morbidities, each with complicated management plans. "Treatment burden" is the "work" undertaken by patients managing a chronic condition, and includes understanding treatments, engaging with others, taking complicated medication regimes, enacting lifestyle advice and attending hospital appointments. Our aim is {{develop an understanding of}} treatment burden in CHF patients, enabling us to identify points and types of intervention that would reduce non-adherence and potentially improve outcomes. Methods Secondary qualitative analysis of 46 interviews with CHF patients: 30 male; 20 female; aged between 45 and 88  years (mean age 73  yrs). Using normalisation process theory (NPT) as a coding framework, the data were categorised into the four NPT domains: coherence; cognitive participation; <b>collective</b> action; reflexive <b>monitoring.</b> Each of these domains has four subcategories as shown in Abstract 63 Table 1. Two researchers analysed all the transcripts and discussed any disagreements. Any dispute was resolved by a third party. Any data that fell outside of the NPT were noted. A taxonomy of "treatment" work was then created. There are four domains – Coherence, Cognitive Participation, <b>Collective</b> Action, Reflexive <b>Monitoring.</b> Each has four subcategories. Abbreviations are used to identify each subcategory e. g. for the domain "Coherence (CO) ", subcategory "Differentiation (DI) " is written "CODI". Results Workload or burden of treatment was described by patients across all four domains. Very little data fell outside the NPT framework, and any that did was emotional work which is not included in NPT. Abstract 63 Figure 1 shows the frequency of different types of burden, with the scale reflecting the number of times a category was recorded (see Abstract 63 Table 1 for key of categories). The most frequent category of work mentioned was enacting work such as taking multiple medications or attending multiple hospital appointments, the least mentioned was keeping up to date with current treatments. A taxonomy of treatment burden was constructed. Conclusion and implications We have created a conceptual model of treatment burden in CHF patients which can be used to inform the development of a scale to measure treatment burden...|$|R
40|$|Crowdsensing is {{emerging}} as a powerful paradigm capable of leveraging the <b>collective,</b> though imprecise, <b>monitoring</b> capabilities of common people carrying smartphones or other personal devices, which can effectively become real-time mobile sensors, collecting information about the physical places they live in. This unprecedented amount of information, considered collectively, offers new valuable opportunities to understand more thoroughly {{the environment in which}} we live and, more importantly, gives the chance to use this deeper knowledge to act and improve, in a virtuous loop, the environment itself. However, managing this process is a hard technical challenge, spanning several socio-technical issues: here, we focus on the related quality, reliability, and scalability trade-offs by proposing an architecture for crowdsensing platforms that dynamically self-configure and self-adapt depending on application-specific quality requirements. In the context of this general architecture, the paper will specifically focus on the Quasit distributed stream processing middleware, and show how Quasit can be used to process and analyze crowdsensing-generated data flows with differentiated quality requirements in a highly scalable and reliable way...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of New York City 2 ̆ 7 s fiscal crisis in 1975, both the New York state {{legislature}} and Congress passed laws aimed at helping the city recover. As {{a result of}} this legislation, the federal and state governments became more involved in the city 2 ̆ 7 s affairs and were tasked with <b>monitoring</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining between the city and its employees. Labor and management in the public sector were forced to cooperate in order {{to get out of the}} financial predicament, and the city survived the crisis. This article examines the changes in collective bargaining laws and practices that occurred as a result of the crisis, including productivity bargaining and gain-sharing, coalition bargaining, the use of salary review panels, and the emergence of the city 2 ̆ 7 s ability to pay as a major factor in public sector bargaining. The impact of the crisis on both labor and management is also examined. This articles concludes that although many people blamed collective bargaining for the crisis, there is much evidence that it actually helped the city solve the problem. Additionally, the financial crisis led to greater participation by labor unions in government processes...|$|R

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) has an {{immediate}} potential {{for use in}} food and feed industry in East and Central Africa (ECA). However, its industrial utilization in the region remains low, partly {{due to lack of}} improved processing technologies, lack of awareness of the alternative uses of cassava and technical know how for commercialization. To tap the potential of cassava in feed industry of Uganda, EARRNET and its partners, NARO, Ugachick and farmers, established in 2005 two pilot processing sites in the districts of Bukedea and Masindi. Site selection was based on the levels and potential for increasing cassava production, existence of farmer groups/association, storage facility, availability of reliable clean water supply and ease of access to market. The objectives of the project were to a) increase awareness on the benefits of using high quality cassava chips in feed industry, b) introduce and promote use of improved processing and drying technologies c) assess the quality of cassava chips and d) develop better marketing strategies for cassava chips. The technology was introduced in a participatory manner through mobilization, sensitization, trainings, quality assessment, <b>collective</b> marketing, <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation. As a result, farmers got to know the potential benefits of cassava chips usage in animal feeds. The introduction of the improved drying facilities enabled farmers reduce drying time from 7 - 10 days as reported in traditional set-up to 1 - 2 days. The moisture content of the chips (10 - 12 %) processed using the new technology was significantly (P 1 ppm) than those traditionally processed (15 ppm). Cyanide levels in traditionally processed chips (17 - 35 ppm) was significantly (p 5 tonnes). Due to anticipated income generation from improved processing, acreage under cassava production in the project area increased by over 50 %. However, though farmers embraced the improved technology, there still exist some hurdles that are discussed in this paper. The lessons learned from the study will help to improve further out scaling of production and utilisation of cassava technologies in the region. Peer Revie...|$|R
