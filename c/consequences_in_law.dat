I {{will not say}} that she had told a falsehood, or that Elsley had forsworn himself {{when he got the}} licence: but certainly both of them were guilty of something very like a white lie, when they declared that Lucia had the consent of her sole surviving guardian, on the strength of an half-angry, half-jesting expression of Scoutbush's that she might marry whom she chose, provided she did not plague him. In the first triumph of success and intoxication of wedded bliss, Lucia had written him a saucy letter, reminding him of his permission, and saying that she had taken him at his word: but her conscience smote her; and Elsley's smote him likewise; and smote him all the more, because he had been married under a false name, a fact which might have ugly <b>consequences</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> which he did not like to contemplate. To do him justice, he had been half-a-dozen times during his courtship on the point of telling Lucia his real name and history. Happy for him had he done so, whatever might have been the consequences: but he wanted moral courage; the hideous sound of Briggs had become horrible to him; and once his foolish heart was frightened away from honesty, just as honesty was on the point of conquering, by old Lady Knockdown's saying that she could never have married a man with an ugly name, or let Lucia marry one.|$|E

Gathering evidence may take many forms; presenting evidence that tend to prove or disprove the point at issue is strictly governed by rules.

As electronic resources become more prevalent and available, courts begin citing to them. The emerging digital-born information and the new network models of communication such as Law Blogs and Wikipedia have already acquired a certain status, being cited by court decisions. For example, the U. S. Supreme Court recently cited a videotape in its decision of Scott v. Harris (2007), saying 2 ̆ 2 it speaks for itself, 2 ̆ 2 and included it in the opinion as an attachment.

40|$|This Master's degree thesis {{deals with}} {{legislation}} on the "principle of {{concentration in the}} contentious procedure" and related legal institutes. Pursuant {{to the principle of}} concentration, the parties to the civil proceedings are obliged to concentrate and perform the prescribed pleadings within particular time period. These pleadings include among others: allegation of material facts, proposed evidence to prove these facts and objections to the procedural matters. After the passage of prescribed time, a factual and evidentiary "stop condition" occurs, i. e. the parties to the proceedings are not able to perform the pleadings with relevant <b>consequences</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> anymore. Legislation on the principle of concentration has been significantly amended by adoption of several Civil Procedure Code amendments, namely Act N. 30 / 2000 Coll. and Act N. 7 / 2009 Coll. The thesis aims to analyse and critically evaluate these amendments. The thesis consists of seven chapters. The introductory chapter defines the theoretical concept of the principle of concentration and its intended purpose. The second chapter describes the concept of legal principles and places the principle of concentration in the group of civil procedure principles. The main attention is paid to the principle of legal order, the principle of [...] ...|$|E

The thesis is divided into nine chapters; the first four are devoted to philosophical and historical introduction to the concept of "time", while the remaining five are focused on the influence of time in the context of the current Civil Code. The first chapter follows the perception of time from the beginning of mankind, deriving primarily from the work of a major Romanian historian and philosopher of the last century - Mircea Eliade. The second chapter is dedicated to time as divisible quantity and describes the different ways to divide time through the day on a longer term units - years. The third chapter discusses the concept of time in ancient Rome from the perspective of the great scholars of his time - Isidore of Seville and Ambrosia Theodosius Macrobius. It describes not only the Roman division of time, but also the development of the Roman calendar [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The law {{relating}} {{to the use of}} name was originally dominated by the patriarchal principle, so that only {{the name of the father}} was passed on. A married woman generally had to accept the name of her husband.

40|$|An important, though oft neglected, {{distinction}} between multilateral treaty obligations separates obligations of the bilateral nature {{from those of}} the collective or erga omnes partes type. Multilateral obligations of the bilateral type can be reduced to a compilation of bilateral, state-to-state relations. They can be compared to contracts. Collective obligations, in contrast, cannot be divided into bilateral components. They are concluded in pursuit of a collective interest that transcends the individual interests of the contracting parties. The standard example of such obligations are those arising under a human rights treaty. <b>In</b> domestic <b>law,</b> collective obligations can be compared to criminal law statutes or even domestic constitutions. This essay examines the origins of the {{distinction between}} bilateral and collective obligations, as well as its major <b>consequences,</b> both <b>in</b> <b>law</b> of treaties and the law on state responsibility. On that basis, a wider typology of multilateral treaty obligations is suggested. In the exercise, obligations arising under the World Trade Organization are used as a case study.

40|$|This paper aims at {{exploring}} how intentional {{a piece of}} behavior should be to count as an action, and how a minimal view on action, not requiring a richly intentional causation, may still qualify as voluntary. Knowing what counts as an action {{is not only a}} matter of nominal definition. It has important <b>consequences</b> <b>in</b> education, <b>law,</b> as well as in ethics. One unresolved question in the domain of action consists in determining which features, if any, are distinctive of human action as contrasted with non-human animal action. The interest of studying what Kent Bach (1978) called "minimal actions " is that they seem not to presuppose any prior intention, not even any conscious decision. Defining a minimal action as a guided bodily movement (not requiring an intentional- belief-desire-causation) will help us discuss some issues that become easily blurred within the folk-psychological approach to full-fledged, richly intentional actions. In the first section, I will first develop the contrast between the two kinds of action and offer reasons for taking the category of minimal action as a functionally relevant one. In the second section, this "austere " definition of action will be used to test our intuitions about wha...|$|R

Therefore the thesis consists of two main parts. In part one, the thesis defines the legal principle concept and continues with the autonomy of the will characteristic, from which the contractual freedom principle derives, and then it describes its restrictions as a reset of both the principle of equality and the principle of protection of the weaker party to contract. As follows, the thesis {{deals with the}} position of labor law within the private law area, its historical development, the influence of the Constitutional Court decision no. 116 / 2008 Coll. and the adoption of the new Civil Code in terms of the labor law contractual freedom extent. The ending of the first part is dedicated to the modern "flexicurity" system that seeks to reach the balance between contractual freedom on one hand and an employee protection within labor law on the other hand.

40|$|The UK Immigration Rules were amended in April 2013 {{to include}} a new {{category}} of leave: ‘Part 14 stateless persons’. Statelessness arises {{when a person is}} not a national of a state. The guide focuses upon the definition applied by the UK Immigration Rules: ‘a person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law’. This definition is taken from the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons (the 1954 Convention). An important feature of the Immigration Rules relating to stateless persons is the scope they provide to secure recognition by the Home Office of statelessness, a legal condition which itself has important <b>consequences</b> <b>in</b> international <b>law.</b> The guide sets out the view of the authors on best practice in advising and representing clients considering or making an application for statelessness leave in the UK.

Some key questions of law and practice have yet to be addressed by the courts; the guide provides a snapshot of the state of play as at September 2016.

It may also be of use to organisations working with potentially stateless persons who may refer them to legal advisers.
