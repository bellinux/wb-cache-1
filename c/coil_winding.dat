2500|$|The actual wire {{employed}} in voice <b>coil</b> <b>winding</b> {{is almost always}} copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the moving mass of the coil. While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about {{one third of the}} mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{set up for}} cryocooler based ac susceptometer {{is designed}} and fabricated. Hylum is chosen as the former material. Primary and secondary <b>coils</b> are <b>winded</b> over a single hylum former. Secondary coil, a set of two equal and oppositely <b>winded</b> <b>coils,</b> is first <b>winded</b> over the hylum former. Then the primary <b>coil</b> is <b>winded</b> over it. Copper wire (150 micron) is used for winding. The whole set up is then set in the cryocooler (HC- 4 E, Sumltomo cryogenics). An ac current is supplied to the primary coil from DSP Lock-in Amplifier (Model SR 830), which produces the required magnetic field. This magnetic field magnetize the sample and an induced emf in secondary coil is observed. The effect of magnetic field in secondary coil is cancelled by the two oppositely <b>winded</b> <b>coil</b> system. So that the emf induced is only due to the change in moment of sample. This emf is then separated to in-phase and out-of phase voltage component in lock-in amplifier. The in-phase and out-of phase voltage component is converted to in-phase and out-of phase component of ac susceptibility by dividing a voltage factor V 0. Temperature is lowered down to liquid helium temperature in cryocooler and data are recorded using lab view program. Then the in-phase and out-of phase component of ac susceptibility is plotted against varying temperature. This is the background plot for ac susceptometer. In our project we have chosen La 1 -xSr xMnO 3 (LSMO) as sample. Sample is prepared by auto combustion sol-gel method. Pellets are made and cut into rectangular shape. One such rectangular shaped cut sample is carefully placed in the centre {{of one of the}} secondary coil. Then the ac susceptibility measurement is done by retaining all the parameter such as applied voltage and frequency constant in lock-in amplifier. Data are plotted and the susceptibility plot with sample is obtained. The susceptibility plot for sample was obtained by deducting the background from the susceptibility plot with sample. The phase change in the LSMO system is studied using the Ac susceptometer. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{technically}} {{pure copper}} is {{being replaced by}} aluminium as conductive material in electrical transformers for power systems. This evolution brings new manufacturing challenges. One major difficulty is the limited weld ability and non-acceptable residual deformations of the aluminium, when welded by fusion arc welding processes. The Friction Stir Welding (FSW) was selected for evaluation considering the requisites of the application on mechanical strength, distortion and electrical conductivity. The current work evaluates the feasibility of application of FSW to join successive residual aluminium foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils,</b> into new longer foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils.</b> The residual foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> are made of AA 1070 with 1. 6 mm thick and 1100 mm wide. The residual foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> are butt jointed by FSW and rewind in one new longer foil winding until the total length of the new bobbin already enables its application {{in the production of}} new components for high voltage electrical transformers. This way, the FSW may be used as key technique to add-value and promote a more sustainable industrial production system. Each of the residual foil <b>winding</b> <b>coils</b> had an average weight of about 250 kg, which required the development of dedicated supporting, positioning and clamping systems. The technological conditions to be implemented in real scale are initially developed in 300 mm length welds.

It was demonstrated the technological feasibility of joining by FSW, and rewind, residual winding foils, to produce new coils complying with the requirements for distortion, mechanical strength and electrical resistance properties.
