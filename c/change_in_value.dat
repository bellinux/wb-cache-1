25|$|The re-indexing {{problem of}} {{leveraged}} ETFs {{stems from the}} arithmetic effect of volatility of the underlying index. Take, for example, an index that begins at 100 and a 2X fund based on that index that also starts at 100. In a first trading period (for example, a day), the index rises 10% to 110. The 2X fund will then rise 20% to 120. The index then drops back to 100 (a drop of 9.09%), {{so that it is}} now even. The drop in the 2X fund will be 18.18% (2*9.09). But 18.18% of 120 is 21.82. This puts the value of the 2X fund at 98.18. Even though the index is unchanged after two trading periods, an investor in the 2X fund would have lost 1.82%. This decline in value can be even greater for inverse funds (leveraged funds with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3). It always occurs when the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of the underlying index changes direction. And the decay in value increases with volatility of the underlying index.|$|E
2500|$|The decibel (symbol: dB) is a {{logarithmic}} unit used {{to express}} the ratio of one value of a physical property to another, and may be {{used to express}} a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> (e.g., +1 dB or -1 dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a reference value; when used in this way, the decibel symbol should be appended with a suffix that indicates the reference value or some other property. For example, if the reference value is 1 volt, then the suffix is [...] "V" [...] (i.e., [...] "20 dBV"), and if the reference value is one milliwatt, then the suffix is [...] "m" [...] (i.e., [...] "20 dBm"). [...] However, sound pressure level is referenced to the [...] "threshold of hearing" [...] (generally given as 20 micropascals at 1 kHz), and the suffix is [...] "SPL" [...] (i.e., [...] "60 dB SPL").|$|E

2500|$|In physics, {{as well as}} mathematics, a vector {{is often}} {{identified}} with a tuple of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients {{for a set of}} basis vectors. When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called covariant or contravariant depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are [...] "regular vectors" [...] with units of distance (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as gradient. If you change units (a special case of a change of basis) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1m becomes 1000mm–a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1K/m becomes 0.001K/mm–a covariant <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>value.</b> See covariance and contravariance of vectors. Tensors are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of tensor.|$|E
6000|$|There are cases, however, {{in which}} the {{potential}} change of the [...] precious metals affects their value as money {{in the same way}} that [...] it affects the value of other things. Such a case was the change [...] in the value of silver in 1876. The usual causes assigned for that [...] serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from [...] the mines of Nevada; the demonetization of silver by Germany; and [...] the decreased demand for export to India. It is true that the [...] exports of silver from England to India fell off from about [...] $32,000,000 in 1871-1872 to about $23,000,000 in 1874-1875; but [...] none of the increased Nevada silver was exported from the United [...] States to London, nor had Germany put more than $30,000,000 of her [...] silver on the market;(233) and yet the price of silver so fell [...] that the depreciation amounted to 20-¼ per cent as compared with [...] the average price between 1867 and 1872. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>value,</b> [...] however, took place without any corresponding change in the actual [...] quantity in circulation. The relation between prices and the [...] quantities of the precious metals is, therefore, not so exact, [...] certainly as regards silver, as Mr. Mill would have us believe; [...] and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of [...] Demand and Supply {{in the same way that}} it affects things other [...] than money.|$|E

The value of these articles, in the quantities [...] specified, and all of standard quality, shall be ascertained [...] monthly or weekly by Government, and the total sum [in money] [...] which would then purchase this bill of goods shall be, thereupon, [...] officially promulgated. Persons may then, if they choose, make [...] their contracts for future payments {{in terms of this}} multiple or [...] tabular standard.”(225) A, who had borrowed $1,000 of B in 1870 [...] for ten years, would make note of the total money value of all [...] these articles composing the multiple standard, which we will [...] suppose is $125 in 1870. Consequently, A would promise to pay B [...] eight multiple units in ten years (that is, eight times $125, or [...] $1,000). But, if other things <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> relatively to money [...] during these ten years, the same sum of money—$1,000—in 1880 will [...] not return to B the same just amount of purchasing power which he [...] parted with in 1870. Now, if, in 1880, when his note falls due, [...] the government list is examined, and it is found that commodities [...] in general have fallen in value relatively to gold, the multiple [...] unit will not amount to as much gold as it did in 1870; perhaps [...] each unit may be rated only at $100. In that case, A is obliged to [...] pay back but eight multiple units, which costs him only $800 in [...] money, while B receives from A the same amount of purchasing power [...] over other commodities which he loaned to him. B had no just claim [...] to ten units, since the fall of all commodities relatively to gold [...] was not due to his exertions. On the other hand, if, between 1870 [...] and 1880, prices had risen, mutatis mutandis, the eight units [...] would have cost A more than $1,000 in gold; but he would have been [...] justly obliged to return the same amount of purchasing power to B [...] which he received from him.|$|E

More specifically, I {{am interested in}} what ways individuals lose religiosity and how they compare to those who maintain or gain religiosity. Using the National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR) longitudinal dataset, I examine if <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>values</b> surrounding the meaning of life, equality and care, and marriage between waves significantly affects <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> levels of religiosity. I look at three dimensions of religiosity, involvement, orthodoxy, and affiliation, as my dependent variables. First differences modeling, also known as change score modeling, along with OLS and logistic regressions {{were used to assess}} the relationships of the dependent and independent variables between Waves 1 and 3 of the NSYR. Results suggest that among the three dimensions of religiosity, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>values</b> impact <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> religious involvement and orthodoxy over time, but not affiliation. Furthermore, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> thinking about the meaning of life increased respondents??? likelihood of losing religious affiliation whereas <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>valuing</b> equality and care and conservative marriage ideals decreased this likelihood. Future research should continue to look at religiosity as a complex, multi-dimensional concept rather than measuring it with one variable alone while investigating adolescence and emerging adulthood as a time of self-exploration and religious identity development.

40|$|Coalescing is a data {{restructuring}} operation {{applicable to}} temporal databases. It merges timestamps of adjacent or overlapping tuples that have identical attribute values. The {{likelihood that a}} temporal query employs coalescing is very high. However, coalescing is an expensive and time consuming operation. In this paper 1 we present a novel temporal relational model through which coalescing be-comes quite simple. The basic idea is to augment each time-varying attribute in a temporal relation with two additional attributes that trace <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>values</b> of the correspond-ing time-varying attribute. One attribute traces <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>values</b> with respect to each individual instance (i. e. tuples having the same key value), while the other attribute traces <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>values</b> globally for all instances (i. e. all tuples in the temporal relation).
