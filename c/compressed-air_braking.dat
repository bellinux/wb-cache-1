50|$|The {{locomotive}} brake was a Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake.</b> Braking {{worked on}} one side of all the carrying and coupled wheels. Some of the locomotives were later equipped with Indusi train protection.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were later}} {{fitted with a}} Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake,</b> a steam heating system, washout equipment, sand distributor and adjustable blastpipe.|$|R
50|$|From {{running number}} 2094 (1921 series) onwards the {{locomotives}} had factory-fitted <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes,</b> from running number 2112 (1923 series) the engines were equipped with Knorr feedwater heaters on {{the crown of}} the boiler barrel behind the chimney. Those engines delivered prior to that were all retrofitted with <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes</b> and, in most cases, also with surface economisers. The 1908/09 series only rarely had preheaters. Where they were fitted they were located {{to the side of}} the chimney.|$|R
50|$|A Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake</b> was {{installed}} as the locomotive brake. The air pump was originally {{on the left}} of the smokebox; later it was moved to the right.|$|R
50|$|Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{installed}} for locomotive braking. This worked {{on one side}} only of all carrying and coupled wheels. Locomotives 19 012, 015, 017 and 022 were later fitted with Riggenbach counter-pressure brakes.|$|R
50|$|Braking for {{locomotive}} {{and train}} {{was provided by}} a Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake.</b> On the two prototypes the air pump was on the right, on the remaining locomotives it was installed on the left hand side.|$|R
50|$|The {{air pump}} for the <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake</b> was {{positioned}} {{at the front}} right, next to the smokebox, the air reservoirs were {{on the right and}} left of the boiler and the silencer was fixed to the chimney.|$|R
50|$|The <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes</b> {{worked on}} {{only the first}} three cars of the train, and seven brakemen (two of whom died in the derailment) had been {{distributed}} throughout the train, to set the brakes when signalled {{to do so by}} the locomotive whistle.|$|R
50|$|On steam {{locomotives}} {{without a}} second independent brake system (like e.g. a <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake,</b> vacuum brake or steam brake) for the engine, {{in addition to the}} usual counterweight or fixed brake, the countersteam brake was used as a braking system. Today, steam locomotives generally have to have two independent brake systems in order to be licensed, so that the countersteam brake is not viewed as a braking system, but is nevertheless still used.|$|R
50|$|Because Heberlein brakes {{were still}} {{partially}} in use at that time, the locomotives also had, on delivery, the necessary equipment for them, complete with guide rollers and winders (Haspel). The locomotive itself had a Knorr <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake</b> which {{was controlled by}} the vacuum brake used for the train.|$|R
50|$|Initially a Hardy {{vacuum brake}} was installed; this was later {{replaced}} by a Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake.</b> The sander was hand-operated and sanded {{the second and third}} axles. The engines also had a Latowski steam-operated bell and, later, a steam turbo generator was fitted over the smokebox door outside the locomotive body to provide electric lighting.|$|R
5000|$|The brake {{effort of}} the Kö was {{initially}} only determined {{by the weight of}} the engine driver and the maximum force he could transmit via the brake pedal. With the introduction of new, more powerful motors (up to [...] ) and the corresponding increase in tractive effort this proved insufficient; as a result many light locos in the DB and DR were equipped with a <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake,</b> that could also operated the brakes of attached wagons. DR engines were not equipped with their own brake cylinders so that only the attached wagons were air-braked. In the DB the permitted top speed was raised from 30 to 45 km/h where <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes</b> had been installed. These locos can be easily recognised by their air reservoirs on the front. Because the open cab gave no real protection from the weather in winter, doors and windows were added during the course of main inspections from the late 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Between 1991 and 1994 it did brief {{service in}} green livery as no. 21 {{in charge of}} the {{heritage}} train (Traditionszug), a special made up of historic coaches, which the Mallet locomotives to that point could not haul as their brakes were not compatible with the new <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes</b> of the train. In addition it carried out duties from its home station of Gernrode.|$|R
50|$|The Kunze-Knorr brake brought {{together}} {{the ideas of}} Prussian senior surveyor, Bruno Kunze (1854-1935), and preparatory work by the founder of Knorr-Bremse, Georg Knorr (1859-1911). It was the first, continuous, <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake</b> that, even on long goods trains, enabled the brake force not only to be applied gradually, but also released again gradually. By combining a single-stage and a two-stage brake cylinder with a compound brake {{a significant increase in}} brake effort was achieved.|$|R
50|$|They {{were the}} {{predecessors}} of the Saxon Class V V. Between 1859 and 1887 they were delivered in three batches of 24, 31 and 118 engines. They had an overhanging outer firebox and a steam dome. They had {{different types of}} valve gear; Allan, Gooch and Stephenson valve gear all being used at different stages. The first batch had Dampfschlitten brakes, the second steam-operated brake blocks and the third had Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s the BBÖ sold several {{engines to}} the GKB. One of them, number GKB 671, {{is still working}} today, albeit with some small {{modifications}} such as <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes</b> thanks {{to the work of}} the Steirischen Eisenbahnfreunde (Styrian Railway Society). Built in 1860, the Austrian-made Südbahn Class 23 (old) locomotive on the Graz-Köflach railway (GKB), is the longest serving steam engine in the world. It is frequently on duty and is used to haul steam specials.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 the Deutsche Reichsbahn {{incorporated}} 378 machines {{of power}} category 2 in its EDP classification scheme as Class 100. After German reunification these became Class 310 in the DB AG. Only {{a few of}} the DR's light locomotives had hydraulic power transmission; they were grouped into sub-class 100.8. Under the old numbering scheme they were classified as Köf. Dead man's handles (Sifa) and radios for marshalling were not common. The Deutsche Reichsbahn converted many Kö to <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes,</b> this programme had not been completed when the Berlin Wall came down.|$|R
50|$|The Kunze-Knorr brake (Kunze-Knorr-Bremse or KK-Bremse) is an {{automatic}} <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake</b> for goods, passenger and express trains. It {{was the first}} graduated brake for goods trains in Europe. When it was introduced after the First World War, goods train brakes switched from hand operation to compressed-air in various European countries. The Deutsche Reichsbahn alone put the cost of equipping German goods wagons with Kunze-Knorr brakes between 1918 and 1927 at 478.4 million Reichsmarks. The operating cost savings from faster goods services and having fewer brakemen was assessed by the Reichsbahn at almost 96.3 million Reichsmark annually.|$|R
50|$|Heberlein brake is a {{continuous}} railway brake used in Germany that is applied {{by means of}} a mechanical cable. Train braking is therefore initiated centrally from the locomotive using a winder. This causes the brake clips to be applied on individual wagons, assisted by a servo system which makes use of the rotation of the axle. The brakes operate automatically if the cable snaps. A typical feature of Heberlein brakes is the clearly visible cable run on top of the wagons, but cables can also be led underneath the wagons, as on the Spreewaldbahn railway line. Heberlein brakes were eventually largely replaced by <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brakes</b> or, sometimes, by vacuum brakes on narrow gauge railway vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{basis for}} Knorr's {{commercial}} success {{was provided by}} {{an agreement with the}} Prussian State Railways, which at that time had formed the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company, to supply single-chamber express braking systems, first for passenger and later on for freight trains. The [...] "Knorr Druckluft-Einkammerschnellbremse" [...] (K1) - a <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake</b> - and its derivatives offered considerably enhanced safety performance compared with traditional systems. In the early twentieth century, train guards still had to operate brakes by hand, from so-called [...] "brake vans". The first pneumatic brakes were of a basic design, but before long, indirect automatic systems using control valves were developed. See History of rail transport in Germany for an overview.|$|R
50|$|It had an Allan {{valve gear}} with trick valves. The {{connecting}} rods drove the third coupled wheels. The loco had an Exter counterweight brake for {{the engine and}} a Körting vacuum brake for the train. This was probably replaced in 1926 by a Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> <b>brake.</b> When the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the operational running of the state-owned by privately operated line from the Deutsche Eisenbahn-Betriebsgesellschaft, {{a subsidiary of the}} firm of Vering & Waechter who had built the line, these engines were incorporated into their fleet as numbers 99 7201 to 99 7204. In 1964/1965 the steam locomotives were retired and replaced by diesel locomotives. Until then they had managed all the traffic, no other locomotives were even employed in a temporary role.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{way they}} operate, there is a longer delay with Heberlein brakes before the brakes take effect when {{compared}} with <b>compressed-air</b> or vacuum <b>brakes.</b> As a result, locomotive and train crews have to be given appropriate training and experience when using this type of brake in practice.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the advent}} of the Prussian T 20 (DRG Class 95) in 1922 with its 1'E1' axle {{arrangement}} and better qualities than the initial Gt 2x4/4 series, a second series was built and deployed between 1922 (no. 5766) and 1923 (nos. 5767-5775). They were improved in comparison with their predecessors: greater evaporative heating area, capable of holding half a ton of coal more, greater axle load and service weight, short chimney (without a cap). Both series were later modified in different ways after being taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and incorporated into its classification scheme as Class 960. All locomotives were equipped with a Westinghouse <b>compressed-air</b> double <b>brake,</b> operating on all wheelsets from the front, the sand pipes initially served the second and fourth wheelsets of the front drive. After the modification of the second series in 1926, they were additionally fitted with a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake, and seven axles sanded to increase adhesion. To begin with the locos ran with three headlights at the front, but just two after 1926.|$|R
