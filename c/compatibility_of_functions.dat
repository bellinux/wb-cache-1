40|$|Development of a {{vibration}} feeder was performed as one {{application of a}} vibratory machine with a self-contained vibration-reducing function by means of interference of transmissive force. The most important conditions for a vibration proof of a vibratory machine are <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> which oppose each other, reduction of transmissive force on the machine base and amplification of vibration on the body. This study deals with application of the proposed design to the feeder. The machine consists of coupling {{of a pair of}} one-degree-of-freedom mass-spring system. An excitation spring is devided {{as a part of a}} coupling spring for generation of excitation force on the two bodies. One end of the spring is excited by harmonic displacement with a reciprocating mechanism such as a crank. In this paper, we present vibration characteristics with full consideration of transmissive force and the optimum design procedure of the system. The transmissive force is reduced by 30 dB in the linear feeder which is excited by the excitation spring in the first trial...|$|E

We consider a first-order language with mutually recursive function definitions, system calls, and an environment semantics. The proof method relies on a generalization <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> definition with the bisimulation. We use the inductive method to show correctness of a form of dead code elimination. This is an interesting case study because the transformation removes function, variable, and parameter definitions from the program.

40|$|Abstract—Network {{interworking}} in the IP era {{is largely}} an issue <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> control layer <b>functions</b> and protocols. No common framework exists yet which would tie together the various mechanisms established for achieving QoS, security, mobility, etc. This paper introduces {{the concept of}} an extensible control space that can dynamically incorporate existing or new mobile networks. The wide variety of different network functionalities in today’s networks motivates this concept; heterogeneity in future networks will increase further. Providing a common, shared control space designed with a strong and consistent architectural view provides flexibility and dynamic adaptability of control functionality. Special emphasis lies on novel features to allow networks to automatically and dynamically interconnect and reconfigure their control functionality – which we call network composition.

40|$|This paper explores {{architectural}} design considerations regarding challenges of sustainable living, drawing parallels to extreme environments, {{in relation to}} user-centered design research conducted by researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, University of Houston and NASA. It further discusses application {{in the context of}} a Sustainable Living Lab, to be built as student housing on the Chalmers campus. Extreme environments are here defined as places that pose significant complications and risks for people to maintain their usual everyday activities with a certain level of physical and psychological comfort. The research addresses the need for integrated solutions, and the conscious development of sustainable strategies based in an understanding of human factors and residential practices. The paper presents a theoretical and methodological background for a proposed experimental ‘design/build/live’ approach and results from initial studies with students on user perceptions and ideation. Findings indicate that an optimization of spatial or material use can be found for example in a reassessment of activities perceived as private or shared, as well as the spatial <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> different <b>functions,</b> informing the design of facilities and building systems, as well as social organization and demands for supporting systems. Perceptions on changing practices towards shared use, and the value of co-creation processes for enabling sustainable living practices are emphasized...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of the associated properties of subcell discretisations for viscoelastic flows, where aspects <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> solution <b>function</b> spaces are paramount. We introduce one new scheme, through a subcell finite element approximation fe(sc), and compare and contrast this against two precursor schemes – one with finite element discretisation in common, but at the parent element level quad-fe; the other, at the subcell level appealing to hybrid finite element/finite volume discretisation fe/fv(sc). To conduct our comparative study, we consider Oldroyd modelling and two classical steady benchmark flow problems to assess issues of numerical accuracy and stability- cavity flow and contraction flow. We are able to point to specific advantages of the finite element subcell discretisation and appreciate the characteristic properties of each discretisation, by analysing stress and flow field structure up to critical states of Weissenberg number. Findings reveal that the subcell linear approximation for stress within the constitutive equation (either fe or fv) yields a more stable scheme, than that for its quadratic counterpart (quad-fe), whilst still maintaining third order accuracy. The more compatible form of stress interpolation within the momentum equation is found to be via the subcell elements under fe(sc); yet, this makes no differenc...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{decomposition}} {{is becoming}} more and more popular, because it is more general than all other known logic synthesis approaches and it seems to be the most effective approach for LUT-based FPGAs, (C) PLDs and complex CMOS-gates. The multi-level functional decomposition can be seen as a recursive splitting <b>of</b> a given <b>function,</b> into two sub-functions: the predecessor (bound-set) function and successor function. Initially, the bound set function is a multi-valued (symbolic) function, where a certain value (symbol) is assigned to each particular input-cube <b>compatibility</b> class <b>of</b> the <b>function</b> being decomposed. To be implemented with binary logic, the multi-valued bound-set function must be expressed as a set <b>of</b> binary <b>functions.</b> This transformation is called the multi-valued sub-function encoding. It can be performed by the binary code assignment to each particular input-cube compatibility class. It determines the resulting binary predecessor and successor sub-functions and therefore influences the quality of the resulting circuit to a high degree. In this paper, a new method of the multi-valued sub-function encoding is presented. The method is based on the information relationship measures. Experimental results from the prototype CAD-tool that implements the method demonstrate that it is able to efficiently construct extremely effective circuits for symmetric functions. Results for asymmetric functions are also very good. 1...|$|R

The theory of product liability is closely related to the strict liability but the doctrine of punitive damages has been developed to regulate malicious misconducts. Due to the different basic concepts, the strict liability and malicious misconducts, the theory of product liability might not include the doctrine of punitive damages. In addition to the <b>compatibility</b> issue, <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> the punitive damages are another issue. Although the punitive damages, there is a theoretical necessity of reviewing the relations between the theory of product liability and the U. S. doctrine of punitive damages. The theory of product liability is closely related to the strict liability but the doctrine of punitive damages has been developed to regulate malicious misconducts. Due to the different basic concepts, the strict liability and malicious misconducts, the theory of product liability might not include the doctrine of punitive damages.

With the issues about compatibility and functions, this thesis suggests two implications for improving the revised South Korean Product Liability Act. The first implication for the revised South Korean Product Liability Act is that implementing the punitive damages of South Korea within the three times of compensatory damages regardless of the degree of malicious misconducts is not fit for regulating various types of malicious misconducts. Therefore, there is a necessity for reforming the three–time’s cap of South Korean punitive damages.
