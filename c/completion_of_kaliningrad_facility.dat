40|$|This work juxtaposes the {{analysis}} of the federal discourse on the exclave position <b>of</b> the <b>Kaliningrad</b> region in 1994 — 2012 based on the screening by the Nezavisimaya gazeta and the results of surveys of students at the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University and the Universities of Gdansk and Klaipeda using a similar questionnaire. Students of all three universities show latent dissatisfaction with employment prospects, which is manifested in the declared intention to emigrate. The orientation of young residents <b>of</b> <b>Kaliningrad</b> and their peers from Gdansk and Klaipeda towards prevailing connections with Europe is complicated by the uncertainty of the EU-Russia relations. Young residents of Gdansk and Klaipeda reproduce dated stereotypes, and their interest in the Kaliningrad region is limited. However, as the experience of the other countries suggests, local border traffic between the Kaliningrad region and the neighbouring Polish voivodeships can contribute to the improvement of mutual images. Long-lasting eforts to diversify cooperation and promote a positive image <b>of</b> <b>Kaliningrad</b> in the neighbouring Polish regions can prove worthwhile. Apart from the measures aimed at strengthening the region’s economic base, it is necessary to increase the symbolic capital <b>of</b> <b>Kaliningrad</b> to achieve harmonious development <b>of</b> <b>Kaliningrad</b> identity. ...|$|R
