5|$|During the {{funerals}} of Soviet leaders {{there was a}} custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were carried in the procession behind the coffin. This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a <b>cushion</b> with one decoration on it. However, as Brezhnev had {{more than two hundred}} decorations, several were placed on each <b>cushion.</b> Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.|$|E
5|$|Canvaswork {{in which}} the linen ground was covered entirely by tent, gobelin, or cross {{stitches}} in wool or silk thread was often used for <b>cushion</b> covers and small bags. Notable examples like the Bradford carpet, a pictorial table cover, were likely the work of professionals in the Broderers' Company.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cushion</b> caroms, {{sometimes}} called by its original name, the indirect game, is traceable to 1820's Britain {{and is a}} descendant of the doublet game dating to at least 1807. The game is {{sometimes referred to as}} one-cushion or one-cushion billiards, which is the direct translation of its name into English from various other languages such as Spanish ("una banda") and German ("einband").|$|E
5|$|Its {{climate is}} cold, dry and very sunny, {{with high levels}} of {{ultraviolet}} radiation. Licancabur is not covered by glaciers, and vegetation such as <b>cushion</b> plants and shrubs are found lower on its slopes. Chinchillas were formerly hunted on the volcano.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cushioned</b> tread {{can provide}} {{slightly}} lower impact training than running on outdoor surfaces. Although <b>cushioned</b> belts have mostly been deprecated {{out of use}} and <b>cushioned</b> replacement belts {{may be hard to}} find, many treadmills have rubber or urethane deck elastomers (<b>cushions)</b> which are superior in <b>cushioning</b> and last longer than <b>cushioned</b> belts. There were for a time banana shaped flexible decks that were among the very best as far as <b>cushioning</b> that were priced at a midrange level, but currently these are not being sold, perhaps because of the increased manufacturing cost of making the flexible deck. <b>Cushioned</b> belts also don't last as long as regular belts due to their construction out of weaker materials. For calorie burning, incline can be used to significantly reduce impact for a given rate of energy use.|$|R

40|$|<b>Cushioning</b> {{optimization}}. Abstract. To {{realize the}} <b>cushioning</b> optimization of multilayer regularly-arranged circular honeycombs under in-plane crushing loadings with high impact velocities, a {{finite element model}} is introduced to obtain the <b>cushioning</b> mechanical parameters. A simplified energy absorption model is {{used to evaluate the}} <b>cushioning</b> performance, which shows that the <b>cushioning</b> performance is related to dynamic plateau stress and dynamic densification strain. The impact velocity, deformation mode and configuration parameters determine them. Empirical formulas of critical velocity of deformation mode transition, dynamic densification strain and dynamic plateau stress are given from the discussion of numerical results. A feasible <b>cushioning</b> optimization algorithm is presented in detail...|$|R
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar <b>cushion,</b> reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The <b>cushion</b> itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that wheelchair (WC) users {{are exposed to}} unhealthy levels of vibration during WC use. Health risks associated with vibration exposure include vertebral disc degeneration and back pain, which may consequently decrease the function and independence of WC users. Some evidence {{suggests that}} the <b>cushions</b> used in WCs may amplify vibrations, although conclusive evidence has not been presented in the literature. This study evaluated and compared the transmissibility of commercially available WC <b>cushions</b> with two laboratory test methods: (1) direct measurement of transmissibility while human subjects propelled a WC over a road course with different <b>cushions</b> and (2) characterization of <b>cushions</b> with a material testing system (MTS) combined with mathematical models of the apparent mass of the human body. Results showed that although dynamic characterization of WC <b>cushions</b> is possible with an MTS, the results did not correlate well with the transmissibility obtained in the WC road course. Significant differences were found for transmissibility among the <b>cushions</b> tested, with the air-based <b>cushions</b> having lower transmissibility than the foam- or gel-based <b>cushions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony <b>cushion</b> scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony <b>cushion</b> scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a <b>cushion</b> or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full <b>Cushion</b> {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers {{were designed to}} be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors {{similar to those found}} on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E
40|$|Footwear <b>cushioning</b> was {{evaluated}} objectively using an impact tester {{and related to}} perceived levels of <b>cushioning</b> (PLC). To evaluate the perceived levels of <b>cushioning</b> during standing, walking, and running, 3 experiments were conducted with 20 participants in each experiment. A 7 -point subjective rating scale was used to rate the perceived levels of <b>cushioning.</b> At {{the end of the}} experiment, the subjective perceptions of <b>cushioning</b> were also recorded. During standing and running, the perceived level of <b>cushioning</b> can be predicted from the time to peak deceleration and/or stiffness (or compression). During walking, however, the magnitude of the peak deceleration on the impact tester appears to be a good predictor of PLC. Impact characterizations can reveal important differences between materials and how they are perceived during activity. In addition, the results seem to explain and link the differences that exist in the ergonomics and biomechanics literature on <b>cushioning.</b> Applications of this research include the design and selection of materials for footwear, floor mats, and other supporting surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The <b>cushioning</b> {{properties}} of honeycomb paperboards are studied {{by means of}} experimental analysis. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} <b>cushioning</b> behaviour of paper honeycombs with and without liners are similar, but the <b>cushioning</b> capability is signifi cantly larger for the material with liners. Experiment and theory show that the relative density of paper honeycomb core has a signifi cant effect on the <b>cushioning</b> {{properties of}} honeycomb paperboards; however, the basis weight of the liner has only little effect. Experimental results also show that the energy absorption properties of multilayer honeycomb paperboards are not always higher than those of monolayer honeycomb paperboards, and that the height of honeycomb paperboard has an effect on its <b>cushioning</b> properties. These results can be used to characterize and improve the <b>cushioning</b> properties of honeycom...|$|R
