25|$|On 26 October 1957, St. Paul's Church of England was {{extensively}} {{damaged by}} fire, leaving only its sanctuary intact. Designs for the re-building of the damaged {{sections of the}} church was again completed by its original architect Louis Williams. However, he decided to use a more restrained Gothic Arts and Crafts style for the rebuild. The transepts, chancel, sanctuary, vestries and chapel from the 1933 design were retained, but the 1887 nave was beyond repair and was demolished. The new designs included a nave with multiple gabled bay windows with stained glass designed by mural artist Christian Waller (wife of Napier Waller) and a restrained version of the tower from the 1933 design. The foundation stone for the rebuilt church was again laid by Archbishop Frederick Head, and it was constructed of <b>clinker</b> <b>brick</b> in 1959.|$|E

50|$|In Germany, <b>clinker</b> <b>bricks</b> (German: Klinkerziegel) {{are named}} {{according}} to the German Institute for Standardization's DIN 105. They differ between full clinker (KMz) with a density of 2.0 kg / dm ³ to 2.2 kg / dm ³ and high hole clinker (KHLz) with a density of 1.6 kg / dm ³ to 1.8 kg / dm ³. Because of their low porosity, <b>clinker</b> <b>bricks</b> are inferior thermal insulators, compared to normal <b>bricks.</b> Canal <b>clinkers</b> are named {{according to the}} German Institute for Standardization’s DIN 4051. Clinkers are frost resisting and, thus are suited particularly for facades. The formats of the clinker stones are named according to the German Institute for Standardization’s DIN 1053. Base for the different formats is the normal format (NF) with length 240 mm, width 115 mm and height 71 mm. For facade layouts architects also order clinkers produced in special dimensions.|$|R
