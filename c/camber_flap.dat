40|$|The {{invention}} {{and design of}} an aerodynamic high lift device which provided a solution to an aircraft performance problem are described. The performance problem of converting a high speed cruise airfoil into a low speed aerodynamic shape that would provide landing and take-off characteristics superior to those available with contemporary high lift devices are addressed. The need for an improved wing leading edge device that would complement the high lift performance of a triple slotted trailing edge flap is examined. The mechanical and structural aspects of the variable <b>camber</b> <b>flap</b> are discussed and the aerodynamic performance aspects only {{as they relate to}} the {{invention and}} design of the device are presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{aerodynamic}} {{control apparatus}} for an air vehicle improves various aerodynamic performance metrics by employing multiple spanwise flap segments that jointly form a continuous or a piecewise continuous trailing edge to minimize drag induced by lift or vortices. At {{least one of}} the multiple spanwise flap segments includes a variable <b>camber</b> <b>flap</b> subsystem having multiple chordwise flap segments that may be independently actuated. Some embodiments also employ a continuous leading edge slat system that includes multiple spanwise slat segments, each of which has one or more chordwise slat segment. A method and an apparatus for implementing active control of a wing shape are also described and include the determination of desired lift distribution to determine the improved aerodynamic deflection of the wings. Flap deflections are determined and control signals are generated to actively control the wing shape to approximate the desired deflection...|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} <b>camber</b> <b>flap</b> {{concept is}} optimized {{to reduce the}} drag of a low speed light UAV between its stall and cruise speeds using an in-house aerodynamic shape optimization code. The flap, which maintains continuity on the upper surface, was analyzed both numerically and experimentally and was shown to provide important reductions in drag {{when compared to the}} clean wing/airfoil in the lower speed range (2. 7 % on average for the wing) and to have significant actuation energy savings when compared to a conventional plain flap (in the order of 40 %). Although the concept uses current actuator technology and materials it is a good option for improving flight endurance/range at low speed over other more complex and advanced morphing concepts.

40|$|The {{results of}} a wind-tunnel {{investigation}} of the NACA 23012, the NACA 23021, and the Clark Y airfoils, each equipped with a <b>cambered</b> external-airfoil <b>flap,</b> are presented in this report. The purpose of the research {{was to determine the}} relative merit of the various airfoils in combination with the <b>cambered</b> <b>flap</b> and to investigate the use of the flap as a combined lateral-control and high-lift device...|$|R
50|$|In {{designing}} the Mini-Nimbus, Klaus Holighaus incorporated the flapped wings from the Glasflügel 303 Mosquito, with the fuselage of the Standard Cirrus. The wings feature trailing edge terminal speed dive brakes-variable <b>camber</b> <b>flaps</b> that limit the vertical dive speed {{to a maximum}} of 70 knots when the dive brakes are fully deployed.|$|R
50|$|Designed for the 15 metre racing class, the Mosquito {{replaced}} the Libelle in Glasflügel's production line. It married the Standard Class Hornet fuselage {{with a new}} flapped wing employing the ubiquitous FX 67-K-150 airfoil. The wing featured innovative interconnected trailing edge dive brakes-variable <b>camber</b> <b>flaps.</b> The glider had automatic connection for all controls: ailerons, elevator, air brakes and water ballast.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a generic design methodology for variable <b>camber</b> <b>flap</b> systems for transport aircraft, intended to be used for cruise and low-speed operations. The methodology was structured after several revisions were performed on conventional high-lift device design methodologies for existing transport aircraft. The definition and detail explanations are given at every phase of the methodology. A case study was performed in order to give an example of the implementation of the methodology where a transport aircraft called A TRA, a design study from previous PhD report, was taken as a model. Experimental work could not be performed, due to budget constraints, so the case study was only carried out using computer-based analyses. Software packages such as MSES-code (a Computational Fluid Dynamic software), CATIA and PATRANINASTRAN were used for this case study to analyse aerodynamic characteristics, layout as well as simulation and structure analyses respectively. The results obtained showed that it was practically feasible to deploy such a high-lift device to transport aircraft when the effect from aerodynamic loads gave minimum effect on structural deformation. The deflections of the flap as well as spoilers under critical loads were below the allowable limits, which had a minimal effect due to the additional lift force generated from the movable surfaces...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{high-lift}} device is the flap, a movable {{portion of the}} wing that can be lowered to produce extra lift. When a flap is lowered this re-shapes the wing section to give it more <b>camber.</b> <b>Flaps</b> are usually located on {{the trailing edge of}} a wing, while leading edge flaps are used occasionally. There are many kinds of trailing-edge flap.|$|R
50|$|The Akaflieg Darmstadt D-40 is an {{experimental}} variable geometry single seat sailplane, fitted with almost full span, <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> for optimum aerodynamics in weak thermals and {{integrated into the}} wing so as to minimise flap tip drag. One flew successfully but the D-40, like other variable geometry sailplanes, was not commercialised.|$|R
2500|$|The SZD-42 Jantar 2 is {{a single}} seat Open Class {{competition}} glider, designed and produced in Poland in the 1970s. [...] It features a span of over 20m [...] (66ft) and elastic, <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps.</b> It was placed second, third and seventh at the 1976 World Gliding Championships. Over one hundred were built and more than ninety remain registered.|$|R
50|$|It had a one piece, {{cantilever}} {{high wing}} which was straight edged and strongly tapered (taper ratio 0.37) to roughly semi-elliptical tips. It {{had a single}} spar structure with a leading edge torsion box. Long, narrow ailerons, divided into two parts, filled the entire trailing edge; these could also act as <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> for low speed flight.|$|R
50|$|Most DLG models use aileron, rudder and {{elevator}} control, {{with the}} ailerons also {{being used as}} <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> for different modes of flight and also as airbrakes for landing. A modern DLG model weighs approximately 9 or 10 ounces (255-283 grams) and has sophisticated aerodynamics. Many pilots use computer radio transmitters with full mixing and flight mode capabilities in order to optimise performance {{and set up the}} models for flight as near perfectly as possible.|$|R
40|$|Trailing-edge flap is {{traditionally}} {{used to improve}} the takeoff and landing aerodynamic performance of aircraft. In order to improve flight efficiency during takeoff, cruise and landing states, the flexible variable <b>camber</b> trailing-edge <b>flap</b> is introduced, capable of changing its shape smoothly from 50 % flap chord {{to the rear of}} the flap. Using a numerical simulation method for the case of the GA (W) - 2 airfoil, the multi-objective optimization of the overlap, gap, deflection angle, and bending angle of the flap under takeoff and landing configurations is studied. The optimization results show that under takeoff configuration, the variable <b>camber</b> trailing-edge <b>flap</b> can increase lift coefficient by about 8 % and lift-to-drag ratio by about 7 % compared with the traditional flap at a takeoff angle of 8 °. Under landing configuration, the flap can improve the lift coefficient at a stall angle of attack about 1. 3 %. Under cruise state, the flap helps to improve the lift-to-drag ratio over a wide range of lift coefficients, and the maximum increment is about 30 %. Finally, a corrugated structure–eccentric beam combination bending mechanism is introduced in this paper to bend the flap by rotating the eccentric beam...|$|R
2500|$|In about 1925 {{at least}} one Udet 8 was fitted with full-span Lippmann/Handley Page slats coupled to full-span ailerons which were lowered {{together}} as <b>camber</b> increasing <b>flaps</b> when the slats were deployed. It was one {{one of the earliest}} German aircraft to have slats. The slatted Udet 8 was recorded as a Udet 8a or Udet 8B in contemporary journals, though a modern source states that the U 8a (D-839) had a new wing with an area increase of [...] and a Sh-12 engine. D-839 is recorded as a U 8b in a reconstructed register.|$|R
50|$|Its wing {{was built}} around two box spars with Warren girder ribs. The Mureaux was {{intended}} to operate at high altitudes, so the wing had a high aspect ratio for its time and used a thin wing section of Brunet's own design. In plan it was unswept, with constant chord, semi-circular tips and a rounded cut-out in the trailing edge over the forward cockpit. Ailerons occupied {{the whole of the}} trailing edge; they could be used differentially for roll control or together as <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> for landing.|$|R
40|$|A nonplanar vortex lattice {{method is}} {{described}} for calculating the potential flow aerodynamic characteristics of complex planforms, {{with an emphasis}} on wings with spanwise segmented partial-span flaps. A new technique has been developed for proper modeling of flow in the region between the flap edges and the wing in the case of part-span flaps. The effects of compressibility have been accounted for by the use of the Prandtl-Glauert rule with no approximation being made regarding freestream incidence, wing <b>camber,</b> and <b>flap</b> deflection. The method has been tested for a number of cases to assess its utility...|$|R
50|$|A {{wingsail}} is a variable-camber aerodynamic {{structure that}} is fitted to a marine vessel {{in place of}} conventional sails. Wingsails are analogous to airplane wings, except that {{they are designed to}} provide lift on either side to accommodate being on either tack. Whereas wings adjust <b>camber</b> with <b>flaps,</b> wingsails adjust <b>camber</b> with a flexible or jointed structure (for hard wingsails). Wingsails are typically mounted on an unstayed spar—often made of carbon fiber for lightness and strength. The geometry of wingsails provides more lift, and a better lift-to-drag ratio, than traditional sails. Wingsails are more complex and expensive than conventional sails.|$|R

D-839 is recorded as a U 8b in a reconstructed register.|$|R
2500|$|The {{resulting}} {{design was}} a single-engined, single bay biplane. The fuselage structure was of mixed construction, with a steel tube forward section and a wooden box-girder rear section. The first prototype's fuselage was smoothly faired {{out to a}} circular section using formers and stringers, with the forward fuselage back to the cockpit covered in metal skinning and the rear fuselage fabric covered. [...] The wood and fabric single-bay wings, unlike the S.E.4, had noticeable stagger between {{the upper and lower}} wings, but were fitted with similar, full span control surfaces which could be moved differentially as ailerons or together as <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps,</b> to those used on the S.E.4.|$|R
40|$|Some {{background}} information is {{provided for the}} Vortex Flow Aerodynamics Conference and that current slender wing airplanes do not use variable leading edge geometry to improve transonic drag polar is shown. Highlights {{of some of the}} initial studies combining wing <b>camber,</b> or <b>flaps,</b> with vortex flow are presented. Current vortex flap studies were reviewed to show that there is a large subsonic data base and that transonic and supersonic generic studies have begun. There is a need for validated flow field solvers to calculate vortex/shock interactions at transonic and supersonic speeds. Many important research opportunities exist for fundamental vortex flow investigations and for designing advanced fighter concepts...|$|R
50|$|The short-span, narrow {{mean chord}} (16 in or 406 mm) {{cantilever}} wing was built of wood {{like the rest}} of the T.G.N.1. It had three parts, two plywood-skinned lifting sections each 15 ft (4.57 m) long joined by a 3 ft (910 mm) centre section. The single wing spar was a 4×3 in (102×76 mm) spruce beam. The wing was straight edged and tapered by sweep on the leading edge only. The trailing edges carried full-span ailerons with the inboard half-spans divided into three sections. These inner surfaces moved through progressively smaller angles than the outer ones and could be lowered as <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> or airbrakes.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings of}} the SB-11 have 2.3° of {{dihedral}} and are unswept. The inner 60% of span has constant chord. The outer panels, carrying the ailerons, are straight tapered with a taper ratio of 0.4. Manually driven full span Fowler type Wortmann flaps emerge from the trailing edge between rollers, increasing the chord by 200 mm (7.9 in) over the untapered inner wing and by 80 mm (3.2 in) at the tip. Overall the flaps produce a 25% increase in wing area. Their trailing edges carry ailerons outboard and plain <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> inboard. Above wing, mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are placed at about mid span.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} {{design was}} a single-engined, single bay biplane. The fuselage structure was of mixed construction, with a steel tube forward section and a wooden box-girder rear section.

5000|$|The Taupin had {{rectangular}} plan wings, {{the forward}} one providing 65% {{of the wing}} area, both mounted on the central fuselage longeron. They were wooden two spar structures, fabric covered and braced from below with parallel pairs of forward leaning struts to the lower fuselage longerons, each pair stiffened with a horizontal cross-brace between them and with short upward secondary braces to the wings. The wings were mounted with equal and significant dihedral. Both had full-span flaps which were interconnected and could move differentially as ailerons and together as <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps,</b> a system first used on the glider and acknowledged {{as the source of}} its [...] "extraordinary controllability".|$|R
5000|$|A {{split flap}} that slides backwards, before hinging downward, thereby {{increasing}} first chord, then <b>camber.</b> The <b>flap</b> may {{form part of}} the upper surface of the wing, like a plain flap, or it may not, like a split flap, but it must slide rearward before lowering.

Maximum thrust coefficients were limited to 0. 12. Angle of attack was varied from - 4 deg to 15 deg for Mach numbers between 0. 6 and 0. 95 at a constant unit Reynolds number of 18. 0 million/m (5. 5 million/ft).

40|$|This report {{describes}} the conceptual and detail {{design of the}} A- 90 Short-haul 500 seat airliner project. It started with a market investigation which then led to the specification of the aircraft. The author performed a conceptual design process, to derive the configuration - a twin-engined jet transport with a swept wing, shoulder mounted to a large double-bubble fuselage. Aerodynamic, mass and geometric work was then performed {{prior to the start}} of the main design programme in October 1990. The main programme involved 23 MSc students and 5 members of staff and lasted for 8 months. Each student was given responsibility for the detail design of a major component such as outer wing, fuel system, etc. This work is described together with the final design that emerged. This description is aided by the reproduction of numerous engineering drawings. The work was complemented by extra studies, performed by 15 Flight Dynamics students. The report then discusses the final configuration of the A- 90. The project showed the potential of meeting mass, cost and airport requirements. It should exceed the range requirements and carry 620 passengers for 1700 n miles, 500 for 2260 n miles or 345 for 3500 n miles. The design showed considerable flexibility and could be relatively easily developed to carry some 1000 passengers. Investigations were performed of several applications of new technology, including variable <b>camber</b> <b>flaps,</b> fibre optic flight controls, "all electric" systems and modern materials. They all looked feasible, and should be investigated further. The main concern was the provision of bleed air and secondary power following the loss of one engine, on such a large aircraft. Careful system design overcame this problem. The A- 90 project proved again the validity of Cranfield's group design project as a powerful means of educating design students...|$|R
50|$|In {{plan the}} leading edge of the forward wing was straight, with only slight sweep out to rounded tips; the {{trailing}} edge was also straight but strongly forward swept, producing strong taper over the outer 70% of the span. Inboard the wing chord reduced linearly by about 30% to the root. The outer wing had 3° of dihedral, though the narrowing centre section curved downwards strongly to the roots. The Delanne 20 was an all wood aircraft and each wing was built around two spruce and plywood box spars. The trailing edges carried ailerons and <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps,</b> coupled to slats on the corresponding sections of {{the leading edge}}s. The wings were attached to the fuselage upper longerons at their roots and braced to the lower fuselage by a V-form pair of struts from the lower fuselage at about 35% span.|$|R
50|$|<b>Camber</b> {{changing}} Fowler <b>flaps</b> {{had been}} used before on gliders, notably on the 1938 Akaflieg Hannover AFH-4 and the 1948 Cijan-Obad Orao II, though not fitted to this design's later version. Whilst they provided the increased camber needed for low speed climbs, they also increased drag, both by reducing the aspect ratio, raising the induced drag, and by the creation of extra vortexes at the outer ends of the flaps. This penalty was less costly in typically strong South African thermals than in the weaker ones found in northern Europe.|$|R
40|$|A {{limited number}} of lifting-surface-theory {{solutions}} for wings with chordwise loadings resulting from angle of attack, parabolic-ac <b>camber,</b> and <b>flap</b> deflection are now available. These solutions were studied {{with the purpose of}} determining methods of extrapolating the results {{in such a way that}} they could be used to determine lifting-surface-theory values of the aspect-ratio corrections to the lift and hinge-moment parameters for both angle-of-attack and flap-deflection-type loading that could be used to predict the characteristics of horizontal tail surfaces from section data with sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes. Such a method was devised for horizontal tail surfaces with full-span elevators. In spite of the fact that the theory involved is rather complex, the method is simple to apply and may be applied without any knowledge of lifting-surface theory. A comparison of experimental finite-span and section value and of the estimated values of the lift and hinge-moment parameters for three horizontal tail surfaces was made to provide an experimental verification of the method suggested.

50|$|A long-standing {{challenge}} for the designers of competition sailplanes were the conflicting requirements posed {{by the need to}} gain in height in sometimes weak and narrow thermals, calling for high lift and low stalling speeds for small radius turns, and the need for rapid penetration of the cool, sinking air between thermals. In thermals, wings should ideally be of high camber and be lightly loaded; between them, low camber wings with high wing loading would fly faster. Large area, <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> were one solution but vortexes generated at their extremities added significantly to the drag, decreasing climb rates. Akaflieg Brunswick decided to follow the example of the disappointing British Sigma by providing the SB-11 with Wortmann flaps along the whole of the trailing edge of the wing, including the ailerons. This avoided the flap associated vortexes, though any increase in wing area, however implemented, will lower the aspect ratio and raise the induced drag caused by wingtip vortexes.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{all-metal}} requirement, the Romano R16 initially flew with a wing {{of mixed}} construction which was originally {{built for the}} rather similar Romano R.6 civil passenger aircraft. It is not known if the intended wing, all-metal and expected to be lighter, ever replaced it. On each side the high wing was in two parts, with a rectangular inner section attached {{to the top of}} the fuselage. The outer panels were straight tapered to rounded tips. The wing had two wooden box spars and spruce ribs and was entirely plywood covered. The centre section, over 40% of the span, was braced at its outer ends with a pair of parallel steel wing struts between the wing spars and the lower fuselage longerons, so that the R.16's wing was a semi-cantilever one. High aspect ratio ailerons occupied the whole outer panel trailing edge and <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> filled those of the centre section.|$|R
50|$|The FK-3 was {{designed}} by Otto Funk to be a high performance sailplane, particularly suited to weak thermal conditions but also easy to fly. It is a largely metal pod and boom aircraft, with cantilever shoulder wings. The wing has a thickness/chord ratio of 15.3% and a simple straight tapered plan with square tips, built around a single spar. It made use of plastic foams, both in the light alloy-foam sandwich ribs and with a rigid foam honeycomb structure between the ribs to support the 0.50 mm skin. The whole trailing edge is filled with control surfaces; inboard of the ailerons there are <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> divided into two parts, the inner section deflecting through greater angles than the outer. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are fitted at inboard at mid-chord, opening {{above and below the}} wing. The wings also contain rubber bags to hold up to 110 lb of water ballast, with a dump valve in the fuselage behind the undercarriage monowheel.|$|R
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} greater span, {{the wing of}} the Jantar 2 {{differed}} only from that of its predecessor by having less taper and a slight change of plan. [...] The leading edge remains straight and slightly swept, but the inner half-span has no sweep on the trailing edge, with the ailerons mounted on the forward swept edge of the outboard part. The wing construction {{is similar to that}} of the Jantar 1, all glass fibre with a single spar and glass cloth/foam sandwich skin. [...] There are mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes which extend both above and below the wing. [...] Its <b>camber</b> changing <b>flaps</b> are hingeless; instead the movement is provided by deflection of the upper wing surface. [...] Combined with a carefully sealed sliding joint in the lower surface, these elastic flaps minimise loss in lift due to leakage and abrupt shape changes. [...] The first two prototypes had two piece wings but later aircraft have further wing divisions at about 2.5m (8ft) from the wing tips for easier handling.|$|R
40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{investigation of}} wings suitable for supersonic fighter application was undertaken {{to understand the}} flow regions developed by these wings through flow visualization and to evaluate areas in which low-speed testing could provide information for extrapolation to higher Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers. This study involved cranked wings of highly-swept inboard panels and outboard panel of various sweeps with leading- and trailing-edge devices. Both theoretical and experimental results with flow visualization are presented. Flow visualization results show that a mixed flow condition (vortex flow on the highly-swept inboard section and attached flow on the cranked outboard section) is possible for wings with low sweep (20 deg) outboard cranked sections. Lift and drag measurements on the planar (no flap deflection) wings show good agreement with theoretical results for leading-edge vortex flow. There {{is little or no}} change in planar wing performance at maneuver conditions due to outboard sweep effects. Results also show that for <b>cambered</b> wings (<b>flap</b> deflected) only small improvements in performance over flat wings were obtained at high-lift maneuver conditions...|$|R
