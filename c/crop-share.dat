In a partial equilibrium context, the authors show that when boat owners and crew members are risk-averse, crop sharing is the optimal contract, and the resultant labor employment level will be greater than with a (suboptimal) wage contract. Industry effects and steady-state resource growth limitations are introduced into a market equilibrium model. In this extended model, market equilibria will also involve sharing contracts. These will result in greater employment, which comes at the expense of reduced resource stocks and higher-than-necessary harvesting costs. The article also examines how industry regulation such as licensing, quotas, and subsidies will differ if the prevailing contract is cropsharing as compared with a wage.

Like Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia underwent a Stalinist phase of collectivization in the 1950s before leaving it behind in the search for a new model. In Poland, a sort of “dual agricultural” model was developed in which 20% of land was controlled by large, inefficient state farms, and the rest privately owned, mostly in the form of small peasant farms. This isolated situation left the peasants open to obvious discrimination and they suffered from a lack of financial and structural support from the state. In Czechoslovakia, the state had only a bare tolerance for household plots and the transitional system was marked by its almost total inflexibility. In contrast, transitional measures in Hungary worked with the concerns of the farmers, allowing them mechanical independence, semi-private production on their household plots and <b>crop-shared</b> fields, and a decent standard of living from higher agricultural producer prices and substantial government investment.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of {{uncertain}} output prices upon fishers' location choices. It employs ARIMA models to construct the price forecasts used by fishers in a model which generates expected profits for three fishing locations in the British Columbia salmon fishery. A random utility model of fishing location choice is then estimated using two different sets of regressors. The first is expected seasonal profit and its variability. The second is expected wealth and its variability, where expected wealth is taken to be the sum of the known preseason wealth and the expected profitability of a given fishing location. Results show that expected profitability is a significant determinant of fishing location choice but that expected wealth plays an even bigger role. This suggests that there is a type of wealth or stock effect present in decisions made by fishers. The results also provide evidence that the variability of profits or wealth is generally a less significant component in regard to fishing location choice. In fact, some fishers thrive on greater variability, thereby providing some evidence of the risk loving behaviour typically attributed to fishers. This is not the case, however, for all fishers since some are found to be risk-neutral and even risk-averse. Given the finding that fishers do respond to economic incentives, one policy implication concerns the ability of fisheries managers to alter the dispersion of fishers over fishing locations via the adjustment of the economic incentives by means of differential royalty taxes. A second policy implication results from the finding of risk-loving behavior. This calls into question models that assume risk-averse behaviour and predict a dominance of <b>crop-sharing</b> contracts over wage contracts.

40|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the extension services introduced by Soba central nursery (Khartoum state) in terms of adoption of tree planting and sustainability of plantation program. Two types of data were used in this research, primary and secondary data. The primary data were collected using two methods of social surveys (interviews and group discussions), while the secondary data were collected from the files, documents and archives of the Forests National Corporation (FNC). Were the following: i. Land tenure was a determinant factor for the adoption of tree planting in farms. ii. Different types of land ownership existed in the study area like title holder, free release, <b>crop-sharing,</b> rent and release to relatives. iii. The area of the farm was an important factor for the success of the afforestation programs. iv. The level of awareness was high among the interviewed sample where the majority of the respondents were acquainted with the environmental roles of trees. v. The main trees used in the afforestation program were; Kafur trees (Eucalyptus sp.), Damas (Conocarpus sp.), and Dign EL Basha (Albizia lebbeck) besides some horticultural trees like lemon, date palm and mango. vi. Farmers adopted trees planting at their farms for the sake of having an additional source of income, amelioration of micro-climate, protection of top soil from erosion, and to restore soil fertility. IV vii. The number of seedlings distributed by the central nursery during ten years (1997 – 2007) showed a dramatic decline in the number of seedlings produced at the nursery. The year 2007 showed the lowest seedlings distribution. The main factor behind this decline was the lack of means for seedlings transportation; the central nursery is under funded and understaffed. Moreover, the extension service was sporadic and confined to farmers close to the central nursery. viii. The initial phase of the project witnessed a complete reliance on sophisticated inputs imported from Finland without using any local material. ix. After the phase-out of the project, the running cost added a new burden on the budget of the FNC; as a result the activities of the central nursery witnessed intensive modification. x. The main risks confronting tree planting at farms as perceived by farmers were; fluctuation of rainfall, frequent drought cycles, lack of fences (overgrazing), and lack of effective and efficient extension service. In conclusions, to enhance adoption of agro forestry interventions, categorization of land tenure is a pre-requisite for specifying the land ownership that guarantees the success of the afforestation program. The level of awareness is high; necessitating a continuous dissemination of information using different extension methods and communication channels. All the factors of success of the afforestation program are available, i. e., fertile soils and source of irrigation (Blue Nile). An effective extension unit is needed to sensitize and mobilize farmers to participate in the afforestation program...|$|R

40|$|Farmers face many {{business}} risks relating to production, prices, technological change, legal and social issues, and human resources. A tenant can share production and price risks with the landlord through a <b>crop-share</b> lease. This enables the landlord {{to share in}} higher or lower-than-expected yields and/or prices. However, the typical <b>crop-share</b> lease also requires the landlord to share the cost of fertilizer, seed, and chemicals and pay to have {{his share of the}} crop harvested. Income from such a share lease is usually considered as self-employment income for the landlord, which some landlords would prefer to avoid. A subsequent fact sheet in this series will address farm-rental tax issues. In contrast, a flexible-cash lease will allow landowners to share some of these risks without becoming subject to selfemployment taxes. And, like a fixed-cash lease, the tenant doesn’t have {{to keep track of the}} landowner’s share of expenses. Nor does the landowner have to make grain marketing decisions. Flexible-cash rent usually pertains only to cropland, with fixed rents for buildings, farmstead facilities, and relatively minor acreages of pasture, hay, or woodland. Both parties need to agree on the amount of these “non-flexible ” rents prior to start of the lease period. In addition, the flexible-cash rent keeps the landowner eligible for potential “windfall profits” should they happen. Some disadvantages include the requirement of more records and a written lease agreement compared to a possible fixed-cash rent. In addition, the tenant should expect less income over time because he is transferring more of the risk to the landowner. An Ohio 1999 research project revealed that at least 8 percent of cash leases had some flexibility provisions. A 1996 Ohio study revealed few flexible cash leases.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We use cross {{sectional}} {{data on the}} characteristics of landown-ers and tenant farmers in the United States to study the effect of multi-lateral contracting on land-lease contract choice. We find that tenants who rent from a relatively large number of landowners are more likely to use cash-rent, rather than <b>crop-share,</b> rental leases. When a tenant’s labor effort is allocated across the land of multiple landowners, one landowner’s contract affects the marginal cost of effort for the tenant operating under another landowner’s contract. Relative to a tenant oper-ating in isolation with a single landowner, this effect leads to an equilib-rium “overprovision ” of incentives only when the multiple landowners design their contracts noncooperatively. If contracts are chosen coop-eratively across all landowners for a given tenant, a reverse prediction holds: multilateral contracting leads to flatter incentives relative to bi-lateral contracting between a single landowner and tenant. Thus, our central empirical finding—multilateral contracting increases the likeli-hood of cash-rent contracting—is consistent with noncooperative be-havior among landowners. There is no legal restriction (e. g., antitrust) on communication among landowners, so our results suggest that some friction limits the coordination and redistribution needed to achieve a cooperative outcome...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>crop-share</b> lease {{is meant}} to reflect how income, expenses, and risk are shared between the tenant farmer and the landlord. The sharing levels are determined by each party’s contributions to the business. As agricultural technology and production practices change over time, shared leases should be reviewed by both parties to see that income continues to be distributed according to contributions. Most share leases are based upon customary methods of sharing production and expenses in a community. More than 75 % of share leases in Ohio are 50 - 50. About 15 % of tenant farmers receive from 60 % to 75 % of income/production in a 2 / 3 - 1 / 3 type arrangement. A smaller number keep more than 75 % of income. As a general rule, tenants receive {{a greater share of}} the value of crop production on poorer-quality soils and a lesser share on better soils. Advantages of Shared Leasing • The landlord and tenant share risk in both good and bad years alike. • Both parties can share benefits of improved technology. • The landlord will benefit from increased yields, prices, or government program payments. •Joint management may result in more profitable decisions. • It is easier for the landlord to document material participation for maintaining Social Security base and for estate tax special use valuation. • Shared leasing is an efficient financing alternative for farmers as it reduces cash outlay per acre and spreads fixed machinery cost over more land. • The farmer’s rental obligation to the landlord varies directly with the farm’s crop returns. Disadvantages of Shared Leasing •Share agreements are more complex, so landowners with limited agricultural knowledge or time may prefer cash renting...|$|E
40|$|Land {{is a prime}} {{factor of}} {{production}} for an agricultural country like Bangladesh and access to land has been {{the major source of}} livelihood of farmers living in rural Bangladesh. However, access to land is governed by informal tenure arrangements which in turn affect the productivity of the farm. This thesis looks at the consequences of different contract choices relating to land tenancy arrangements in rural Bangladesh. It consists of three core chapters (Chapter 4, 5 and 6) which include: an analysis of the productivity impacts of sharecropping; an examination of the conditions under which a sharecropping contract is chosen over a fixed-rent contract; and an examination of sources of incentives whereby particular types of tenants end up contracting with particular types of landlords or choosing particular crop practices. Empirical investigations presented in this thesis add {{to our understanding of the}} nature of contructual relationships within agricultural land tenancy markets. The first academic contribution of this thesis lies in the comparison of conventional and non-conventional econometric methodologies. Particular emphasis is given to the problems of sample-selection bias and endogeneity in the contract choice that very often plague the estimation results. It is important to have an appropriate measure which controls for the biases in the econometric analysis that arise from the observability problem of certain theoretically important factors such as risk preferences, moral hazard problem which affect impact of tenure arrangements, participation decision as well as motivation for matching. This is crucial because how much certain characteristics affect the contract choice system can provide information about the functioning of a micro-economy. The works discussed herein are mostly econometric analysis, although the thesis has attempted to locate the most relevant theoretical models to explain the econometric outcomes in each chapter. The literature review chapter (Chapter 3) also has a detail explanation of the revelant theoretical models. A two-year household-level panel data set of rice farmers from rural Bangladesh is used to illustrate different corollaries of tenancy contracts. The first core chapter (Chapter 4) attempts to analyse the impact of sharecropping compared with that of owner cultivation. It illustrates the productivity differentials with special focus on the hypothesis of ‘Marshallian ineffciency’,i. e. lower efficiency on sharecropped as compared to owned plots. The main contribution of this chapter is the use of a unique regression model to evaluate the potential impact of adoption of sharecropping measured by the impact on the household’s output. A household’s decision to enter into a <b>crop-share</b> contract is endogenous and may affect his productivity. Therefore, a simultaneous equation model with endogenous switching regression is developed. This method enables us to estimate the causal impact of choosing sharecropping and helps to capture the treatment-effect of sharecropping by controlling for the impact of the selection problem on productivity and the adoption decision. This chapter includes preliminary results from the random-effect, the fixed-effect and the treatment-effect models to evaluate the consistency of estimation results. Our analysis reveals that in rural Bangladesh, the threat of eviction effect¹ dominates the Marshallian inefficiency and sharecroppers are no less productive compared with the owner cultivators. This chapter contributes to an understanding of the factors which generate differences in input and output intensities across two comparative tenure regimes: mixed tenant and pure tenant. Results do not find any strong support for the idea that cropping intensity is relatively higher among pure sharecroppers compared to mixed sharecroppers. The overall empirical results imply that due to non-availability of off-farm jobs, share tenants employ their optimal effort in crop production. The second core chapter (Chapter 5) attempts to identify the determinants of the choice of contracts between a <b>crop-share</b> contract and a fixed-rent contract. The modelling focuses on estimating how heterogeneous risk preferences and the moral hazard problem affect the choice of contracts among the participants in the land-lease market. The analysis draws from the principal-agent model where both parties are assumed to be risk averse. Though sharecropping remains widespread, its determinants are still poorly understood and the debate over the extent of risk preferences and moral hazard are far from settled. The present study jointly determines the socio-economic factors underlying the decision to rent-in/out land and the choice of tenancy contract between a <b>crop-share</b> contract and a fixed-rent contract using a two-stage modified Heckman selection model. The first set of results reveal that a number of socio-economic factors affect a farmer’s participation in the land-rental market and work in opposite directions regarding the decision to rent-in or rent-out land. The likelihood of renting-in land is higher for farmers with insufficient cultivable land but with higher numbers of male agricultural labourers in the household. On the other hand, the likelihood of renting-out land is higher among farmers with higher levels of cultivable land but with lower numbers of male agricultural labourers in the household. Among the households, who participate in the land-lease market as tenants, the results do not support the risk-sharing hypothesis of the agency theory as a motivation for contract choice, while there is some support that the monitoring problem affects the contract choice. The monitoring capacity of the landlord household is an important factor in choosing a particular tenancy contract. The third core chapter (Chapter 6) extends the analysis of the second core chapter with particular focus on the incentives for matching. It studies the presence of potential bias in estimated coefficients of contract choice equations arising from multiple sources of endogenous matching among the landlords, the tenants and the activities and its implications on the contract choice equation. The study finds support for the incentives for endogenous matching in two sources. These are: tenant’s observable proxies for risk aversion impacting the decision of choosing a particular crop practice; and the landlord’s observable risk preferences are significantly related to the tenant’s characteristics although there is no evidence of observed landlord characteristics impacting on the tenant’s proxies of risk aversion. Econometrically the presence of matching biases the results due to the omitted variable problem, which if not controlled for will cause an inconsistent estimation of the contract choice equation. In fact, this chapter reveals that without controlling for matching the risk-sharing is an important determinant of contract choice. However, after controlling for possible sources of matching, risk-sharing is found not to have any significant influence on choosing a particular tenancy contract. ¹Threat of eviction hypothesis: Uncertainty about contract renewal creates incentives to increase output (and therefore input use) on sharecropping plots in order to qualify for contract renewal. Testable implications would be higher or not significantly lower output on sharecropped plots than on own cultivated plots. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The year, 1988, {{was one of}} {{considerable}} real estate market activity and rising agricultural land values. These trends were evident across the state according to 1989 Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market Survey reports. The survey revealed an average rate of increase of 25 percent during the 12 -month period ending February 1, 1989. This increase, however, represents a percentage change from a base value that reflects several years of declines. In fact, even with the 1988 advances, 1989 land values remain considerably below peak levels of the early 1980 s. A succession of high income years for production agriculture, in large part due to federal farm program payments, fueled market demand. Some of the activity {{appears to have been}} pent-up demand from earlier years of nearly dormant markets. The vast majority of buyers have been active farmers who were generally buying parcels to add to existing farm units. In most cases, these parcels are within 5 miles of the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s residence. On the supply side of the market, some financial stress sales and liquidation sales by institutional lenders were still evident in 1988, but at a much lower level than preceding years. Of actual transactions during 1988 that were observed by survey reporters, nearly 45 percent were straight cash sales involving no debt. About one in ten sales were seller-financed. Negotiated cash rental rates for 1989 were also higher. Cropland rental rates were generally 10 to 20 percent higher than a year earlier. Rental rates on grazing land jumped significantly. In some areas of the state, current cash rental rates are approaching historic highs, a reflection of favorable income levels for production agriculture over the past few years. As for rates of return to farmland investment, survey reporters usually estimated percentage rates to be highest for irrigated land followed by dryland cropland and then grazing land. However, adjusting typical cash rental rates for landowner expenses and estimating net rates of return will not yield very high returns on irrigated land. This may be explained in part by the fact that many landowners who are either farming the irrigated land themselves or renting on a <b>crop-share</b> basis have recently experienced higher levels of returns than those under current cash rental arrangements. For irrigated land particularly, some owners have, no doubt, recently achieved net rates of return of 10 percent or higher. Nearly 5 percent of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s cropland base (1. 1 million acres) is now enrolled in USDA 2 ̆ 7 s Conservation Reserve Program. While some counties have had considerable acreage enrollment, the impact of this program on local land values and cash rental rates appears to be marginal...|$|E
