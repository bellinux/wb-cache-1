5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E
5|$|Family <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> {{consists}} of the mouse lemurs (smallest of all primates), the dwarf lemurs, and the fork-marked lemurs and their allies. There are 37extant species.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most {{closely related to}} mouse lemurs within the family <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> fork-marked lemurs {{are the most}} phylogenetically distinct, {{although}} their placement remained uncertain until recently. One uniting characteristic (synapomorphy) among all cheirogaleids, {{to the exclusion of}} other lemurs, is the branching of the carotid artery along with how it enters the skull—a trait which is shared by fork-marked lemurs. Analyses based on morphology, immunology, and repetitive DNA have given contradictory placements of Phaner, while studies in 2001 and 2008 either lacked data or yielded poor resolution of their placement.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationships}} among the families of lemurs have been problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. [...] Two competing phylogenies exist based on genetic and molecular data. [...] One approach (Horvath etal.) looks at a larger number of genes, but among fewer species. [...] This results in Lemuridae being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> and Indriidae. [...] The other approach (Orlando etal.) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species. [...] Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to Lemuridae, <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> and Indriidae. Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that Daubentoniidae (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuroid clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families. [...] However, two problems create complications for both approaches. [...] First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence. [...] In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42mya; such distant splits create a lot of noise for molecular techniques.|$|E
500|$|As {{its name}} implies, the gray mouse lemur is a lemur, {{a type of}} primate, and belongs to the {{suborder}} Strepsirrhini and infraorder Lemuriformes.

[...] The mouse lemur genus Microcebus includes the smallest primates in the world. [...] Phylogenetic analyses of D-loop DNA sequences of various lemur species suggest that the gray mouse lemur may be most closely related to the reddish-gray mouse lemur (M.griseorufus).|$|E
500|$|Lemurs have diversified greatly since first {{reaching}} Madagascar. [...] The aye-aye and its extinct {{relations are}} thought to have diverged first, shortly after colonization. [...] According to molecular studies, there have since been two major episodes of diversification, from which all other known extant and extinct family lineages emerged. [...] The remaining families diverged in the first diversification episode, during a 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). [...] The dates for this divergence window span the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event, during which time climate cooling took place and changes in ocean currents altered weather patterns. [...] Outside of Madagascar, these dates also coincide with the divergence of the lorisoid primates and five major clades of squirrels, all occupying niches similar to those of lemurs. [...] The dates do not suggest that increased predation drove family-level divergence since the first carnivores arrived on the island between 24 and 18mya. [...] The precise relationship between the four of the five families of lemurs is disputed since they diverged during this narrow and distant window. [...] Although all studies place <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all other}} members of the family <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> the gray mouse lemur is nocturnal and arboreal.

500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{classification}} of lemurs above the genus level has seen many changes. Early taxonomists proposed a variety of classifications for lemurs, but generally separated indriids from other lemurs and placed the aye-aye in a major group of its own; some classified the {{dwarf and mouse lemurs}} with the galagos. In 1915, William King Gregory published a classification that remained generally accepted over the next decades. He placed all the lemurs together in a [...] "series" [...] Lemuriformes and recognized three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae (including the current <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> and Lepilemuridae). George Gaylord Simpson's influential 1945 classification of mammals placed the treeshrews and the fossil Anagale (both now classified outside Primates) inside Lemuriformes and classified the fossil families Plesiadapidae and Adapidae in a superfamily Lemuroidea with most of the lemurs.|$|E
500|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs and {{are some of the}} largest members of the family <b>Cheirogaleidae,</b> {{weighing}} around [...] or more. They are the most phylogenetically distinct of the cheirogaleids, and considered a sister group {{to the rest of the}} family. Aside from their dorsal forked stripe, they have dark rings around their eyes, and large membranous ears. Males have a scent gland on their throat, but only use it during social grooming, not for marking territory. Instead, they are very vocal, making repeated calls at the beginning and end of the night. Like the other members of their family, they are nocturnal, and sleep in tree holes and nests during the day. Monogamous pairing is typical for fork-marked lemurs, and females are dominant. Females are thought to have only one offspring every two years or more.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1970s, the rafting {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} called into question by claims that lemur family <b>Cheirogaleidae</b> might be {{more closely related to}} the other Afro-Asian strepsirrhines than {{to the rest of the}} lemurs. [...] This idea was initially based on similarities in behavior and molar morphology, although it gained support with the 2001 discovery of 30‑million-year-old Bugtilemur in Pakistan and the 2003 discovery of 40‑million-year-old Karanisia in Egypt. [...] Karanisia is the oldest fossil found that bears a toothcomb, whereas Bugtilemur was thought to have a toothcomb, but also had even more similar molar morphology to Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs). If these relationships had been correct, the dates of these fossils would have had implications on the colonization of Madagascar, requiring two separate events. [...] The most parsimonious explanation, given the genetic evidence and the absence of toothcombed primates in European fossil sites, is that stem strepsirrhines evolved on the Afro-Arabian landmass, dispersing to Madagascar and more recently from Africa to Asia. [...] More recently, the structure and general presence of the toothcomb in Bugtilemur has been questioned, as well as many other dental features, suggesting it is most likely an adapiform.|$|E
