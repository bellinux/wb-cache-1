50|$|At the {{foundation}} of example-based machine translation {{is the idea of}} translation <b>by</b> <b>analogy.</b> When applied to the process of human translation, the idea that translation takes place <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> is a rejection of the idea that people translate sentences by doing deep linguistic analysis. Instead, it is founded on the belief that people translate by first decomposing a sentence into certain phrases, then by translating these phrases, and finally by properly composing these fragments into one long sentence. Phrasal translations are translated <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> to previous translations. The principle of translation <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> is encoded to example-based machine translation through the example translations that are used to train such a system.|$|R

According to the National Corpus of the Russian Language, anger dims eyes, makes blind and mad. In metaphorical projections, anger is defined {{in relation to the}} structural elements of other subject areas, including fluid, wild animals, natural disasters, fire, lightning, or thunderstorm. <b>By</b> <b>analogy</b> with some resources, anger is collected, wasted, and exhausted; <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> with water, anger overflows and boils; <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> with fire, inflames, and fades, anger can flare up and fade; <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> with wild animals, it can be curbed, tamed, or subdue. It is quite common that speakers do not pay attention to metaphorical expressions but take them almost for the objective characteristic of anger...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this essay}} I {{characterize}} arguments <b>by</b> <b>analogy,</b> which have an impor-tant role both in philosophical and everyday reasoning. Arguments <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> are dif-ferent from ordinary inductive or deductive arguments {{and have their}} own distinct features. I try to characterize the structure and function of these arguments. It is further discussed that some arguments, which are not explicit arguments <b>by</b> <b>analogy,</b> nevertheless should be interpreted as such and not as inductive or deductive arguments. The result is that a presumed outcome of a philosophical dispute {{will have to be}} reconsidered...|$|R

Socrates was like Plato in other respects, then asserting that C. Socrates was mortal is an example of argument <b>by</b> <b>analogy</b> because the reasoning employed in it proceeds from a particular truth in a premise (Plato was mortal) to a similar particular truth in the conclusion, namely that Socrates was mortal.|$|R

The results can be generalized to other domains. 1 Introduction Theorem proving <b>by</b> <b>analogy,</b> as sketched in Figure 1, finds a proof for a target theorem guided by a proof or proof plan of a given source theorem {{which is similar to}} the target theorem.
