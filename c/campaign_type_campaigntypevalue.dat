40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{research}} conducted in cooperation with 12 Snap, the leading European mobile marketing company, which has implemented large-scale mobile advertising campaigns with companies such as McDonald’s, Nestlé, Microsoft, Coca Cola, Adidas and Sony. To set the overall stage, we first discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the mobile phone in comparison to other marketing media. Then we propose a framework of different <b>types</b> of advertising <b>campaigns</b> that can be supported through the usage of mobile devices. These <b>campaign</b> <b>types</b> include (1) mobile push campaigns, (2) mobile pull campaigns, and (3) mobile dialogue campaigns. Building on this framework, we analyze different campaigns that 12 Snap implemented for different consumer goods and media companies. Drawing from these experiences we then discuss a number of key management issues that need to be considered when implementing mobile marketing campaigns. They include the following themes: (1) the choice of <b>campaign</b> <b>type,</b> (2) the design of a campaign, (3) the targeting of the youth market and (4) the combination of different media types to create integrated campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySecurity StudiesSam R. BellThis project {{examines}} {{the choices that}} rebel groups make between different types of sub-state political violence campaigns. I argue that rebels will choose a specific <b>campaign</b> <b>type</b> based on variations in the levels of state actions that cause grievances (referred to as coercion), and the capacity of {{both the state and}} the rebel group. This project develops a framework to explain the rebel decision-making process. The rebels seek to change the political behavior of the state by undertaking some form of violent campaign. Rebel campaigns are the ways in which rebels seek to obtain their ends; this project delineates between terrorist, insurgent, and civil war campaigns. However, rebels’ choice of campaign is affected by several factors: coercion, state administrative capacity, state military capacity, rebel administrative capacity, and rebel military capacity. I hypothesize that the different <b>types</b> of <b>campaigns</b> are affected differently by these factors. Additionally, I hypothesize that levels of coercion are more strongly related to the initial year of the campaign than subsequent years, regardless of <b>campaign</b> <b>type.</b> These hypotheses are analyzed via quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitatively, this includes the development of novel latent variables for coercion and capacity prior to empirical testing of the hypotheses. Qualitatively, two case studies of rebel groups are examined; the Mau Mau in Kenya and the LTTE in Sri Lanka. The research finds limited support for the hypotheses regarding the relationships between coercion and capacity, and the rebels’ choice of campaign...|$|R
40|$|Animal rights extremists {{have carried}} {{out a number of}} campaigns in the past in order to protect animals. The actions they carry out as part of these campaigns are often {{described}} as acts of intimidation, however little has been done to explore how these groups use intimidation on the whole. Past research has focused mainly on specific animal rights <b>campaign</b> <b>types</b> (Donovan & Coupe, 2013; Munro, 2005) or action types (Monaghan, 1999). The current research aimed to explore the types of intimidating behaviours carried out by animal rights extremists in the UK across all <b>campaign</b> <b>types.</b> Literature reviews were carried out in order to understand more about the current knowledge of animal rights extremism and intimidation. Study 1 aimed to catalogue incidents carried out by animal rights extremists in the UK, and to identify any regular patterns of behaviour across and between distinct campaign groups. The results of this study demonstrated that animal rights extremists show patterns in their choice of actions and targets both across the campaigns, and more specific patterns emerged for the main five campaigns. Having identified that threats are closely associated with intimidation, both from the literature reviews and the findings of Study 1, the second study aimed to explore the type of language used by animal rights extremists when making threats. The findings of Study 2 indicate that animal rights extremists are extremely confident when making their threats, although they might not be truthful when doing so. Overall, the findings of this research have important practical implications for potential targets of animal rights extremists...|$|R

Specifically, we propose and evaluate a content-driven framework for ef-fectively linking free text posts with common “talking points ” and extracting campaigns from large-scale social media. Three of the salient features of the campaign extraction framework are: (i) first, we investigate graph mining techniques for isolating coherent campaigns from large message-based graphs; (ii) second, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of text-based message correlation in message and user levels; and (iii) finally, we analyze temporal behaviors of various <b>campaign</b> <b>types.</b> Through an experimental study over millions of Twitter messages we identify five major <b>types</b> of <b>campaigns</b> – Spam, Promotion, Template, News, and Celebrity campaigns – and we show how these campaigns may be extracted with high precision and recall...|$|R

40|$|With the {{improvement}} of the geodetic techniques for the observation of the fault mechanism, it became very important to determine the stability and accuracy of the measurements. Following the new technologies (e. g. GPS) and high quality observations, many studies on tectonic problems can be initiated and improved. However, the quality and reliability of data obtained and results deduced from these studies depend on the location of stations, in other words, the design of geodetic networks, measurements techniques (e. g. continuous and <b>campaign</b> <b>type</b> GPS data collection) and observation errors. In this study, station number is fixed around a strike-slip fault and it is assumed that we observe the deformation pattern with these station positions correctly, and, using simulations, we checked the relationship between the accuracy of deformation model parameters based on errors (correlated noise and monument instability) and then investigate the sensitivity of the parameters according to the number of the stations, the distance from the fault and the type of the geodetic surveying. In addition, we investigated the simulation model for different value of the fault model parameters and compared the simulation results with a real world example.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different types of televised mass media campaign content on calls to the English NHS Stop Smoking helpline. Method: We used UK government-funded televised tobacco control campaigns from April 2005 to April 2010, categorised as either "positive" (eliciting happiness, satisfaction or hope) or "negative" (eliciting fear, guilt or disgust). We built negative binomial generalised additive models (GAMs) with linear and smooth terms for monthly per capita exposure to each <b>campaign</b> <b>type</b> (expressed as Gross Ratings Points, or GRPs) to determine their effect on calls in the same month. We adjusted for seasonal trends, inflation-adjusted weighted average cigarette prices and other tobacco control policies. Results: We found non-linear associations between exposure to positive and negative emotive campaigns and quitline calls. The rate of calls increased more than 50 % as exposure to positive campaigns increased from 0 to 400 GRPs (rate ratio: 1. 58, 95 % CI: 1. 25 - 2. 01). An increase in calls in response to negative emotive campaigns was only apparent after monthly exposure exceeded 400 GRPs. Conclusion: While positive campaigns were most effective at increasing quitline calls, those with negative emotive content were also found to impact on call rates but only at higher levels of exposure...|$|R
40|$|The American Red Cross (ARC) {{and many}} other {{disaster}} relief organizations often encounter the problem of retaining one-time disaster donorspeople who have given their first donation {{in response to a}} major disaster. Only 30 % of these donors return to give a second time after their initial contribution. A critical problem for the ARC is to motivate disaster donors to contribute to long-term operations and post-disaster programs such as community disaster preparation or emergency response training. In a typical disaster-donor retention campaign, the ARC sends an appeal for funds (usually a mailed letter) to a segment of disaster donors. The appeal is designed using a combination of features related to the letter format and contents, donor and <b>campaign</b> <b>type,</b> and the use of various gift items. The number of possible designs is exponential in the number of features. The outcome is evaluated using the success rate, defined as the proportion of mailings in a campaign that elicited a donation. The goal is to find the best set of campaign attributes that maximize the success rate as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on the number of campaigns that can be conducted. Linear regression based on historical data has been used to estimate the effects of the campaign attributes on the success rate (Ryzhov et al. 2013). The results of the estimation, however, are subject to change afte...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the need for}} a new model to evaluate government marketing communication in Australia. This issue has sparked great interest inside and outside government over the last two decades. There is a considerable body of research on evaluating marketing communication campaigns with reference to commercial marketing. However there is a paucity of research in the literature on the evaluation of government marketing campaigns. This thesis contributes to filling that gap by examining government communication campaign evaluation in Australia. This thesis potentially extends the body of knowledge on communication evaluation. Another potential contribution of the research is to improve the practice of evaluation of government marketing communication campaigns. This study uses a range of qualitative research methods, including action research, document analysis, elite actor interviews and case study analysis, to validate a new model against the available evidence from marketing communication campaigns in the government sector in Australia from 1999 to 2009. In examining actual practice the researcher used the 1994 Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) Program Evaluation model as the guiding template. Three new generic structural factors: Accountability, Benefits and Impacts/ROJ are added to the DOFA model. These flow from the latest literature on program evaluation. The researcher also adds three new situation or process factors that specifically are useful in planning communication <b>campaign</b> evaluation: <b>campaign</b> <b>type,</b> a risk matrix and a focus on timeframe decisions. This approach has not been used previously and is potentially a substantial contribution to the literature on communication evaluation models. This proposed model is generic, as it applies to all marketing communication programs. It is also normative as it incorporates key elements acknowledged as important for 21 st century systems of governance; social risk and greater transparency to foster and promote continuous improvement in government communication. The model for government evaluation should be useful for government marketing practitioners and researchers in marketing communication theory. The researcher believes the new model could be applied to evaluate large and small scale Australian Government marketing communication campaigns. The study also provides a new set of protocols based on the new model which will help campaign managers plan evaluation of marketing communication campaigns of varied size and complexity...|$|R
