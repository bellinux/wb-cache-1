40|$|Abstract. The {{inner and}} outer {{surfaces}} of concrete lining in deep alluvium freezing shaft are exposed to different temperatures, taking the hydration heat of cement for pyrogen. Additional stresses are therefore observed in concrete lining, owing to its marked temperature drop at early ages. This paper makes a numerical calculation of the temperature and the thermal stress on freezing <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> by finite element methods and engineering monitoring. The results reveal that the <b>concrete</b> of <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> has a high heat-release rate in the early age. And the time when <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> reaches its maximum temperature is 4 days earlier than it reaches its maximum thermal tension stresses. At the time of {{one day after the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> pouring, the {{inner and outer}} surface of <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> will crack owing to its hoop tension strain is greater than ultimate tension strain.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{focuses on the}} application of numerical modelling methods to rock mechanics problems, combining theoretical, experimental and numerical modelling work. Specifically, practical finite difference modelling approach for analysing <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> stability through the Marl and Potash strata at Boulby mine UK has been developed using the commercially available software FLAC 2 D/FLAC 3 D (ITASCA 2008). A soft rock Marl occurs close {{to the bottom of}} the two deep shafts at the mine. Both <b>shafts</b> <b>concrete</b> linings through this stratum have suffered considerable pressure, which has caused gradual failure of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining.</b> So far, both shaft linings through the Marl stratum have been restored twice after sunk in 1970 s and a further third relining is now required and being planned. The in situ observations, the rock engineers's experience, and the available in situ measurements at the mine have been significantly helpful in the validation of the numerical modelling. Many factors at the mine site have, however, made this numerical modelling research challenging, including complicated lining structures, complex lining failure conditions and the scarcity of laboratory test data for the weakest rock material - the Marl, which easily weathers on exposure. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a database of materials properties relevant to this research has been produced. The methodology of obtaining appropriate rock mass input material properties to use in numerical modelling based on laboratory test data has been studied. In three-dimensional models in this research, two modelling methods have been developed to simulate each stage in the shaft linings: the continuous model for all shaft linings and independent models for each <b>shaft</b> <b>lining.</b> The numerical modelling results imply that: Firstly, in the independent three-dimensional models, the modelling results were difficult to understand due to the complexity of the structures representing the shaft relining systems and difficulty in defining appropriate properties for the interface elements. Therefore, the continuous three-dimensional model that gives the analysable modelling results is recommended by the author for this research. By this method, the effect of the historic changes in the stress field on each shaft lining's stability can be investigated from initial shaft construction to subsequent relining phases. Secondly, the weak rock Marl should not be the only reason for the shaft linings' failure through this stratum. The roadway approximately 10 m beneath the Marl stratum was also a key factor for the stability of the shaft linings. The weak Marl cannot carry the stress redistribution around the shaft caused by the roadway excavation, which was an uneven loading acting on the circular shaft linings. This uneven loading introduced high shear and tensile stresses which threatened the stability of the circular concrete structures. Thirdly, the interface materials between high strength <b>concrete</b> blocks in <b>shaft</b> relinings improved the flexibility of the lining systems successfully, but decreased the strength of the whole lining systems as weak "joints". In addition, the single ring concrete blocks (the first and third relinings) are a more effective lining than the double rings (the second relining), and the third relining would perform better than the previous ones. As a recommendation for the further simulation, it is worth attempting to simulate the longer term deformation and stress conditions of the <b>shaft</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>lining</b> systems using the Creep model built in FLAC 2 D/FLAC 3 D codes. Additionally, deeper research work combined with in situ investigation can be done to decrease the uncertainty of the input material properties to make the numerical models as close to the real engineering situation as possible.

During the occurrence of a severe seismic event, the failure or severe damages in the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>shaft</b> could result in the total collapse of the structure. In a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>shaft,</b> plastic hinge formation only occurs {{at the base of the}} shaft and nonlinear resources of the rest of the shaft remains unexploited. This research presents an innovative technique for the assembly of shafts for elevated water tanks, using the slits in the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>shaft</b> design, which reduces the stress concentration at the shaft base and distributes stresses uniformly along the height of the shaft. The main aim of this study was to investigate the nonlinear seismic performance of the innovative RC slit shaft of the elevated water tanks by means of a finite element approach. The capacity spectrum and time history analyses were carried out to understand the nonlinear behaviour of the proposed support system. The results revealed that the slit width in the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>shaft</b> directly affected the failure mode and stiffness of the elevated water tanks. It was concluded that, with an appropriate design, the conversion of a solid shaft into a slit shaft can significantly increase the ductility of a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>shaft,</b> but there would be a slight reduction in the lateral strength. Furthermore, the results revealed that crack propagation was more uniform along the height of the slit shafts in comparison to the solid shaft and the ductility of the shafts increases as the slits become wider. Conclusively, this study showed that introducing the slits in the shaft could result in a significant reduction in the seismic response values of the elevated water tank, resulting in an economical design of the shaft structure and the foundation system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{water-bearing}} {{soft rock}} strata of West China, a field measurement {{is carried out}} on the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> in bedrock section. The <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> is built with freezing method. From the measurement, some changes of regularity in construction, thawing and post thawing period are obtained, including the temperature, freezing pressure and the vertical and hoop strain of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining.</b> Measurement studies have shown that: during the plastic stage of shaft construction period, {{with the release of}} hydration heat, the thermal expansion occurs in the concrete and the strain gauge, leading to tensile strain. In the earlier stage, the elastic modulus and strength of concrete increases rapidly. When the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> temperature reaches its maximum, the cooling and growth in the freezing pressure make the hoop strain increase sharply. However, the hoop strain is at lower tensile or compressive value. In the early stage and mature stage, the strain change is mainly affected by temperature. In the thawing and post thawing period, the concrete strain is also primarily influenced by temperature change. During the measurement, when the maximum compressive strain is less than ultimate value, the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> is in a safe state. To ensure the security of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining,</b> the <b>concrete</b> strength growth and sidewall temperature should be controlled in the similar shaft condition. In addition, the reinforcement ratio should not be too small for the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining</b> in frozen bedrock. And further, the fiber reinforced concrete, shrinkage-compensating concrete and low hydration heat concrete technology can also be adopted to reduce the cracks as much as possible and to avoid penetrating cracks. For the soft aquifers in West China, the further field measurement is still needed to obtain the stress and deformation regularities of the <b>shaft</b> <b>lining,</b> which can not only provide a basis for security assessment of the shaft, but also guide its design and optimization to improve the design theory...|$|R
