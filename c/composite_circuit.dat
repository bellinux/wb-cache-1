40|$|Current logic {{synthesis}} {{techniques are}} ineffective for arithmetic circuits.

Multipliers are particularly challenging {{because of the high}} fanout that results from the partial product generator.

To remedy this situation, we introduce a new logic synthesis algorithm that analyzes the cofactors of the Boolean input expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first general logic synthesis algorithm that can handle complex arithmetic circuits such as multipliers of non-trivial size without having any prior knowledge about the functionality of the circuit; it can also optimize larger <b>composite</b> arithmetic <b>circuits</b> that contain a variety of components.

Results In this paper, we investigate one of the interface conditions: fan-out. We quantify the fan-out, a concept widely used in electrical engineering, to indicate the maximum number of the downstream inputs that an upstream output transcription factor can regulate. The fan-out is shown to be closely related to retroactivity studied by Del Vecchio, et al. An efficient operational method for measuring the fan-out is proposed and shown to be applied to various types of module interfaces.

Structural modal/harmonic {{finite element models}} in ANSYS are integrated in this study to enable the predictions of resonance frequency shifts and failure stress for vertically clamped parallel circuit boards with inclusion of series of mounted electronic modules (chips). The board is modeled as a thin plate made of layers of E-glass composite with different fiber orientations and inter-fiber angles. Appreciable differences in maximum failure stress and resonance frequency shifts are observed by changing the above parameters in the fabrication of the boards. Mathematical approximations (metamodels) are provided to describe the complex trend of resonance frequencies in terms of angular design parameters. The model equations would simplify the parametric effects on frequency shifts and provide insight into any subsequent design optimization {{in the absence of}} access to FE codes, or readiness to devote more resources on FE analysis.

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major Pro essor) The extremely fast ionization {{process in}} semiconductors offers {{a means of}} generating pulses that have sub-nanosecond rise times and high peak powers. There are several important applications of these pulses which require {{the duration of the}} generated pulse to be variable. This thesis investigates three methods of producing variable-width pulses using transistors operating in the avalanche mode. The first circuit studied is used with a capacitor as the collector load. It produces pulse rise times of less than one nanosecond but has the disadvantage of a relatively slow RC discharge fall time. Distributed and lumped parameter delay lines were used in the second form of circuits studied. With the artificial delay line the pulse width can be controlled by opening the line at different sections whereas with the cable, the length must be altered to change the pulse width. These circuits produced fast rise, flat top, and fast fall pulses. In the third method studied, a <b>composite</b> <b>circuit</b> is used in which the fast rise of an avalanche pulse is added to a slower rise, but variable duration pulse, generated by a saturating transistor. This method is shown to produce fast rise, variable-width pulses with overshoot and ringing easily held to less than five percent...|$|E
40|$|RNA-based {{temperature}} sensing {{is common}} in bac-teria that live in fluctuating environments. Most naturally-occurring RNA thermosensors are heat-inducible, have long sequences, and function by se-questering the ribosome binding site in a hairpin structure at lower temperatures. Here, we demon-strate the de novo design of short, heat-repressible RNA thermosensors. These thermosensors contain a cleavage site for RNase E, an enzyme native to Escherichia coli and many other organisms, in the 5 ′ untranslated region of the target gene. At low temperatures, the cleavage site is sequestered in a stem–loop, and gene expression is unobstructed. At high temperatures, the stem–loop unfolds, allowing for mRNA degradation and turning off expression. We demonstrated that these thermosensors respond specifically to temperature and provided experimen-tal support for {{the central role of}} RNase E in the mechanism. We also demonstrated the modularity of these RNA thermosensors by constructing a three-input <b>composite</b> <b>circuit</b> that utilizes transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regula-tion.

Synthetic biology is uniquely poised to make great contributions to numerous fields such as bio-fuel, energy production, agriculture and eco-remediation, national defense, and biomedical and tissue engineering. Considerable {{progress has been made}} in engineering novel genetic circuits in many different organisms. However, not much progress has been made toward developing a formal methodology to engineer complex genetic systems in mammalian cells. One of the most promising areas of research is the study of embryonic and adult stem cells. Synthetic biology has the potential to greatly impact the progression and development of research in this area of study. A critical impediment to the development of stem cell engineering is the innate complexity, little to no characterization of parts, and limited compositional predictive capabilities. In this thesis, I discuss the strategies used for constructing and optimizing the performance of signaling pathways, the development of a large mammalian genetic part and circuit library, and the characterization and implementation of novel genetic parts and components aimed at developing a foundation for mammalian synthetic biology. I have designed and tested several orthogonal strategies aimed at cell-cell communication in mammalian cells. I have designed a characterization framework for the complete and proper characterization of genetic parts that allows for modular predictive composition of genetic circuits. With this characterization framework I have generated a small library of characterized parts and <b>composite</b> <b>circuits</b> that have well defined input-output relationships that can be used in novel genetic architectures.
