40|$|Activation of PPARγ by {{synthetic}} ligands, thiazolidinediones, inhibits {{the proliferation}} of cancer cells. In this report, focusing our attention on <b>ciglitazone,</b> we show that <b>ciglitazone</b> inhibits melanoma growth by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, whereas normal melanocytes are resistant to <b>ciglitazone.</b> In melanoma cells, ciglitazone-induced apoptosis is associated with caspase activations {{and a loss of}} mitochondrial membrane potential. Induction of cell-cycle arrest by <b>ciglitazone</b> is associated with changes in expression of key cell-cycle regulators such as p 21, cyclin D 1, and pRB hypophosphorylation. Cell-cycle arrest occurs at low <b>ciglitazone</b> concentrations and through a PPARγ-dependent pathway, whereas the induction of apoptosis is caused by higher <b>ciglitazone</b> concentrations and independently of PPARγ. These results allow an effective molecular dissociation between proapoptotic effects and growth inhibition evoked by <b>ciglitazone</b> in melanoma cells. Finally, we show that in vivo treatment of nude mice by <b>ciglitazone</b> dramatically inhibits human melanoma xenograft development. The data presented suggest that <b>ciglitazone</b> might be a better candidate for clinical trials in melanoma treatment than the thiazolidinediones currently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, such as rosiglitazone, which is devoid of a proapoptotic PPARγ-independent function...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{previously}} {{demonstrated that the}} thiazolidinedione <b>ciglitazone</b> inhibited, independently of PPAR activation, melanoma cell growth. Further investigations now show that <b>ciglitazone</b> effects are mediated through the regulation of secreted factors. Q-PCR screening of several genes involved in melanoma biology reveals that <b>ciglitazone</b> inhibits expression of the CXCL 1 chemokine gene.

40|$|Objective. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are {{synthetic}} agonists for the peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-gamma receptor and {{are currently}} in use as oral glucose-lowering drugs. TZDs have immune-modulating effects in vitro and in vivo. Because patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk for pneumonia, we evaluated the influence of <b>ciglitazone,</b> a TZD, on markers of inflammation and outcome during pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Design: In vivo animal study and in vitro study. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects. Female C 57 BI/ 6 mice and murine alveolar macrophage-like MH-S cells. Interventions. C 571 BI/ 6 mice were inoculated with 10 (5) colony-forming units of S. pneumoniae intranasally. The following interventions were studied: 1) vehicle at t = 0; 2) <b>ciglitazone</b> 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally at t = 0; and 3) <b>ciglitazone</b> 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally at t = 0 and 24 hours. Mice were killed at either 24 or 48 hours after infection. Additionally, phagocytosis and killing of S. pneumoniae by MH-S cells were assessed in vitro. Measurements and Main Results: Single treatment with <b>ciglitazone</b> reduced bacterial loads at 24 hours but not at 48 hours, whereas repeated <b>ciglitazone</b> treatment did diminish bacterial loads at 48 hours. After 24 hours, cytokine levels in lung homogenate were lower in single-dose ciglitazone-treated mice; however, after 48 hours, {{there was no difference}} in lung cytokines between any of the experimental groups.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the cytological and molecular effects of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR) -γ and PPAR-γ agonists on stomach cancer cells. METHODS: To {{determine the}} proliferation-suppressive effects of troglitazone and <b>ciglitazone,</b> SNU- 216 and SNU- 668 stomach cancer cells were plated in media containing 40 μmol/L troglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. After 3, 5 and 7 d, {{the cells were}} counted with a hemocytometer. To assess the appearance of PPAR-γ, a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed. On day 7, Western blotting {{was used to determine}} the effects of troglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> on the expression of p 21 and phosphorylated-ERK (pERK) genes. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine which portion of the cell cycle was delayed when troglitazone was used to suppress cell proliferation. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the activity of troglitazone, microarray analysis was conducted. RESULTS: PPAR-γ was manifested in both SNU- 216 and SNU- 668 cells. <b>Ciglitazone</b> and troglitazone suppressed cell growth, and troglitazone was a stronger suppressor of stomach cancer cells than <b>ciglitazone,</b> an inducer of cell cycle arrest in the G 1 phase. SNU- 668 cells were also determined to be more sensitive to <b>ciglitazone</b> and troglitazone than SNU- 216 cells. When troglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> were administered to stomach cancer cells, levels of p 21 expression were increased, but ERK phosphorylation levels were reduced. When GW 9662, an antagonist of PPAR-γ, was applied in conjunction with <b>ciglitazone</b> and troglitazone, the cell growth suppression effect was unaffected. The gene transcription program revealed a variety of alterations as the consequence of troglitazone treatment, and multiple troglitazone-associated pathways were detected. The genes whose expression was increased by troglitazone treatment were associated with cell development, differentiation, signal transmission between cells, and cell adhesion, and were also associated with reductions in cell proliferation, the cell cycle, nuclear metabolism, and phosphorylation.

40|$|Background/Aims: Recent {{evidence}} indicates that peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonists protect against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here we investigate {{the effects of the}} PPAR-gamma agonists, rosiglitazone and <b>ciglitazone,</b> on the renal dysfunction and injury caused by I/R of the rat kidney in vivo. Methods: Rosiglitazone or <b>ciglitazone</b> were administered to male Wistar rats prior to and during reperfusion. Biochemical indicators of renal dysfunction and injury were measured and histological scoring of kidney sections was used to assess renal injury. Expression of PPAR isoforms and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 during renal I/R were assessed using RT-PCR and Northern blot, respectively. Myeloperoxidase activity and activation of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) were used as indicators of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell infiltration and oxidative stress, respectively. Results: Expression of PPAR-alpha, PPAR-beta and PPAR-gamma 1 (but not PPAR-gamma 2) was observed in kidneys with down-regulation of PPAR-a expression during renal I/R. Rosiglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> significantly reduced biochemical and histological signs of renal dysfunction and injury. Renal expression of ICAM- 1 caused by I/R was reduced by rosiglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> which was reflected by decreased PMN infiltration into reperfused renal tissues. Both rosiglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> reduced PARP activation indicating a reduction of oxidative stress. Conclusion: These results suggest that the PPAR-gamma agonists rosiglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> reduce the renal dysfunction and injury associated with I/R of the kidney. We propose that one mechanism underlying the protective effects involves inhibition of the expression of ICAM- 1, a reduction of PMN infiltration into renal tissues and subsequent reduction of oxidative stress.

40|$|Apoptosis or {{programmed}} {{cell death}} has been demonstrated {{to play a role}} in the development of lung injury following hemorrhagic shock. A major pathway modulating the apoptotic response is the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI 3 K/Akt) pathway. <b>Ciglitazone,</b> a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPARy) ligand has previously been shown to attenuate lung inflammation following hemorrhagic shock.

MethodsMouse mesangial cells were made quiescent and proliferation was measured following the application of PDGF. Using <b>ciglitazone</b> as the model compound, the mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of PPARγ activators on MAPK and specific cell cycle regulatory proteins were examined by Western blot analysis and transfection studies. ResultsCiglitazone inhibited PDGF-induced mesangial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (1 to 20 μmol/L). The inhibitory effect was blocked by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor element (PPRE) decoy oligonucleotide, indicating that the observed effect of <b>ciglitazone</b> was via PPARγ activation. <b>Ciglitazone</b> (1 to 20 μmol/L) did not affect extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation but inhibited the activation of serum response element (SRE) by 85 ± 6 % (P < 0. 01). This effect was associated with a reduction in c-fos expression (80 ± 9 %, P < 0. 01). <b>Ciglitazone</b> (1, 10, and 20 μmol/L) also inhibited cyclin D 1 expression by 37 ± 8 %, 79 ± 15 %, and 87 ± 12 %, respectively (P < 0. 001 to 0. 001), and p 21 expression by 45 ± 6 % (P < 0. 01), 61 ± 10 % (P < 0. 001), and 72 ± 8 % (P < 0. 001), respectively. <b>Ciglitazone</b> inhibited PDGF-mediated up-regulation of p 27.

In this study, we examined whether <b>ciglitazone,</b> a synthetic PPARγ ligand, can modulate the basal and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-induced ICAM 1 gene expression in human ASM cells. Methods: Human ASM cells were treated with TNFα. ICAM- 1 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. PPARγ activity was inhibited by target-specific small interfering (si) RNA targeting PPARγ and GW 9662, a PPARγ antagonist. Activity of nuclear factor (NF) -κB was assessed by using immunoblot analysis, immune-confocal images, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results: By flow cytometry, <b>ciglitazone</b> alone {{had no effect on}} ICAM- 1 expression in ASM cells, but inhibited ICAM- 1 expression in response to TNFα (10 ng/ml) in a dose-dependent manner (1 - 10 μM).

Knockdown of PPARγ gene by target-specific siRNA targeting PPARγ enhanced ICAM- 1 expression and the inhibitory effect of <b>ciglitazone</b> on TNFα-induced ICAM- 1 expression was reversed by PPARγ siRNA and GW 9662.

In this study, we compared the effects of the synthetic PPAR ligand <b>ciglitazone</b> with an endogenous PPAR ligand, 15 -deoxy- 12, 14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15 -deoxy PGJ 2), on inherent neurotoxicity and neuroprotection using a reduction in extracellular KCl in rat cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). We also assessed the effects of these ligands on c-Jun protein expression, which is up-regulated on induction of low-KCl-mediated neuronal apoptosis as well as being associated with PPAR in other cell types. We showed that PPAR mRNA is expressed in CGN cultures and observed ciglitazone- and 15 -deoxy PGJ 2 -mediated inherent neurotoxicity that was concentration and time dependent. c-Jun was only modestly increased in the presence of <b>ciglitazone</b> but was markedly up-regulated by 15 -deoxy PGJ 2 after 12 hr.

40|$|Background: Insulin {{resistance}} {{is linked to}} dyslipidemia, characterized by a decrease in high density lipo-proteins {{and an increase in}} low density lipoproteins. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are insulin-sensitizing agents used to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recently, the safety of certain TZD regimens has been questioned because of associated adverse effects on the plasma lipid profile. We examined the effect of a TZD, <b>Ciglitazone,</b> on apolipoprotein synthesis and secretion in human liver HepG 2 cells. Methods and Results: The effect of <b>Ciglitazone</b> treatment on apolipoprotein synthesis was addressed at the level of transcription, translation and secretion. RT-PCR showed that <b>Ciglitazone</b> increased the transcription of apoE and apoAI but reduced the levels of apoCI and apoB mRNA. Western blot analysis showed an increase in apoAI and apoE secreted in the cell culture media, whereas the amounts of apoB 100 and apoCI were reduced. To confirm that <b>Ciglitazone</b> regulates apolipoprotein translation, its effect on de novo protein synthesis was evaluated by metabolic labeling with [35 S]-methionine/cysteine, and a similar pattern of regulation was observed. The change in apolipoprotein levels was not secondary to cholesterol biosynthesis or clearance, since Ciglita-zone did not regulate the transcription of HMGCoA reductase, or the LDL receptor. However, mRNA levels for both PPAR-γ and LXRα were induced, suggesting a role for either or both receptors in modulating the hepatic apolipoprotein profile. The involvement of these nuclear receptor transcription factors was confirmed since direct activation of these receptors by endogenous PPAR-γ ligand, 15 d-prostaglandin J 2, or LXRα ligand, 22 (R) hydroxycholesterol, similarly upregulated apoAI and apoE, but down-regulated apoB 100 protein synthesis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Ciglita-zone treatment results in an atheroprotective lipoprotein profile in liver cells. Thus, while the adipose and muscle tissues may be primary targets in TZD-mediated glucose homeostasis, liver PPAR-γ contributes significantly to the regulation of plasma lipoprotein profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{peroxisome}} proliferator activated receptor gamma (PP ARy) {{makes up}} a distinct subclass {{of the nuclear}} receptor family of transcription factors and {{is involved in the}} regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. PP ARy is the target receptor for a class of hypoglycemic pharmaceutical agents called Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are extensively used for the management of insulin resistance. TZDs reduce plasma glucose levels by increasing cellular glucose uptake and reducing hepatic glucose production. It is known that diabetic subjects taking TZDs show a decrease in plasma triglycerides and an increase in HDL lipoprotein levels. In spite of such an improvement in plasma lipid profile, a recent report suggests that subjects receiving a specific TZD treatment may be at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Several target genes of PPARy are relevant to the development of atherosclerosis. These include genes for the apolipoproteins apoE, apoAI, and ApoCI. These genes are highly expressed in the liver, a major organ for the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). We have studied the regulation of apolipoproteins apoAI, apoCI, apo E, and apoBlOO by the TZD, <b>Ciglitazone,</b> in HepG 2 liver cells. ApoE and apoCI are components ofVLDL, apoAI is the primary apoprotein of HDL particles, and apoB 100 is found in LD L particles. Our data show a significant increase in apoE, a po AI and apoCI transcripts after treatment of HepG 2 cells with <b>Ciglitazone.</b> We confirmed that regulation of mRNA levels is extended to protein expression. Using specific immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, we found that <b>Ciglitazone</b> induces apoE, apoAI, and apoCI protein synthesis and secretion from HepG 2 cells. Additionally, we performed metabolic labeling experiments to show an up-regulation in de nova synthesis of apoAI and apoE, but a down-regulation of apoB 100 synthesis, in Ciglitazone-treated HepG 2 cells. Consistent with the physiologic effects of TZDs, we found that <b>Ciglitazone</b> treatment reduced the triglyceride content of HepG 2 cells. Our studies about the effects of <b>Ciglitazone</b> on apolipoprotein mRNA and protein expression lead us to conclude that activation of PP ARy may influence the plasma lipoprotein profile by altering the expression of hepatic apolipoproteins. Our data show that Ciglitazone-mediated hepatic PPARy activation resulted in an increase in atheroprotective apolipoproteins apoAI and apoE, and a decrease in atherogenic apoBlOO. Thus, Ciglitazone's effect on hepatic apolipoprotein expression does not appear to contribute to cardiovascular risk...|$|E

40|$|Given {{their roles}} in immune regulation, the {{expression}} of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) 1 and 2 isoforms was investigated in human naïve (CD 45 RA+) and memory (CD 45 RO+) CD 4 + T cells. Stimulation of both types of cells via the CD 3 /CD 28 pathway resulted in high expression of both PPARγ receptors as measured by real-time PCR. Treatment with the PPARγ agonist, <b>ciglitazone,</b> increased PPARγ 1 expression but decreased PPARγ 2 expression in stimulated naïve and memory cells. Furthermore, when present, the magnitude of both PPARγ receptors expression was lower in naïve cells, perhaps suggesting a lower regulatory control of these cells. Similar profiles of selected proinflammatory cytokines were expressed by the two cell types following stimulation. The induction of PPARγ 1 and suppression of PPARγ 2 expressions in naïve and memory CD 4 + T cells in the presence of <b>ciglitazone</b> suggest that the PPARγ subtypes may have different roles in the regulation of T-cell function...|$|E
40|$|The obesity hormone leptin {{has been}} implicated in breast cancer development. Breast cancer cells express the leptin {{receptor}} {{and are able to}} synthesize leptin in response to obesity-related stimuli. Furthermore, leptin is a positive regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and high levels of both proteins are associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ligands are therapeutic agents used in patient with Type 2 diabetes and obesity which have recently been studied for their potential anti-tumor effect. Here, we studied if these compounds, <b>ciglitazone</b> and GW 1929, can affect the expression of leptin and VEGF in breast cancer cells. In MDA-MB- 231 and MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, treatment with submolar concentrations of <b>ciglitazone</b> and GW 1929 elevated the expression of leptin and VEGF mRNA and protein, and increased cell viability and migration.

40|$|Abstract Background Activated {{mast cells}} are present within airway smooth muscle (ASM) bundles in eosinophilic asthma. ASM {{production}} of the chemokine CXCL 10 {{plays a role in}} their recruitment. Thus the effects of glucocorticoids (fluticasone, budesonide), long-acting β 2 -agonists (salmeterol, formoterol) and thiazolidinediones (<b>ciglitazone,</b> rosiglitazone) on CXCL 10 production by ASM cells (ASMC) from people with and without asthma were investigated in vitro. Methods Confluent serum-deprived cells were treated with the agents before and during cytokine stimulation for 0 - 24 [*]h. CXCL 10 protein/mRNA, IκB-α levels and p 65 activity were measured using ELISA, RT PCR, immunoblotting and p 65 activity assays respectively. Data were analysed using ANOVA followed by Fisher’s post-hoc test. Results Fluticasone and/or salmeterol at 1 and 100 [*]nM inhibited CXCL 10 release induced by IL- 1 β and TNF-α, but not IFNγ or all three cytokines (cytomix). The latter was also not affected by budesonide and formoterol. In asthmatic ASMC low salmeterol, but not formoterol, concentrations increased cytomix-induced CXCL 10 release and at 0. 01 [*]nM enhanced NF-κB activity. Salmeterol 0. 1 nM together with fluticasone 0. 1 and 10 [*]nM still increased CXCL 10 release. The thiazolidinediones <b>ciglitazone</b> and rosiglitazone (at 25 and 100 [*]μM) inhibited cytomix-induced CXCL 10 release but these inhibitory effects were not prevented by the PPAR-g antagonist GW 9662. <b>Ciglitazone</b> did not affect early NF-κB activity and CXCL 10 mRNA production. Conclusions Thus the thiazolidinediones inhibited asthmatic ASMC CXCL 10 release under conditions when common asthma therapies were ineffective or enhanced it. They may provide an alternative strategy to reduce mast cell-ASM interactions and restore normal airway physiology in asthma. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Thiazolidinediones are a {{new class}} of anti-diabetic agents which {{increase}} insulin sensitivity by binding to the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and stimulate the expression of insulinresponsive genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. These drugs also have vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However the mechanisms for these actions are not understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator. Equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) - 1, which is an Na+- independent and nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR) -sensitive nucleoside transporter, {{plays an important role in}} adenosine functions because it fine-tunes the local concentrations of adenosine in the vicinity of adenosine receptors. In the present study, the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and <b>ciglitazone,</b> on ENT 1 in VSMCs were studied. Methods: The ENT 1 activity in VSCMs was determined by the initial rate of [3 H]adenosine uptake and [3 H]NBMPR binding assay. The mRNA and protein expressions of ENT 1 were detected by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Results: Incubating VSMCs for 48 hr with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT 1 mRNA and protein levels. However, troglitazone inhibited [3 H]adenosine uptake and [3 H]NBMPR binding of VSMCs with IC 50 values of 2. 35 ± 0. 35 µM and 3. 99 ± 0. 57 µM, respectively. This effect of troglitazone on ENT 1 was PPARγ- independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT 1. In contrast, pioglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> had minimal effects on [3 H]adenosine uptake by VSMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> as its side-chain contains a vitamin E moiety. This difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT 1 because vitamin E did not inhibit [3 H]adenosine uptake by VSMCs. Conclusions: Troglitazone inhibits ENT 1. It is suggested that troglitazone may alter the vascular effect of adenosine. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|UNLABELLED: PPARgamma {{levels in}} asthma- and non-asthma-derived airway smooth muscle cells and PPARgamma activation-induced cell {{proliferation}} were investigated. In {{the presence of}} FBS, PPARgamma levels were higher in subconfluent asthma-derived cells but lower in confluent cells compared with non-asthma-derived. However, PPARgamma activation did not alter cell proliferation. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Airway remodelling involves thickening of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) bulk. Proliferation of asthma-derived ASM cells is increased in vitro, but underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) regulates the cell cycle. It is suggested that PPARgamma agonists have anti-inflammatory effects, which may be valuable {{in the treatment of}} asthma, but information regarding their antiproliferative properties in ASM is lacking. Although corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation, in vitro they inhibit proliferation in only non-asthma ASM cells by reducing cyclin D 1. We therefore investigated the effects of mitogenic stimulation (foetal bovine serum (FBS)), and a PPARgamma ligand (<b>ciglitazone),</b> on PPARgamma and cyclin D 1 expression and proliferation of ASM cells. In addition, we examined the effects of <b>ciglitazone</b> on ASM cell proliferation. METHODS: We assessed PPARgamma and cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein levels using quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Cell proliferation was assessed using bromodeoxyuridine uptake. RESULTS: In the presence of 5 % FBS, PPARgamma and cyclin D 1 expression decreased over time in non-asthmatic cells but increased in asthmatic cells (compared with sub-confluent cells). FBS-induced proliferation of asthmatic cells increased at all time points, but occurred only at day 7 with non-asthmatic cells (compared with unstimulated time-matched control). <b>Ciglitazone</b> increased PPARgamma expression in both groups, but did not alter cell proliferation, while fluticasone increased PPARgamma protein only in asthmatic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although {{in the presence of a}} mitogenic stimulus, PPARgamma was differentially expressed in asthma- and non-asthma-derived ASM; its expression was not related to the increased proliferation observed in asthmatic ASM...|$|E
40|$|Thiazolidinediones are a {{new class}} of anti-diabetic agents which {{increase}} insulin sensitivity by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and stimulating the expression of insulin-responsive genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). The present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and <b>ciglitazone,</b> on ENT 1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48 h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT 1 mRNA and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3 H]adenosine uptake and [3 H]NBMPR binding of HASMCs with IC 50 values of 2. 35 ± 0. 35 and 3. 99 ± 0. 57 μM, respectively. The effect of troglitazone on ENT 1 was PPARγ-independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT 1. In contrast, pioglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> had minimal effects on [3 H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and <b>ciglitazone</b> in that its side-chain contains a Vitamin E moiety. The difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT 1 because Vitamin E did not inhibit [3 H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Using the nucleoside transporter deficient PK 15 NTD cells stably expressing ENT 1 and ENT 2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ENT 1 but had no effect on ENT 2. From these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ENT 1. Pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ENT 1. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
