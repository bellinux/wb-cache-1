He was liable to all types of obligations, as one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{proposals}} of Plato in The Laws: presentation three times monthly {{at the home of}} the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of metics, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.|$|E

[...] The recipe calls for two small {{chickens}} to be fried in butter; for ground turmeric, ginger and pepper to be added and the dish to be stewed; and for cream and lemon juice to be added just before serving. Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but not quite a modern curry. As you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Epperson, who {{had struck}} up a {{friendship}} with Spacey while writing an early screenplay draft of The Shipping News, was hired to write a new draft for Beyond the Sea. Epperson's script included Darin's penchant for orgies after his divorce with Sandra Dee. Spacey, finding the Epperson script to be overtly dark and morbid, began to rewrite Beyond the Sea, incorporating info from the 1987 Lewis Colick script. Spacey acknowledged he portrayed Darin in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, and decided not to centrally depict {{the darker side of}} Darin's life. [...] "The other scripts made Bobby [...] a rather unlikable figure," [...] he explained. [...] "I was not interested in making a conventional biopic, as you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> results. I was interested in making an exuberant celebration of an entertainer {{in a way that would}} be uplifting for an audience." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{finished}} recording {{their debut}} album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire in September 2005 with British record producer Jim Abbiss producing. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, selling 363,735 copies {{in the first}} week. This smashed the previous record of 306,631 copies held by Popstars by Hear'Say, and sold more copies on its first day alone – 118,501 – {{than the rest of}} the Top 20 albums combined. The cover sleeve of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the NHS in Scotland for [...] "reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK". The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and suggested the opposite – [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> image smoking is not doing him the world of good." ...|$|E

In a somewhat similar fashion, spaces that are both normal and T1 are often called [...] "normal Hausdorff spaces" [...] by people that wish to avoid the ambiguous [...] "T" [...] notation. These conventions can be generalised to other regular spaces and Hausdorff spaces.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} part of the book Jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial {{division}} of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition. Another interpretation of history, generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to Jacobs' is supported by Marxist archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe and in recent times by another historical materialist Charles Keith Maisels These writers argue that agriculture preceded cities. The apparent opposition between Childe and Jacobs theories rests in their definition of 'city,' 'civilization,' or 'urban.' Childe, like other materialists such as Maisels or Henri Lefebvre defines 'urban' or 'civilization' as Synoecism—as a literate, socially stratified, monolithic political community, whereas, as one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Economy of Cities or from Cities and the Wealth of Nations, Jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor. Without the requirements of literacy, monumental building, or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces, 'cities' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when Childe and Maisels place them. However, Jacobs' definition is supposition, since 'city' is defined simply as a large town or [...] "a large human settlement" [...] indicating permanence. The earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement, implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found.|$|E

60|$|The {{character}} of Balaam is so perfectly natural, and yet {{of a kind}} so very difficult to unravel and explain, that if the story was invented by man, as poems or novels are, {{it must have been}} invented very late indeed {{in the history of the}} Jews; at a time when they had grown to be a far more civilised people, far more experienced in the cunning tricks of the human heart than they were, as far as we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bible, before the Babylonish captivity. But it was NOT invented late; for no Jew in these later times would have thought of making Balaam a heathen, to be a prophet of God, or a believer in the true God at all. The later Jews took up the notion that God spoke to and cared for the Jews only, and that all other nations were accursed.|$|E
