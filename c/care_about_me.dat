2500|$|Benedikt Fontana is {{considered}} a hero and a freedom fighter in the Grisons. Legend has it that he cheered on his men to attack the Habsburg fortifications with the words [...] "Hei fraischgiamank meiss matts, cun mai ais be ün hom da fear, quai brichia guardad, u chia hoatz Grischuns e Ligias u maa non plü!""Go on, my boys, I'm just one man, do not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Today is for the Grisons and the Leagues, or never!". Whether he really used such words is of course uncertain; written accounts that emphasise {{his role in the}} battle appeared only {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. The legend was further elaborated and became popular in the 19th century, and in 1903, a statue was erected in his honor at Chur.|$|E
2500|$|It {{became a}} ballroom-sized {{room with a}} double-height ceiling full of Renaissance-type frescoes, with Baccarat crystal chandeliers. The carved marble {{fireplace}} was taken from an old Louisiana plantation home. Hill chose parquet flooring and a gold and white color scheme for the entire room. The pianos were placed at one end, with French provincial sofas cushioned by an oriental carpet at the other end. Gold and white silk wall panels concealed shelves for records, music-related books, and Hill's musical instruments. Hill had 108 speakers installed in the room, connected with four miles of wiring. He spent more than $20,000 on the room's sound system. Hill also added a hidden movie screen on which to project his collection of comedy films, which was also hidden {{behind one of the}} silk wall panels. [...] The room became a bone of contention; Joan was angry about the amount of money her husband had poured into realizing his dream. During their 1968 separation, she had confided in Patti Gordon, a friend who owned a restaurant, that the music room had been central to their troubles. [...] "He doesn't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> or our son or anybody else. Only that god damned music room. I wish we had never started building it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me one thing. I've often {{wanted to}} know, {{and now you}} speak of it I'll venture to ask. Did you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> when you read Keats to me last summer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|An {{extraordinary}} expression flashed {{across her}} face, {{very different from}} pity, modesty, remorse, or anything her companion had expected: her voice became suddenly strong and full. [...] "I don't believe," [...] she said, [...] "he ever <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> a rap. He hated my husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it believable?" [...] exclaimed Abdul. [...] "It {{appears that}} none of the belligerents <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> at all. None had designs upon me. The war was not made, as we understood, Toomuch, as an attempt to seize my person. All they wanted was Constantinople. Not me at all!" ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE (embarrassed). Oh, I'm popular {{enough when}} I'm going away. They don't <b>care</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell," [...] he answered. [...] "Certainly I cannot {{think of}} {{anything}} I have done to offend him. But I am nearly always unfortunate. The people whom I {{would like to have}} <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> as a rule don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me, how queer they are!" [...] thought Nelly, half afraid, yet {{very anxious}} {{to go with them}} and see more of this curious sea-life of which they had spoken. [...] "Don't you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> at all, and don't you want me to stay with you a little while?" [...] she asked, {{wondering}} how she should get on with creatures who could not love her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bessie, dear Bessie!" [...] said John, who {{was pretty}} well beside himself by this time, [...] "just tell me honestly--do you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> I am not worth much, I know, {{but if you}} do all this goes for nothing," [...] and he took her hand and drew her towards him, so that she half slipped, half rose from the sod wall and stood face to face with him, for she was a tall woman, and they were very nearly of a height.|$|E
6000|$|... "She <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> just as Mrs. Baker does," [...] said Graham to himself, who was {{the worst}} judge of them all. He muttered {{something}} quite unintelligible in answer to the kindness of her words; and then Madeline, having gone through her task, retired to the further side of the round table, {{and went to work}} among the teacups.|$|R
2500|$|Tricky {{was in a}} brief {{relationship}} with Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk in the 1990s. When asked in mid-2013 {{about the time the}} pair spent together, Tricky stated: [...] "I wasn't good for Björk. I wasn't healthy for her. I feel she was really good to me, she gave me a lot of love and she really was a good person to me. I think she <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father and}} mother were honest people," [...] says Mary, obstinately. [...] "My mother ran away from home, and died in a hospital. My father was always drunk, and always beating me. My step-mother {{is as good as}} dead, for all she <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> My only brother is {{thousands}} of miles away in fore ign parts, and never writes to me, and never helps me with a farthing. My sweetheart--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That 's not an answer! But it 's {{none of my}} business. Only if I, in his place, being {{suspected}} of having--what shall I call it?--a cold heart, managed to do that piece of work, oh, oh! I should be called a pretty lot of names. Charlatan, poseur, arrangeur! But he can do as he chooses! My dear young man, I know you don't like me," [...] he went on, as Roderick came back. [...] "It 's a pity; you are strong enough not to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> at all. You are very strong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: [...] "I own {{the late}} encroachments upon my {{constitution}} made me willing {{to see the}} end of all further <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> or my works. I would rest for the one in a full resignation of my being to be disposed of by the Father of all mercy; and for the other (though indeed a trifle, yet a trifle may be some example) I would commit them to the candour of a sensible and reflecting judge, rather than to the malice of every short-sighted and malevolent critic, or inadvertent and censorious reader. And no hand can set them in so good a light," [...] &c.--Let. cxx. to Mr. W.--WARBURTON.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help thinking," [...] she said, looking smilingly at him, after a {{few moments}} of silence, [...] "how strange it is that we should have met and talked to each other, just {{as if it had been}} only {{yesterday}} when we parted at Lorton. And yet we must both be very much altered in those five years,--I think it is five years. How was it you seemed to have a sort of feeling that I was the same Maggie? I was not quite so sure that you would be the same; I know you are so clever, and you must have seen and learnt so much to fill your mind; I was not quite sure you would <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tricky {{was in a}} brief {{relationship}} with Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk in the 1990s. When asked in mid-2013 {{about the time the}} pair spent together, Tricky stated: [...] "I wasn't good for Björk. I wasn't healthy for her. I feel she was really good to me, she gave me a lot of love and she really was a good person to me. I think she <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{never will}} say so; {{and a good}} while ago she made me promise not {{to speak to her}} about it again. And she has set her mind {{especially}} against my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can't give her up. I do think she <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said that Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] exclaimed Dolly, pouting, {{when the}} {{laughter}} had subsided; [...] "you make believe to <b>care</b> something <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> and yet will {{not listen to}} what I say." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} the oddest things. Of {{the shape of the}} room, of the cracks in the ceiling, of the paper on the walls, of the flaws in the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of the washing-stand being rickety on its three legs, and having a discontented {{something}} about it, which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge {{under the influence of the}} old one. I was crying all the time, but, except that I was conscious of being cold and dejected, I am sure I never thought why I cried. At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to come here where no one seemed to want me, or to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> half as much as she did. This made such a very miserable piece of business of it, that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane, and cried myself to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shut up the book," [...] said Neelie, resignedly. [...] "I have {{no doubt}} we should find the police, and the prison, and the hair-cutting--all punishments for perjury, exactly as I told you!--if {{we looked at the}} next page. But we needn't trouble {{ourselves}} to look; we have found out quite enough already. It's all over with us. I must go to school on Saturday, and you must manage to forget me as soon as you can. Perhaps we may meet in after-life, and you may be a widower and I may be a widow, and the cruel law may consider us emancipated, when it's too late to be of the slightest use. By that time, no doubt, I shall be old and ugly, and you will naturally have ceased to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> and it will all end in the grave, and the sooner the better. Good-by," [...] concluded Neelie, rising mournfully, with the tears in her eyes. [...] "It's only prolonging our misery to stop here, unless--unless you have anything to propose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I am {{sure that}} you know very well, Mary, that I mean the {{vocation}} {{of taking care of}} me, which you repudiated with scorn--in fact refused to entertain it seriously at all. Of course there may have been other grounds, but the one you laid stress on was that I was lazy and purposeless, and that if you ever did take up such a vocation it would be to take care of some one you could respect. I don't say for an instant that I approach to that altitude, but at least I may say I am no longer an idler, that I have worked hard, and that I have every hope of success. You see, too, that I want you more than I did then. I am a poor artist and not the heir to a good estate. But as you are fond of sacrificing yourself, that may not be altogether an objection. At any rate, dear, I think I shall be able to keep you comfortably. I am not sure I should ever have mustered up courage enough to have spoken on this subject again, {{had it not been for}} yesterday. But that gave me a little hope that you really had come to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> a little, and that possibly you might be willing to change your plans again in my favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} kind of you," [...] John said. [...] "If I had known that you <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> seeing <b>me,</b> I would have come to you with pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Try me. It {{shall not}} be nonsense. If you <b>care</b> enough <b>about</b> <b>me</b> to wish to save me from what is evil, you can do it. I <b>care</b> enough <b>about</b> you {{to give up the}} pursuit at your bidding." ...|$|R
60|$|MINNIE. He didn't <b>care</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> really. But you can't help liking George. He's human, all right! If he was {{boss of the}} Pindar Shops there wouldn't be any strike.|$|R
6000|$|... "You, dear Mother," [...] he writes, [...] "must now choose wholly for {{yourself}} what {{your way of}} life is to be; and let there be, I charge you, no <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> or others in your choice. Ask yourself where you would like best to live,—here with me, or with Christophine, or in our native country with Luise. Whithersoever your choice falls, there will we provide the means. For the present, of course, in the circumstances given, you would remain in Würtemberg a little while; and in that time all would be arranged. I think you might pass the winter months most easily at Leonberg" [...] (pleasant Village nearest to Solitüde); [...] "and then with the Spring you would come with Luise to Meiningen; where, however, I would expressly advise that you had a household of your own. But of all this, more next time. I would insist upon your coming here to me, if I did not fear things would be too foreign and too unquiet for you. But were you once in Meiningen, we will find means enough to see each other, and to bring your dear Grandchildren to you. It were a great comfort, dearest Mother, at least to know you, for the first three or four weeks after Christophine's departure, among people of your acquaintance; as the sole company of our Luise would too much remind you of times that are gone. But should there be no Pension granted by the Duke, and the Sale of Furniture, &c. did not detain you too long, you might perhaps travel with both the Sisters to Meiningen; and there compose yourself in the new world so much the sooner. All that you need for a convenient life must and shall be yours, dear Mother. It shall be henceforth my care that no anxiety on that head be left you. After so many sorrows, the evening of your life must be rendered cheerful, or at least peaceful; and I hope you will still, in the bosom of your Children and Grandchildren, enjoy many a good day." [...] In conclusion, he bids her send him everything of Letters and MSS. which his dear Father left; hereby to fulfil his last wish; which also shall have its uses to his dear Mother.|$|E

50|$|It's {{thanks to}} people. I {{realized}} {{that there are still}} many people who <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I made the decision to work really hard thanks to people to whom I feel really thankful towards.

6000|$|... "I {{got this}} plaything {{for a woman}} in the old country, many a long year ago," [...] said Mat, {{pressing}} the fan roughly into Mr. Blyth's hands. [...] "When I come back, and thought for to give it her, she was dead and gone. There's not another woman in England as <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> or knows <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> If you're too proud to let your wife have the thing, throw it into the fire.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to her work for the LGBT community, she also organized and performed at benefits for battered women and children. When asked about why she chose to do this work, she replied, “Somebody has to care. People say, ‘Why do you still do that?’ I said, ‘It’s very simple. If people didn’t <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> when I was growing up, with my mother being black, raised in the south.’ I said, ‘I wouldn’t be here.’” ...|$|E

5000|$|Outside of {{performing}} with Slipknot, Thomson {{is known to}} keep a relatively low profile. Speaking on the band's 2006 video release Voliminal: Inside the Nine, he explained that [...] "I like my quiet time; I like to be left the fuck alone", while pointing out that he [...] "loves" [...] {{being a part of}} the band. In an interview with Jon Wiederhorn for Revolver magazine about the making of Iowa, the guitarist explained that [...] "On days off, you'd never see me out of my hotel room ...

Her mother, Sikharulidze, and Moskvina took her back to Saint Petersburg, Russia where she could begin her rehabilitation.
