50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{as the subject}} matter of higher {{education}} became more diverse, pressure grew to standardize both higher education in general and the transition between secondary and higher education in particular. The first school to make the high school diploma a necessary and sufficient <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> was the University of Michigan in 1870; as high school education was standardized through accreditation bodies beginning in the 1880s, more colleges and universities followed Michigan's lead.|$|R

Prior to the 1960s institutions of higher education did not have to respect students constitutional rights but could act as a parent {{in the interest of the}} student (Nancy Thomas, 1991). In 1960 Shelton v. Turner found [...] "the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools" [...] and in 1961 Dixon v.

Typically, the law clerks are selected from among the top students of each law school across the country.

5000|$|The {{southern}} {{members of}} Congress upheld that the Tallmadge amendment was unconstitutional because it put restrictions on {{states as a}} <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> to the Union.

The proponents of the Tallmadge Amendment argued that [...] "slavery itself was a moral and political evil that was contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, and that it had been tolerated in the Constitution only by necessity and ought to now be restricted".|$|R
50|$|However, in some situations, the {{procedures}} and {{conditions for the}} issue of long-stay visas have been harmonised among all Schengen member states, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania. For example, Council Directive 2004/114 has harmonised the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> of third country nationals wishing to study in a Schengen member state, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus or Romania. Consequently, following the deadline {{for the implementation of}} the Directive (i.e. 12 January 2007), all Schengen member states (as well as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus or Romania) are obliged to apply the same criteria in dealing with applications from third country nationals who wish to be admitted to their territory in order to study (namely that the applicant must have a valid travel document covering the duration of the stay, parental authorisation (if a minor), sickness insurance, not be regarded as a threat to public policy, security or health, and payment of the relevant fee).|$|E
50|$|At the Second Congress of the Third International, the Sinistra {{played a}} {{determinant}} role in stiffening the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission.</b> In so doing, {{at a time}} of continued and considerable social ferment, it hoped to bar admission to groups and parties whose acceptance of a revolutionary program and discipline would prove rhetorical and their actions detrimental, particularly if the postwar verve and revolutionary conditions receded, as was soon the case. In seeing the International as a true, authentic world party rather than a formal arithmetic summation of national parties, which later would be free to go on and “make politics” as each saw fit, of all the European communist groups the Sinistra was the clearest on the question of internationalism. Even as it was involved in founding a communist party in Italy, the Sinistra in the International stood for the reaffirmation of Marxism’s integrity and for an internationalism strategically and tactically binding the working classes of the West with the rebellious people of the East. It believed that a revolutionary communist party must seek the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie leading to the establishment of the class dictatorship as a bridge to a classless society. Strongly favoring internal discipline, it maintained that, within both the national parties and the International, obedience must rest on the voluntary acceptance and understanding of the revolutionary program by each and every adherent, and not on bossy compulsion.|$|E

50|$|In {{the event}} that the name and date of birth of the {{applicant}} matches any sexual offence record in the system, he/she is required to submit fingerprints to the RCMP for a physical confirmation. Criminal record check {{is an integral part of}} the process for obtaining security clearances regardless of level of access. Some provinces may require high-risk professions to be screened to ensure public safety. For example, the BC Ministry of Justice requires all healthcare professionals, practicum students in healthcare, childcare facilities staff and volunteers, school and hospital staff regardless of position to undergo a CRC via the Criminal Records Review Program.

50|$|In 1610 he {{was invited}} to join the elite Confrerie of Romanists, a society of Antwerp humanists and artists. A <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> was that the member had {{travelled}} to Rome. The diversity and high positions held by the Confrerie's membership offered him a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons. He was elected the dean of the painter's chamber of the Guild in 1611. Vrancx was a member and district head of the local civil militia from 1613 onwards and was in 1626 asked by the Antwerp mayor to serve a five-year term as the captain of the militia in return for a complete exemption from taxes and municipal services. The position entitled Vrancx to carry a sword. It was in a vigorous pose with a sword on his side that he was portrayed by Anthony van Dyck.|$|R
