40|$|In 2011, the Malaysian {{government}} has announced the implementation <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> accounting system {{as part of}} the national agenda. Following the announcement, the Accountants General Department (AGD) of Malaysia has been appointed as the agency to head and responsible for the implementation <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> accounting system in the public sector. The shift from cash basis accounting to accrual accounting represents the fiscal management change in the Malaysian public sector.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of operating cycle on the differential persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> and cash flow, and the market reaction to the different components of earnings across firms with various operating cycles. Design/methodology/approach – By examining the US public firms' earnings and the capital market reaction to different components of earnings, from 1964 to 1993, it is found that the longer the operating cycle, the lesser will be the persistent <b>of</b> <b>accruals.</b> Findings – This result is consistent with Sloan's theory that the differential persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> is attributable to estimation errors in accruals. Moreover, the market efficiency test shows that the mispricing <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> is greater for firms with longer operating cycle, indicating that investors fixate on earnings, while ignoring the persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> among firms with different earnings quality. Originality/value – This paper adds to the growing literature that has begun to examine the factors affecting accrual persistence and accrual mispricing by indicating that the length of operating cycle can play a role. In addition, it provides fresh evidence that the market fixates on earnings, thus emphasizing the importance of contextual analysis of financial statement.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Accountancy. The first essay, "Inter-temporal accrual persistence and accrual anomaly" investigates whether accrual persistence and accrual anomaly vary with the state of economy. Prior accounting research argues that diminishing marginal returns on new investments drive lower persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> relative to cash flows. Macroeconomic research documents that marginal profitability is counter-cyclical, which implies that diminishing marginal returns on new investments are more pronounced during periods of expansions than recessions. Linking the cyclicality of diminishing returns on investments with the argument that diminishing returns to investments contribute to lower persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> relative to cash flows, this paper predicts that the differential persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> is greater during expansionary periods than recessionary periods. Using a U. S. sample from 1972 to 2003, I find that the differential persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals</b> is greater during economic expansions than recessions. When I focus on the components <b>of</b> <b>accruals,</b> I find that depreciation, change in accounts receivable, change in raw materials,and change in finished goods are the main drivers <b>of</b> cyclical differential <b>accrual</b> persistence. These findings are robust to alternative conditioning sets, estimation procedures, and measures of the business cycle. I also find that investors are unable to assess the cyclical differential persistence <b>of</b> <b>accruals,</b> leading to higher returns (both raw and abnormal returns) from an accrual-based trading strategy during expansionary periods. The second essay "Can cyclical property <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> persistence explain the accrual anomaly?" examines whether cyclical accrual persistence documented in the first essay can provide an explanation to accrual anomaly based on consumption based assets pricing theory. Specifically, I posit that accruals decrease in consumption risk because of cyclical property <b>of</b> <b>accrual</b> persistence (i. e., accruals are less persistent during economic expansions than during recessions). The implication is that the observed abnormal returns from accrual-trading strategy represent compensation for the underlying consumption risk. Using a U. S. sample from 1972 to 2003, I find that consumption risk decreases in the level <b>of</b> <b>accruals.</b> I also show that after controlling for other known risk factors, pricing kernel (a proxy for the state of economy) can explain about 11 percent of abnormal returns from accrual-based trading strategy. These findings are robust to alternative conditioning set and estimation procedures...|$|R
