Relations between Natchez and colonists were generally friendly—some Frenchmen even married and had children with Natchez women—but there were tensions.

A systematic analysis shows that <b>concession</b> period design involves the design of <b>concession</b> period structure {{as well as the}} determination of the <b>concession</b> period length. The <b>concession</b> period may have a single-period structure or a two-period structure; its length may be fixed or variable.

Through Monte Carlo simulation, this paper evaluates the mean net present value (NPV), variance and NPV-at-risk of different <b>concession</b> period structures, so that both the government and the concessionaires can understand their risk exposure and rewards.

Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Senator John McCain’s <b>concession</b> address {{from the}} 2008 United States Presidential election campaign. McCain’s <b>concession</b> speech was significant {{because of his}} come-from-behind victory in the Republican primary, the favorable critical responses to his speech, and his response to the historic nature of a person of color winning the presidential election. This study is also significant because it contributes to the small body of literature that examines <b>concession</b> addresses. This study examined how well McCain’s <b>concession</b> speech demonstrated the qualities associated with the genre, if McCain’s <b>concession</b> functioned as a model speech, and whether McCain’s <b>concession</b> might signal an evolution of the genre. The method used to critique McCain’s <b>concession</b> was generic application, using a combined framework of Chesebro and Hamsher’s (1974) and Ritter and Howell’s (1974) characteristics of the <b>concession</b> genre. This method entailed applying {{the characteristics of the}} <b>concession</b> genre to McCain’s speech to determine if the artifact constitutes a strong example of the genre. The study found that McCain’s speech demonstrated qualities associated with the genre of <b>concession</b> speeches well, functioning as a model because he utilized rhetorical techniques that were uniquely successful for him, and that scholars and practitioners of should be flexible in their application of the genre constraints associated with <b>concession</b> speeches.

40|$|<b>Concession</b> {{period is}} an {{important}} decision-making variable for the investment and construction of public infrastructure projects. However, we currently have few scientific methods to exactly determine the <b>concession</b> period. This paper managed to seek out <b>concession</b> period decision models for public infrastructure with option game theory, studied the influence of minimum government income guarantee and government investment on <b>concession</b> period, and demonstrated those models in the formulas mentioned in the paper. The research {{results showed that the}} increase of minimum government income guarantee value would shorten the <b>concession</b> period, while the increase of income volatility, that is, the uncertainty, would lengthen the <b>concession</b> period. In terms of government investment, optimal <b>concession</b> period would lengthen to some extent with the increase of government investment ratio and the income and the decrease of its guarantee value. Yet, optimal <b>concession</b> period would shorten in case of extreme highness of the government investment ratio due to its high guarantee value. And the government would accordingly shorten the <b>concession</b> period in case of the unchanged government investment ratio with the increased income volatility and risks. Still, the paper put forward the argument that the government would apply various guarantee methods and implement flexible <b>concession</b> period in accordance with the specific circumstances of public infrastructure projects...|$|R
