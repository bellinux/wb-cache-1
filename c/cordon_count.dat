40|$|In {{spite of}} the 1976 Central Area Plan, the Toronto Central Area still {{maintained}} {{its role as a}} major employment centre, and is likely to stay as the hub of increasing work trips generated throughout the Toronto region in the future. The principal task {{of this study is to}} analyze and measure the effects and impacts of population and housing intensification in the Toronto Central Area on travel demand during the morning peak period associated with this Toronto Central Area for the period 1975 - 90. The findings could prove to be a very valuable tool in managing growth and development in the Central Area. Detailed time series analysis from 1975 to 1989 is performed using the Metro <b>Cordon</b> <b>Count</b> data. A cross-sectional analysis for 1987 was also conducted using the 1987 Travel Diary Survey data. A simple travel demand model for the Central Area is developed to evaluate <b>Cordon</b> <b>Count</b> data...|$|E

This paper aimed to explain the variation in active travel into Glasgow, a post industrial city in the West of Scotland. Methods Census travel data from 2001 and data from a <b>cordon</b> <b>count</b> performed over 2 days in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were used to estimate the number of pedestrians and cyclists entering and leaving the city centre from four city sectors.

40|$|A dynamic transit trip {{assignment}} model {{developed for}} the operational planning of an existing metro system has the following salient features:(1) use a schedule-based network formulation to model the movement of trains; (2) use multi-interval assignment (15 -minutes duration for each time interval) to predict train loading; (3) assume a multivariable linear path cost model that includes in-vehicle time, waiting time, walking time and line change penalty; (4) divide passengers into different classes based on their route choice preferences; (5) calibrate the model using passenger boarding and alighting flows at station platforms; (6) validate the model using <b>cordon</b> <b>counts.</b> As a case study, the model {{is applied to the}} Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway network for a 4 -hour period from 6 a. m. to 10 a. m. The input data consists of full sample multi-interval station-to-station O-D trip matrices compiled from data retrieved from ticketing gates. Multi-class assignments for single period and multi-period are implemented and a calibration procedure estimates the proportion of different user classes of travelers to be assigned to the network...|$|R
40|$|This paper assesses whether two {{sustainability}} policies {{currently in}} effect in London, a congestion charge zone {{and a low}} emission zone, have affected freight operations and reduced vehicle kilometers travelled. It investigates responses by freight operators, including re-timing, re-routing, or {{reducing the number of}} trips, or replacing vehicles. Freight traffic trends from 1994 to 2012 were identified using road traffic estimates, <b>cordon</b> <b>counts,</b> and vehicle speed data and supplemented by interviews with freight industry experts and operators. Findings indicate that freight traffic increased throughout London during this timeframe, but declined in the central boroughs partly within the congestion charge zone. The congestion charge may have time-shifted some light goods trips, but most freight trips face a variety of constraints on operators’ delivery window. No evidence was found of re-routing of freight traffic or avoidance traffic around the charged zone. The low emission zone spurred higher levels of operational change than the congestion charge zone, and it was effective at spurring freight vehicle replacement. The paper also discusses freight operators’ perceptions of these policies and how they could be improved...|$|R

40|$|Assessments {{were made}} of the impacts on freight traffic and {{operations}} of two sustainability policies currently in effect in London, a congestion charge zone (CCZ) and a low emissions zone (LEZ). Responses by freight operators, including retiming, rerouting, {{reducing the number of}} trips and kilometers traveled, and replacing vehicles, was investigated. Trends from 1994 to 2012 were identified with the use of road traffic estimates, <b>cordon</b> <b>counts,</b> and vehicle speed data, supplemented by interviews with freight industry experts and operators. In this time frame, goods traffic increased throughout London but declined in the central CCZ. Findings indicate that freight traffic was largely insensitive to the congestion charge. Price elasticity of demand was estimated as −. 04 to −. 06 for light goods vehicles and as perfectly inelastic for medium and heavy goods vehicles in the long run. The congestion charge may have time-shifted some light goods vehicle trips. No evidence was found of rerouting of freight traffic or avoidance traffic around the CCZ. Freight operators likely benefited from travel time reductions and journey reliability improvements throughout Inner London, a wider area than the CCZ. Operational efficiencies may have been achieved through greater vehicle load consolidation but offset by the relocation of logistics depots and warehouses priced out of central London. The LEZ was effective at spurring vehicle replacement, including some substitution to smaller vehicles. Discussion recounts freight operators’ perceptions of these policies and how their concerns have been addressed...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{population}} estimates {{prepared by}} statistical agencies typically {{focus on the}} population resident in a given geographic area at a defined point in time, but in practice many locations undergo substantial daily, weekly and seasonal flux in population numbers. Such fluctuations exert wide-ranging impacts {{for goods and services}} in destination areas, such that increasing recognition is being given to the need for more refined estimates that capture these 2 ̆ 7 service populations 2 ̆ 7. While a number of methods have been proposed to count visitors or estimate temporary populations, systematic testing has been limited, and the evidence suggests that no single methodology is effective at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This paper utilises a hybrid approach which couples <b>cordon</b> <b>counts</b> based on multiple technologies with administrative data and an on-line survey to estimate the daily, weekly and seasonal fluctuation in the population of a large Australian metropolitan University campus. Our results trace {{the rise and fall of}} the campus population over the course of the day, identify the scale and duration of the peak, and show how population numbers vary from day to day and over the course of the teaching semester. We track aggregate flows to and from Campus by mode of travel and find they significantly exceed the on-campus population peak, underlining its sensitivity to timetabling of classes and other events. We also identify strong correlations between data sources which assist in validating the estimates and, together with evolving technologies, offer potential avenues for substantial cost saving in future estimations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{relative}} accuracy of five methods for estimating external trip generation of mixed use development through comparison to <b>cordon</b> traffic <b>counts.</b> The five methods include the procedure {{described in the}} ITE Trip Generation Handbook, state-of-practice travel forecast models, the results {{of research on the}} travel effects of built environment, known as the 5 D’s, and combinations of these techniques. The findings, based on case studies of three mixed-use areas of varying size and mix, suggest that application of 5 D adjustments improves the accuracy of both the ITE procedures and travel forecast models when estimating external trip generation of mixed use development. Introduction and Background There is currently a considerable amount of attention being focused on Smart Growth by the public, land developers, planners, policy makers and elected officials. The reasons range from a desire to obtain the greatest economic yield from an acre of developable land, to the need to optimize the utility of existing efficient transportation infrastructure, to a desire to emphasiz...|$|R
40|$|A common {{question}} asked in current travel behaviour research is whether investment in sustainable travel leads to {{significant changes in}} travel behaviour and awareness? In this large-scale study, {{we looked at the}} preliminary impact of UK Central Government funding to encourage sustainable modes of transport as implemented by three regional transport authorities and local councils through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF). The evaluation method was predominantly quantitative, the main component being a longitudinal postal cohort survey. The survey was conducted in five treatment areas that were the subject of local LSTF-funded transport interventions, which included physical infrastructure upgrades as well as softer measures: a town in Leicestershire; two districts in South Hampshire, and two districts of Greater Manchester. In addition, {{in each of the three}} regions, surveys were undertaken in control (or comparison) areas that had not received such interventions. The survey tool comprised a self-completion questionnaire covering respondents’ awareness and usage of various land-based transport modes, including a seven-day travel diary. The initial survey was conducted in December 2013 /Spring 2014 (with the after survey a year later - to follow), and the results compared against identical surveys in the three similar demographic control areas in the three regions. Over 64, 000 questionnaires were distributed, which gave rise to a response rate of over 13 %, from which nearly 6, 800 completed or partially completed records were obtained and analysed. An age-weighting was applied to the travel diary data, to account for the variation in the sample versus the demography of the local populations, and the results analysed according to five different travel purposes, using guidance from the UK’s Department for Transport, the project sponsor. The data from this 2013 / 14 survey suggests there are already small effects arising from the LSTF interventions, particularly from public transport interchange improvements, bus priority measures, demand responsive transport and improved cycling infrastructure. The level of awareness for these schemes is higher in the treatment areas than the control areas, and this is reflected in the travel diary data, which suggests respondents from the treatment areas tend to travel shorter distances per round trip on average, with a significant greater proportion being conducted by bus, and less as car driver. This study also shows the potential of collecting large datasets across different sources for travel behaviour analysis; however further research, including comparisons with <b>cordon</b> <b>counts</b> and results from the follow-on survey, need to be conducted before more substantive conclusions can be drawn...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for forecasting cyclist volume and route choice based on space syntax techniques for urban analysis. Space syntax {{has been shown}} to correlate strongly with pedestrian and vehicular trips in a number of international studies, but little research to date has focused on the role of urban form and street network design in cyclist route choice. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the distribution of cycling trips in the central London area, focusing on a sample of work-based commuting trips. A sample of 423 cyclists from 50 organizations was combined with <b>cordon</b> volume <b>counts</b> at several Central London locations. It was found that individual cycle trips were subject {{to a wide range of}} variables that made individual traces difficult to predict, but that total cyclist volumes corresponded strongly with the most accessible, direct streets in the urban network. This research suggests that angular minimization is an important factor in cyclist route choice and that measurement of least angle routes in urban environments can be a useful way of predicting cyclist volumes and route choice. Such techniques have the potential to save planners and policymakers the expense of performing origin destination studies and may offer a useful tool for cyclist volume prediction. volume counts, London pedestrian and cycle safety...|$|R
40|$|This paper dicusses {{the parking}} demand and {{supply in the}} central {{district}} of Nana. Occupylng only 5. 4 per cent, or 200 ha., of the total planned area of the city, the district is most heavily populated {{in the city and}} busiest in comercial activities all over Okinawa. Most of the important streets originate or cross the district. As of September of 1966, surveys were carried out to find out 1) available parking spaces in the district of which curb parking and parking lots were the main sources, 2) characteristics in the use of parking lots, and 3) number of vehicles stored in the district during the day time on an average weekday,Saturday, and Sunday. <b>Cordon</b> <b>counts</b> were performed at eighteen locations distributed along the circumference of the district. The locations are shown by triangles in Fig. 1. Important results from the surveys are shown in the figures and tables presented elsewhere in this paper of which Fig. 1, Fig. 4, Fig. 5,T able 1, and Table 2 are of more importance. Some of the important conclusions drawn from the discussion in this paper are listed in the following. 1) As of September of 1966, there were about thirty to fourty parking lots in the city all of which run by private owners. There was no slngle parking garage or parking lots operated by any govermental organization. 2) parking spaces available in the thirty-four parking lots studied were about 29, 230 square metres or 1183 in vehicle number, of which 754 were in the district. Spaces available for curb parking in the district were 2074 in vehicle number. 3) Parking demands on a weekday, Saturday, and Sunday were found as follows. (表については省略) 4) Comparison between the parking demands and the spaces available in the district as stated above indicates that the district has enough parking spaces. 5) However. due to increasing traffic regulations and the presence of unbalance between geological distribution of demand and supply, it seems difficult to expect that all of the available curb parking apaces in the district are or will be used effectively. It is the writer's belief that to bring good balance between them not only in the district concerned, but also in the city as a whole it is a must of today for govermental functions to establish a parking plan which is well integrated in a comprehensive traffic plan for the city. Above conclusions were derived based on the specific conditions and limitations described in the paper. therefore any one who would refer to any part of the conclusions is expected to understand those conditions and limitations and not to use them beyond the range wherein the study is valid...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{batches of}} a stuffed pasta product, tortellini, and {{slightly}} pre-fried breaded reconstituted turkey steaks {{with cheese and}} ham filling, Cordon Bleu, were prepared according to commercial recipes, then inoculated with 104 CFU/g of Staphylococcus aureus (in case of tortellini) and with 106 CFU/g of Listeria monocytogenes (in case of Cordon Bleu) prior to packing in plastic bags under a gas atmosphere of 20 % CO 2 and 80 % N 2. The inoculated packages were irradiated at 3 kGy (tortellini) and 2 kGy (Cordon Bleu) with a 60 Co radiation source. The applied radiation doses were sensorially acceptable for these products. The experimental batches of tortellini were stored at 15 °C, while the Cordon Bleu samples were stored at 5 and 9 °C. Unirradiated samples were kept together with the respective irradiated ones. Storage was continued for 4 weeks and microbiological tests were performed {{before and after the}} irradiation, and subsequently after every seven days. Besides selective estimation of the counts of the test organisms, total aerobic counts were evaluated in all samples and in case of <b>Cordon</b> Bleu, colony <b>counts</b> of lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, sulphite reducing clostridia, yeasts and moulds were also selectively estimated. The 3 -kGy dose reduced the S. aureus count in tortellini below the detection limit (logCFU= 0. 26), and it remained undetectably low in the irradiated samples during all 28 days of storage, while the S. aureus count in the unirradiated samples increased up to 108 CFU/g during 8 days. The Listeria <b>count</b> in <b>Cordon</b> Bleu was reduced by irradiation from the initial count of 6. 1 to 3. 5 logCFU/g. At 5 °C storage, this residual count remained stagnant up to 3 – 4 weeks, but started to increase at 9 °C after one week of storage. In the unirradiated samples, the Listeria count increased hundred-fold during 4 weeks at 5 °C, and during 2 weeks at 9 °C. Sulphite reducing clostridia were, and remained, undetectable (< 0. 48 logCFU/g) in all samples even at 9 °C. The limiting factor of the shelf-life of the unirradiated poultry products was the growth of lactic acid bacteria at 9 °C, whereas enhanced lipid oxidation was an unwanted side-effect of radiation treatment. From these studies it can be concluded that the potential risk posed by the investigated non-sporeforming pathogenic bacteria could be considerably reduced by gamma irradiation, however, storage temperature remains a crucial factor of safety and methods should be developed to counteract the lipid-oxidative effect of the radiation processing...|$|R
