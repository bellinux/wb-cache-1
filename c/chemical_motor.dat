2500|$|Mitochondria hyperpolarization is a {{key event}} in {{initiating}} changes in morphology. Intraplatelet calcium concentration increases, stimulating the interplay between microtubule/actin filament complex. The continuous changes in shape from the unactivated to the fully activated platelet is best seen on scanning electron microscopy. Three steps along this path are named early dendritic, early spread and spread. The surface of the unactivated platelet looks {{very similar to the}} surface of the brain, with a wrinkled appearance from numerous shallow folds to increase the surface area; early dendritic, an octopus with multiple arms and legs; early spread, an uncooked frying egg in a pan, the [...] "yolk" [...] being the central body; and the spread, a cooked fried egg with a denser central body. These changes are all brought about by the interaction of the microtubule/actin complex with the platelet cell membrane and open canalicular system (OCS), which is an extension and invagination of that membrane. This complex runs just beneath these membranes, and is the <b>chemical</b> <b>motor</b> which literally pulls the invaginated OCS out of the interior of the platelet like turning pants pockets inside out, creating the dendrites. and then spreads each dendrite until the entire OCS becomes indistinguishable from the initial platelet membrane as it forms the [...] "fried egg". This dramatic increase in surface area comes about with neither stretching nor adding phospholipids to the platelet membrane.|$|E

40|$|Some {{results of}} non-equilibrium {{statistical}} mechanics are presented,both {{in the context}} of biological systems as well as in a classicalphysics context. In the biological context we seek the microscopicperspective as well as the macroscopic perspective. The physics contextis sought mainly as a test case and reference for development ofgeneralized perturbation or expansion techniques. Kinesin Concerningthe microscopic perspective we present a model for kinesin, a molecularmotor responsible for many important cellular processes that requirework. Kinesin is capable of transforming chemically stored energy intowork through a series of chemical and conformational changes, steppingalong microtubules (a biochemical polymer that structures cells) as its`rails'. Our approach to model this motor enzyme is to consider thespatial-chemical states as states of a Markov process, modelling therates as exchanges of mass and entropy with thermal and chemical (orparticle) reservoirs of the environment. Due to translationalinvariance of the process we need only describe a single steppingcycle. Under some additional assumptions (based on experiments) we mayfurther reduce the state space until we arrive at a model consisting ofsix states that are well defined. The model describes theexperimentally observed behavior of kinesin well. The thermoelectric effect Wepresent a interacting particle model for the thermoelectric effect. This leads to some insight in the working of temperature gradients asthermodynamic forces. On the other hand it provides us with apossibility to investigate perturbations beyond the linear regime. Perturbation and generalized fluctuation relations Nextwe argue that [...] in spite of its general validity [...] the fluctuationtheorem is not useful to obtain higher order response coefficients. Byintroducing the notion of field-reversal we provide the(time-) symmetrical equivalent of the fluctuation theorem as acomplementary relation. We then argue that a generalized form of thefluctuation theorem (derived by making use of field-reversal only),combines these fluctuation relations in order to derive responsecoefficients up to any given order (and consequently not necessarily byperturbing around equilibrium). These arguments are strengthenedthrough a more explicit derivation of these relations {{in the context of}}Markov processes and further elucidated with help of some examples. Models for DEB theory Atthe end we venture into the macroscopic perspective with help of DEBtheory, a biological theory describing mass and energy flows forindividual organisms. We present two different models that investigatethe possibility of a relatively simple underlying local dynamics. Firstwe propose a simple type of chemical reaction model [...] a caricature of arealistic chemical reaction system [...] without any kind of geometricalstructure. This model describes the dynamics for V 1 -morphs (organismswhose surface area grows as their volume) according to DEB theory withonly a single free parameter. Then, in order to describe the dynamicsfor isomorphs, we propose a "wire" model that takes the geometricalstructure of the organism into account, in order to obtain coincidencewith the dynamics dictated by DEB theory.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{chemical}} dynamics requires understanding {{the effect of}} time-dependent transition rates between states of chemo-mechanical molecular configurations.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of a focal firm, and its partners' local {{alliance}} actions, on the creation of technological innovations by the former. More specifically, we study how two types of redundancy in a focal firm's ego network affect its ability to create new technologies in its technology core areas (exploitation) and/or non-core areas (exploration). We analyse this empirically in three different industry settings: <b>chemicals,</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles, and pharmaceuticals. One of our key findings is that individual firms can indeed boost both types of innovative output by shaping the degree of redundancy in their local alliance network, but that the way in which this should be done differs between the creation of core and non-core technologies. Next, we find that it is very useful to unpack the rather abstract notion of redundancy into more specific types of redundancy in ego networks. Overall, these findings reflect an action-oriented view on the role of individual firms in collaborative networks, which may complement the dominant view in the alliance literature emphasizing the role of the overall network structure and firms' network position within it.

The observed POA was characterized by number of carbon atoms (NC), number of double bond equivalents (NDBE) and degree of molecular branching.

The gas chromatography retention time data indicates that the cycloalkane ring structures are most likely dominated by cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings and not larger cycloalkanes. High molecular weight combustion byproducts, that is, alkenes, oxygenates, and aromatics, were not present in significant amounts.

2500|$|The Arab-Israeli {{war ended}} on 10 March 1949 with a decisive Israeli victory. On 6 February 1950, King Farouk of Egypt issued a decree under which manifests and cargoes of ships could be searched {{to ensure that}} no [...] "war contraband" [...] was present on vessels bound {{directly}} or indirectly for Israel. War contraband included arms, munitions, and war material. However, article 10 additionally stipulated that other goods were to be considered [...] "contraband" [...] and were to be treated as war material — ships, <b>chemicals,</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles, money, gold, and fuel of any kind. At the time 90% of Israeli oil was supplied by Iran and imported through the Straits of Tiran. To prevent Iranian oil from entering Israel, Egypt blockaded the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba. Oil tankers proceeding through the Suez Canal were required to submit documentation to guarantee none of their cargo would arrive at an Israeli port. To enforce the policy of denying strategic goods to Israel, the decree authorized {{the use of force against}} any ship attempting to avoid search, including live gunfire, to make it submit to inspection. If a ship were to subsequently allow a search and reveal that they were not carrying any [...] "contraband", the ship would be allowed to continue its voyage. However, if the ship resisted a search by force, it would be considered to have violated its neutrality. For this [...] "hostile act", ships were to be seized and their cargo impounded even if they were not found to possess any [...] "contraband". Ships found or suspected to transgress the Egyptian shipping practices delineated in this decree were blacklisted by Egypt and denied free use of the Suez Canal. The decree of February 1950 signaled a shift in the policy of the Arab League. The boycott's immediate purpose had originally been to prevent direct Arab trade with Israel (called a primary boycott). With this decree the boycott was expanded to the interruption of international trade with Israel (a secondary boycott).
