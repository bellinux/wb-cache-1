This has been {{extended}} also to Escherichia coli {{in the form of}} a stable <b>cointegrate</b> with the wide-host-range plasmid R 772. Its structure was studied by constructing a physical map of R 772 and of the R 772 ::pTiB 6 <b>cointegrate.</b> An insertion sequence present in R 772, called IS 70, turned out to be involved in <b>cointegrate</b> formation. We found one intact copy of IS 70 and a small segment of IS 70, respectively, at the junctions of R 772 and Ti DNA. The absence of a complete second copy of IS 70 is a likely explanation for the stability of the <b>cointegrate</b> plasmid. A procedure for site-directed mutagenesis of this <b>cointegrate</b> plasmid in E. coli is described.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{technique}} which uses the <b>cointegrate</b> intermediate of transposon Tn 1000 transposition {{as a means}} to lower the copy number of ColE 1 -type plasmids. The transposition of Tn 1000 from one replicon to another is considered a two-step process. In the first step, the transposon-encoded TnpA protein mediates fusion of the two replicons to produce a <b>cointegrate.</b> In the second step, the <b>cointegrate</b> is resolved by site-specific recombination between the two transposon copies to yield the final transposition products: the target replicon with an integrated transposon plus the regenerated donor replicon. Using in vitro techniques, the DNA sequence of the Tn 1000 transposon was altered so that <b>cointegrate</b> formation occurs but resolution by the site-specific recombination pathway is blocked. When this transposon was resident on an F factor-derived plasmid, a <b>cointegrate</b> was formed between a multicopy ColE 1 -type target plasmid and the conjugative F plasmid. Conjugational transfer of this <b>cointegrate</b> into a polA strain resulted in a stable <b>cointegrate</b> in which replication from the ColE 1 plasmid origin was inhibited and replication proceeded only from the single-copy F factor replication origin. We assayed isogenic strains which harbored plasmids encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to measure the copy number of such F factor-ColE 1 -type <b>cointegrate</b> plasmids and found that the copy number was decreased to the level of single-copy chromosomal elements.

The structures of both the simple transposition products and the cointegrates formed in a recA- background seem to be the same as those produced in a recA+ background.

40|$|CS 1 is the {{prototype}} of a class of pili of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) associated with diarrheal disease in humans. The genes encoding this pilus are carried on a large plasmid, pCoo. We report the sequence of the complete 98, 396 -bp plasmid. Like many other virulence plasmids, pCoo is a mosaic consisting of regions derived from multiple sources. Complete and fragmented insertion sequences (IS) make up 24 % of the total DNA and are scattered throughout the plasmid. The pCoo DNA between these IS elements has {{a wide range of}} G+C content (35 to 57 %), suggesting that these regions have different ancestries. We find that the pCoo plasmid is a <b>cointegrate</b> of two functional replicons, related to R 64 and R 100, which are joined at a 1, 953 -bp direct repeat of IS 100. Recombination between these repeats in the <b>cointegrate</b> generates the two smaller replicons which coexist with the <b>cointegrate</b> in the culture. Both of the smaller replicons have plasmid stability genes as well as genes that may be important in pathogenesis. Examination by PCR of 17 other unrelated CS 1 ETEC strains with a variety of serotypes demonstrated that all contained at least parts of both replicons of pCoo and that strains of the O 6 genotype appear to contain a <b>cointegrate</b> very similar to pCoo.

These modeling issues are manifest in all applied work {{but they are}} particularly acute in multivariate time series settings such as <b>cointegrated</b> systems where multiple interconnected decisions can materially affect {{the form of the}} model and its interpretation. In <b>cointegrated</b> system modeling, empirical estimation typically proceeds in a stepwise manner that involves the determination of <b>cointegrating</b> rank and autoregressive lag order in a reduced rank vector autoregression followed by estimation and inference. This paper proposes an automated approach to <b>cointegrated</b> system modeling that uses adaptive shrinkage techniques to estimate vector error correction models with unknown <b>cointegrating</b> rank structure and unknown transient lag dynamic order. These methods enable simultaneous order estimation of the <b>cointegrating</b> rank and autoregressive order in conjunction with oracle-like efficient estimation of the <b>cointegrating</b> matrix and transient dynamics. As such they offer considerable advantages to the practitioner as an automated approach to the estimation of <b>cointegrated</b> systems.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{plasmids}} which cannot replicate in Escherichia coli {{have been}} used to introduce specific modifications into the E. coli chromosome by homologous recombination (2 ̆ 7 gene targeting 2 ̆ 7). The E. coli gene (gpt) encoding guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Gpt) was used for initial targeting studies owing to the availability of a powerful positive selection for loss of the Gpt+ phenotype (6 -thioguanine resistance or 6 TGR or Gpt-). P. aeruginosa plasmids containing selectable markers flanked by gpt sequences were introduced as supercoiled DNA into an E. coli strain which contained a normal gpt locus. Primary cointegration of such plasmids into the E. coli genome results in a gene duplication event which maintains Gpt function; a secondary recombinational event which resolves the <b>cointegrate</b> either reverses the primary event or results in replacement of the original gpt copy with the modified version. A 316 -bp region of homology was sufficient for <b>cointegrate</b> formation, and resolution of the cointegrates through a shorter (92 bp) homologous flank was selectable through loss of Gpt function. The frequency of <b>cointegrate</b> resolution under these conditions was significantly above the spontaneous gpt mutational loss rate...|$|E

The recipient was the polA amber mutant JG 112, in which RSF 2124 cannot replicate. Ampicillin-resistant transconjugants can arise only when the genes for ampicillin resistance are linked to NR 1 or are transposed to the host chromosome. When EcoRI fragment A of NR 1 (20. 5 kilobases) was cloned to RSF 2124, the frequency of cotransfer of ampicillin resistance with tetracycline resistance was 25 to 60 %. Plasmid DNA from these ampicillin-resistant transconjugant cells was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and was {{shown to be a}} <b>cointegrate</b> of NR 1 and the RSF 2124 derivative. Analysis of plasmid DNA isolated from donor cultures showed that the cointegrates were present before conjugation, which indicates that the mating does not stimulate <b>cointegrate</b> formation. When the cloned fragment was EcoRI fragment H of NR 1 (4. 8 kilobases), the frequency of cotransfer of ampicillin resistance with tetracycline resistance was about 4 %, and the majority of the ampicillin-resistant transconjugants were found to contain <b>cointegrate</b> plasmids. When the donor contained NR 1 and RSF 2124, the frequency of cotransfer of ampicillin resistance was less than 0. 1 %, and analysis of plasmid DNA from the ampicillin-resistant transconjugants showed that Tn 3 had been transposed onto NR 1.

Each interplasmid transposition resulted in the fusion of the donor and acceptor plasmids into <b>cointegrate</b> structure, with a 9 -bp duplication of the target DNA at the insertion site. <b>Cointegrate</b> formation was abolished in δrecA strains, although simple insertions of IS 10 were observed. This suggests a two-stage mechanism involving IS 10 conservative transposition, followed by homologous recombination between the donor and the acceptor. Two plasmids carrying inactive IS 10 sequences were fused to cointegrates at a 100 -fold lower frequency, suggesting that homologous recombination is coupled to and stimulated by the transposition event. Each IS 10 transposition from the chromosome to the acceptor plasmid involved replicon fusion, providing a mechanism for IS 10 -mediated integration of extrachromosomal elements into the chromosome.
