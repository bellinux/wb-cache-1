40|$|This study {{presents}} a diagnostic analysis of how {{two types of}} governance structures (water user associations versus <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> institutions) at Hubei, issue their impacts on local irrigation governance and management, to produce a collective action outcome in irrigation systems. In particular, it focuses on (1) at the meso level, institutional analyses of irrigation management incorporate physical, community, and institutional attributes, and their interactions to configure possible pathways to collective outcomes within Hubei’s settings, and (2) at the micro level, the underlying mechanisms that offer individuals incentives to cooperate {{with each other for}} irrigation activities. Drawing upon a theoretical debate about rationales for promoting or limiting the establishment and development of water user associations, and empirical puzzling phenomena observed in Central China, three research hypotheses are posited accordingly. Determinants of collective outcomes in local irrigation governance and management are highlighted from irrigation literature. Employing Elinor Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development Framework, an analytical framework exploring irrigation governance patterns in Central China is introduced. A mixed research method is applied in this study. At the meso level, 32 irrigation systems are selected to run a Qualitative Comparative Analysis; at the micro level, four irrigation systems are identified out for an in-depth comparative case study. In the end, three pathways to collective action, and four pathways to water adequacy, are generalized respectively. Evidence from 32 irrigation systems in central China indicates that both WUA-managed <b>irrigation</b> systems and <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems have the capacity to organize <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> activities successfully in local settings. For one thing, WUA {{is only one of the}} many factors affecting collective outcomes, and that the impact of WUA really depends on how it is nested within the larger configuration of factors; thus, challenging the belief of many government officials and analysts that WUA institution is a panacea for irrigation problems. For the other, <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems could also achieve collective action, if attributes configured appropriately. This demonstrates that <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> institution, in and of itself, is not automatically malign; given this, moves towards participatory governance do not necessarily render traditional hierarchical government interventions obsolete. Last but not least, this study also identifies a third governance institution, namely, the lineage group. Findings indicate that as informal solidary entities, lineage groups have important contributions to rural governance, as long as they are nested within the appropriate attributes configurations. Referring to the pathways to water adequacy, it is found that the emergence of collective action alone does not necessarily translate into water adequacy at the tail end of the irrigation systems. The four case studies not only entail some pathways to collective action, but also exemplify complicated and diverse reasons that might lead to collective failures. Comparing the successful cases with the failure ones, boundary rules, position rules, choice rules, and payoff rules explain the systematic differences at the operational level, while information rules, aggregation rules, and scope rules that operate at the collective level, appear to have minimal effect here. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

It reveals that high irrigation costs are progressively excluding the poor, who are unable to generate a cash income from other activities they need to fund irrigation. In addition, the operation of collective schemes involving the poor is being jeopardized by the development of private irrigation schemes, which benefit from hidden subsidies appropriated by local elites. This results in unequal access to irrigation, which can cause resentment at community level. This weakens community cohesiveness, as well as communities' capacities for collective action and coordination, which are crucial for <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, {{water has}} been {{subjected}} to different commodification and de-collectivization processes. Increasingly, this is also affecting <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> water management. Critical analysis of this privatization and de-collectivization wave in the irrigation sector has mainly focused on neoliberal institutional policies and market-oriented legislation. However, subtly and silently but equally determinant, the adoption of water-saving technologies is fostering the penetration of private enterprise and market-based governance into these hydro-social settings. This paper discusses this phenomenon through a case study of the community of Senyera in Valencia, Spain, tracking the privatization and subsequent contestation and re-takeover of water management by irrigation system users. The article shows how privatization removes users’ autonomy in the name of common well-being, and increases irrigation costs in a context of little transparency. But the case also highlights users’ capacity to re-value and re-signify their past collective action, remembering and ‘re-membering to’ the collective. Senyera water users critically and reflexively analyse privatization, reconstruct societal relationships around and embedded inside the new technology, and re-collectivize and re-moralize irrigation management in a new hydro-social scenario...|$|R

Our results indicated that under conditions of improved water rights, preference for volumetric pricing increases, whilst the presence of a Water Users Association reduces this preference. Furthermore, it was found that using an appropriate combination of water demand management tools considerably increases the willingness to pay for a change in scenario.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the connection between management of canal (gravity) irrigation and farmers’ social behavior. From this perspective, we examine the benefits of a rural canal irrigation project, based on our hypothesis that social behaviors of local farmers are influenced by the availability of canal irrigation due to the <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> management required in irrigated societies. The present paper (1) measures social behavior through behavioral game experiments, and (2) estimates the effects of irrigation, neighborhood, as well as individual characteristics. Drawing on the results of dictator game and ultimatum game as the dependent variables, with a household survey on 245 villagers in the province of Bohol, the Philippines, we employ the HLM (Hierarchical Linear Modeling) method which was originally designed to explore neighborhood effects and social contexts. To date, the model has provided quantitative analyses of the latter. Yet, it has not been fully utilized for neighborhood effects studies. Our regression result shows that the level of measured social behavior is fairly associated with 1) access to irrigation water in the village, 2) other neighborhood characteristics (e. g., village-level averages of schooling years, asset, and yield) 3) household’s socioeconomic and agricultural characteristics (e. g., household-level schooling years, asset, and yield). The result indicates that the availability of irrigation water in the village does not only improve agricultural productivity but also enhances social relationship among farmers, which would add to the importance of irrigation investment in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{transcription}} of the 2000 ’s European Water Framework Directive in France has led {{to define}} maximum volumes that can be abstracted in water bodies. In many French contexts, it requires reducing more or less drastically current water consumption, especially in agriculture where farmers were granted permits by the water policy authority, regardless the real level of water availability. To do so, French water law imposes, where water bodies are structurally in water scarcity, to create irrigation associations charged to share available water between farmers. And the challenge is particularly high in the groundwater case, where farmers are not embedded in <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> schemes. Sharing rules have then to be designed from the ground up. This communication presents and critics the way that innovative management instruments were explored in six cases’ studies representative {{of the diversity of}} agricultural products and hydrogeological situations. These instruments were debated during 18 foresight workshops held with institutional representatives (50) and farmers (87). Foresight workshops had the advantages to make credible institutional and resource changes, and to retrieve from current but side-debates. In five cases, researchers took the lead of these workshops, and in the last one it was directly carried by a stakeholder (an Agriculture Chamber), which allows to test the transferability of such a method in real context with a direct implementing goal. Lessons are drawn at several levels. Firstly, debating on contrasted scenarios is a robust way to facilitate discussions on something not implemented yet in France. Secondly, the context highly matters, in particular the perception of the reality of groundwater scarcitylevel. Thirdly, to debate on groundwater management tools has to be firstly embedded in a more general discussion, on the future of agriculture or at least on more broadly water challenges (like in terms of quantity and quality) ...|$|R

30|$|The {{previous}} agent-based {{model by}} Heim et al. (2018) revealed spatial-economic inequalities. This study extends the previous model to include socio-economic drivers of land-settlement such as tribal affiliation and clan-formation. Both scenarios developed with the extended agent-based model reveal that clan-formation is inevitable {{under the current}} system. A trade-off can be observed between social mix or segregation within clans and efficient land-allocation to clan members. Spatial mixing, as the process of clan-formation, is further constrained by the urgency of individuals to actually settle down, build a home and start a family (compare Scholz 1990; Belgacem 2011; Al Gharibi 2014; Benkari 2017; Shouman 2017). This life-changing decision blocks the mobility of a plot-owner for a long time. For the model, this means that once the initial plots have been settled, {{there seem to be}} not enough matching opportunities to create a competitive market. Thus, the following phases cannot accommodate trades motivated by tribal affiliation explicitly, yet also not exclude them totally. The study suggests that Oman is closer to the metaphorical ‘salad bowl’ described by Belgacem (2011) as ‘segregationist division’, where tribal groups might get relocated but not dissolved, than the ‘melting pot’. Incidentally, the land-allocation system strengthens the tribal power on a local level and forms a third aspect contrary to the intended purposes of the land-allocation system a striking parallel to Wilkinson (1977) central thesis that a “tribally organised population running a <b>collective</b> <b>irrigation</b> (and spatial distribution) system cannot emerge under a centralised state” (additions by the authors). Taking limitless mobility of the clan members into account, the simulation tests all desired properties, which would require excessive coordination between clans and individuals in real life. Clan-formation will thus never reach absolute states as described by the model, but gradually slows down, a further indication why the process is hard to back by empirical data, but is a recurring subject among younger Omanis that suffer from the impossibility to access the real-estate market. The simulation results confirm that emergent urban phenomena such as partial settlement, land speculation and spatial mobility can be linked to.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors {{influencing}} {{the decline in}} collective management of local commons {{and the impact of}} this decline on agricultural production and household consumption. The analysis is based on a village and household data set collected in 1999 in Tamil Nadu, India, where tank irrigation systems are managed collectively for rice cultivation by informal water users' organizations. Our statistical analyses find that one major reason for the decline in <b>collective</b> tank <b>irrigation</b> management is the dissemination of private well irrigation systems. Once the decline has occurred, our analyses predict that the gap in rice yields between farmers who have access to private wells and those who must rely solely on tanks will widen, with only the latter group suffering lower yields. Our analyses also find that the same pattern holds for levels of income and consumption because the affected farmers cannot sufficiently compensate for the loss of their rice income by diversifying their income sources to agricultural labor or nonagricultural work. In this way, the decline in collective management results in greater inequality and poverty. Copyright 2007 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|R
40|$|AB Provision of {{irrigation}} has been {{thought to be}} crucial in improving the livelihoods of millions of tribals in Central belt of India, who are locked in perpetual poverty. Green Revolution Technology, which {{has been at the}} heart of India?s agricultural development, has more or less bypassed the tribal population. For one, irrigation infrastructure is inadequate in the tribal regions and again when irrigation infrastructure is made available, the tribals do not seem to make adequate use of them. Creating demand for irrigation among the tribal farmers seems to be most important challenge. It is in this backdrop that we undertook our case study in a tribal dominated block of Gujarat. Unlike the other tribal dominated areas Jharkhand and Chattisgarh), the tribals in our study area were third generation farmers and therefore they faced no cognitive barriers in adopting irrigated agriculture. They are also as skilled a farmer as any other, which is reflected by {{the fact that there are}} no discernable yield differences between a tribal and a non-tribal farmer. We studied four canal irrigation schemes, which have been all turned over to the farmers at the behest of AKRSP (I) ?s intervention. All these four schemes are tribal dominated, some of them are completely so, others have a handful of non-tribal population. The schemes we studied were Pingot RBMC, Baldeva LBMC, Pingot LBMC and Issar Minor Irrigation scheme. Our results confirm that irrigated agriculture has brought about tremendous benefits to a tribal farmer in the form of yield increases, higher cropping intensity, lower out migration and higher wage rates within the village. The trajectory of change for a typical tribal farming has been from cultivating local paddy in Kharif and migrating in Rabi and summer to cultivating hybrid paddy in kharif and irrigated groundnut or moong in summer. Irrigated agriculture has become central to their livelihoods and this in part explains why Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) has been more or less successful here. However, the non-tribal farmers have benefited more from PIM than tribal farmers, because they shifted to very lucrative sugarcane farming. The non-tribals (Patels) have also played a significant role in these <b>irrigation</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in that they have provided the much needed ?demonstration effect? of profitability of irrigated agriculture. AKRSP (I) ?s role as facilitator of PIM in Pingot RBMC and Baldeva LBMC has been acclaimed nationally. But we propose that the success of these two schemes lies in the creation of Pingot LBMC society, where tribal farmers came forward on their own and formed irrigation society to take over management of the canal system. The very fact that an all-tribal farmer group could successfully replicate PIM experiment in Gujarat that was started with Pingot RBMC and Baldeva LBMC is a proof enough for the success of PIM as a whole. We also propose that in the long term, the sustainability of PIM will depend on the overall profitability of irrigated agriculture and therefore efforts should be made to make farming a more profitable venture for the tribal farmers. Encouraging them to shift to highly lucrative crops such as sugarcane and orchard crops could perhaps make irrigated agriculture more profitable in future...|$|R

The area irrigated at present in India is 25 per cent of the sown area and it is expected to increase to about 52 per cent of the cropped area in the year AD 2025...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] this paper, {{a contribution to}} the design of <b>collective</b> pressurized <b>irrigation</b> networks in solid-set sprinkler irrigated windy areas is presented. The methodology is based on guaranteeing minimum on-farm performance, using a historical hourly wind speed database and a ballistic solid-set irrigation simulation model. The proposed method was applied to the Montesnegros Irrigation District (central Ebro basin, Spain). The district irrigates an area of 3, 493 ha using an on-demand schedule. The average wind speed in the area is 2, 8 m s- 1. An analysis of district water records showed that farmers often reduce water demand when the wind speed is high, but their irrigation decision making is limited by the capacity of the irrigation network and by the unpredictable character of local winds. Simulations were performed for eleven irrigation seasons, two triangular sprinkler spacings (18 x 18 and 18 x 15 m), and two sprinkler models. The percentage of monthly suitable time for irrigation was determined for four management strategies. The first one was based on a wind speed threshold (3 m s- 1), while the other three were based on three levels (standard, relaxed and restrictive) of two irrigation performance parameters: the Christiansen Uniformity Coefficient (CU) and the Wind Drift and Evaporation Losses (WDEL). The thresholds for the standard strategy were CU ≥ 84...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} interest from both {{policy makers and}} scholars in the collective management of natural resources in the rural sector, the literature has not covered {{many aspects of the}} incentives targeting collective actors. In this article, we analyze how embedding minimum participation rules in rural policies affect the distribution of benefits of a group of players that cooperate. The article applies the Shapley Value and the Nash–Harsanyi solution, two of the key solutions of cooperative game theory, to an incentive scheme in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) to support the construction of <b>collective</b> reservoirs for <b>irrigation</b> water. Results show that rules on the minimum storage capacity and on the minimum number of users affect the benefit distribution in opposite directions. The main conclusion of the article is that minimum participation rules should be carefully designed if welfare distribution is an issue. However, further studies are required to have a comprehensive assessment of minimum participation rules within rural policies...|$|R
40|$|A {{standard}} optimal investment {{model is}} used to analyze farmers' decision to accumulate social capital in terms of participating in <b>collective</b> activities for <b>irrigation</b> management. Several predictions {{borne out by the}} data are presented in this study. Social capital investment in small irrigation groups (1) decreases when the farmer's field is located at the downstream area where water is scarce; (2) increases when farmers have larger ricefields; (3) decreases when farmers pay the irrigation service dues; and (4) increases when the farmer belongs to a heterogeneous group which facilitates collective action when pooling resources to reduce the risks involved in rice farming. Moreover, the farmers' social capital investment in other small irrigation groups in the irrigation system 1) increases when farmers have larger rice-growing areas; 2) increases when there is a high level of trust among the farmers; but 3) declines as the opportunity cost of time increases due to coordination and participation in collective activities with farmers from other areas of the system. ...|$|R
