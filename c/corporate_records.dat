25|$|Finally, {{well into}} 1906, {{at the request}} of Rogers, famous {{industrialist}} turned philanthropist Andrew Carnegie brought President Lucius E. Johnson of the Norfolk & Western Railway to Rogers' office in the Standard Oil Building in New York. According to N's <b>corporate</b> <b>records,</b> the meeting lasted less than five minutes. Some tense and less-than-pleasant words were exchanged, and Rogers' backing had finally been confirmed.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} {{housing the}} Billy Graham Center (BGC), named {{after one of}} the college's most well-known graduates, opened in September 1980. The Billy Graham Center itself, as the repository of the evangelist's <b>corporate</b> <b>records,</b> had existed since 1974. The BGC houses several evangelism institutes, a museum of the history of evangelism, the college's Archives and Special Collections, and the Wheaton College Graduate School. It also housed the school radio station, WETN 88.1 FM, until its sale in February 2017.|$|E
25|$|The main trading {{operations}} if Blantyre and East Africa Ltd {{were carried}} out {{in what is now}} Malawi where it owned large estates, whose main products were tobacco and tea, through {{the first half of the}} 20th century. During the 1950s it sold many of its tobacco estates to the colonial administration of Nyasaland but retained its tea estates until after independence. The company has been referred to as Blantyre and East Africa Company Ltd, but according to its <b>corporate</b> <b>records,</b> it has never changed its name and has always been Blantyre and East Africa Ltd.|$|E
25|$|The {{seriousness}} of the issue was again highlighted, however, by a February 2014 fire at a southside Buenos Aires <b>corporate</b> <b>records</b> warehouse owned by U.S. based Iron Mountain Incorporated. The fire, which killed nine firemen and a civil defense officer, followed charges by the AFIP revenue bureau that Iron Mountain South America Ltd. and Iron Mountain Chile S.A. are front companies operating from tax havens. Money laundering investigations were subsequently initiated against 24 firms (out of 642) with documentation stored at the warehouse. Similar fires had recently taken place in four Iron Mountain facilities in North America and Europe.|$|E

25|$|It was {{possible}} under the former law {{to place a}} corporation on probation. Specifically, a corporation could be sentenced to probation {{over a period of}} time not to exceed 5 years, coupled with suspension of payment of part of the fine. Corporations can be placed on probation, but corporate shareholders of the defendant corporation cannot be placed on probation without making them defendants too and giving them an opportunity to be heard. Controversial proposed amendments to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines would encourage courts to install monitors in corporate probationers with wide-reaching powers to examine <b>corporate</b> <b>records.</b> There has also been some debate as to whether courts can order corporate probationers to make charitable contributions.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian and {{its sister}} {{newspaper}} The Observer opened The Newsroom, an archive and visitor centre in London, in 2002. The centre preserved and promoted the histories {{and values of}} the newspapers through its archive, educational programmes and exhibitions. The Newsroom's activities were all transferred to Kings Place in 2008. Now known as the Guardian News & Media Archive, the archive preserves and promotes the histories and values of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers by collecting and making accessible material that provides an accurate and comprehensive history of the papers. The archive holds official records of The Guardian and The Observer and also seeks to acquire material from individuals who have been associated with the papers. As well as <b>corporate</b> <b>records,</b> the archive holds correspondence, diaries, notebooks, original cartoons and photographs belonging to staff of the papers. This material may be consulted by members of the public by prior appointment. There is also an extensive Manchester Guardian archive at the University of Manchester's John Rylands University Library and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives. The British Library also has a large archive of The Manchester Guardian, available in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM in their British Library Newspapers collection.|$|E
50|$|The archival {{collection}} {{also contains}} manuscripts; records of professional associations; <b>corporate</b> <b>records</b> (including the Burroughs <b>corporate</b> <b>records</b> and the Control Data <b>corporate</b> <b>records,</b> among many others); trade publications; periodicals; manuals and product literature for older systems, photographic material (stills and moving), {{and a variety}} of other rare reference materials.|$|E

5000|$|The initial impulse behind McMahon's solo project Jack's Mannequin was [...] "Locked Doors", a song he {{recorded}} in December 2003, which {{he felt was}} too different from previous Something Corporate material. He realized that, if he would ever decide to release it, it would be on a solo album rather than a Something <b>Corporate</b> <b>record.</b> The idea seemed to be off the table until, in late summer 2004, both McMahon and his bandmates were exhausted from months of touring and {{decided to take a}} break.|$|R

The [...] "Back to the Motor League" [...] lyrics state: [...] "fifteen years later it still reeks of swill and chickenshit conformists".

5000|$|It {{is often}} viewed {{as an example of}} punk rock's idealistic [...] "do it yourself" [...] {{philosophy}} (which aimed to achieve underground artistic success without commercialisation by avoiding mainstream <b>corporate</b> <b>record</b> labels) being applied via modern communications technology, in a way which {{would not have been possible}} before the advent of the internet. The popularity of online forums and social-networking sites has made it possible for bands to immediately disseminate news of a gig to thousands of people only hours before a performance, at minimal cost, and bypassing the traditional print and radio-based methods of publicising concerts.|$|R
