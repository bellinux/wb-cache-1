25|$|A {{long-term}} {{study of}} a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program on a university campus in Central Florida found that, despite widespread concern about the welfare of free-roaming cats, 83% of the cats studied had been present {{for more than six}} years, with almost half first observed as adults of unknown age.

25|$|While new {{characters}} can {{be easily}} coined by writing on paper, they are difficult to represent on a computer – they must generally be represented as a picture, rather than as text – which presents a significant barrier to their use or widespread adoption. <b>Compare</b> <b>this</b> {{with the use of}} symbols as names in 20th century musical albums such as Led Zeppelin IV (1971) and Love Symbol Album (1993); an album cover may potentially contain any graphics, but in writing and other computation these symbols are difficult to use.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this semi-classical idea, many {{numerical}} computations were done based on the percolation picture. On top of the classical percolation phase transition, quantum tunneling was included in computer simulations to calculate the critical exponent of the `semi-classical percolation phase transition'. To <b>compare</b> <b>this</b> result with the measured critical exponent, the Fermi-liquid approximation was used, where the Coulomb interactions between electrons are assumed to be finite. Under this assumption, the ground state of the free electron gas can be adiabatically transformed into the ground state of the interacting system and this gives rise to an inelastic scattering length so that the canonical correlation length exponent can be compared to the measured critical exponent.|$|E
25|$|Own best judge: People are {{considered}} the best judge of their own type. While the MBTI provides a Reported Type, this is considered only an indication of their probable overall Type. A Best Fit Process is usually used to allow respondents to develop {{their understanding of the}} four dichotomies, to form their own hypothesis as to their overall Type, and to <b>compare</b> <b>this</b> against the Reported Type. In more than 20% of cases, the hypothesis and the Reported Type differ in one or more dichotomies. Using the clarity of each preference, any potential for bias in the report, and often, a comparison of two or more whole Types may then help respondents determine their own Best Fit.|$|E

25|$|Based {{upon the}} star's spectrum, {{it has a}} stellar {{classification}} of A3Va, with the luminosity class 'Va' indicating this is a particularly luminous dwarf, a main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of Denebola's outer envelope is about 8,500K, which results in the white hue typical of A-type stars. Denebola has a high projected rotational velocity of 128km/s, which is of the same order of magnitude as for the very rapidly rotating star Achernar. <b>Compare</b> <b>this</b> to the Sun's more leisurely equatorial rotation velocity of 2km/s. This star {{is believed to be}} a Delta Scuti variable star that exhibits fluctuations in luminosity of 0.025 magnitudes roughly ten times per day.|$|E
25|$|Information {{about the}} {{massacre}} {{began to spread}} as early as 1943, due to the activities and works of Helena Pasierbska, Józef Mackiewicz, Kazimierz Sakowicz and others. Nonetheless the Soviet regime, which supported the resettlement of Poles from the Kresy, found it convenient to deny that Poles or Jews were singled out for massacre in Paneriai; the official line was that Paneriai was a site of massacre of Soviet citizens only. This led some — including Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek — to <b>compare</b> <b>this</b> to the Katyn massacre. On 22 October 2000, {{a decade after the}} fall of communism, in independent Lithuania, an effort by several Polish organizations resulted in raising a monument (a cross) to fallen Polish citizens, during an official ceremony in which representatives of both Polish and Lithuanian governments (Bronisław Komorowski, Polish Minister of Defence, and his Lithuanian counterpart), as well as several NGOs, took place.|$|E
25|$|Another {{version of}} {{formalism}} is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem {{is not an}} absolute truth, but a relative one: if one assigns meaning to the strings {{in such a way}} that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), then one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (<b>Compare</b> <b>this</b> position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.|$|E

Bellows notes that manuscripts vary about the spelling of the place name, and that he, like others, has followed 19th-century scholar Sophus Bugge's choice. Bellows states that the stanza mentioning Lyfjaberg [...] "implies that Mengloth is a goddess of healing, and hence, perhaps an hypostasis of Frigg, as already intimated by her name [...] In stanza 54, Eir appears as one of Mengloth's handmaidens, and Eir, according to Snorri (Gylfaginning, 35) is herself the Norse Hygeia. <b>Compare</b> <b>this</b> stanza to stanza 32." ...|$|E
500|$|Until {{the early}} twentieth century, readers reacted to [...] "Ulysses" [...] sympathetically. The meaning of the poem was {{increasingly}} debated as Tennyson's stature rose. After Paull F. Baum criticized Ulysses' inconsistencies and Tennyson's conception of the poem in 1948, the ironic interpretation became dominant. Baum finds in Ulysses echoes of Lord Byron's flawed heroes, who similarly display conflicting emotions, self-critical introspection, and a rejection of social responsibility. Even Ulysses' resolute final utterance—"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield"—is undercut by irony, when Baum and later critics <b>compare</b> <b>this</b> line to Satan's [...] "courage never to submit or yield" [...] in John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667).|$|E
