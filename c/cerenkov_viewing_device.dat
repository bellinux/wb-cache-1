40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the {{detection}} of partial defects focussed on the detection of {{a small number of}} missing or substituted fuel rods in a spent fuel assembly. Attention has now been directed to the diversion of fifty percent or more fuel rods, which {{is considered to be a}} more credible diversion scenario. The diversion of fifty percent of the fuel rods in a fuel assembly by rod substitution using stainless steel or zirconium rods should cause a decrease in the total Cerenkov light output from the fuel assembly. Studies were carried out in the laboratory and in the field to determine the ability of the digital <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>device</b> (DCVD) to detect this expected decrease in Cerenkov light intensity. Because there are no real examples of LWR fuel with fifty percent rod substitution, a spent fuel assembly was modelled using ORIGEN-ARP, GEANT 4 and ZEMAX to produce a Cerenkov light intensity at the detector of the DCVD. The preliminary laboratory, field and modelling results on the ability of the DCVD to detect partial defects will be given...|$|E

Spent fuel verification using the existing Improved <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>Viewing</b> <b>Device</b> {{is becoming more and more}} difficult and sometimes impossible primarily due to the increasing cooling time of low burnup assemblies and damaged fuel in closed bottles. Other complicating factors include dummy assemblies in the ponds, different storage configurations, difficult access and variation in the quality of the pond water.

40|$|U. S. {{citizens}} currently {{make up only}} 12 % of {{the positions}} held in the IAEA’s Department of Safeguards. While the United States has maintained {{a high level of}} support for the Agency over the duration of its history, the number of American inspectors currently in the field does not reflect this level of involvement. As a result, the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Office of International Relations, as part of the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) mission, has tasked Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to develop a rigorous two week hands-on training program to encourage and operationally acclimatize U. S. Citizens who are interested in applying for IAEA inspector positions using IAEA authorized equipment at INL. Idaho National Laboratory is one-of-a-kind in its ability to train IAEA inspectors by including training at nuclear facilities on site and includes, for example, direct measurement of an active spent fuel storage cooling pond. This accredited course will introduce and train attendees on the major IAEA systems used in collecting nuclear safeguards data and performing safeguards inspections. Unique in the United States, these classes will give attendees direct hands-on training and will address equipment purpose, function, operating principles, application, and troubleshooting, based upon what would be expected of an IAEA Safeguards Inspector in the field and in the office. Upon completion, U. S. applicants will be better qualified to pursue a position in the IAEA Department of Safeguards Operational Divisions. In support, INL has recently established a new laboratory space to house state of the art nuclear safeguards instrumentation. Currently, equipment installed in the laboratory space includes attended systems: 3 DLR (3 -D Imaging Laser) for design information verification, a Digital <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>Viewing</b> <b>Device</b> for measurement of spent fuel, HM- 5 handheld radiation detectors, quantitative neutron and gamma systems; unattended monitoring systems including: NGAM and MiniGRAND radiation systems and a DMOS camera system, and VACOSS/EOSS Optical Sealing Systems. ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the ponds}} of La Hague, France, {{different}} types of material are stored awaiting reprocessing: • Irradiated LEU fuel assemblies; • Fresh MOX scrap of different origins; • Irradiated MOX assemblies from research reactors; • Irradiated L/HEU assemblies from research reactors. According to the safeguards approach developed by Euratom, irradiated LEU fuel is verified by <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> Other fuel types are verified with a dedicated underwater neutron/gamma detector. The measurements are resource intensive for both inspectors and operator. In addition, one of the measurement locations will be decommissioned by 2015. Thus, ultrasonic bolt seals (USBS) were identified as a suitable means to keep continuity of knowledge and reduce inspection effort. The paper describes the currently required measurements and the related intense effort and compares with the effort required to place and read USBS. The discussion focuses on the activities required for un-irradiated MOX scrap, which is of particularly high safeguards interest, and {{a description of the}} measures implemented to minimise re-measurement needs is provided. The associated significant savings are demonstrated. Under the new approach, USBS are placed on all newly arriving baskets, following verification by NDA. Baskets already in the pond will be sealed with USBS step by step. In order to make this project possible, JRC Ispra supplied a new generation of USBS reading heads, electronics and software. The paper describes the significant improvements of the new technology versus earlier generations. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R

40|$|Visual data presentations require {{adaptation}} {{for appropriate}} display on a <b>viewing</b> <b>device</b> that {{is limited in}} resources such as computing power, screen estate, and/or bandwidth. Due {{to the complexity of}} suitable adaptation, the few proposed solutions available are either too resource-intensive or inflexible to be applied broadly. Effective use and acceptance of data visualization on constrained <b>viewing</b> <b>devices</b> require adaptation approaches that are tailored to the requirements of the user and the capabilities of the <b>viewing</b> <b>device.</b> We propose a predictive device adaptation approach that takes advantage of progressive data refinement. The approach relies on hierarchical data structures that are created once and used multiple times. By incrementally reconstructing the visual presentation on the client with increasing levels of detail and resource utilization, we can determine when to truncate the refinement of detail so as to use the resources of the device to their full capacities. To determine when to finish the refinement for a particular device, we introduce a profile-based strategy which also considers user preferences. We discuss the whole adaptation process from the storage of the data into a scalable structure to the presentation on the respective <b>viewing</b> <b>device.</b> This particular implementation is shown for two common data visualization methods, and empirical results we obtained from our experiments are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Aims To {{establish}} whether lower resolution, lower cost <b>viewing</b> <b>devices</b> {{have the potential}} to deliver mammographic interpretation training. Methods On three occasions over eight months, fourteen consultant radiologists and reporting radiographers read forty challenging digital mammography screening cases on three different displays: a digital mammography workstation, a standard LCD monitor, and a smartphone. Standard image manipulation software was available for use on all three devices. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) were used to determine the significance of differences in performance between the <b>viewing</b> <b>devices</b> with/without the application of image manipulation software. The effect of reader’s experience was also assessed. Results Performance was significantly higher (p<. 05) on the mammography workstation compared to the other two <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> When image manipulation software was applied to images viewed on the standard LCD monitor, performance improved to mirror levels seen on the mammography workstation with {{no significant difference between the}} two. Image interpretation on the smartphone was uniformly poor. Film reader experience had no significant effect on performance across all three <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> Conclusion Lower resolution standard LCD monitors combined with appropriate image manipulation software are capable of displaying mammographic pathology, and are potentially suitable for delivering mammographic interpretation training. Key points • This study investigates potential devices for training in mammography interpretation. • Lower resolution standard LCD monitors are potentially suitable for mammographic interpretation training. • The effect of image manipulation tools on mammography workstation viewing is insignificant. • Reader experience had no significant effect on performance in all <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> • Smart phones are not suitable for displaying mammograms...|$|R
