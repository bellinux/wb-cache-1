5000|$|The {{science of}} webometrics (also <b>cybermetrics)</b> tries {{to measure the}} World Wide Web to get {{knowledge}} about the number and types of hyperlinks, structure of the World Wide Web and usage patterns. According to Björneborn and Ingwersen (2004), the definition of webometrics is [...] "the study of the quantitative aspects of the construction and use of information resources, structures and technologies on the Web drawing on bibliometric and informetric approaches." [...] The term webometrics was first coined by Almind and Ingwersen (1997). A second definition of webometrics has also been introduced, [...] "the study of web-based content with primarily quantitative methods for social science research goals using techniques that are not specific to one field of study" [...] (Thelwall, 2009), which emphasizes the development of applied methods {{for use in the}} wider social sciences. The purpose of this alternative definition was to help publicize appropriate methods outside of the information science discipline rather than to replace the original definition within information science.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{there is}} {{increasing}} interest in university rankings. Annual rankings of world universities are published by QS for the Times Higher Education Supplement, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the Higher Education and Accreditation Council of Taiwan and rankings based on Web visibility by the <b>Cybermetrics</b> Lab at CSIC.

The rankings limited to European universities are compared to the ranking of the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University. The findings show that there are reasonable similarities between the rankings, even though each applies a different methodology. The biggest differences are between the rankings provided by the QS-Times Higher Education Supplement and the Ranking Web of the CSIC <b>Cybermetrics</b> Lab. The highest similarities were observed between the Taiwanese and the Leiden rankings from European universities. Overall the similarities are increased when the comparison is limited to the European universities...|$|E

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} may be {{described}} as the century of development of metric sciences, i. e. librametrics, scientometrics, bibliometrics, informetrics, econometrics, technometrics, biometrics, sociometrics, psychometrics, educametrics and so on…Possibly the inception of <b>cybermetrics</b> was the concluding milestone of the metric sciences’ voyage in the last century. The internet and open access revolution touched the crest at 1990 s that laid down a milestone in 2001. The dawn of new millennium radiated the new spark of light across the globe, which is Wikipedia. The knowledge dissemination process demolished another barricade to ensure people’s easy access. It was a new concept that drastically transformed the world of scholarly communication. Various new dimensions were added to the processes of information collection, storage, processing, dissemination and evaluation. The performance and impact measurements of these processes gradually systematized them towards more objectiveness. In this way newer metric sciences are developing incessantly in different subject domains. Recent developments include Wikimetrics, article-level metrics, altmetrics etc. In this paper all metrics generally associated directly or indirectly with the scope and context of library and information science have been discussed along with some brief historical background. Starting from Ranganathan’s librametry, it addresses upto most recent metric studies. All metrics are categorized in three classes on the basis of respective time of inception, i. e. classical metrics, neo-classical metrics and modern metrics. The four metrics, i. e. librametrics, bibliometrics, scientometrics and informetrics are categorized under classical metrics. <b>Cybermetrics</b> is regarded as neo-classical metrics while remaining others evolved in 21 st century are recognized as modern metrics...|$|E

The performance of Malaysian OA repositories and journals is highlighted. The strength of OA channels in increasing visibility and citations are evidenced by research findings. It is proposed that libraries champion OA initiatives by making university or institutional governance aware; encouraging institutional journal publishers to adopt OA platform; collaborating with research groups to jumpstart OA institutional initiatives and to embed OA awareness into user and researcher education programmes. By actively involved, libraries will be free of permission, licensing and archiving barriers usually imposed in traditional publishing situation...|$|E

We also find differences among journals for distributions of authors by gender and corporate authors by region. Some of the regional differences can be explained by journal maturation [...] the more mature the journal the greater the dispersion.

40|$|This article {{describes}} and summarises {{the contributions of}} the Statistical <b>Cybermetrics</b> Research Group (SCRG) at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK to the information science specialisms of Webometrics and altmetrics. In both cases the group created free computer programs for data gathering and analysis. In Webometrics the SCRG developed counting methods for hyperlink analysis and assessed them for collections of different types of website. In addition, it also developed methods for automatically gathering and analysing text on a large scale, both for web citation analysis and for more general social science purposes. It also developed two Webometric theories. In altmetrics, the SCRG analysed the validity of a range of indicators, including counts of tweets and Mendeley readers for academic articles, finding evidence that they associated with citation counts and hence that they had value as altmetrics. The dual purposes of this paper are to give an overview of a range of methods and free tools for Webometrics and altmetrics, and to give a historical overview of the evolution of one information science research group in the hope that others can learn from its successes and failures...|$|E
