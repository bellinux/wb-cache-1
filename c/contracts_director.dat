5000|$|Neame was {{recruited}} to direct The Poseidon Adventure (1972) after the <b>contracted</b> <b>director</b> left the production.

50|$|Conway {{was one of}} a team of MGM <b>contract</b> <b>directors,</b> who forsook any pretense to a {{specific}} individual style in favor of working within the strictures set forth by studio management. A thoroughly competent craftsman, he delivered commercially successful entertainments, on time, and within budget. Conway may not have achieved fame as a creative genius, but the majority of his films remain eminently entertaining to this day.|$|R
50|$|The film {{is based}} on the 1932 play Road House by Walter C. Hackett. It was made by British Gaumont at the Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, with {{shooting}} beginning in July 1934.

50|$|By 1939, Michael Powell {{had been}} hired as a <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> by Korda on the {{strength}} of The Edge of the World. Korda set him to work on some projects such as Burmese Silver that were subsequently cancelled. Nonetheless, Powell was brought in to save a film that was being made as a vehicle for two of Korda's star players, Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson. The film was The Spy in Black, where Powell first met Emeric Pressburger.|$|R
50|$|Mirisch {{surrounded}} Kennedy with {{a strong}} cast, with Monte Markham giving a thinly-disguised Steve McQueen-like performance, in the same wardrobe McQueen wore in The Magnificent Seven. Elmer Bernstein was on hand to reprise part of original score of The Magnificent Seven and adding new elements. Mirisch also had his <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> Paul Wendkos direct. The producer of the film, Vincent M. Fennelly, had worked with Mirisch at Monogram and had produced the Clint Eastwood Western TV series Rawhide.|$|R
50|$|Garboil is {{the studio}} <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> Linda {{initially}} works with. He is of German descent and {{speaks with a}} thick German accent. It isn't known whether Linda initially suspects him of being a spy because of his activities or his ethnic heritage, but her suspicions are proven to be well-founded. He is cold and superior in his dealings with others, and has a disdain for Linda's cat. Garboil was the only recurring villain in Black Cat’s history. The character disappeared after a few appearances.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a three-year}} period as a <b>contract</b> <b>director,</b> Sellars shifted into the role as producer. His first in this role was as Verity Lambert's {{successor}} on The Newcomers. [...] From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, he moved through a quick succession of soap operas, including The Doctors and The Brothers. By 1973, he had entered a five-year period of directing shorter-form dramas. Most of these endeavours were, like The Chinese Puzzle and {{a portion of the}} Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, far afield from his usual work in soap opera.|$|R
50|$|Hall {{acted in}} the theatre {{from the age}} of four through 1914, when he began to work in silent movies. Following his {{military}} service in World War I, he returned to Hollywood and pursued a career in film production. He worked as a film editor and assistant director at Paramount Pictures until 1932, when he directed his first feature film, Sinners in the Sun. From 1937 to 1947, he was a <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> at Columbia Pictures, where he earned a reputation for sophisticated comedies. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941).|$|R
50|$|Hamilton MacFadden (April 26, 1901 - January 1, 1977) was an American actor, screenwriter {{and film}} director. After {{starting}} out on Broadway in the 1920s, {{he moved into}} filmmaking in Hollywood. During the early 1930s he was a <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> at Fox. McFadden {{made a number of}} films for them including several early entries in the Charlie Chan series such as Charlie Chan Carries On (1931). He was released from his Fox contract following the 1934 merger with Twentieth Century Pictures. Thereafter he mixed occasional directing jobs with a number of small supporting appearances in films.|$|R
50|$|The Nikkatsu Company {{assigned}} Kanto Wanderer to <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> Seijun Suzuki. It was {{his first}} ninkyo eiga, or chivalry film. It was also a programme picture, a quickly made, low-budget film, designed to be screened after Shohei Imamura's The Insect Woman. Kanto Wanderer {{was based on a}} serial written by Taiko Hirabayashi published in the Asahi Shinbun. Hiroshi Noguchi, Suzuki's mentor, had previously adapted the story as Song from the Underworld (1956). Suzuki was apprehensive about remaking a film by Noguchi but his producer Kenzō Asada assured him that it was better a former assistant directed it.|$|R

50|$|Before Hang 'Em High {{had been}} released, Eastwood had {{set to work}} on Coogan's Bluff, a project which saw him reunite with Universal Studios after an offer of $1 million, more than {{doubling}} his previous salary. Jennings Lang {{was responsible for the}} deal. Lang was a former agent of Don Siegel, a Universal <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> who was invited to direct Eastwood's second major American film. Eastwood was not familiar with Siegel's work but Lang arranged for them to meet at Clint's residence in Carmel. Eastwood had seen three of Siegel's earlier films, was impressed with his directing and the two became friends, forming a close partnership in the years that followed.|$|R
50|$|On April 27, 2010, the Bears {{allowed the}} <b>contract</b> of <b>Director</b> of College Scouting, Greg Gabriel, {{a member of}} the Bears {{scouting}} staff since 2001, to expire. There has been no announcement regarding who will succeed him.|$|R

50|$|Kincaid {{has served}} as a youth {{counselor}} for the Social Security Administration (1970-71), as an educational consultant, assistant professor and as assistant to the Dean of the School of Health Related Professions at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from 1971 to 1995 and <b>Contract</b> <b>Director</b> of Development at Miles College from 1996-97. He was also vice-president and later president of the Ensley Highlands Neighborhood Association and vice-president of the Five Points West community in Birmingham. In 1997 he was elected to represent District 8 in the Birmingham City Council and two years later defeated interim-Mayor William A. Bell in a runoff to become Mayor. Kincaid was also member of the Alabama delegation to the 2000 Democratic National Convention.|$|R
50|$|The Nikkatsu Company {{conceived}} Take Aim at the Police Van as a borderless action film, {{a studio}} subgenre with internationalized characters and setting. <b>Contract</b> <b>director</b> Seijun Suzuki had previously worked mainly on pop song films, a youth subgenre {{in which the}} films were built around an already popular song, and yakuza films with an occasional film noir bent. It also {{marked the beginning of}} his practice of co-writing his films. Leading man Michitaro Mizushima had also starred in Suzuki's Underworld Beauty two years earlier. He was atypical of borderless action films by virtue of his age, forty-eight at the time, as they typically featured Nikkatsu's younger stars such as Yujiro Ishihara and Akira Kobayashi.|$|R
50|$|Lord Wright, concurring, {{stated that}} it was a breach of <b>contract</b> if a <b>director</b> was removed without cause.|$|R
50|$|Joe May {{was hired}} as {{director}} because he'd helmed a series of Universal horror films in 1939, all of which had done well at the box office. May's background significantly influenced the film. He had fled his native Austria in 1934 due {{to the rise of}} Austrofascism, and became a <b>contract</b> <b>director</b> at Universal. May saw The House of the Seven Gables as a metaphor for opposing fascism and celebrating freedom of thought. But his background influenced the film in other ways, too. Alan Napier and Vincent Price both said that May had a heavy German accent, and had difficulty making himself understood in English. This hampered May's ability to direct his actors, and the studio ordered screenwriter Lester Cole to act as dialogue director.|$|R
50|$|Sears's budget-stretching skills {{attracted}} the attention of Columbia staff producer Sam Katzman. Katzman was a notoriously cheap producer, making topical films so quickly that they could be playing in theaters while the topic was still hot. Katzman recruited Sears for the 1952 serial Blackhawk, and after Sears was relieved of the Charles Starrett features, Katzman offered Sears full-time work in his unit. For the next five years Fred Sears worked steadily as a <b>contract</b> <b>director,</b> having no particular style or specialty of his own but capable of working in various genres. His most famous films are probably the Bill Haley musicals Rock Around the Clock and Don't Knock the Rock, and the science-fiction features Earth vs. the Flying Saucers and The Giant Claw.|$|R
