5|$|Ghosh {{went against}} the {{expectations}} of <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not {{willing to work with}} him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a sequel}} to the HBO-produced film <b>Cast</b> <b>a</b> Deadly Spell. Hopper plays Lovecraft in place of Fred Ward. Additionally, many {{characters}} have different back-stories than in <b>Cast</b> <b>a</b> Deadly Spell. For example, Lovecraft refuses to use magic in <b>Cast</b> <b>a</b> Deadly Spell on principle, but in Witch Hunt he refuses because of a bad experience he has had.|$|R
5|$|The {{climate of}} the Itcha Range is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> rain shadow over the Itcha Range.|$|E
5|$|The desolate Ikana Canyon, to {{the east}} of Clock Town, is the site of a former kingdom. It is {{inhabited}} mainly by the undead, except for a ghost researcher and his daughter Pamela, as well as a thief named Sakon. A pair of giant masked insectoid serpents known as Twinmold from their nest in Stone Tower Temple are <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> dark aura over the land, causing the dead bodies of former citizens and soldiers to come back to life as undead monsters.|$|E
5|$|The film's preview poster showing Aditya and Shraddha under {{a jacket}} in a rain-drenched street with the streetlight <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> glow was {{released}} along with music on 8 April 2013.

50|$|It's {{time now}} {{for you and me}} to become more {{politically}} mature and realize what the ballot is for; what we're supposed to get when we <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> ballot; and that if we don't <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> ballot, it's going to end up in a situation where we're going to have to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> bullet. It's either a ballot or a bullet.|$|R

50|$|If a {{light is}} shone on a {{three-dimensional}} object, a two-dimensional shadow is cast. By dimensional analogy, light shone on a two-dimensional object in a two-dimensional world would <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> one-dimensional shadow, and {{light on a}} one-dimensional object in a one-dimensional world would <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> zero-dimensional shadow, that is, a point of non-light. Going the other way, one may infer that light shone on a four-dimensional object in a four-dimensional world would <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> three-dimensional shadow.|$|R
5|$|The {{municipal}} government {{consists of a}} mayor and ten city councillors elected to four-year terms of office. The council is non-partisan with the mayor serving as the chairman, <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> ballot only in cases of a tie vote. There are four wards electing two councillors each with an additional two councillors selected at large by the general electorate. Day-to-day operation {{of the city is}} under the control of a City Manager.|$|E
5|$|Juste {{primarily}} attacks {{at close}} quarters using the series' traditional whip weapon, the Vampire Killer. It can be brandished to deflect projectile attacks, reminiscent of Simon Belmont's {{usage of the}} weapon in Super Castlevania IV. A variety of ranged sub-weapons—holy water, a dagger, a holy book, a cross, a gem, an axe, and a thunder gauntlet—are available, one {{of which can be}} carried at any given time and combined with one of the five spell books—Fire Book, Ice Book, Bolt Book, Wind Book, and the Summoning Tome—hidden throughout the castle to create a magical attack. <b>Casting</b> <b>a</b> spell renders the player character invincible for a moment.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Level Mountain is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Nahlin Plateau, <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> rain shadow over Level Mountain. Because the massif has a gently sloping and flat profile, it has subtle differences in climate, particularly at the low to upper-mid elevations. Hence a relatively homogeneous climate extends over Level Mountain, with only gradual temperatures and precipitation gradients occurring altitudinally. Therefore, large mammals do not have a wide diversity of local climates from which to choose.|$|E
50|$|Except for a tie, {{the mayor}} also votes in three other occasions. They <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> {{vote on the}} {{appointment}} and removal for the City Manager, and City Attorney. The other vote relates to city contract work. After a project has {{been approved by the}} city council, and bids have either been rejected or no bids submitted, the mayor may <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> vote for turning over the work to city employees. He can not bring the matter to a vote, but only <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> vote.|$|R

5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
5|$|An evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to {{take over}} the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army. It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds. In reality however, Dan was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king {{choosing}} to cover it up and declare Dan a hero. Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding. 100 years later, Zarok reappears, <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living. However, in the process, he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere. Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.|$|E
5|$|As {{they enter}} the room, the man stands up and holds the briefcase. During the third chorus, they engage in battle and {{circulate}} the room for defence. Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in the room. Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself, holding onto it, and <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> spell against the man, making him fall to the ground. As they celebrate, Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase. However, the man stands up and transforms into a polar bear; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground. Perfume member A-Chan throws an apple as a detraction, and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams. Defeated, the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy. A-Chan picks up the plush toy, and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament. The video ends with the group exiting the office.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the decision}} of Swedish voters to <b>cast,</b> or not, <b>a</b> preference vote in the European Parliament elections and/or the national elections. Previous research shows that various structural and individual factors {{have a positive impact}} on the propensity to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> preferential vote. On a structural level, factors such as type of election, personalisation of politics, media and election campaigns could affect the voters when deciding whether to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> preferential vote or not. On an individual level, factors such as political interest, candidate proximity and party identification could also affect the voters. There are vast statistical data showing how many and which voters, depending on social background, are more likely to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> preferential vote, but researchers have yet not found out what exactly motivates the voters to either <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> preferential vote or not. All in all, this article attempts to show the diversity of motivations behind preference voting and draw general patterns by interviewing Swedish voters...|$|R
5|$|Before casting Keira Knightley as Gretta, Carney {{considered}} <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> {{pop singer}} such as Adele {{in the main}} role, {{as well as a}} number of other actresses including Scarlett Johansson, who was at one point attached to the project. Knightley, who had never sung professionally before, prepared for the role by training with a vocal coach and learning how to play a guitar. Mark Ruffalo was Carney's first choice for the role of Dan, and agreed to star in the film after Carney sent him the first draft of the screenplay. Singer Adam Levine was also the only person Carney considered casting as Dave, and won the role after talking with Carney over Skype and recording some dialogue as an audition; he declined to be paid for appearing in the film. Although he had had minor acting parts on television before, Begin Again marked his first role in a film. Carney approached James Corden to appear in the film after admiring Corden's performance in the lead role in a Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors.|$|E
5|$|Sherwood {{lived in}} Pungo, Princess Anne County (today part of Virginia Beach), and married James Sherwood, a planter, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she {{was accused of}} <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> spell on a bull, {{resulting}} in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful {{and her husband had}} to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} {{whether he could}} reach his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over the}} earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} <b>casting</b> <b>a</b> curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E
25|$|Because of KMT {{strategy}} of having people boycott the referendum, one major controversy, like in 2004 was {{the format of}} the polling, specifically as whether the referendum questions would be on the same or different ballots as the Presidency. While in 2004 the Central Electoral Commission allowed U shaped line in which people would first <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> ballot for President and then <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> separate ballot for each of the two questions, the Commission ordered voters to cast all votes at once on separate ballots. Voters who choose not to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> referendum ballot simply declined to pick up the extra two ballots.|$|R
