5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal <b>Company</b> <b>did</b> not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E

Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein <b>Company</b> <b>did</b> not sign on as the film's distributor until {{near the end of}} production, and while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.|$|E

5|$|Carte {{left the}} theatre, opera company, hotels {{and his other}} {{business}} interests to Helen. Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas. In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet, overseeing his management of a revival of Iolanthe and several new comic operas. Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own. In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre. The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company.

Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in Korea, noting the <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units {{to which they were}} attached were decorated. Bond also said many of the accomplishments of the company were attributed to white units, {{due in part to the}} command climate precipitated by Almond.|$|E

(After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
