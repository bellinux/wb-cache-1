5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E

5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, <b>carrot,</b> <b>and</b> some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E

25|$|A Green Paper {{published}} in 1998 foreshadowed New Labour's approach to out-of-work benefit reform {{from that point}} on: being in work was vital and the government would encourage people on benefits to find jobs, using the <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> the stick; the claimant's contribution would be {{to try to find}} work; and Incapacity Benefit would be partially means-tested, with people receiving an occupational pension incurring a deduction in the amount of Incapacity Benefit they would receive.|$|E
25|$|Cheese slaw is {{prepared}} using grated cheese, crumbled or cubed cheese, grated <b>carrot,</b> <b>and</b> a mayonnaise dressing.

It often does not contain cabbage, as per coleslaw, although cabbage is occasionally used. Cheese slaw may contain other vegetables, such as chives, spring onions, shallots, parsley, and broccoli.|$|E

25|$|On the government's side, al-Muwaffaq was {{in command}} of an {{enormous}} number of men and ships, and his troops used naphtha in an attempt to burn down enemy structures. In addition, he ordered {{the construction of a new}} city, al-Muwaffaqiyyah, which provided provisions and other services for his men. Throughout the siege he utilized a <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> stick approach with the rebels; Zanj troops that voluntarily surrendered were granted guarantees of safety and rewards, and were paraded in front of al-Mukhtarah to convince others to join them, while rebel soldiers that were killed in battle were at times decapitated and their heads were displayed in view of the defenders.|$|E
25|$|In Captain <b>Carrot</b> <b>and</b> the Final Ark (October 2007), {{written by}} Bill Morrison, with art by co-creator Scott Shaw, The Zoo Crew reunite {{in the midst}} of growing strife between the land and the sea creatures of Earth-26, sparked by Starro. Unfortunately, they {{encounter}} Starro and most of their powers are neutralized except for Pig Iron. Furthermore, that Earth is rendered uninhabitable and the Crew has an ocean liner loaded with refugees transported off the planet by the Just-A-Lot-Of-Animals. Unfortunately, the ship is accidentally sent to New Earth. Although the Justice League encounter the ship and land it safely, all the passengers, including The Crew are transformed into their animal forms indigenous to that Earth and, although they all apparently still have their human level intelligence, they are unable to speak. However, some time in the future, the Crew will discover that their powers have been restored. In Final Crisis #7, Captain Carrot is seen in the climactic battle with his humanity and powers restored, and Pig Iron is with him.|$|E

500|$|In {{political}} philosophy, a throffer is {{a proposal}} (also called an intervention) that mixes an offer with a threat {{which will be}} carried out if the offer is not accepted.

[...] He fires at the bad rabbit, but finds nothing but a <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> a rabbit tail on the bench. [...] The good rabbit then sees the bad rabbit running away without his whiskers and tail.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} soups are enjoyed, {{particularly}} in the winter. Chicken soup has been a mainstay of Jewish cuisine since medieval times and is popular in Israel. Classic chicken soup is prepared as a simple broth with a few vegetables, such as onion, <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> celery, and herbs such as dill and parsley. More elaborate versions are prepared by Sephardim with orzo or rice, or the addition of lemon juice or herbs such as mint or coriander, while Ashkenazim may add noodles.

500|$|Throffer has not, however, been universally adopted; Michael R. Rhodes {{notes that}} there has been some {{controversy}} in the literature on whether to use throffer, citing a number of writers, including Lawrence A. Alexander, David Zimmerman and Daniel Lyons, who do not use the term. Some, including political scientists Deiniol Jones and Andrew Rigby, consider throffer to be synonymous with <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> stick, an idiom which refers to the way a donkey is offered a carrot to encourage compliance, while noncompliance is punished with a stick. Other writers, while electing to use the word, consider it a poor one. For instance, literary scholar Daniel Shore calls it [...] "a somewhat unfortunate term", while using it in his analysis of John Milton's Paradise Regained.|$|E
500|$|To explain each form, Russell {{provides}} illustrations. The {{power of}} mere force {{is like the}} tying of a rope around a pig's belly and lifting {{it up to a}} ship while ignoring its cries. The power of inducements is likened to two things: either conditioning, as exemplified by circus animals which have been trained to perform this-or-that trick for an audience, or group acquiescence, as when the leader among sheep is dragged along by chains to get the rest of the flock to follow. Finally, the power of propaganda is akin to the use of <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> stick to influence the behaviour of a donkey, {{in the sense that the}} donkey is being persuaded that making certain actions (following the carrot, avoiding the stick) would be more or less to their benefit.
