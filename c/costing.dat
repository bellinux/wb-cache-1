Variable <b>costs</b> are also the sum of marginal <b>costs</b> over all units produced.

However, not all variable <b>costs</b> are direct <b>costs.</b> For example, variable manufacturing overhead <b>costs</b> are variable <b>costs</b> that are indirect <b>costs,</b> not direct <b>costs.</b> Variable <b>costs</b> are sometimes called unit-level <b>costs</b> as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|R

5|$|The cyclone caused $50million {{in damage}} to the banana crop and $3million to papaws between Ingham to Cairns alone. Agricultural {{impairment}} {{was not limited to}} Babinda; throughout northern Queensland, the storm devastated banana and papaw crops. Avocado farms at Atherton and pineapple farms in Rollingstone and Mutarnee experienced considerable losses; in addition, $35million in sugar cane crops near Innisfail were destroyed, with 60–70percent of the entire year's harvest ruined. Within the vicinity of Tully, the storm ruined 30percent of the crop, causing $10million in losses. In general, the sugar industry, already economically weak, bore the brunt of the system's impact. Overall, Winifred caused $86.4million in agricultural losses; the cyclone ruined 1.5million tones of sugar, <b>costing</b> $40million, 3.7million cases of bananas, <b>costing</b> $34.6million, and 15percent of the maize crop, <b>costing</b> $500,000. Winifred also damaged $4.9million in papaws, and $3.8million in avocados, lychees, custard apples, flowers, and chokos, as well. Effects to dairy and poultry industries were less severe, with losses reported at $2million and $600,000, respectively. Winds uprooted large swaths of forest, with $1million in damage at government-owned forests alone.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} price {{adjustment}} practices and provide quantitative {{measurement of the}} managerial and customer <b>costs</b> of price adjustment using data from a large U.

We find that price adjustment <b>costs</b> are a much more complex construct than the existing industrial organization or the macroeconomics literature recognizes. In addition to physical <b>costs</b> ("menu costs"), we identify and measure three types of managerial costs—information gathering, decision-making and communication <b>costs,</b> and two types of customer costs—communication, and negotiation <b>costs.</b> We find that the managerial <b>costs</b> are more than six times, and customer <b>costs</b> are more than twenty times, the menu <b>costs.</b> In total, the price adjustment <b>costs</b> comprise 1. 22 percent of the company’s revenue and 20. 03 percent of the company’s net margin.
