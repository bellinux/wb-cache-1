5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E

Demolition began shortly after in April 2012, when all {{stores in the}} mall had either {{relocated}} or closed. The Original Pancake House, a restaurant, was the final tenant to close in the mall. The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a tenant in the mall since 2009, <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> Wayzata location entirely. Among the mall's other final tenants were a True Value hardware store, a jewelry store, a health food store, and a furniture store.|$|E
5|$|After the Sierra Leone Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> program in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Movies {{were popular}} in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over {{a billion people}} in 1942, 1943 and 1944. By 1934, German {{regulations}} restricting currency exports {{made it impossible for}} American film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.|$|E

5|$|The United States Coast Guard urged marine {{interests}} and boaters in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina to take precaution {{to protect their}} lives and vessels. In Florida, the Gulf Islands National Seashore <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> campground and a beach front road. Additionally, several states parks were closed and campers were evacuated. At Pensacola Beach, condominium associations asked residents to remove furniture from high balconies due to the anticipation of strong winds. A state of emergency was issued for Taylor County, where two shelters were opened.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E

5|$|In Maui County, the Hawai'i Department of Education ordered for {{the closure}} of all schools and the {{designation}} of some facilities as emergency shelters. All public schools in Hawaii County were also closed by the department. Both the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii Community College <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> campuses during Iselle's passage. The Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources closed all of its managed lands in Hawaii and Maui counties and closed some of its campgrounds and wilderness areas in Oahu and Kauai counties. All state offices and courthouses in Hawaii County were closed with the retention of only essential staff. Although Hawaiian Airlines did not cancel its flights, the company waived fees for passengers seeking to change from flights expected to service during Iselle's passage. United Airlines and Island Air later took the same accommodative measures. The latter later cancelled all of its inter-Hawaiian flights on August7, {{with the exception of}} flights serving Kauai; American Airlines and numerous other airlines would follow suit as the threat of Iselle neared. The Salvation Army readied its resources in preparation for relief operations for Iselle in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{employment}} in the park began to decline as companies <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. Ellesmere Port and Runcorn at {{the western end of}} the Manchester Ship Canal were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment had fallen to 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s. In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (TRAFIC), membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by improving their own areas through landscaping and other environmental improvements. The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester Ship Canal during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service. By 1976, the workforce had fallen to 15,000, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two years}} after opening, a flood in March 1904 did serious damage to the structure. However, the owners hired the Horseheads Bridge Company, run by the Perkins brothers. They charged $7,000 (1904 USD) to {{complete}} repairs of the bridge. With the reopening of the bridge, and along with the newly constructed Erie Railroad station, a new revitalization came to Skinners Falls and Milanville, including an acid company, creamery, and a dairy company, which helped raise income for the bridge using the $0.22 toll. One company that could not make it is the Skinners' timber rafting, which had been in business for over 140 years. In 1914, J. Skinner was the new owner, but the company was devastated when one of their timber rafts collided with a Myers family-owned ferryboat, killing four. The blame {{was placed on the}} ferry operator. However, along with the tragedy, the lack of riverside forests made it hard for timber rafting to prosper and in 1914, they <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> doors.|$|E

The local Catholic leaders demanded a peaceful bandh on 15 September in and around the city of Mangalore, and as a response Catholic traders and transport owners <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> shops and stopped their vehicles. A memorandum was submitted to the district council at 10.30 am, seeking protection for the lives and property of Christians. Prayers were to be held in all the 48 churches of the district on Wednesday, 17 September. On 6 October 2008, some 10,000 people from civil society and religious organisations organised a march to protest against the anti-Christian perpetrators of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E

5|$|Benfica began December {{hoping to}} extend their {{domestic}} winning streak, and the club's first game hosted Vitória de Setúbal on 1 December. Laionel opened the score for Setúbal in the 35th minute, with Benfica only responding {{in the second half}} with Kostas Katsouranis. In the 59th minute, David Suazo fired a powerful shot that beat Pedro Alves and put Benfica in the lead. However, in the 91st minute, a bicycle kick by Anderson do Ó cleared Quim and levelled the game. Although Sánchez Flores called the equaliser an accident, he soon dropped Quim in favour of José Moreira. A week later, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros to play Marítimo. They had their best performance of the season, winning 6–0 with Suazo and Nuno Gomes each scoring twice. The win put Benfica {{at the top of the}} table for the first time since May 2005, and was their largest away win since 1974. On 13 December, Benfica played Leixões for a place in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals. On a rainy night at Estádio do Mar, neither team could find the back of the net in regular and extra time. Reyes missed a penalty, giving Leixões the win. Although Nuno Gomes was frustrated with the elimination, he said it was time to hold their heads high and win the league. On Thursday the 18th, Benfica <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> European campaign by hosting Metalist Kharkiv. To qualify, Benfica had to win 8–0 and Olympiacos not win; in case of a draw, Benfica needed a better goal average. They lost one-nil, finishing last in Group B. Sánchez Flores assumed full responsibility for his team's performance in the competition. Of 40 teams, only Partizan, Heerenveen and Feyenoord played worse than Benfica. The year ended with a home game against Nacional. Benfica never overcame Nacional goalkeeper Rafael Bracalli, wasting an opportunity to open a four-point lead in the league table. The match ended in controversy after Cardozo had a goal disallowed because Miguel Vítor had deflected the ball with his hands. According to Sánchez Flores, the goal was legitimate and Benfica were deprived of three points.|$|E
