5|$|According to {{historian}} David Armitage, the Declaration of Independence did {{prove to}} be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights.

50|$|Since 1987, the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> some <b>new</b> {{congressional districts}} {{have been met}} with controversy, {{especially}} due to incumbent political clans and their allies benefiting from the new district arrangements. Some <b>of</b> these <b>new</b> congressional districts {{are tied to the}} <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> province, because such an act necessarily entails the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> congressional district.|$|R

Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time {{too short to}} account for <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain, pointing again towards ideasthesia.|$|E
5|$|After World War II {{the study}} of {{probability}} theory and stochastic processes gained more attention from mathematicians, with signification contributions made {{in many areas of}} probability and mathematics as well as the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> areas. Starting in the 1940s, Kiyosi Itô published papers developing the field of stochastic calculus, which involves stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations based on the Wiener or Brownian motion process.|$|E
5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E

50|$|Since Confederation in 1867, {{there have}} been several {{proposals}} for new Canadian provinces and territories.

5|$|In the 8th and 9th centuries, {{civil service}} {{constituted}} the clearest path to aristocratic status, but, {{starting in the}} 9th century, the civil aristocracy was rivalled by an aristocracy of nobility. According to some studies of Byzantine government, 11th-century politics were dominated by competition between the civil and the military aristocracy. During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> courtly dignities and offices.|$|E
5|$|Narayan is {{associated}} with the Kirana gharana (stylistic school of Kirana) through Abdul Wahid Khan, but his performance style is not strongly connected to it. Most of Narayan's compositions are from the singing repertoire of his teachers and were modified and adapted to the sarangi. He has created original compositions and in performance varies those he was taught. Narayan disfavors the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ragas, but developed compound ragas, including those of Nand with Kedar and Kafi with Malhar.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E

5|$|Some noncoding DNA {{sequences}} play structural {{roles in}} chromosomes. Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but {{are important for}} the function and stability of chromosomes. An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> genes {{through the process of}} gene duplication and divergence.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{president}} of the Municipal Council is Leandro Pereira, supported by the political party Justice First. All {{but one of the}} seven councillors belong to political parties opposed to President Hugo Chávez's administration. There is also a Legislative Commission, presided over by councillor Salvador Pirrone in 2007. The commission's job is to assist the municipality in legal matters, such as the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> laws and decrees.|$|E
5|$|The post-war era saw the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> College in 1962, Innis College in 1964 and Woodsworth College in 1974, {{all of them}} nondenominational. Along with University College, they {{comprise}} the university's constituent colleges, which are established and funded by the central administration and are therefore financially dependent. Massey College was established in 1963 by the Massey Foundation as a college exclusively for graduate students. Regis College, a Jesuit seminary, entered federation with the university in 1979.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} Nyuserre Ini {{witnessed}} the unabated {{growth of the}} priesthood and state bureaucracy, a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty in particular under Neferirkare Kakai. Changes in the Egyptian administration during this period are manifested by a multiplication {{in the number of}} titles, reflecting the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> administrative offices. These in turn, reflect a movement to better organise the administration of the state with the new titles corresponding to charges attached to very specific duties.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} {{the development of}} the Parliamentary Triangle, a core part of Griffin's design, and since then various buildings of national importance were constructed on the lakefront. The Australian National University was built, and sculptures and monuments were built. On average, the population of Canberra increased by more than 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975 as {{the development of the}} capital became more concerted, and new residential land was released through the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> town centres in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cultural forms. Baseball cards {{were introduced in}} the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature {{an image of a}} baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
5|$|During the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868, {{the delegates}} paid {{attention}} to northeastern portion of the state, especially the increasing need for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> counties in the region. At the time, there were a total of twenty counties located in the region, compared to twenty-three presently. The convention originally met to write a new state constitution, but members quickly tried to shift the focus to other issues. During the convention, the Committee on Counties and County Boundaries presented proposals {{for the creation of}} three new counties in the region. They were to be called Delta, Webster, and Richland. Delta County was established on July 29, 1870, by the Twelfth State Legislature. The proposals for Webster and Richland counties, however, were not passed.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E
