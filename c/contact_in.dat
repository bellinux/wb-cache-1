5|$|According to Martin Noth, {{a scholar}} of the Hebrew Bible, the {{narratives}} of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage {{than that of the}} West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in <b>contact</b> <b>in</b> southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical <b>contact,</b> <b>in</b> a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Black's <b>contact</b> <b>in</b> the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), {{insists that}} Black should not get {{involved}} in the case as he is too close to the victims. However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E

5|$|Bok was {{aided by}} people of diverse {{cultures}} and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was wrong and provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum. Upon arriving in Khartoum, Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman {{and members of the}} Fur people, and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church. His first point of <b>contact</b> <b>in</b> the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language <b>contact</b> <b>in</b> the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The <b>contact</b> <b>in</b> which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E

5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical <b>contact.</b> <b>In</b> the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing {{the failure of the}} first <b>contact.</b> <b>In</b> His Master's Voice, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{made another}} try {{on the same}} position. The morning of August 22, North Korean {{infantry}} started a very heavy attack against the 1st Battalion. Employing no artillery or mortar preparatory fires, the force cut the barbed wire at the perimeter and attacked at close quarters with small arms and grenades. This assault engaged three American companies and drove one of them from its position. After three hours of fighting A Company counterattacked at 07:00 and regained its lost position. The next day, August 23, the North Koreans, frustrated in this area, withdrew from <b>contact</b> <b>in</b> the 35th Infantry sector.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} account of Japanese <b>contact</b> <b>in</b> Palau occurred in 1820, when a coastal sailing ship was blown off course and eight surviving men {{spent five years}} in Palau until 1825. Japanese traders began to establish settlements from the mid-19th century onwards, and by 1890 two Japanese trading stations had been established. Many of these traders married the daughters of local chieftains and raised local families. When Japan annexed Palau from Germany in 1914, Japanese settlers and their descendants acted as state liaison officials and interpreters for the Japanese military administration.|$|E

5|$|The {{implications}} of discovery depend {{very much on}} the level of aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity, its ethics, and how much human and extraterrestrial biologies have in common. These factors will govern the quantity and type of dialogue that can take place. The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long-term {{implications of}} <b>contact.</b> <b>In</b> the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension.|$|E
