2500|$|A single {{platform}} and siding were provided {{on the southern}} {{side of the line}} at the western end of the Venn <b>Cross</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The station's location, in a cutting [...] above sea level, meant that it was prone to being blocked by snow. One of the signals was of a special design with a central pivot to allow it to be seen through Venn <b>Cross</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A crossing loop was installed with a second platform in February 1905. The station had a signal box on the westbound platform. The goods shed and the western end of the platforms were in Devon, while the main station buildings were in Somerset. Goods traffic was withdrawn from 30 September 1963. The station building and the station master's house are still in residential use and the goods shed has also been converted into a house. Some GWR railings and signals remain nearby.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Deutsche Bahn {{proposed}} {{an amendment to}} the plan, with among other things, the longitudinal spacing of the <b>cross</b> <b>tunnels</b> reduced from 1,000 to 500 m and special construction methods in the portal area to deal with tunnel boom. Among other things, the route of the eastern tunnel was shifted slightly to give a uniform distance of 12 m between the airlock doors of the <b>cross</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The amended plans provided for a new safety concept over a length of 2,260 m. The amendment was approved in November 2012. According to a media report the amendments to the plan were necessary because of new safety regulations (as of February 2012).|$|R
50|$|Because of its length, in {{addition}} to the Midland's normal block system, signal wires were installed which, when cut, caused alarms to ring in the signal boxes at each end. The same system was used in the shorter Cowburn and Clay <b>Cross</b> <b>Tunnels.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of traffic tunnel {{accidents}} {{have been reported in}} China since the 21 th century. However, few studies have been reported to analyze traffic accidents that have occurred in urban road tunnels. This study aims to examine the characteristics of the temporal, spatial, and modality distributions of traffic in Shanghai river <b>crossing</b> <b>tunnels</b> using statistical analysis and comparative analysis. Employing these techniques tunnel accident data obtained from Shanghai center 110 was analyzed to determine temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of traffic accidents in river <b>crossing</b> <b>tunnels</b> in Shanghai. The results of this analysis are discussed and summarized in this paper. Identification of the characteristics of tunnel traffic accidents can provide valuable information for development of effective countermeasures to improve tunnel safety in China...|$|R

50|$|The {{first stage}} of Moscow Metro opened in 1935 {{terminated}} at a shallow alignment Smolenskaya station. The second stage (opened in 1937) started with a 1.4 kilometer westward extension from Smolenskaya to Kiyevskaya, a station serving the Kiyevsky Rail Terminal, which required a river <b>crossing.</b> <b>Tunnel</b> <b>crossing</b> was impractical; an open contest for the bridge design was held in spring 1935. Yakovlev brothers won with a relatively modest, reserved prototype. Actual bridge was built without planned statues and portico.|$|R

50|$|The Golden <b>Cross</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{emerged in}} the centre arch of the three and had reputedly allowed monks to cross from St. Chad's to drink in privacy, without being spotted by public. During the 1960s Mr O'Dwyer was {{persistently}} bothered by curious tourists wanting to explore the underground passage. However, once he decided to charge a shilling per visit, numbers dwindled {{until such time as}} he was able to seal the entrance to the tunnel and store his dustbins in the area. During the refurbishments of the late 1970s the entrance to the tunnel was demolished.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the opening}} of long-distance station, the three-track station opened in 1972 (now the {{regional}} station) has only been used by regional and S-Bahn traffic. Between 1985 and 1999, the regional station had been used by Intercity and later by Intercity-Express services. Until December 2010 some long-distance trains used the regional station at night, when the long-distance station was closed. The long-distance station is now also open at night, so scheduled long-distance trains no longer stop at the regional station. The Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed line opened in August 2002, {{three years after the}} line between the Raunheim curve and the Frankfurt <b>Cross</b> <b>tunnel</b> through the new station.|$|E
