There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E

The book was adopted by Andrew Bell around 1800 for his Madras system of education and by various educational societies throughout Britain and its colonies; it was even used to educate adult slaves in Antigua and Jamaica.|$|E

25|$|Many {{types of}} sports {{equipment}} {{are made of}} wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, <b>cricket</b> <b>bats</b> are typically made of white willow.

25|$|Cricket balls can be bowled {{at close}} to 160km/h (100mph) by pace bowlers and made to deviate from a {{straight}} course, both in the air (known as 'swinging') and off the ground (known as 'seaming').

Some bats made in Kashmir are of international standards and are/were used by many national players in India such as Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh. Bats made in other regions are generally of lower quality, and mainly used in non-professional cricket games, such as tennis ball cricket, which are played in streets and neighbourhoods across India.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known written {{version of}} the Laws of Cricket, dating from 1744, does not include an lbw rule. At the time, batsmen in English cricket used curved bats, which made it unlikely {{that they would be}} able to stand directly in front of the wickets. However, a clause in the 1744 laws gave umpires the power to take action if the batsman was [...] "standing unfair to strike". <b>Cricket</b> <b>bats</b> were modified to become straighter over the following years, allowing batsmen to stand closer to the wickets. Subsequently, some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets. Such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in 1774 ruled that the batsman was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg. However, critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batsmen. The 1788 {{version of the}} laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batsman's intent; now a batsman was lbw if he stopped a ball that [...] "pitch straight". Further clarification of the law came in 1823, when a condition was added that [...] "the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket". The ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket, or between the wickets at either end of the pitch. In 1839 the MCC, by then responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket, endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batsman out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps.|$|E
