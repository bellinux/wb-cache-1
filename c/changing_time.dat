25|$|Their self-titled debut album, {{produced}} by Gold, {{was released in}} March 1974, nearly a year after it was recorded in New York. It defined the band's signature sound, a mix of American-style boogie rock and complex, symphonic arrangements with <b>changing</b> <b>time</b> signatures. Steinhardt's violin was a distinctive element of the group's sound, being defined more by heartland rock than the jazz and classical influences which most progressive rock violinists followed.|$|E

2500|$|This {{has led to}} {{continuity}} problems. Early {{histories of}} races such as the Daleks were rewritten. Writer Paul Cornell, discussing continuity errors, opines that the modern programme's Time War can explain away (or retcon) such discontinuities, giving the example of Earth's different destructions in The Ark (1966) and [...] "The End of the World" [...] (2005). Writer and Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat has gone further, arguing that [...] "a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes {{and the concept of}} <b>changing</b> <b>time</b> can't have a continuity error – it's impossible for Doctor Who to get it wrong, because we can just say 'he changed time'".|$|E
2500|$|The Time War {{provides}} a convenient in-story explanation for any contradictions in series continuity: for example, writer Paul Cornell {{has suggested that}} Earth's destruction by an expanding sun in [...] "The End of the World" [...] five billion years hence, {{as opposed to the}} original depiction of its demise around the year 10,000,000 AD in The Ark (1966), can be attributed to changes in history due to the War.

2500|$|The basic {{style of}} the album was {{described}} by critics as a mixture death and progressive metal, with some melodic elements. Mark Fisher of Metal Forces wrote that [...] "The first is that Extol have gone even further into the progressive aspect of their music than their last two albums did. The band full-on channel aspects of Rush, Yes and King's X without apology." [...] Vocally, the band ranges from death growls to progressive, pop-style clean singing to black metal rasps and wails. Emma Johnston of Metal Hammer said that Extol takes a [...] "distinctly kitchen-sink approach to their art, mashing together frontman Peter Espevoll's death-metal rasp with dreamy prog melodies and a relentless thrash march from the get-go." [...] On the song [...] "Ministers", Johnston states that Extol [...] "turns Slayer inside out and uses their [...] riffs for their own pious means." [...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine compared the clean vocals to Queen, and John Magelssen of Indie Vision Music specified that the singing on [...] "Open the Gates" [...] sounds like [...] "Weird Al mixed with The Faceless' vocals." [...] Magelssen described the technical {{style of the}} album as [...] "intricate syncopated (off rhythm) beats and ever <b>changing</b> <b>time</b> signatures," [...] and Timothy Estabrooks of Jesus Freak Hideout said that on Extol the [...] "riffs are lightning fast and complex, the drumming is aggressive and constantly changing tempos and rhythms, and even the occasional breakdown is very well executed." ...|$|E

60|$|Towards {{morning he}} slept, {{and then for}} days and nights, how many he did not know, {{it seemed to him}} that he did not wake but dreamed through a <b>changing</b> <b>time</b> when he was dimly aware of contending voices: voices of his believers, the Little Flock, and voices of his unbelievers, the Herd of the Lost, {{pleading}} and threatening in the forest round his place of refuge. His followers were trying to bring him food and raiment, and his enemies were preventing them and boasting that they would keep guard over his refuge till they starved him out. Then all again was a blur, a texture of conscious and unconscious misery till a night came when the woof broke and trailed away from him, and he lifted himself on his elbow and after he had drunk a long draft from the spring, found tremulous strength to get to his feet. He tried some steps in the open space, where the light of the full moon fell, and found that he could walk. He reached the tangled entrance to his covert, and stealthily put the vines aside. He peered out into the shadows striped with moonshine and could see no one, and he was going to venture farther, when he stopped stone still at the figure of a man crouched in the middle of the causeway. The man's head was fallen forward and his gun lay across his lap; he must be one of the guards that his enemies had set on his refuge to keep him there and starve him out; and he must be asleep. Dylks stooped and peered into his face and knew the man for one of the Hounds who had often disturbed his meetings, and now he looked about in the rage that surged up through his penitence and self-pity for a stone or a club to strike him senseless, or dead if need be. But there was no such weapon that he could see, and the risk of a struggle was greater than the risk of trying to pass the man without waking him. After long doubt he tried with one foot and then another and the man did not wake; then he crept slowly by, and then with softly dragging steps he got farther from the sleeper and pushed on through the woods in the direction of the turnpike, as he imagined it. But he came out in a clearing where a new log cabin showed clear in the open under the moon.|$|E
