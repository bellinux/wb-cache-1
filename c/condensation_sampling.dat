40|$|A {{system for}} the {{tracking}} and classification of livestock movements is pre-sented. The combined ‘tracker-classifier ’ scheme {{is based on a}} variant of Is-ard and Blakes ‘Condensation ’ algorithm [6] known as ‘Re-sampling Con-densation ’ in which a second set of samples is taken from each image in the input sequence {{based on the results of}} the initial <b>Condensation</b> <b>sampling.</b> This is analogous to a single iteration of a genetic algorithm and serves to incor-porate image information in sample location. Re-sampling Condensation relies on the variation within the spatial (shape) model being separated into pseudo-independent components (analogous to genes). In the system a hierarchical spatial model based on a variant of the Point DistributionModel [16] is used to model shape variation accurately. Re-sults are presented that show this algorithm gives improved tracking perfor-mance, with no computational overhead, over Condensation alone. Separate Cyclic Hidden Markov Models are used to model ‘Healthy ’ and ‘Lame ’ movements within the Condensation framework in a competitive man-ner such that the model best representing the data will be propagated through the image sequence. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{automatic}} analysis of meetings gains more and more in importance due to a growing number of meetings taking place in any part of the world. However if someone of the invited people cannot join the meeting it would be desirable for this person to have a kind of browser that enables him to get an automatically generated summary of the meeting and to watch any section of the video recording that seems to be interesting for him. In order to provide such a tool, several steps have to be performed on the videostream. In the first part of analyzing the recorded video the person has to be detected in each frame of the video. For this detection we use a tracker based on the ICondensation algorithm [1]. This algorithm is an extension of the standard condensation method and additionally uses a so-called importance function to draw samples from. In our implementation we have chosen the skin color distribution as such an importance function. Now samples can be drawn both from the importance function on the one side and from the face distribution on the other side. The great advantage of this extended algorithm is, that a track, that has been lost, can be found again by sampling from this importance function. This reinitialization is performed in every frame with a certain probability, i. e. some samples are drawn from the importance function to avoid a loss of the track, and the remaining samples are drawn from the face probability distribution with standard <b>condensation</b> <b>sampling.</b> The tracker produces an estimation of the person’s location in the videoframe. With this information we now can define a rectangle around the person (including head and hands) called action region, where we suppose gesture...|$|E

30|$|The above {{results suggest}} that pore {{structure}} becomes more arranged at lower nitric acid molar ratios. Synthesis at 0.2 and 0.5 NA molar ratios confirms this observation where the sharper (100) reflections plus additional high reflection peaks characteristic of a hexagonal pore arrangement become visible at 3 ° to 4 ° 2 θ of the XRD pattern (Figure  7 a). Nitrogen sorption isotherms of these samples in Figure  6 b show type IV isotherms. Unlike the MSF <b>sample,</b> capillary <b>condensation</b> of <b>sample</b> 0.2 NA extends over a wider p/po range and shows type H 2 hysteresis loop (sloping adsorption and vertical desorption). This suggests that pores in the 0.2 NA spheres have narrow and wide sections and possible interconnecting channels [44]. Conversely, capillary <b>condensation</b> step of <b>sample</b> 0.5 NA was sharper, which is indicative of a uniform pore size as verified by its more resolved XRD peaks. Surface area properties of these two samples are very close (Table  2). Noteworthy is their pore size (approximately 3  nm) which is slightly larger than the MSF (2.35  nm), suggesting that NO 3 − counterion causes swelling in the surfactant micellar size. Similarly, the larger wall thickness (2.3 to 2.45  nm vs. 1.95  nm for MSF) means more silica <b>condensation</b> in these <b>samples.</b> However, they have smaller surface areas (624 and 560 vs. 1, 008  m 2 /g) and pore volumes (0.43 and 0.4 vs. 0.64  m 3 /g). Overall, high nitric acid concentrations provide spheres with uniform pore size and disordered structure, whereas growth at low concentrations increases the rate of condensation and surface roughness and promotes pore order.|$|R

30|$|Progressive {{decrease}} in the molar ratio of NA causes notable changes in the morphology and microstructure of the product. At intermediate molar ratios (1 NA and 2 NA), loose fine particulate and film products were formed with a disordered structure. Their XRD patterns in Figure  7 a show only a one broad (100) reflection shifted to a slightly higher angle than sample 3.34 NA (the high order small peaks are not discernible). Sample 1 NA, however, exhibits a better pore arrangement than sample 2 NA according to the higher intensity and smaller width of the (100) reflection. It is known that the pore order is dictated by the degree of surfactant packing during silica condensation which is clearly influenced by varying the acid content. While both products of 1 NA and 2 NA have the typical mesoporous type IV sorption isotherms, sample 1 NA exhibits two broad capillary condensation steps: one with no hysteresis loop occurring at 0.2 to 0.35 p/po and one at 0.4 to 0.7 p/po with type H 2 hysteresis loop. This indicates the presence of intraparticle and interparticle porosities in sample 1 NA which result in a {{bimodal pore size distribution}} having average sizes of 2.5 and 3.8  nm. The interparticle porosity emerges possibly from the aggregation of small particles during <b>condensation.</b> <b>Sample</b> 2 NA conversely has an average pore size of 2.9  nm. Pore size and area properties are shown in Table  2.|$|R

30|$|Frozen hydrate {{analysis}} {{has the effect}} of improving the analyte ion signal intensity in addition to achieving the closest native state of the sample during imaging [53, 82, 83, 86 – 88, 91]. Under this frozen hydrate environment, the signal intensity increase from small peptides, drugs, and lipids was proved by surface analysis and depth profiling using ToF–SIMS [42, 53, 82, 83, 86 – 88, 91 – 93]. Changes in the sample temperature leads to the possibility that molecules with high mobility migrate to the tissue surface and form a physical surface layer, thereby reducing the chance that other molecules will come into contact with a proton. If the temperature is kept at a cryogenic temperature, there is no molecular movement, and the ionization of the analyte is undisturbed, so the signal intensity is relatively improved. One of the most important points in the frozen hydrate analysis process is to avoid water <b>condensation</b> on the <b>sample</b> surface. Piwowar et al.

Ultraviolet, fluorescence and excitation spectroscopy were used for analysis of photo physical properties. Thermal properties were characterized by TGA and SDTA. The derivatives Cl-MO-DPQ and Cl-M-DPQ show absorbance peaks in the range 264 - 370 nm and 264 - 338 nm respectively. In both the cases the emission spectra are in blue region. The TGA and SDTA studies show not only the DPQ but also it’s derivatives have good thermal stability {{even though they are}} low molecular weight organic compounds, which may in turn improve the stability and operating lifetime of the device. The physical and chemical properties of these polymers are useful as a blue emitting organic material for OLED’s...|$|R

But in this time many in marketing there are honey which don’t experience, where honey which don’t experience of to contain water and sucrose. Obstetrical of this difficult sucrose processed by body so that dangerous enough when in consumption by patient of desease diabetes. One of the alternative to know content of sucrose in honey by chemical analysis, condensed progressively <b>condensation</b> colour at <b>sample</b> combine which have been reacted by hence rate excelsior of sucrose which implied in the honey. In appliance application use LED as light source, where light of LED after passing sample will be accepted by colour censor of TCS 230. Where TCS 230 is IC convertion of light colour to frequency, there is especial two component form of this IC, that is photodiode and convertion of current to frequency. Result of output to colour censor of TCS 230 accepted by Mikrokontroller ATmega 8535 functioning as processor of data, then presented by LCD {{in the form of}} value in prosentase...|$|R
