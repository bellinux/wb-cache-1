5|$|SR11 is {{proposed}} to be a toll facility {{that will serve}} a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa, the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry. It will connect SR 905 and SR 125 to the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> connects to Mexican Federal Highway 2D and Mexican Federal Highway 2 to Tecate, and Mexican Federal Highway 1D to Ensenada.|$|E
5|$|The American Bird Conservancy {{designated}} Whitefish Point a Globally Important Bird Area. Whitefish Point's {{land and}} water features create a natural <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> funnels thousands of birds during spring and fall migrations, providing unique opportunities for research, education, and conservation programs. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons, merlins, boreal owls, great gray owls, red-throated loons, red-necked grebes, scoters, and jaegers (also known as skuas) {{are just some of}} the birds that can be seen during migration.|$|E
5|$|The FAA {{temporarily}} closed Airway R-20, the air <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> Korean Air Flight 007 {{was meant}} to follow, on September 2.

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|A {{scenario}} {{consistent with}} the phylogenetic, ice sheet size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> ran along the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is {{consistent with the}} findings of earlier studies.|$|E
5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg <b>corridor)</b> <b>that</b> trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} from1926to1935. Route31 has carried two different {{numbers in the}} past. It was known as Route30 between1927and1953, when it was renumbered to Route69 to avoid conflicting with US30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number69. There were plans made in the late1960s and early1970s to build a freeway in the Route31 <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> would begin in the Trenton area and extend {{as far north as}} Interstate84 (I-84) in Port Jervis, New York; however, it was canceled in the mid-1970s due to opposition from area residents and environmental and financial constraints. In recent years, the portion of Route31 between Flemington and Clinton has been widened to four lanes. In addition, there was a failed project to build a bypass of Flemington that would have also eliminated the Flemington Circle.|$|E
5|$|Constructed to Cubitt's own designs, the new mansion had a {{very similar}} style to that of Osborne House. Cubitt's {{attention}} to detail was such that he even manufactured his own bricks at a brickworks he {{set up for the}} purpose, using lime extracted from the chalk quarries on {{the eastern edge of the}} estate. Almost one hundred rooms made up the Italianate structure's three storeys, stretching across nine bays in a square formation. Cubitt contrived his own form of soundproofing by concealing seashells between levels. The flat roof was edged with a parapet embellished with balustrades, and a matching decoration was incorporated round the first floor, both made from Portland stone. Gibbs surrounds were used on the windows on the ground floor whereas triangular pediments featured on the windows included on the three central canted bays of the first floor. Segmented pediments adorned all the remaining windows. The water supply was provided by the well installed by Tyers, which was close to the southeast corner of the new mansion, via a <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> spanned the entire outside of the mansion. The entrance had an attached porte-cochère enabling visitors to gain undercover access to the outer hall directly from their transport.|$|E
5|$|MD 30 {{originated}} in the colonial era {{as part of a}} wagon road connecting the fledgling port of Baltimore with the new settlement that was to become Hanover. This highway was improved as a turnpike in the 19th century. MD 30 was constructed as a state road by the Maryland State Roads Commission in the late 1910s and early 1920s, and it became one of the original state-numbered highways in 1927. The state highway was relocated and widened near Reisterstown in the late 1930s and along the rest of its route in the early 1950s. The Hampstead Bypass was planned as early as the 1960s to ameliorate the increasing congestion along the MD 30 <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> was only exacerbated when I-795 was completed to Reisterstown in the late 1980s. However, the construction of the bypass was continually delayed due to environmental issues and politics. The bypass was finally constructed between 2006 and 2009; the old highway through Hampstead became MD 30 Business. A MD 30 bypass of Manchester has also been discussed since the 1960s, but the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) has no plans to construct the new highway in the foreseeable future.|$|E

5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative {{that came out of the}} study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E
5|$|Then, in 1957, {{the northernmost}} part of present SR57 {{was added to}} the state highway system as part of Route 240, which the {{legislature}} designated along the route planned for I-210. This became part of the proposed Temescal Freeway, later the Corona Freeway; a southerly extension of the Orange Freeway to Legislative Route 60 (SR 1) near Huntington Beach was added in 1959 as Route273. Also in 1959, the legislature created Route272, extending the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, completing the proposed freeway <b>corridor</b> <b>that</b> is now SR57. When the entire route, except Route240 which was still part of I-210, was redesignated SR57 in the 1964 renumbering, none of these proposed freeways had been built; the only constructed segment was the old surface road from Fullerton towards Pomona. The part of old Route19 east of Route272 became part of SR 60. As part of the same renumbering, Route180 on State College Boulevard became Route250, which was amended the next year to provide for its deletion once that portion of the SR57 freeway was completed (between I-5 and SR 91).|$|E
