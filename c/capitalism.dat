5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and <b>capitalism,</b> which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of <b>Capitalism</b> {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern <b>capitalism</b> (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient <b>capitalism,</b> which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of <b>capitalism</b> in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} of <b>capitalism</b> {{and discussion of}} the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of <b>capitalism</b> is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in <b>capitalism</b> since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} new stage, state monopoly <b>capitalism.</b> He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly <b>capitalism</b> existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E
5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that <b>capitalism</b> caused war. He argued that if <b>capitalism</b> were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and {{a high degree of}} freedom of trade), then this system of managed <b>capitalism</b> could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later {{to the creation of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E

5|$|Many scholars, however, have {{disagreed}} with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that <b>capitalism</b> {{did not begin}} with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy. In Milan, Venice and Florence, the small city-state governments {{led to the development}} of the earliest forms of <b>capitalism.</b> In the 16th century, Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland. Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of <b>capitalism</b> by leading to the development of the labour theory of value.|$|E

This world-ecological practice of ecorational instrumentality – i. e. of nature domination {{in the name of}} “Nature” – presents a remedy for <b>capitalism’s</b> crisis that is itself crisis-ridden, enacting a central tension of ecocapitalism: that between “conservation” and “development”. This epistemic-institutional tension is traced through the preconditions, modes and effects of ecotourism in Laos by gradually zooming from the most general scale of societal nature relations into the most detailed intricacies of ecotouristic practice. The combination of Bourdieu, Marx and Critical Theory enables a systematic analysis of the recreational frontier as enactment of various contradictions deriving from the “false-and-real” Nature/Society dualism.

5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In <b>capitalism,</b> this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, <b>capitalism</b> produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under <b>capitalism,</b> owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple <b>capitalism</b> and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between <b>capitalism</b> and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates <b>capitalism</b> to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and <b>Capitalism,</b> the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of <b>Capitalism</b> should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, {{a debate}} on the {{national}} question in Europe opened up between {{the majority of the}} SWP and a movement led by Van Heijenoort, Albert Goldman and Felix Morrow. This minority anticipated that the Nazi dictatorship would be replaced with <b>capitalism</b> rather than by a socialist revolution, leading to the revival of Stalinism and social democracy. In December 1943, they criticised the SWP's view as underestimating the rising prestige of Stalinism and the opportunities for the capitalists to use democratic concessions. The SWP's central committee argued that democratic <b>capitalism</b> could not revive, resulting in either military dictatorship by the capitalists or a workers' revolution. It held that this would reinforce the need for building the Fourth International, and adhered rigidly to their interpretation of Trotsky's works.|$|E

5|$|In all, the Renaissance {{could be}} viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of <b>capitalism.</b> This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of <b>capitalism</b> invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.|$|E
