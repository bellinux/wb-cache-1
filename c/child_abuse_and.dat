5|$|The {{world of}} comic strips saw {{a number of}} works pop up. Ben Wicks was doing The Outsiders and Wicks, Jim Unger's Herman debuted in 1975, and Ted Martin's Pavlov in 1979. In 1978, Lynn Johnston, living in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, began For Better or For Worse, which was noted for {{following}} {{the lives of the}} Patterson family as they grew older in real time, and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the midlife crisis, divorce, the coming out of a gay character, <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> death.

5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do nothing to prevent <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

40|$|Background Public child {{healthcare}} {{doctors and}} nurses, and primary school teachers play {{a pivotal role}} in the detection <b>and</b> reporting of <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> because they encounter almost all children in the population during their daily work. However, they report relatively few cases of suspected <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> to <b>child</b> protective agencies. The aim of this qualitative study was to investigate Dutch frontline workers’ <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> detection <b>and</b> reporting behaviors. Methods Focus group interviews were held among 16 primary school teachers and 17 public health nurses and physicians. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed according to factors of the Integrated Change model, such as knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, skills, social influences and barriers influencing detection <b>and</b> reporting of <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> Results Findings showed that although both groups of professionals are aware of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> signs <b>and</b> risks, they are also lacking specific knowledge. The most salient differences between the two professional groups are related to attitude and (communication) skills). Conclusion The results suggest that frontline workers are in need of supportive tools in the <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> detection <b>and</b> reporting process. On the basis of our findings, directions for improvement of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> detection <b>and</b> reporting are discussed...|$|R
