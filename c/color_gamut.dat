5|$|HDMI 1.3 was {{released}} on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340MHz (10.2Gbit/s). Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16Gbit/s (1920×1080 at 120Hz or 2560×1440 at 60Hz). It added support for 10bpc, 12bpc, and 16bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, {{in addition to the}} Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining <b>color</b> <b>gamut</b> boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio syncing (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25 MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz. It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices.|$|E
25|$|Color performance: There are {{multiple}} terms to describe {{different aspects of}} color performance of a display. <b>Color</b> <b>gamut</b> is the range of colors that can be displayed, and color depth, which is the fineness with which the color range is divided. <b>Color</b> <b>gamut</b> is a relatively straight forward feature, but it is rarely discussed in marketing materials except at the professional level. Having a color range that exceeds the content being shown on the screen has no benefits, so displays are only made to perform within or below the range of a certain specification. There are additional aspects to LCD color and color management, such as white point and gamma correction, which describe what color white is and how the other colors are displayed relative to white.|$|E
25|$|Computer graphic {{techniques}} {{capable of}} rendering high-contrast scenes shifted the focus from color to luminance {{as the main}} limiting factor of display devices. Several tone mapping operators were developed to map high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard displays. More recently, this work has branched away from utilizing luminance to extend image contrast and towards other methods such as user-assisted image reproduction. Currently, image reproduction has shifted towards display-driven solutions since displays now possess advanced image processing algorithms that help adapt rendering of the image to viewing conditions, save power, up-scale <b>color</b> <b>gamut</b> and dynamic range.|$|E
40|$|Software {{has been}} {{developed}} to help engineers visualize the <b>gamuts</b> of <b>color</b> hardcopy devices. Software modules have been written so that <b>color</b> <b>gamuts</b> and <b>color</b> space transformations can be explored using a scientific visualization program. Tools have been created that allow the user to accentuate the differences between gamuts and {{to interact with the}} displayed data. The data flow architecture of the program makes it easy to add more <b>color</b> <b>gamuts</b> and to investigate additional color transformations...|$|R

This makes it easy to, for example, describe the possible <b>colors</b> (<b>gamut)</b> that can be constructed from the red, green, and blue primaries in a computer display.|$|R
25|$|CCFL: The LCD {{panel is}} lit either by two cold cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps placed at opposite {{edges of the}} display or an array of parallel CCFLs behind larger displays. A diffuser then spreads the light out evenly across the whole display. For many years, this technology had been used almost exclusively. Unlike white LEDs, most CCFLs have an even-white spectral output resulting in better <b>color</b> <b>gamut</b> for the display. However, CCFLs are less energy efficient than LEDs and require a somewhat costly inverter to convert whatever DC voltage the device uses (usually 5 or 12V) to ~1000 V needed to light a CCFL. The thickness of the inverter transformers also limits how thin the display can be made.|$|E
25|$|Still {{searching for}} a single-tube {{solution}} that was bright enough for direct viewing, in 1942 Baird hit upon the Telechrome concept. His solution was essentially to combine two tubes into one large spherical enclosure. In {{the center of the}} enclosure was a translucent mica sheet forming the display, covered on one side with cyan phosphor, the other with an orange-red color, producing a limited but useful <b>color</b> <b>gamut.</b> Two electron guns arranged {{on either side of the}} screen fired at it, producing the two colors. The image was viewed from one side, seeing one of the colors directly and the other being transmitted through the screen from the other side. This was the first single-tube color television system.|$|E

The 15-inch models include a discrete Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 graphics card {{in addition to the}} integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys, and has only two USB-C ports.

500|$|Reviewers {{lamented the}} loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its {{brightness}} was turned all the way up. CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: [...] "According to Apple, the new display offers a wider <b>color</b> <b>gamut,</b> and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions." [...] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15" [...] and 17" [...] models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized. The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.|$|E
500|$|At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was {{announced}} that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro, leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line. It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro. The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity. Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use, while others reported around six hours. Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80percent of their capacity. Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU. The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60percent greater <b>color</b> <b>gamut.</b> All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot. The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot. For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to {{the right side of the}} chassis.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} tetra-chroma {{display unit}} that has, {{in contrast to}} the contemporary trichromatic displays, four primary colors. Extra fourth cyan light allows better reproduction not only region of cyan colors but also, thanks to advanced position of green primary light, orange and yellow colors. These both regions are printable through modern inkjet printers. Colorimetric driving is discussed in detail and also reproduction on the basis of spectral matching isn’t omitted.

2500|$|The {{number of}} color receptors determines the {{minimum number of}} {{primaries}} needed to produce a <b>color</b> <b>gamut</b> that spans a reasonable fraction of the perceptible color space. [...] Thus for trichromats like humans, we use three (or more) primaries for most general purposes. [...] Two primaries {{would be unable to}} produce even some of the most common among the named colors. Adding a reasonable choice of third primary can drastically increase the available gamut, while adding a fourth or fifth may increase the gamut but typically not by as much.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{official}} RGB definition for the colors, because its <b>color</b> <b>gamut</b> is too narrow.

The yellow color actually lies outside the sRBG colorspace. The blue color is called [...] "sea blue", {{which is a}} dark to medium blue.

50|$|In practice, photographers {{almost always}} use {{relative}} or perceptual intent, as for natural images, absolute causes color cast, while saturation produces unnatural colors.
