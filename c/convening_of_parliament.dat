25|$|Isolated {{strands of}} liberal thought had existed in Western {{philosophy}} since the Ancient Greeks and in Eastern philosophy since the Song and Ming period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized {{as a distinct}} ideology, by the English philosopher John Locke, generally regarded {{as the father of}} modern liberalism. The first major signs of liberal politics emerged in modern times. These ideas began to coalesce {{at the time of the}} English Civil Wars. The Levellers, a radical political movement, during the war called for freedom of religion, frequent <b>convening</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the 17th century in England, culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined parliamentary sovereignty and the right of revolution and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state. The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several European monarchies throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its American colonies grew after 1765 and the Seven Years' War over the issue of taxation without representation, culminating in the Declaration of Independence of a new republic, and the resulting American Revolutionary War to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The Articles of Confederation, written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The Confederation Congress called a Constitutional Convention in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new Constitution of the United States establishing a federal government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document. It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.|$|E
60|$|When Phineas {{returned}} to London, the autumn Session, {{though it had}} been carried on so near to Christmas as to make many members very unhappy, had already been over for a fortnight. Mr. Daubeny had played his game with consummate skill to the last. He had brought in no bill, but had stated his intention of doing so early in the following Session. He had, he said, of course been aware from the first {{that it would have been}} quite impossible to carry such a measure as that proposed during the few weeks in which it had been possible for them to sit between the <b>convening</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> and the Christmas holidays; but he thought that it was expedient that the proposition should be named to the House and ventilated as it had been, so that members on both sides might be induced to give their most studious attention to the subject before a measure, which must be so momentous, should be proposed to them. As had happened, the unforeseen division to which the House had been pressed on the Address had proved that the majority of the House was in favour of the great reform which it was the object of his ambition to complete. They were aware that they had been assembled at a somewhat unusual and inconvenient period of the year, because the service of the country had demanded that certain money bills should be passed. He, however, rejoiced greatly that this earliest opportunity had been afforded to him of explaining the intentions of the Government with which he had the honour of being connected. In answer to this there arose a perfect torrent of almost vituperative antagonism from the opposite side of the House. Did the Right Honourable gentleman dare to say that the question had been ventilated in the country, when it had never been broached by him or any of his followers till after the general election had been completed? Was it not notorious to the country that the first hint of it had been given when the Right Honourable gentleman was elected for East Barsetshire, and was it not equally notorious that that election had been so arranged that the marvellous proposition of the Right Honourable gentleman should not be known even to his own party till there remained no possibility of the expression of any condemnation from the hustings? It might be that the Right Honourable could so rule his own followers in that House as to carry them with him even in a matter so absolutely opposite to their own most cherished convictions. It certainly seemed that he had succeeded in doing so for the present. But would any one believe that he would have carried the country, had he dared to face the country with such a measure in his hands? Ventilation, indeed! He had not dared to ventilate his proposition. He had used this short Session in order that he might keep his clutch fastened on power, and in doing so was indifferent alike to the Constitution, to his party, and to the country. Harder words had never been spoken in the House than were uttered on this occasion. But the Minister was successful. He had been supported on the Address; and he went home to East Barsetshire at Christmas, perhaps with some little fear of the parsons around him; but with a full conviction that he would at least carry the second reading of his bill.|$|E

50|$|Ayub Khan was {{replaced}} by general Yahya Khan who became the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Khan organized the Pakistani general election, 1970. The 1970 Bhola cyclone {{was one of the}} deadliest natural disasters of the 20th century. The cyclone claimed half a million lives. The disastrous affects of the cyclone caused huge resentment against the federal government. After a decade of military rule, East Pakistan was a hotbed of Bengali nationalism. There were open calls for self-determination. When the federal general election was held, the Awami League emerged as the single largest party in the Pakistani parliament. The League won 167 out of 169 seats in East Pakistan, thereby crossing the half way mark of 150 in the 300-seat National Assembly of Pakistan. In theory, this gave the League the right to form a government under the Westminster tradition. But the League failed to win a single seat in West Pakistan, where the Pakistan Peoples Party emerged as the single largest party with 81 seats. The military junta stalled the transfer of power and conducted prolonged negotiations with the League. A civil disobedience movement erupted across East Pakistan demanding the <b>convening</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament.</b> Rahman announced a struggle for independence from Pakistan during a speech on 7 March 1971. Between 7-26 March, East Pakistan was virtually under the popular control of the Awami League. On Pakistan's Republic Day on 23 March 1971, the first flag of Bangladesh was hoisted in many East Pakistani households. The Pakistan Army launched a crackdown on 26 March, including Operation Searchlight and the 1971 Dhaka University massacre. This led to the Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence. As the Bangladesh Liberation War and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide continued for nine months, East Pakistani military units like the East Bengal Regiment and the East Pakistan Rifles defected to form the Bangladesh Forces. The Provisional Government of Bangladesh allied with neighboring India which intervened in the final two weeks of the war and secured the surrender of Pakistan.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the position of Reformed theology, Calvinist feature on the theme of the prayer for the dead, present in the Westminster Confession of Faith (1647). The document served as the doctrinal and confessional manual of the Reformed church, drawn up in Westminster Abbey, in England, after <b>convening</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> in the context of disputes between Parliament and King Charles I (1600 - 1649, king since 1625). The text was drafted by theologians, in a small system of theology, grounded in the teachings of John Calvin (1509 - 1564). The document was part of the process of confessionalization of the religion lived by Christianity in the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth century and contributed significantly to the consolidation of the Reformed orthodoxy. The text presented the doctrine in a simple and direct way because it was facing the wide dissemination among the faithful. On the topic of the prayer for the dead, in the Westminster Confession, Chapter XXI, Section IV, is explicit that "the prayer should be made for lawful things, and for all classes of men that currently exist or will exist in the future, but not for the dead. " This doctrinal postulated was consolidated in the Christian Reformed tradition since then. The text had conformed the presbyterianism, distinguishing it from Catholic ecclesiology. Análise da posição da teologia reformada, de feição calvinista, sobre o tema da oração pelos mortos, presente na Confissão de Fé de Westminster (1647). O documento serviu de manual doutrinal e confessional da Igreja reformada, redigido na Abadia de Westminster, na Inglaterra, após convocação do Parlamento, no contexto das disputas entre o Parlamento e o rei Carlos I (1600 - 1649, rei desde 1625). O texto foi elaborado por teólogos, no formato de um pequeno sistema de teologia, ancorado nos ensinamentos de João Calvino. O documento fez parte do processo de confessionalização da religião vivido pelo cristianismo na segunda metade do século XVI e na primeira metade do século XVII e contribuiu significativamente para a consolidação da ortodoxia reformada. O texto apresentava a doutrina de maneira simples e direta porque era voltado à ampla divulgação entre os fiéis. Sobre o tema da oração pelos mortos, na Confissão de Westminster, Cap. XXI, Seção IV, está explicitado que “a oração deve ser feita por coisas lícitas e por todas as classes de homens que existem atualmente ou que existirão no futuro; mas não pelos mortos”. Este postulado doutrinário se consolidou na tradição cristã reformada a partir de então. O texto acabou conformando o presbiterianismo, distinguindo-o da eclesiologia católica.  ...|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after the}} First English Civil War, the Agreement {{was the subject}} of the Putney Debates in 1647.
