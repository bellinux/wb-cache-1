The hash function makes it possible to compress data into a fixed length and avoid data <b>collision.</b> <b>Sensor</b> nodes only need to store a few keys and a hash function at a time, reducing the memory requirements of sensor nodes and ensuring key security.|$|E

This system works using pressure sensor, GPS and GSM technology. These technology embedded together to sense the vehicle collision and indicate {{the position of the}} vehicle or locate the place of accident in order to solve the problem immediately (as soon as possible). For doing so AT 89 S 52 microcontroller is interfaced serially to a GSM modem, GPS receiver, and pressure sensor. A GSM modem is used to send the position (Latitude and Longitude) of the vehicle, the plate of the vehicle and the SMS text from the accident place. The GPS modem will continuously give the data (longitude and latitude) and Load sensor senses the collision of the vehicle against obstacles and input to microcontroller. As load sensor senses the collision, the GSM start to send the plate of the vehicle, text message and the position of the vehicle in terms of latitude and longitude in real time...|$|E
40|$|Collision {{detection}} is {{a fundamental}} issue {{for the safety of}} a robotic cell. While several common methods require specific sensors or the knowledge of the robot dynamic model, the proposed solution is constituted by a virtual <b>collision</b> <b>sensor</b> for industrial manipulators, which requires as inputs only the motor currents measured by the standard sensors that equip a manipulator and the estimated currents provided by an internal dynamic model of the robot (i. e., the one used inside its controller), whose structure, parameters and accuracy are not known. The collision detection is achieved by comparing the absolute value of the current residue with a time-varying, positive-valued threshold function, including an estimate of the model error and a bias term, corresponding to the minimum collision torque to be detected. The value of such a term, defining the sensor sensitivity, can be simply imposed as constant, or automatically customized for a specific robotic application through a learning phase and a subsequent adaptation process, to achieve a more robust and faster collision detection, as well as the avoidance of any false collision warnings, even in case of slow variations of the robot behavior. Experimental results are provided to confirm the validity of the proposed solution, which is already adopted in some industrial scenarios...|$|E

First of all, {{a study on the}} required performances for the anti collision sensors was carried out. Requirements were critically reviewed considering flight dynamics models of the typical collision scenarios. The study included requirements on all sensor characteristics related to the anti-collision function such as resolutions coming from flying obstacle relative velocity and dimensions, field of regard, timing, and obstacle revisit rate. The requirements on sensor resolutions were discussed considering typical obstacle dimensions and flight envelopes. In addition, the dynamical correlation between sensor measurement rate and resolutions was modeled. The second step of the design process was to select sensors that fulfilled the estimated theoretical performances. The resulting sensor configuration included an active microwave anti-collision system, two visible cameras, and two infra-red sensors that allowed for increased performances in terms of angular resolution and measurement rate along with day/night and all weather capabilities. Subsequently, the system logic architecture was developed. The assigned system goal was to realize the detection, tracking, and identification of up to four obstacles that were simultaneously sensed in the Field of Regard. Standing the multiple sensor approach, sensor fusion architecture was developed for each one of the functions reported above. Multiple mode operation was determined depending on the number and on the type of sensors that could detect an obstacle at the same time. Flight tests will be carried out to demonstrate system capability with scaled performances by installing a selected set of sensors onboard a lightweight aircraft...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Classical motion {{planners}} {{and most of}} navigation routines discard dynamics {{of the system and}} therefore fail in some special conditions. If a robot is moving towards an obstacle with a high acceleration and speed, collision is inevitable because the obstacles are taken into account only either once they are in range, or a physical collision is reported by detection routines. In this paper, we have introduced a new approach named T-Bone Algorithm, that considers kinematics of an extended case of a Dubins car moving in a static environment, in order to avoid potential collisions, however it inherently can be extended for more complex systems. This method deforms the perception of the <b>collision</b> <b>sensors</b> – which traditionally discard dynamics of the system and only consider physical appearance of the obstacles. Deformed state space is then fed into the planner and navigation unit in order to move the vehicle, safely. Bounded complexity of the algorithm makes it proper to be used in realtime applications.

40|$|International audienceUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{have become}} very {{affordable}} and small in recent years, and are increasingly used {{in a wide range}} of monitoring and surveillance applications. A major problem when operating with swarm of UAVs is the risk of mid-air <b>collisions.</b> <b>Sensor</b> technology to detect other aircrafts in order to prevent collisions currently receives a lot of attention in the research community. Therefore acoustic technologies could play an important role in anti-collision systems for small lightweight UAVs. Since most of aircrafts rely on active propulsion using propellers or jets, they emit noise which reveals their presence and position. It is therefore possible to detect the range and the bearing of other aircraft to avoid collisions without relying on active communication within the swarm. Because acoustic sensing is passive, relatively small, cheap, and low power consuming, the work is focused on the design of microphone array and its on-board processing to deliver anti-collision alerts. But tracking acoustic sources in air faces number of substantial challenges because of low signal to noise ratio of the surrounding aircrafts noises compared to the self noise of the equipped listening UAV. In this context we therefore concentrate on self-noise reduction techniques for on board microphone array processing...|$|R

40|$|Most {{artificial}} learning systems converge after {{a certain}} number of interations but the final weight distribution cannot be predicted or calculated from the initatial conditions. In several cases general boundary conditions can be devised to guarantee convergence (e. g. Hopfield networks). In this study we use the Isotropic Sequence Order (ISO) learning rule to show that the final weights of an agent which learns in complex environment can be calculated analytically. The ISO learning rule is a differential Hebbian learning rule for temporal sequence learning. Weight change is defined as the correlation between the band-pass filtered input ui and the derivative of the output v: dρi/dt = μ ui v ´ where μ is the learning rate. Ultimately the temporal difference between two input signals T drives the learning (Fig. 1 a). In our experiments we use a simulated robot with vision and <b>collision</b> <b>sensors</b> to this end. The robot has a built-in retraction reflex as soon as it touches an obstacle. Its goal is to avoid this by using the signals from its vision sensors for steering.

Subsequent simulation to be verified were: Demonstrate the ability to detect cooperative traffic and provide situational awareness to the ROA pilot; Demonstrate the ability to track the detected cooperative traffic and provide position information to the ROA pilot; Demonstrate the ability to determine collision potential with detected cooperative traffic and provide notification to the ROA pilot; Demonstrate that the CCA subsystem provides information in sufficient time for the ROA pilot to initiate an evasive maneuver to avoid collision; Demonstrate an evasive maneuver that avoids collision with the threat aircraft; and lastly, Demonstrate the ability to assess {{the adequacy of the}} maneuver and determine that the collision potential has been avoided.
