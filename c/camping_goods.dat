50|$|The Kiowa were patrilineal with a chiefdom {{living in}} semi-{{sedentary}} structures. They were hunters and gatherers, meaning {{they did not}} live in one area long enough to grow plants or crops, but did trade with sedentary tribes that grew crops. The Kiowas migrated with the American bison because it was their main food source along with an abundant supply of antelope, deer, wild berries, wild fruit, turkeys and other wild game. Dogs dragged travois and rawhide parfleche that contained <b>camping</b> <b>goods</b> for short moves that were {{for long periods of}} time. With the introduction of the horse, the Kiowa revolutionized their economy and when they arrived on the Plains they were a fully mounted warrior nation. The horses were acquired from Spanish rancherias south of the Rio Grande. The new Kiowa and Plains Apache homeland lay in the southwestern plains adjacent to the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado and western Kansas and the Red River drainage of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1970 by Joe Montgomery and Murdock MacGregor to {{manufacture}} precast concrete housing. Later Ron Davis came to Cannondale from CBS Laboratories where he was VP {{in charge of the}} development of microfilm reproduction. Ron, a polymath and a gifted mechanical designer/inventor, had ideas for an internal combustion engine that would use ammonia as fuel. Such a concept, if proved, could have far-reaching effects in warfare logistics and middle-eastern politics. Davis, with MacGregor as assistant, had some surprising success. They managed to duplicate and exceed results obtained by Allison Engine, then a division of General Motors. Faced with a commitment to invest a large amount of capital to take the project to a workable model installed in an automobile, Joe decided that the company should raise capital by developing and marketing other products that they had conceived. By now MacGregor and Davis had recruited two more CBS Laboratory alumni: John Wistrand, an award-winning Industrial Designer, and Jim Catrambone, a rising management star. A highly advanced air conditioner with no moving parts was a first effort. Then Joe Montgomery, after a camping bike trip with his son, conceived the Bugger bicycle trailer. Ron Davis devised the under-seat hitch, a torsion spring made of Lexan. Wistrand designed the cloth bags and cargo carrier on the two models of trailers. Joe, in an effort repeated in numerous products, sourced the cloth components, and ensured perfection in their manufacture. A trip to the Bicycle Show in New York was an eye opener. The team was besieged by bike dealers wanting to buy the bags. They bought trailers too, but really wanted the bags. In less than six months Cannondale became the world's largest manufacturer of lightweight bicycle bags. Using a marketing plan devised by Montgomery, Cannondale swept across the US, securing orders from more than 2500 dealers in less than 20 months. They then used the infrastructure developed to produce the bags to enter the <b>camping</b> <b>goods</b> market with backpacks and tents. When Todd Patterson, another exceptional designer/inventor, came aboard and developed the process for jigging and welding aluminum bike frames Cannondale became a serious manufacturer of bicycles. One of the most successful products was the Bugger, a child trailer, although Cannondale's marketing department claimed to be unaware of the connotations of the name in British English (some were, nevertheless, exported to the UK). Today, Cannondale produces many different types of high-end bicycles, which are no longer hand-made in the US. They specialize in aluminum (rather than steel or titanium) and carbon fiber frames, a technology in which they were pioneers. The name of the company was taken from the Cannondale Metro North train station in Wilton, Connecticut.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between technology and its social and cultural context by examining {{the ways in which}} changing ideas and attitudes about camp vehicles and leisure camping shaped recreational vehicle technology. It focuses on the period, roughly 1890 to 1960, when leisure camping and recreational vehicles were in their formative years, when American popular culture publications celebrated recreational vehicle travel, and when recreational vehicle manufacturing matured into a dynamic, billion-dollar industry. Looking at what social values and ideas prompted the selection of a technology, and second, what new values and ideas may have then prompted the shift from one technology to another, this study examines two different but related topics [...] -recreational camping and recreational vehicle technology. It contends that changes in the former led to changes in the latter.;This study recounts the roots of recreational camping and America 2 ̆ 7 s relation to the pastoral landscape to show that as 2 ̆ 2 the art of camping 2 ̆ 2 became more popular, and accessible, equipment manufacturers and suppliers worked to advance new ideas in <b>camping</b> <b>goods.</b> The role of the automobile is emphasized to document distinct changes that occurred in leisure-time camping once increased individual mobility via the automobile came to the fore.

The role of select engineers and modern designers in establishing the trailer coach industry and advancing new ideas are discussed as well as the role of aircraft technology, aeronautical engineering, and technological transfer.;Americans used a variety of recreational vehicles and camping equipment to fulfill their autocamping needs. New designs and materials, sometimes borrowed from railroad, automobile, and aircraft manufacturing, reflected the desires of users and the efforts of businesses in meeting those changing needs. What began with a few manufacturers supplying tents and camp paraphernalia, within fifty years developed into a dynamic industry producing an array of products for a diverse American market including tent-trailers, auto-conversions, trailer coaches, fifth-wheel trailers, truck campers, and motor homes.
