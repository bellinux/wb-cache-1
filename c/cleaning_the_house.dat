25|$|Vietnamese people {{celebrate}} the Lunar New Year annually, {{which is based}} on a lunisolar calendar (calculating both the earth's movement around the sun and the moon around the earth). Tết is generally celebrated on the same day as Chinese New Year, except when the one-hour time difference between Vietnam and China results in new moon occurring on different days. It takes place from {{the first day of the}} first month of the Vietnamese calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day. Many Vietnamese prepare for Tết by cooking special holiday food and <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> These foods include bánh chưng, bánh dày, dried young bamboo soup (canh măng), giò, and sticky rice. Many customs are practices during Tết, such as visiting a person's house on the first day of the new year (xông nhà), ancestor worship, wishing New Year's greetings, giving lucky money to children and elderly people, and opening a shop.|$|E
500|$|The second {{method of}} {{valuation}} uses replacement costs. [...] In simple terms, {{this is done}} by measuring {{the amount of money}} a third-party would make for doing the same work if {{it was part of the}} market. [...] In other words, the value of a person <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in an hour is the same as the hourly wage for a maid. [...] Within this method there are two approaches: the first is a generalist replacement cost method, which examines if [...] "it would be possible, for example, to take the wage of a general domestic worker who could perform a variety of tasks including childcare". The second approach is the specialist replacement cost method, which aims to [...] "distinguish between the different household tasks and choose replacements accordingly".|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were more}} critical of the song's production and Fantasia's vocals. On the nationally syndicated Rickey Smiley Morning Show, Rickey Smiley criticized it as [...] "more of a filler record that you have on while you're <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> or washing dishes". He said that the singer lacked the vocal acrobatics of her performance of [...] "Superwoman" [...] (1989) at the 2015 Soul Train Music Awards. According to Mike Wass, [...] "No Time for It" [...] did not command attention {{on the first hearing}} and lacked the pop hooks of the album track [...] "Ugly". Kevin Apaza of Direct Lyrics criticized the song as safe and predictable, called its production dated, and felt that Fantasia was [...] "sleeping on her laurels". Apaza suggested that Fantasia or RCA release a remix with Kelly Rowland or another female R singer to [...] "prevent this single [...] fall quick into oblivion". In Entertainment Weekly, Chuck Arnold criticized [...] "No Time for It" [...] for [...] "gloss over the grit of Fantasia's voice" [...] and cited it {{as an example of the}} album's uneven sound.|$|E

50|$|On March 28, 2013, a $750 million {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Whirlpool, other {{companies}} suspected of also dumping toxic waste at the park, {{and the family}} who currently owns the property that was formerly Whirlpool Park. This lawsuit, Wendy Brown, et al. v. Whirlpool Corporation, consisted of 27 plaintiffs, including both Wendy and Warren Brown. The amount sought was for <b>the</b> expenses of <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> containing benzaldehyde and for <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> park, {{as well as the}} damage the cluster caused altogether. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, at the plaintiffs request, in early 2015 with no reason given. Whirlpool promised to rid the property of all toxic waste in August 2015.|$|R
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Stampy's eye is seen through a window of the Simpson family's house {{is similar to a}} scene with a Tyrannosaurus rex in the film Jurassic Park. While <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> Marge turns on the radio and the song [...] "Sixteen Tons" [...] by Merle Travis is heard. The {{scene in which}} Homer crashes his car into a deer statue at the Springfield Tar Pits parodies the lyrics to the Sound of Music song [...] "Do-Re-Mi" [...] as Homer shouts: [...] "D'oh!" [...] {{followed}} by Lisa: [...] "A deer!" [...] and Marge: [...] "A female deer!" [...] Homer reads an old TV Guide in which the synopsis of an episode of Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. reads [...] "Gomer upsets Sgt. Carter", a possible synopsis for every episode of that series. He also imagines the episode with a thought of both Carter and Pyle standing next to each other. Carter yells, [...] "Pyle!" [...] and Pyle responds, [...] "Shazam!". As Stampy wreaks havoc throughout Springfield, Patty and Selma are sucked up by a tornado and fly through the air in rocking chairs, similar to a scene in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

60|$|It so happened, in {{this time}} of extremity, that in the course of <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of the Four Chimneys, by an ignorant {{housewife}} who knew nothing of the historic value of the reliques it contained, the old hat of Walter the Doubter and the executive shoe of Peter the Headstrong were thrown out of doors as rubbish.

60|$|It so chanced that Ralph Nickleby, {{at length}} seeing fit, {{for his own}} purposes, to {{communicate}} the atrocities of which Nicholas had been guilty, had (instead of first proceeding to another quarter of the town on business, as Newman Noggs supposed he would) gone straight to his sister-in-law.

[...] "What's the matter with it?" [...] he growled, as they stood on the perilous stairs dodging up from the kitchen. She commented upon the sloping roof of unplastered boards stained in brown rings by the rain, the uneven floor, the cot and its tumbled discouraged-looking quilts, the broken rocker, the distorting mirror.|$|E

2500|$|Beauford Delaney {{was born}} December 30, 1901 in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States of America. Delaney's parents were {{prominent}} and respected members of Knoxville's black community. His father Samuel {{was both a}} barber and a Methodist minister. His mother Delia was also prominent in the church, and earned a living taking in laundry and <b>cleaning</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> of prosperous local whites. Delia, born into slavery and never able {{to read and write}} herself, transferred a sense of dignity and self-esteem to her children, and preached to them about the injustices of racism and the value of education. Beauford was the eighth of ten children, only four of whom survived into adulthood. He summed up the reasons for this in a journal entry from 1961, saying [...] "so much sickness came from improper places to live – long distances to walk to schools improperly heated… too much work at home – natural conditions common to the poor that take the bright flowers like terrible cold in nature…" ...|$|R
