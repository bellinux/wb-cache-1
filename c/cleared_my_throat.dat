6000|$|The {{official}} {{interpreter of}} the court asked my name, and then spoke it aloud so that all could hear. Supposing that all was now ready, I <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and began--in Chinese, because of my imperfect English: ...|$|E
60|$|This done, {{instead of}} {{returning}} {{the box to}} my pocket I passed the chain through the buttonhole of my cloak and let it dangle on my breast as an ornament. When the cigarette was smoked, I <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> in the orthodox manner and fixed my eyes on Runi, who, on his part, made a slight movement to indicate that {{he was ready to}} listen to what I had to say.|$|E
5000|$|Let Me <b>Clear</b> <b>My</b> <b>Throat</b> is {{the third}} and final studio album by DJ Kool, {{released}} in April 1996 on American Recordings. Let Me <b>Clear</b> <b>My</b> <b>Throat</b> was DJ Kool's most successful album chart-wise, becoming his only one to reach the Billboard 200, where it peaked at 161. The album is best remembered for its title track, [...] "Let Me <b>Clear</b> <b>My</b> Throat", which became Kool's only top-40 hit and reached gold certification for sales of over 500,000 copies. [...] "I Got Dat Feelin'," [...] which sampled Naughty by Nature's [...] "Uptown Anthem", also made it to the Billboard charts.|$|R

6000|$|There {{are moments}} in a chappie's life, don't you know, when Reason, so to speak, totters, as it were, on its bally throne. This {{was one of}} them. The {{situation}} seemed somehow to have got out of my grip. I suppose, strictly speaking, I ought, at this juncture, to have <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and said in an audible tone, [...] "Harold, old top, I know where Ponsonby is." [...] But somehow I couldn't. Something seemed to keep the words back. I just stood there and said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> of a huskiness which {{prevented}} speech. “Hump,” he said slowly, “you can’t do it. You are {{not exactly}} afraid. You are impotent. Your conventional morality is stronger than you. You are the slave to the opinions which have credence among the people you have known and have read about. Their code has been drummed into your head {{from the time you}} lisped, and in spite of your philosophy, and of what I have taught you, it won’t let you kill an unarmed, unresisting man.” ...|$|E
60|$|Being thus invited, I {{consented to}} spin them a yarn. The old gentleman settled {{himself in his}} chair, my mother {{smoothed}} her apron, folded her hands, and looked meekly into my face. Tom Lokins filled his pipe, stretched out his foot to poke the fire {{with the toe of}} his shoe, and began to smoke like a steam-engine; then I <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and began my tale, and before I had done talking that night, I had told them all that I have told in this little book, almost word for word.|$|E
50|$|The track Horndog was {{released}} {{as a single}} from this album. The song contains a sample from DJ Kool's Let Me <b>Clear</b> <b>My</b> <b>Throat.</b> Like much of Overseer's work, this track {{has been used for}} commercial purposes such as in the 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor advertisement.|$|R
6000|$|... "But" [...] says I <b>clearing</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> [...] "you have so well {{prepared}} him Major--he has {{had such a}} Tutor in you--that he will have none of the first drudgery to go through. And he is so clever besides that he'll soon make {{his way to the}} front rank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{said it was}} {{an empty}} sleeve?' he said. 'Certainly,' I said. At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man, unspectacled, starts scratch. Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an age. 'Well?' said I, <b>clearing</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> 'there's nothing in it.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found him}} {{at work on}} a picture, which I was able conscientiously to praise, dressed in his usual tweeds--plain, but pretty fresh, and {{standing}} out in disagreeable contrast to my own withered and degraded outfit. As we talked, he continued to shift his eyes watchfully between his handiwork and the fat model, who sat {{at the far end of}} the studio in a state of nature, with one arm gallantly arched above her head. My errand would have been difficult enough under the best of circumstances: placed between Myner, immersed in his art, and the white, fat, naked female in a ridiculous attitude, I found it quite impossible. Again and again I attempted to approach the point, again and again fell back on commendations of the picture; and it was not until the model had enjoyed an interval of repose, during which she took the conversation in her own hands and regaled us (in a soft, weak voice) with details as to her husband's prosperity, her sister's lamented decline from the paths of virtue, and the consequent wrath of her father, a peasant of stern principles, in the vicinity of Châlons on the Marne--it was not, I say, until after this was over, and I had once more <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> for the attack, and once more dropped aside into some commonplace about the picture, that Myner himself brought me suddenly and vigorously to the point.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{there was}} no carving at that dinner. The dishes were handed round by waiters. First we had very thin rice soup with wine and raisins in it--the eating of which seemed to me like spoiling one's dinner with a bad pudding. This finished, the plates were removed. [...] "Now," [...] thought I, [...] "surely some one will {{converse}} with his neighbour during this interval." [...] No! not a lip moved! I looked at my right and left-hand men; I thought, for a moment, of venturing out upon the unknown deep of a foreign tongue, and <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> for that purpose, but every eye was on me in an instant; {{and the sound of}} my own voice, even in that familiar process, was so appalling that I said nothing! I looked at a pretty girl opposite me. I felt certain that the youth beside her was about to speak--he looked as if he meant to, but he didn't. In a few minutes the next course came on. This was a dish like bread-pudding, minus currants and raisins; it looked like a sweet dish, {{but it turned out to}} be salt,--and pure melted butter, without any admixture of flour or water, was handed round as sauce. After this came veal and beef cutlets, which were eaten with cranberry jam, pickles, and potatoes. Fourth and last came a course of cold sponge-cake, with almonds and raisins stewed over it, so that, when we had eaten the cake as a sort of cold pudding, we slid, naturally and pleasantly, into dessert, without the delay of a change of plates.|$|E
5000|$|Her first essay collection, Let Me <b>Clear</b> <b>My</b> <b>Throat,</b> was {{published}} by Sarabande in 2012. In the book, Passarello writes about famous (and sometimes infamous) voices from cultural history, including the 18th c. castrato Farinelli, punk rock crows, impressionists, the rebel yell, the Wilhelm Scream, the Howard [...] "Dean Scream," [...] Pittsburgh sportscaster Myron Cope's [...] "Yoy!", and Marlon Brando's [...] "Stella!" [...] from A Streetcar Named Desire. Passarello {{was the first woman}} to win the Stella Screaming Contest in New Orleans in 2011.

6000|$|... "Moments {{passed and}} still the Ranger did not come. I began to get nervous. Had he been stopped? I scouted the idea. Who could have stopped him, then? Probably the time seemed longer than it really was. Morton showed the strain, also. Other men looked drawn, haggard, waiting as if expecting a thunderbolt. Once in my roving gaze I caught Blandy's glinty eye on me. I didn't like the gleam. I said to myself I'd watch him if I {{had to do it}} {{out of the back of}} my head. Blandy, by the way, is--was--I should say, the Hope So bartender." [...] I stopped to <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and get <b>my</b> breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, with pleasure," [...] said I. There {{being no}} music about, and no piano, I {{concluded}} naturally that my friends amused themselves with solo songs without accompaniment of an evening, {{and having a}} good tenor voice I was not unwilling to lead off with a song. <b>Clearing</b> <b>my</b> rusty <b>throat</b> with a ghrr-ghrr-hram which made them all jump, I launched forth with the [...] "Vicar of Bray"--a grand old song and a great favorite of mine. They all started when I commenced, exchanging glances, and casting astonished looks towards me; but it was getting so dusky in the room that I could not feel sure that my eyes were not deceiving me. Presently some that were near me began retiring to distant seats, and this distressed me so that it made me hoarse, and my singing became very bad indeed; but still I thought it best to go bravely on to the end. Suddenly the old gentleman, who had been staring wildly at me for some time, drew up his long yellow robe and wrapped it round his face and head. I glanced at Yoletta, sitting at some distance, and saw that she was holding her hands pressed to her ears.|$|R
