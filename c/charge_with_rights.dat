Among recommendations might be mentioned a more balanced ethnic representation among the district representatives, more training, better focus on what are specifically human rights violations, analysis of patterns and trends, and the presentation of information {{in such a way that}} it can be directly followed up by bodies and agencies <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> human <b>rights</b> protection...|$|R

40|$|The National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) is <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{protecting}} workers’ <b>rights</b> through providing {{access to}} collective bargaining and enforcing unfair labor complaints.

But with the Board’s 2014 decision in Pacific Lutheran University, that longstanding de facto moratorium has been called into question. This Note argues that the NLRB’s recently expanded jurisdiction is both inappropriate and likely unconstitutional. Ultimately, this Note recommends voluntary bargaining outside the NLRB framework as a way for the NLRB to avoid unconstitutional entanglement with religious schools and for religious educators to practice what they preach...|$|R

In the two decades that followed, the entire landscape of Central Bombay was changed forever. Land became the currency of growth, and this began the systematic extinction of mills in Bombay.

Since that time many institutions have reorganized the various support and review services connected with human subject research including the IRB as one component of their Human Research Protection Program (HRPP). Similarly to the IRB, these programs have as their primary mission the protection of human research subjects. Some IRB responsibilities such as clinical trial monitoring, investigator and research participant education, and auditing of research records may be shifted to specialized units within the HRPP.
