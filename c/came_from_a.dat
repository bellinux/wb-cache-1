5000|$|Of the ten {{types of}} women in the poem, nine are {{delineated}} as destructive: the dirty woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pig; the cunning woman originates <b>from</b> <b>a</b> fox, the incessantly curious and high-maintenance woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dog, the lazy or apathetic woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> earth or soil, the capricious woman of mood swings <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> seawater, the stubborn woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ass, the untrustworthy and uncontrollable woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> ferret, the overly proud woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mare, and the worst and ugliest type of woman <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ape or monkey.

5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single normal distribution, but in fact <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> exponential distribution, but actually <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at}} the data is required.|$|R
