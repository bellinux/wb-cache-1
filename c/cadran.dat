2500|$|The first luxury {{restaurants}} in Paris had {{opened in the}} Palais-Royal in the 1780s. [...] By {{the time of the}} Restoration, new restaurants had appeared close to the theaters, along the Grand Boulevards and on the Champs Èlysées. [...] The best-known luxury restaurant of the Restoration was the Rocher de Cancale, at the corner of rue Mandar. [...] The elaborate dinners there were described in detail in the novels of Honoré de Balzac. The restaurant Le Veau on the Place de Chatelet was famous for its pieds de mouton. [...] Other famous gastronomic restaurants of the time were Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal and Ledoyen the Champs-Élysées (both still in business), [...] La Galiote and le <b>Cadran</b> bleu on the Boulevard du Temple.|$|E

50|$|Dialing {{scales were}} first {{discussed}} by Samuel Foster in 1638. P. Pierre Bobynet, a Jesuit drew a scale {{in his book}} L'horographie ingenieuse contenant des Connoissances, & Curiositez Agréables dans la composition des <b>Cadrans,</b> in 1647. It was however George Serles 1657 book, Dialling Universal, printed by R & W Leybourn that brought them to popular attention. These scales remained virtually unchanged for 250 years. E. C. Middleton, who had been engraving dialling scales from about 1895, supplied dialling scales accompanied by a typewritten instruction book from Birmingham in 1913- these were the scales calculated by Serle. The North American Sundial Society has printed facsimiles of both the Serle and Middleton books.The Middleton dial appeared without explanation in the 1994 Encyclopedia de Diderot et Alembert (French). Further work has done on these rulers by F.W. Cousins, and by Fred W Sawyer from 1997-2009.|$|R
500|$|The {{company was}} {{acquired}} by Pascal Raffy, its current president, on February 6, 2001. [...] In June 2006, Mr. Raffy purchased several manufacturing structures, such as the STT group, which produced complicated watch movements, {{in order to obtain}} complete control over the quality of all phases of the watch crafting process. STT was renamed Dimier 1738 Manufacture de Haute Horlogerie Artisanale and went into a full restructuring {{over the next two years}} in order to bring the standards up to those of Bovet. The second purchase was a dial and precious gem setting manufacture located in Plan-les-Ouates in Geneva. The name was changed also from Valor, Lopez, et Villa to Dimier 1738 Manufacture Artisanale de <b>Cadrans</b> et de Sertissages. With the same philosophy as the movement factory, Mr. Raffy turned this factory into an artisan center providing dials for Bovet, Dimier's watch brand, and a select group of clients in luxury watchmaking. There are currently about 150 employees of Bovet Fleurier SA and the Dimier manufactures, and the company only produces under 2,000 watches a year. [...] Some modern Bovet watches are fitted with mechanisms manufactured by Vaucher Manufacture, a company that also supplied watches to the Chinese market in the 19th century. [...] Bovet spends very little to advertise and prefers to have private salons for clients instead of attending public fairs. [...] About a third of the watches it manufactures are one-of-a-kind pieces that are made to order.|$|R
