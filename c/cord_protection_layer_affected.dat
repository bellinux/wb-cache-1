The obtained mordenite membranes were applied to the separation of water from water/organic solutions (organic solvents: ethanol, acetone, iso-propanol, or acetic add) using a pervaporation method at temperatures from 60 to 100 degrees C. Water permeance through the mordenite membrane in each water/organic solution system was almost identical regardless of organic solvent types in the feed solution.

40|$|Separation {{of water}} from a water-acetone {{solution}} {{was carried out by}} a pervaporation method using a hydrophilic silicalite- 1 membrane. Silicalite- 1 nanocrystals were piled up on the outer surface of cylindrical alumina ceramic filters, followed by a hydrothermal synthesis to form a silicalite- 1 <b>protection</b> <b>layer</b> oil the nanocrystal layer. In other words, the membrane consisted of a silicalite- 1 nanocrystal layer and a silicalite- 1 <b>protection</b> <b>layer</b> (the nanocrystal-layered membrane). In order to achieve high hydrophilic properties of the membrane with the remaining silanol group, the liquid-phase oxidation technique was applied to remove the template. From the SEM observation, the nanocrystal <b>layer</b> and the <b>protection</b> <b>layer</b> were clearly observed, and the silicalitc- 1 <b>protection</b> <b>layer</b> was uniformly formed on the nanocrystal layer. Pervaporation experiments to separate water from the water-acetone solution were conducted using the nanocrystal-layered membrane. It was considered that the secondary growth of the nanocrystals around the interface between the nanocrystal and <b>protection</b> <b>layers</b> <b>affected</b> the separation properties. The effects of the nanocrystal size oil the separation properties were examined. The membrane exhibited selective permeation as well as a high flux of water, and these properties were improved with a decrease {{in the size of the}} nanocrystals. Moreover, the layered membrane exhibited high hydrophilic properties regardless of the acetone concentrations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA hazard {{and risk}} {{analysis}} (H&RA) of events or systems, which have multiple preventive or mitigative safety features, usually requires the application of redundancy rules in order {{to arrive at a}} credible answer. The process industry typically refers to these preventive or mitigative safety features as <b>protection</b> <b>layers.</b> Aggregate system safety performance assessments can become complicated because of the application of those redundancy rules to the individual <b>protection</b> <b>layers.</b> In industrial engineering settings there is a desire to simplify such assessments. A first simplification can be readily done by expanding the e–λt series, of the individual reliability functions, and using only the first two terms. This is acceptable when λt is small enough; e. g., (λt < 0. 01 but places a ceiling condition on the product of λ and the proof test interval, T, which is a maintenance variable. A second simplification is made by using the average probability of failure upon demand (PFDavg = 0. 5 λt) of a <b>protection</b> <b>layer</b> as a true probability in probability calculations, regardless of exposure time restrictions. A third simplification occurs when a system, which consists of several parallel redundant <b>protection</b> <b>layers,</b> has its system PFD determined by a simple multiplication of the PFDavg's of the individual <b>protection</b> <b>layers.</b> Industrial H&RAs are usually conducted without reference to any of the implied simplifications.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{reviewed}} the {{morbidity and mortality}} of surgical resection of the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta using the clamp-and-sew technique. BACKGROUND: Paraplegia remains a devastating complication after thoracoabdominal aortic resection, despite many strategies for spinal <b>cord</b> <b>protection.</b> Because of its simplicity, clamp and sew has been the preferred technique at the University of Virginia for the thoracoabdominal aortic resection when proximal control is possible. METHODS: Between 1987 and 1994, the authors reviewed 91 consecutive patients who underwent thoracic aortic resection using clamp-and-sew techniques without any additional adjuncts for spinal <b>cord</b> <b>protection.</b> RESULTS: The average age of patients was 60. 8 years; 57. 1 % were male. No intraoperative deaths occurred. In-hospital mortality was 13 % (12 / 91), with an overall incidence of postoperative spinal cord injury manifested as paraparesis or paraplegia of 9. 9 % (9 / 91). Eighty-nine percent (81 / 91) of all repairs were completed with aortic clamp times of 40 minutes or less, and nearly six out of ten were completed in 30 minutes or less (53 / 91). Cross-clamp times {{were not significantly different}} between those patients who sustained neurologic injury and those who had no deficits. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that clamp and sew is still a viable technique for thoracoabdominal aortic resection. Nearly all resections can be completed within 40 minutes of aortic occlusion. However, the "safe" duration of thoracic aortic occlusion remains unknown, and spinal cord injury can occur even with short clamp times.

40|$|Purpose. Using {{adequate}} granular {{materials and}} layer {{structures in the}} railway super- and substructure is able to stabilise railway track geometry. For this purpose special behaviour of above materials has to be determined, e. g. inner shear resistance. Inner shear resistance of granular media with and without geogrid reinforcement in different depths is not known yet. Methodology. The author developed a special laboratory method to measure and define inner shear resistance of granular materials, it is called «multi-level shear box test». This method is adequate to determine inner shear resistance (pushing force) vs. depth (distance from the «zero» surface). Two different granular materials: andesite railway ballast (31. 5 / 63 mm) and andesite railway <b>protection</b> <b>layer</b> material (0 / 56 mm), and seven different types of geogrids (GG 1 …GG 7) were used during the tests. Findings. Values of inner shear resistance functions of andesite railway ballast without geogrid reinforcement and reinforced with different types of geogrids and andesite granular <b>protection</b> <b>layer</b> in function of the vertical distance from the geogrid plane were determined with multi-layer shear box tests when the material aggregation is uncompacted and compacted. Only the compacted sample was tested in case of the 0 / 56 mm <b>protection</b> <b>layer.</b> Cubic polynomial regression functions fitted on the mean values of the measurements are described graphically. Determination coefficients with values of R 2 > 0. 97 were resulted in all the cases of regression functions.
