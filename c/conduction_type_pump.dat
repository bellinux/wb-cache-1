40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect.

Moreover, these T 2 SLs {{have been demonstrated}} for MWIR and LWIR detection regions. It {{has been found that}} MWIR T 2 SL exhibits a change in the <b>conduction</b> <b>type,</b> form p- to n-type as the temperature increases. Furthermore, the temperature at which the change occurs increases as the growth temperature of the T 2 SLs increases. This <b>conduction</b> <b>type</b> change is attributed to the existence of two impurity levels with two different activation energies. On the other hand, the LWIR InAs/GaSb T 2 SL conduction is demonstrated to be n-type for the whole range of temperature. In addition to the conventional scattering mechanisms, the IRS mechanism is proved to be the dominant scattering mechanism at low temperatures. These results allow {{a better understanding of the}} physical properties of the InAs/GaSb T 2 SL, which leads to the improvement of IR photodetector performances based on this material.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As an {{important}} semiconductor, nickel oxide (NiO) films deposited by {{electron beam evaporation}} are reported scarcely. In this study, undoped NiO films were deposited on quartz by electron beam evaporation technique, and annealed at different temperature in a pure oxygen atmosphere. The electrical characterization of NiO films were investigated using Hall effect measurements. The {{results show that the}} film <b>conduction</b> <b>types</b> of n, p, and high resistivity appear in proper order with the increasing temperature. The mechanism is further explicated by the SEM and Raman measurements. The oxygen atoms are introduced by the thermal treatment under oxygen ambience. The amount of atoms is more and more with the increasing temperature and it results in becoming larger grain size of the film while the <b>conduction</b> <b>type</b> converting. High resistivity of the film reveals that some oxygen atoms will be out of the film at a higher annealing temperature.

40|$|The {{ferroelectric}} perovskite Na 0. 5 Bi 0. 5 TiO 3, NBT, can exhibit {{three types}} of electrical behaviour, i. e. oxide-ion <b>conduction</b> (<b>Type</b> I), mixed ionic-electronic <b>conduction</b> (<b>Type</b> II) and insulating/dielectric (Type III) based on various defect mechanisms. Here we review how to tune the electrical properties of NBT via several mechanisms, including A-site Na or Bi non-stoichiometry, isovalent substitution, acceptor- and donor-doping. The diversity of electrical behaviour in the NBT lattice is attributed to {{the high level of}} oxide-ion conductivity originating from highly mobile oxygen ions which can be fine-tuned to optimise or suppress the ionic conduction. High oxide-ion conductivity can be obtained by manipulating the starting Na/Bi ≥ 1 and by acceptor-doping to make NBT a potential electrolyte material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). In contrast, the oxide-ion conduction can be partially or fully suppressed by having a starting (nominal) composition with Na/Bi < 1, donor-doping, or utilising the trapping between oxygen vacancies and some B-site acceptor dopants. This significantly reduces the dielectric loss and makes NBT-based materials excellent candidates as high-temperature dielectrics for capacitor applications...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} influence of stem <b>conduction</b> <b>types</b> on the production and physicochemical characteristics of tomato fruits (hybrid Coco, mini type) under organic management. The experiment was conducted between August 2013 and January 2014. The treatments consisted of 4 different conduction systems: 2 traditional stems; 2 stems emerging from axillary cotyledon buds (“bottom stem”); 3 “traditional” stems and 4 stems emerging from tip pruning. Eleven harvests were conducted from 22 nd November 2013 to 31 st January 2014. Data collected included fruit number per plant, yields (g∙plant− 1), fruit physicochemical characteristics, average weight, fruit diameter, pH, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids (SS), SS/TA ratio, reducing sugars, ascorbic acid, lycopene, β-carotene, chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b. Stem <b>conduction</b> <b>types</b> did not affect fruit yields per plant (g∙plant− 1). However, the greater number of stems resulted in more fruits per plant, but the fruit produced had a smaller diameter and average weight. The treatments with more stems also showed higher fruit lycopene levels, TA, and reducing sugars. Thus, under similar growing conditions, it may be recommended that organic mini tomatoes be pruned with 3 or 4 stems {{to increase the number}} of fruits per plant...|$|R

The effects of KCl doped and annealing treatment upon Cu 2 O thin film morphology, surface resistivity, open-circuit voltage, electric <b>conduction</b> <b>types</b> and visible light response are studied. The research results indicate that KCl doped has a great effect upon Cu 2 O crystal morphology, thus, making Cu 2 O thin film surface resistivity drop, and the open-circuit voltage increase and that electric <b>conduction</b> <b>types</b> are transformed from p type into n type, and the visible light (400 - 500 nm) absorption rate is slightly reduced. Annealing treatment can obviously decrease Cu 2 O thin film surface resistivity and improve its open-circuit voltage. When KCl concentration in electrolytic solution reaches 7 mmol/L, Cu 2 O thin film morphology can be changed from the dendritic crystal into the cubic crystal and Cu 2 O thin film surface resistivity decreases from the initial 2. 5 x 10 (6) Omega cm to 8. 5 x 10 (4) Omega cm. After annealing treatment at 320 degrees C for 30 min, the surface resistivity decreases to 8. 5 x 102 Omega cm, and the open-circuit voltage increases from the initial 3. 1 mV to 79. 2 mV.
