He dealt with a public <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1745 the Jacobite rising {{known as}} The 'Forty-Five began. Charles Edward Stuart, {{son of the}} Old Pretender, often {{referred}} to as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed on the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Several clans unenthusiastically joined him. At the outset he was successful, taking Edinburgh and then defeating the only government army in Scotland at the Battle of Prestonpans. The Jacobite army marched into England, took Carlisle and advanced as far as south as Derby. However, it became increasingly evident that England would not support a Roman Catholic Stuart monarch. The Jacobite leadership had a <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> and they retreated to Scotland as two English armies closed in and Hanoverian troops began to return from the continent. Charles' position in Scotland began to deteriorate as the Whig supporters rallied and regained control of Edinburgh. After an unsuccessful attempt on Stirling, he retreated north towards Inverness. He was pursued by the Duke of Cumberland and gave battle with an exhausted army at Culloden on 16 April 1746, where the Jacobite cause was crushed. Charles hid in Scotland with the aid of Highlanders until September 1746, when he escaped back to France. There were bloody reprisals against his supporters and foreign powers abandoned the Jacobite cause, with the court in exile forced to leave France. The Old Pretender died in 1760 and the Young Pretender, without legitimate issue, in 1788. When his brother, Henry, Cardinal of York, died in 1807, the Jacobite cause was at an end.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the size of collateralized {{household}} debt determines an economy’s vulnerability to <b>crises</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> The house price feeds back on itself by contributing to a liquidity effect, which operates through the value of housing in a collateral constraint. Over a specific range of debt levels this liquidity feedback effect is strong enough to give rise to multiplicity of house prices. In a dynamic setup, we conceptualize confidence as a realization of rationally entertainable belief-weightings of multiple future prices.

The regulator has two tools at her disposal to combat these problems - she can audit banks to learn their type prior to giving them a licence, and she can impose capital adequacy requirements. When the regulator has a strong reputation for screening she uses capital requirements to combat moral hazard problems. For less competent regulators, capital requirements substitute for screening ability. In this case the banking system exhibits multiple equilibria so that <b>crises</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the banking system can occur. We also show that in either case, a system of deposit insurance funded through general taxation will be welfare-improving and will allow capital requirements to be eased. ...|$|R

25|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997 began in Thailand in May 1997, {{where the government}} found it {{harder and harder to}} maintain the Thai baht peg at ฿25 to US$1. By 2 July 1997 Thailand abandoned its defence of the baht, allowing it to float freely. Indonesia, which had massive foreign reserves and was seen as having a strong economy, responded on 11 July 1997, by widening its exchange rate band from 8 to 12%. Indonesia had taken similar actions in the years leading up to the crisis, in December 1995 from 2 to 3%, in response to the Mexican {{financial crisis}}, and in June and September 1996 from 3 to 5% and then 5 to 8%.

25|$|In May 1995, in {{the early}} stages of {{investigations}} into the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Melton, fellow scholar James R. Lewis and religious freedom lawyer Barry Fisher flew to Japan to voice concern that police behaviour, including mass detentions without charge and the removal of practitioners' children from the group, might be infringing the civil rights of Aum Shinrikyo members. They had travelled to Japan at the invitation and expense of Aum Shinrikyo after they had contacted the group to express concern over developments, and met with officials over a period of three days. While not having been given access to the group's chemical laboratories, they held press conferences in Japan stating their belief, based on the documentation they had been given by the group, that the group did not have the ability to produce sarin and was being scapegoated. Melton revised his judgment shortly after, concluding that the group had in fact been responsible for the attack and other crimes. Some felt that the scholars' defense of Aum Shinrikyo led to a <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in religious scholarship when the group's culpability was proven.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} environmental-social {{governance}} (ESG), of which responsible investment (RI) {{is now a}} leading example, is built around models of social-political interaction in which participation and deliberation are key structural and procedural components. This approach provides a more holistically legitimate basis to corporate governance, rather than current models of corporate social responsibility, which focus {{on one or two}} attributes (such as accountability or transparency). In the conception offered here, a broad range of institutional arrangements are linked to the structures and processes of 'good' governance. Using a hierarchical framework of principles, criteria and indicators, which places these arrangements in a coherent framework for assessment, it is then possible to evaluate institutional quality. This approach is contrasted with the current, more restricted set of criteria used at present. The chapter concludes with some observations on the legitimacy of contemporary RI, and calls for universal standards to ensure consistency of governance across the sector, thus avoiding future <b>crises</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> analogous to the GFC...|$|R

40|$|Failure in {{research}} is an increasingly hot topic, with high-profile <b>crises</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the published research literature {{in medicine and}} psychology. Among the major factors in this research crisis are the many incentives to report and publish only positive findings.

Thus providing an alternative forum for practitioners and researchers to learn from each other's failures can be very productive. The first LAK Failathon, held in 2016, provided just such an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures and negative findings in a lower-stakes environment, to help participants learn from each other's mistakes. It was very successful, and there was strong support for running it as an annual event. This workshop will build on that success, with twin objectives to provide an environment for individuals to learn from each other's failures, and also to co-develop plans for how we as a field can better build and deploy our evidence base...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{relationship}} between consumer risk perceptions and behaviour when information about food risks is framed in a positive or negative way. Design/methodology/approach - Using food consumption scenarios in an on-line experiment consumers perceived risk and risk tolerance is examined when messages are framed in three different news-type stories. Findings - As anticipated, message framing emerged as a significant predictor of perceived risk and the higher an individual’s self-reported tolerance of risk, the more risk they were willing to accept. Research limitations/implications - The use of hypothetical scenarios and relatively small convenience sample size could be improved by further research. Practical implications - Through simple adjustments to wording, food <b>crises</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> may be reduced and the implications for communication management strategies are discussed. Originality/value - Originality stems from being one of the first papers to use Framing and Prospect Theory in a food crisis situation, in which both risk and framing are operationalised in different ways and the risk was not specified by the researcher. Also, unlike previous research identical numerical facts were framed in a positive, negative or neutral light by changing the wording...|$|R

Especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply, a <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> has emerged with the widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on CDS between these countries and other EU member states, most importantly Germany. By the end of 2011, Germany was estimated to have made more than [...] out of the crisis as investors flocked to safer but near zero interest rate German federal government bonds (bunds).

Looking at short-term government bonds with a maturity of {{less than one year}} the list of beneficiaries also includes Belgium and France. While Switzerland (and Denmark) equally benefited from lower interest rates, the crisis also harmed its export sector due to a substantial influx of foreign capital and the resulting rise of the Swiss franc. In September 2011 the Swiss National Bank surprised currency traders by pledging that [...] "it will no longer tolerate a euro-franc exchange rate below the minimum rate of 1.20 francs", effectively weakening the Swiss franc.

40|$|The {{success of}} the European Union in {{regulating}} the safety of products in the single market differs widely. In the last decade, the regulatory regime for pharmaceuticals has functioned without raising public concerns. The establishment of a European agency for pharmaceuticals in the early 1990 s has been evaluated positively by both producers and consumers, {{and there have been}} no large scandals so far. At the same time, the food sector was subject to a whole range <b>of</b> <b>crises,</b> <b>of</b> which the BSE scandal was certainly the most significant one. In reaction to this, the regulatory regime for foodstuffs was reformed by setting up a European Food Safety Agency in 2002. This article adopts an historical-instituionalist approach, and thus tries to give an explanation for the striking differences between the two regulatory regimes. Accordingly, the development of supranational regulatory regimes is distinguished by two critical junctures: a <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> and the establishment of a single market. It is crucial which of these occurred first. If a <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> leads to the establishment of national regulatory authorities, these authorities act as stakeholders, which could be an obstacle for harmonization, but also ensures a necessary commitment to health and consumer protection once a single market is set up. If national regulatory authorities are missing, it might be easier to set up a single market, but a regulatory deficit is more likely to occur and, in case <b>of</b> a <b>crisis,</b> the whole regulatory regime has to be established at the supranational level.
