25|$|A dust {{extractor}} should be fitted if sawdust {{is prone to}} build up under the <b>cutting</b> <b>blade.</b> Through friction the spinning blade will quickly ignite the accumulated dust, and the smoke can be mistaken for an overheated blade. The extractor also {{reduces the risk of}} a dust explosion and facilitates a healthier working environment.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawing of}} typical blade {{construction}} {{is shown in}} the figure on the right. Research has shown that the sound field is dipole with the primary axis perpendicular to the blade plane. The sources are fluctuating forces acting on each <b>cutting</b> <b>blade.</b> Bies determined that the characteristic speed was the blade velocity, RÎ©, and the characteristic dimension was the tooth area. Other researchers used blade thickness as the characteristic dimension. Cho and Mote found that the Strouhal number St= was between 0.1 and 0.2 where h was the blade thickness. Poblete et al., found Strouhal numbers between 0.12 and 0.18. If the edge tone is relevant, perhaps the characteristic dimension should be the gap between the blades.|$|E

Experiments have been targeted at measuring roughness when turning a sample of 11 523 steel at constant parameters of shift and depth of cut and under variable values of spindle speed. Measurements were performed by using replaceable <b>cutting</b> <b>blades</b> of different types and parameters. Results were evaluated {{in terms of the}} effect of different properties of <b>cutting</b> <b>blades</b> and variable values of spindle speed...|$|R

25|$|It is also widely {{accepted}} that the Huns introduced the langseax, a 60cm <b>cutting</b> <b>blade</b> that became popular among the migration era Germanics {{and in the}} Late Roman Army, into Europe. It is believed these blades originated in China and that the Sarmatians and Huns served as a transmission vector, using shorter seaxes in Central Asia that developed into the narrow langseax in Eastern Europe during the late 4th and {{first half of the}} 5th century. These earlier blades date {{as far back as the}} 1st century AD, with the first of the newer type appearing in Eastern Europe being the Wien-Simmerming example, dated to the late 4th century AD. Other notable Hun examples include the Langseax from the more recent find at Volnikovka in Russia.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} was the bow ard, {{which consists}} of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) {{and the other a}} share (<b>cutting</b> <b>blade)</b> that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops. The ard does not clear new land well, so hoes or mattocks must be used to pull up grass and undergrowth, and a hand-held, coulter-like ristle could be used to cut deeper furrows ahead of the share. Because the ard leaves a strip of undisturbed earth between the furrows, the fields are often cross-ploughed lengthwise and widthwise, and this tends to form squarish fields (Celtic fields). The ard is best suited to loamy or sandy soils that are naturally fertilised by annual flooding, as in the Nile Delta and Fertile Crescent, {{and to a lesser extent}} any other cereal-growing region with light or thin soil. By the late Iron Age, ards in Europe were commonly fitted with coulters.|$|E

2500|$|The Great Pyramid is {{surrounded}} by a complex of several buildings including small pyramids. The Pyramid Temple, which stood {{on the east side of}} the pyramid and measured [...] north to south and [...] east to west, has almost entirely disappeared apart from the black basalt paving. There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated. The basalt blocks show [...] "clear evidence" [...] of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated <b>cutting</b> <b>blade</b> of [...] in length, capable of cutting at a rate of [...] per minute. John Romer suggests that this [...] "super saw" [...] may have had copper teeth and weighed up to [...] He theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden trestle and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it.|$|E
2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of years}} ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The <b>cutting</b> <b>blade</b> or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or with the heel of the user's hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. [...] A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear although furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. [...] There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of adzes to effect greater control of the cutting action.|$|E

50|$|Shearing, {{also known}} as die cutting, is a process which cuts stock without the {{formation}} of chips {{or the use of}} burning or melting. Strictly speaking, if the <b>cutting</b> <b>blades</b> are straight the process is called shearing; if the <b>cutting</b> <b>blades</b> are curved then they are shearing-type operations. The most commonly sheared materials are in the form of sheet metal or plates, however rods can also be sheared. Shearing-type operations include: blanking, piercing, roll slitting, and trimming. It is used in metalworking and also with paper and plastics.|$|R
