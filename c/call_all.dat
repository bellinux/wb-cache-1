Audio tapes and transcripts of the 911 calls, along with images captured by mall security surveillance cameras, were released by the police on December 7, 2007. In one 911 call, gunshots can be heard.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Eusebius's account {{deals with}} Maximinus. Maximinus {{took up the}} office of emperor in Nicomedia on May 1, 305, and {{immediately}} thereafter left the city for Caesarea, hurrying, Lactantius alleges, so as to oppress and trample the diocese of Oriens. Initially, Maximinus governed only Egypt and the Levant. He issued his own persecutory edict {{in the spring of}} 306, ordering general sacrifice. The edict of 304 had been difficult to enforce, since the Imperial government had no record of city-dwelling subjects who held no agricultural land. Galerius solved this problem in 306 by running another census. This contained the names of all urban heads of household and the number of their dependents (past censuses had only listed persons paying tax on land, such as landowners and tenants). Using lists drawn up by the civil service, Maximinus ordered his heralds to <b>call</b> <b>all</b> men, women, and children down to the temples. There, after tribunes called everyone by name, everyone sacrificed.|$|E

25|$|Another custom is to <b>call</b> <b>all</b> the {{children}} (in Orthodox congregations boys only) {{to a special}} aliyah called Kol HaNe'arim (all {{the children}}). In many congregations, a large talit is spread out {{over the heads of}} all the children as the blessing over the Torah is pronounced, and for the congregation to bless the children by reciting (in Hebrew) a verse from Jacob's blessing to Ephraim and Manasseh, Genesis 48:16.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union {{struggled}} {{to contain the}} German invasion, and soon the Soviet High Command had to <b>call</b> <b>all</b> available units stationed along the Finnish border to the rapidly deteriorating front line. According to Finnish historian Ohto Manninen, because of this, the initial air offensive against Finland could not be followed up with a supporting land offensive as allegedly planned. Moreover, the 237th Infantry Division and, excluding the 198th Motorized Division, the Soviet 10th Mechanized Corps were withdrawn from Ladoga Karelia, thus stripping most of the reserves from the remaining defending Soviet units.|$|E
25|$|In many congregations it is {{customary}} to <b>call</b> <b>all</b> eligible {{members of}} the congregation for an aliyah to the Torah on Simhat Torah. To accommodate this the first five aliyot are reread so that everyone has an opportunity to recite the blessing. To save time, some congregations call people up in groups. Others hold a series of separate minyanim for the Torah reading. In a minority of Orthodox congregations women receive aliyot in single-gender tefillah groups (prayer groups consisting only of women, who pray together), and only men are called to the Torah {{in front of the whole}} congregation.|$|E
25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{a second time}} to ask what he saw, he replied that he saw a seething pot tipping from the north, and God said {{that out of the}} north evil would break forth upon all Israel. For God would <b>call</b> <b>all</b> the kingdoms of the north to come, and they would set their thrones at Jerusalem's gate, against its walls, and against the cities of Judah. God would utter God's {{judgments}} against Judah, as its people had forsaken God and worshipped the work of their own hands. God thus directed Jeremiah to gird his loins, arise, and speak to the Judean people all that God commanded, for God had made Jeremiah a fortified city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the land of Judah, its rulers, its priests, and its people. They would fight against him, but they would not prevail, for God would be with him to deliver him.|$|E

25|$|After the 2013 season, the Dodgers {{ended their}} {{broadcast}} agreements with Prime Ticket and KCAL-TV. They entered into {{an agreement with}} Time Warner Cable {{to start their own}} regional sports network, to be called SportsNet LA, to begin with the 2014 season. This marked the end of over-the-air broadcasts of Dodger games, which had begun in 1949. On October 12, 2013, they announced {{that they would not be}} retaining the broadcasting team of Steve Lyons and Eric Collins who had worked road games for the team since 2005 (Lyons) and 2009 (Collins). On December 2, 2013, the team announced that former Dodger Nomar Garciaparra would be part of the new broadcast team. On December 8, it was announced that Orel Hershiser would also be joining the broadcast team as a television game analyst for road games and that Alanna Rizzo would be joining the pre and post game shows. On December 11, Jerry Hairston, Jr. announced that he was retiring from baseball to join the Dodgers pre and post game broadcasting team. On January 22, 2014, it was announced that KLAC radio announcer Charley Steiner would move to the TV booth to call road games with Hershiser, while Garciaparra would call road radio broadcasts with Rick Monday. Vin Scully, in his 65th year with the Dodgers, would continue to <b>call</b> <b>all</b> home telecasts as well as road games from Arizona and San Francisco. The new network officially launched on February 25, 2014. However, a season long dispute between Time Warner Cable and other content providers, most notably DirecTV, led to the new channel only being available in homes that were served by Time Warner Cable itself.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in 1975, Joe Garagiola and Curt Gowdy alternated as the Saturday Game of Week play-by-play announcers with Tony Kubek doing color analysis. Then on {{weeks in}} which NBC had Monday Night Baseball, Gowdy and Garagiola worked together. One would call play-by-play for 4½ innings, {{the other would}} handle color analysis. Then {{in the bottom of}} the 5th inning, their roles switched. Ultimately, in November 1975, Chrysler forced NBC to totally remove Curt Gowdy from NBC's top {{baseball}} team.
