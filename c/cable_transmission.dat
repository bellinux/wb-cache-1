25|$|During {{the night}} of 8–9 November, Emden reached the islands, and sent a party ashore at around 06:00 to disable the {{wireless}} and <b>cable</b> <b>transmission</b> station on Direction Island. The station was able to transmit a distress call before it was shut down. Melbourne received the message, and ordered Sydney to investigate. The Australian ship arrived off Direction Island at 09:15, spotting and being spotted by Emden; both ships prepared for combat. Emden opened fire at 09:40, surprising those aboard Sydney as the range was greater than British intelligence thought Emden was capable of. The German ship scored several hits, {{but was unable to}} inflict disabling damage to the Australian cruiser before Sydney opened up with her more powerful main guns. At 11:20, von Müller ordered that the heavily damaged Emden beach on North Keeling Island. The Australian warship broke to pursue the collier , which scuttled herself, then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. At this point, Emdens battle ensign was still flying, and after no response to instructions to lower the ensign, Glossop ordered two salvoes shot into the beached cruiser. Sydney had orders to ascertain the status of the transmission station, but returned the next day to provide medical assistance to the Germans.|$|E

50|$|As cables between {{line output}} and line input are {{generally}} extremely short {{compared to the}} audio signal wavelength in the <b>cable,</b> <b>transmission</b> line effects can be disregarded and impedance matching need not be used. Instead, line level circuits use the impedance bridging principle, in which a low impedance output drives a high impedance input.

Line inputs present a much higher impedance, typically 10 kΩ or more.|$|E

40|$|INSPEC Accession Number: 10364160 International audienceThis paper {{presents}} ABLE, {{an innovative}} exoskeleton {{for the upper}} limb currently under development at CEA-LIST Interactive Robotics Unit (Fig 1). Its distinctive high performance mechanical transmissions-screw and cable patented arrangement [9]-and its integrated architecture makes it the very first of its category. The first 4 axis model is described here but more complete models are already planned: a 7 axis model as well as portable versions. Its back-drivable, high efficiency, low inertia actuators provide a high capacity (around 40 N continuous effort at the hand) and allow hybrid force-position control without requiring any force sensor. Its first application is currently a research program in rehabilitation (BRAHMA project) and professional use is already in view. Assistance tasks for disabled persons (carrying a bottle) are also typical tasks to be performed by ABLE as well as intuitive telerobotics, haptic device for VR, and sport training, etc. Furthermore, its versatility and simple design allow industrial versions to become soon available.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Southwire Company is to develop the {{technology}} necessary to proceed to commercialization of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) <b>transmission</b> <b>cables.</b> Power <b>transmission</b> <b>cables</b> are a promising near-term electric utility application for high-temperature superconductivity. Present HTS wires match the needs for a three-phase transmission cable: (1) the wires must conduct high currents in self-field, (2) there are no high forces developed, and (3) the cables may operate at relatively low current density. The commercially-available HTS wires, in 100 -m lengths, make construction of a full three-phase, alternating current (ac) <b>transmission</b> <b>cable</b> possible. If completed through the pre-commercialization phase, this project {{will result in a}} new capability for electric power companies. The superconducting cable will enable delivery with greater efficiency, higher power density, and lower costs than many alternatives now on the market. Job creation in the US is expected as US manufacturers supply <b>transmission</b> <b>cables</b> to the expanding markets in Asia and to the densely populated European cities where pipe-type cable is prevalent. Finally, superconducting cables may enable delivery of the new, diverse and distributed sources of electricity that will constitute the majority of new installed electrical generation in the world during the coming decades...|$|R
