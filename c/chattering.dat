40|$|Abstract. <b>Chatter</b> often {{occurs during}} {{precision}} hole boring, {{it results in}} low quality of finished surface and even damages the cutting tool. In order to identify <b>chatter</b> rapidly and gain the precious time for <b>chatter</b> suppression, a <b>chatter</b> monitoring system was established and an effective feature extraction method for boring <b>chatter</b> recognition was presented. According to the characteristic of <b>chatter</b> signal, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was introduced into <b>chatter</b> feature extraction, and its basic theories were investigated. The vibration signal was decomposed by EMD, then the intrinsic mode functions (IMF) was got. Finally, the feature of <b>chatter</b> symptom was extracted by analyzing the energy spectrum of each IMF.

This study examines whether <b>chatter</b> can predict stock market performance, which metric of <b>chatter</b> has the strongest relationship, {{and what the}} dynamics of the relationship are. The authors aggregate <b>chatter</b> (in the form of product reviews) from multiple websites over a four year period across six markets and fifteen firms. They derive multiple metrics of <b>chatter</b> (volume, positive <b>chatter,</b> negative <b>chatter,</b> and 5 -start ratings) and use multivariate time series models to assess the short and long term relationship between <b>chatter</b> and stock market performance. They use three measures of stock market performance: abnormal returns, risk, and trading volume. The findings reveal that two metrics of <b>chatter</b> can predict abnormal returns with a lead of a few days. Of four metrics of <b>chatter,</b> volume shows the strongest relationship with returns and trading volume, followed by negative <b>chatter.</b> Whereas negative <b>chatter</b> has a strong effect on returns and trading volume with a short “wearin” and long “wearout,” positive <b>chatter</b> has no effect on these metrics. Negative <b>chatter</b> also increases volatility (risk) in returns. A portfolio analysis of trading stocks based on their <b>chatter</b> provides a return of 8 % over and above normal market returns. In addition to the investing opportunities, the results show managers that <b>chatter</b> is an important metric to follow to gauge the performance of their brands and products. Because <b>chatter</b> is available daily and hourly, it 2 can provide an immediate pulse of performance that is not possible with infrequent sales and earnings reports. The fact that negative <b>chatter</b> is more important than positive, indicates that negatives are more diagnostic than positives.

40|$|One of {{the major}} factors {{hindering}} the use of qualitative simulation techniques to reason about the behavior of complex dynamical systems is intractable branching due to a phenomenon called <b>chatter.</b> This paper presents two general abstraction techniques that {{solve the problem of}} <b>chatter.</b> Eliminating the problem of <b>chatter</b> significantly extends the range of models that can be tractably simulated using qualitative simulation. <b>Chatter</b> occurs when a variable's direction of change is constrained only by continuity within a region of the state space.

40|$|In {{metal cutting}} processes, <b>chatter</b> has been {{recognized}} as one of the main factors that limit machining productivity and affect product quality. Two different categories of <b>chatter</b> were classified by researchers, i. e., regenerative <b>chatter</b> and non-regenerative <b>chatter,</b> and in this thesis the former is mainly studied. Over the past few decades, though various <b>chatter</b> detection and suppression methods have been developed, their industrial acceptance is still very limited. This research work presents a new system for on-line <b>chatter</b> detection and suppression. Its detection module implements a statistical index to identify <b>chatters</b> by performing wavelet transform and conducting statistical analysis of positive wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM). To suppress <b>chatter,</b> two versions of fuzzy control modules, i. e., plain fuzzy control and self-regulating fuzzy control have been implemented. Unlike the previous <b>chatter</b> suppression systems, the new suppression module features two-way adjustment, i. e., both increasing and decreasing the amount of adjustment. Along with the use of single or multi-output control variables to suppress <b>chatter,</b> productivity is preserved as much as possible. The proposed system is implemented on a SERVO 2000 milling machine. Extensive tests have been carried out. The experimental results show that the wavelet-based <b>chatter</b> detection index can not only detect the existence of <b>chatters</b> but also distinguish the severity levels. The new <b>chatter</b> suppression module works reasonably well in most tests. However, its performance is adversely affected in the presence of non-regenerative vibrations due to the lack of workpiece or clamping rigidity. Further improvements need to be carried out for industrial applications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractChatter {{detection}} {{is necessary}} to carry out stable machining. It is extremely critical in high speed micromilling (spindle speeds > 100, 000 rpm) where the limited tool stiffness and small fluctuations in the cutting forces can lead to dynamic instability. <b>Chatter</b> can deteriorate the surface finish and is detrimental to the tool as well. Hence, <b>chatter</b> identification is important to obtain stable cutting parameters. This <b>chatter</b> free process parameters can be identified by carrying out experiments at different machining conditions. <b>Chatter</b> detection can be accomplished via in-process real time techniques based on force and displacement signals or off-line machined surface characterization. It may be noted that micromilling process uses a miniature end mill whose natural frequencies corresponding to higher modes can {{be as high as}} 10 KHz. Consequently, the sensor bandwidth should be sufficient to detect high <b>chatter</b> frequencies in high speed micromilling. The conventional way of detecting <b>chatter</b> via force sensor may not be applicable in high speed micromilling due to its limited bandwidth. The displacement sensors can also have issues with proper placement and the noise. The <b>chatter</b> surface identification is relatively easy via visual inspection of the surface topography but quantitatively specifying a surface parameter which captures <b>chatter</b> is challenging. To address the issues of <b>chatter</b> identification in high speed micromilling, three different experimental techniques have been studied for <b>chatter</b> characterization. Four different experimental conditions (two stable and two unstable processing conditions based on visual surface inspection of scanning electron micrographs) have been characterized by all three methods and a comparative assessment of different <b>chatter</b> detection techniques has been carried out in high speed micromilling of Ti 6 Al 4 V. It has been observed that force sensor is unable to identify the <b>chatter</b> and the displacement sensor is noisy but can be used to determine <b>chatter</b> under certain conditions. However, average power spectral density (APSD) obtained from the surface topography can clearly identify <b>chatter.</b> A critical average power spectral density has been identified for the determination of the onset of <b>chatter...</b>|$|R
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive <b>chattering</b> vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known as}} the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher, is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous gopher forages for vegetable and plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes color and texture over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make <b>chattering</b> sounds with their teeth; males and females make purring (or crooning) sounds when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm petrel}} nests in crevices and burrows, {{sometimes}} shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed the chick, {{which is not}} normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and zooplankton while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's stomach to an oily orange liquid which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a <b>chattering</b> call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers do {{not have}} such {{a wide range of}} songs and calls as do {{passerine}} birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, <b>chattering,</b> nasal churrs, screams and wails. These calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, low-pitched calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging-calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived Eurasian wryneck is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity.
