5|$|Found in {{tropical}} moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, the <b>collared</b> brown lemur occurs {{west to the}} forests of Kalambatritra and in the south from Tôlanaro north to the Mananara River. The Mananara River is {{the boundary between the}} ranges of the <b>collared</b> brown lemur and the Gray-headed Lemur to the north. The <b>collared</b> brown lemur {{can be found in the}} littoral forests of Mandena Conservation Zone, Sainte Luce Reserve, and Andohahela National Park.|$|E

50|$|S. cristantum is {{the closest}} taxonomic {{relative}} of S. <b>collare.</b> Ways to differentiate between the two include (a) examining length of forewing (S. cristantum length is greater than 29 mm in males) (b) pronotum of S. cristantum is more pointed and pronotal crest is higher than S. <b>collare</b> and (c) S. cristantum males will stridulate more often than S. <b>collare</b> males. Also, S. cristantum is found in more southern areas of the United States than S. collare.Other species of the genus Spharagemon include: S. equale, S. campestris, S. bunites, S. cripitans, S. bolli, S. saxatile, and S. marmorata.|$|R
5|$|Rare vagrant species {{spotted in}} the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard's pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, <b>collared</b> and stock doves, whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and rock pipit. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud. The generally insectivorous <b>collared</b> falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|E
5|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great snipe in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a <b>collared</b> pratincole in 2009. In order to maintain a good habitat, parts of the reed bed are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E

5|$|Wolves were reintroduced {{into the}} Northern Rocky Mountains in the 1990s. In February 2011, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{attached}} radio collars to several wolves in the Imnaha Pack in northeastern Oregon to allow study of their migration. The pack was Oregon's first since wolves {{returned to the}} state. The wolves were numbered; one of them, a year-old male from the pack's second litter, was given the code OR-7 as the seventh wolf to be <b>collared.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9m (between 1.5 and 6.5m) off {{the ground in a}} variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and <b>collared</b> kingfishers, as well as the introduced green tree skink.|$|E
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the samphire. Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, <b>collared</b> sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in the skies over St Kilda.|$|E

5|$|More than 16 {{kinds of}} lizards and snakes live in various {{habitats}} {{in the park}} and consume large quantities of insects, spiders, scorpions, other reptiles, and small mammals. The <b>collared</b> lizard, which occurs in every habitat, is the largest and most often seen. Plateau striped whiptails, a species consisting entirely of females, prefer grasslands and developed areas. Side-blotched lizards live in rocky areas of the park but are seldom seen. Gopher snakes, which sometimes imitate rattlesnakes when disturbed, are among the most common snakes in the park. The Western rattlesnake, the only venomous snake found in the park, prefers grasslands and shrub areas.|$|E
5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian <b>collared</b> dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The hussar cavalry were garbed in a black, {{light blue}} <b>collared</b> dolman, {{sometimes}} {{with a black}} pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight breeches of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black Shako. The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design. The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being {{a copy of the}} Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a red and yellow pennon. By 1815, the Uhlans were wearing all-black uniforms, but retained the yellow-topped czapka.|$|E
5|$|Aside from that, Damai is {{also one}} of the perfect places in Sarawak to see the Irrawaddy dolphin as the mammals can be spotted along the Salak River, Santubong estuary and at the Bako-Buntal Bay. The Santubong Peninsula offers a few sites for bird {{watching}} with the BirdLife International Organisation has registered the whole area on Bako-Buntal Bay as an 'Important Bird Area'. Between October and March, the Buntal River become an important wintering ground for bird migration. A number of birds that have been spotted by the Malaysian Nature Society (Kuching Branch) at Buntal including a variety of plovers, sandpipers, egrets, terns and other rare migrants, while resident birds including <b>collared</b> kingfisher, the white-bellied sea eagle and brahminy kite.|$|E
5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, {{and more often}} in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which time {{they are more likely}} to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (Falco longipennis), <b>collared</b> sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent when they heard the recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E
