40|$|The {{research}} work {{described in this}} thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of glassfibre reinforced plastics for structural uses in Civil Engineering construction. The first stage was primarily concerned with the design of GRP lamintes with structura 1 properties and method of manufacture suitable for use with relatively large structural components. A cold setting, pressure moulding technique was developed which proved to be efficient in reducing the void content in the composite and minimising the exothermic effect due to curing. The effect of fibre content and fibre arrangement on strength and stiffness of the cornposite was studied and the maximum amount of' fibre content that could be reached by the adopted type of moulding technique was determined. The second stage of the project was concerned with the introduction of steel-wire "sheets" into the GRP cornposites, {{to take advantage of the}} high modulus of steel wire to improve the GRP stiffness and to reduce deformation. The experimental observations agreed reasonably well with theoretical predictions in both first and second stages of the work. The third stage was concerned with studying the stability of GRP flat rectangular plates subjected to uniaxial compression or pure shear, to simulate <b>compression</b> <b>flanges</b> or shear webs respectively. The investigation was concentrated on the effect of fibre arrangement in the plate on buckling load. The effect of the introduction of steel-wire sheets on the plate stability in compression was also investigated. The boundary conditions were chosen to be close to those usually assumed in built-up box-sections for both <b>compression</b> <b>flanges</b> and webs. The orthotropic plate and the mid-plane symmetric were used successfully in predicting the buckling load theoretically. In determining the buckling load experimentally, two methods were used. The Southwell plot method and electrical strain gauge method. The latter proved to be more reliable in predicting the buckling load than the former, especially for plates under uniaxial compression. Sample design charts for GRP plates that yield and buckle simultaneously under compression are also presented in the thesis. The final stage of the work dealt with the design and test of GRP beams. The investigation began by finding the optimum cross-section for a GRP beam. The cross-section which was developed was a thin walled corrugated section which showed higher stiffness than other cross-sections for the same cross-sectional area (i. e. box, I, and rectangular sections). A cold setting, hand layings technique was used in manufacturing these beams wbich were of nine types depending on the type of glass reinforcement employed and the arrangement of layers in the beam. The simple bending theory was used in the beam design and proved to be satisfactory in predicting the stresses and deflections. A factor of safety of 4 was chosen for design purposes and considered to be suitable for long term use under static load. Because of its relatively low modulus, GRP beams allowable deflection was limited to 1 / 120 th of the span which was found to be adequate for design purposes.

Half-through girder bridges are in general comprised of two parallel I-secti on beams joined by a concrete deck at the bottom/tension flange level as ill ustrated in Figure 1.

All the tested specimens were loaded under four point bending. Three dimensional (3 D) computer models analysed using the finite element method were used throughout the study. Results from pre-existing experimental work for 1 - section steel girder were used to validate the results obtained from the finite element analysis. Consequently, establishment of steel box girders were made and then validated with the classical beam theory. Failure mode of steel box girders with profiled webs starts with yielding followed by local buckling of the <b>compression</b> <b>flanges.</b> Incline folds in profiled webs at the compression area are able to cope with higher stresses as compared to horizontal folds. Rotation capacity percentage increament of steel box girder with flat webs as compared to the equivalent steel box girders with profiled webs was about 99. 55 % with 0. 16 standard deviation. The increment is about,double the rotation capacity of a girder with flat webs to the girder with profiled webs. Hence, the contribution from webs was significant to the rotation capacity. Rotation capacities increase significantly as the flange thickness and web thickness increase. While, as the yield stress, flange internal element width and flange external element width of steel plate box girders with the profiled webs are increased, the rotation capacities experience reduction...|$|R

Light-weight cold-formed steel channel sections along with fire resistive plasterboards are used to construct light gauge steel frame floor systems to provide the required fire resistance rating. However, simply adding more plasterboard layers is not an efficient method to increase FRR. Hence this research focuses on using joists with improved joist section profiles such as hollow flange sections to increase the structural capacity of floor systems under fire conditions and thus their FRR. In this research, the structural and thermal behaviour of LSF floor systems made of LiteSteel Beams with different plasterboard and insulation configurations was investigated using four full scale tests under standard fires. Based on the ultimate failure load of the floor joist at ambient temperature, transient state fire tests were conducted for different Load Ratios. These fire tests showed that the new LSF floor system has improved the FRR well above that of those made of lipped channel sections. The joist failure was predominantly due to local buckling of LSB <b>compression</b> <b>flanges</b> near mid-span with severe yielding of tension flanges. Fire tests have provided valuable structural and thermal performance data of tested floor systems that included time-temperature profiles, and failure times and temperatures. Average failure temperatures of LSB joists and reduced yield strengths were used to predict their ultimate moment capacities, which were compared with corresponding test capacities. This allowed an assessment {{in relation to the}} accuracy of current design rules for steel joists at elevated temperatures.

40|$|AbstractCold-formed steel (CFS) {{sections}} {{are commonly}} used in modern roof construction. Most purlin members are of thin-walled open cross section. They are usually subjected to roof loading at the top flange in either an upward or a downward direction. The load application points, where the sheeting/purlin connections are located, are often eccentric to the shear centre, and thus inevitably generate a torsional moment that will induce twisting and/or warping deformations in addition to bending deflection. This type of complexity associated with the loading conditions will be exacerbated by the occurrence of single- or mixed-mode buckling (e. g. overall, distortional and local buckling) due to <b>compression</b> <b>flanges</b> tending to move sideways. The connections between purlin and roof sheeting provide a restraining effect on purlin members by preventing such lateral and twisting movements, and thus have a beneficial effect on their load-carrying capacity. In design practice, this effect {{should be taken into}} account from a design-efficiency perspective. To this end, a key step is to quantify the rotational restraint stiffness by using an engineering-orientated model. This paper firstly reports a series of torsional restraint tests (F-tests) for both sigma and zed sections. Two loading directions were examined by adjusting the purlin fixing direction. The rotational angles between the connected flange and sheeting were recorded at each loading step, from which the moment–rotation curves were produced and presented for each test case. A linear relationship has been observed for the moment–rotation relationship from all test specimens. Secondly, a hand calculation model for calculating the rotational stiffness at each connection was developed. In that model, the rotation was deemed to be primarily caused by the localised deformation of the roof sheeting and the distortional deformation of the purlin flange. The rotation caused by the separation of connection was found to be negligible. The model was validated by the experimental test results and an example was presented to demonstrate the application of the model proposed. The rotational stiffness calculated by this model can be used to evaluate the input parameters required for numerical modelling of purlin–sheeting interaction...|$|R

The innovative feature of this hybrid composite girder optimizes the combined use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) in flanges to maximize structural performance while reducing the overall cost by using only GFRP in the web section. Preliminary investigations revealed that the hybrid FRP girder failed due to local buckling, separation of laminates and crushing near the loading point in the <b>compression</b> <b>flange</b> with the compressive and tensile strain smaller than the expected maximum strains. In view of improving its structural performance, concrete deck was provided on top of hybrid FRP composite girder to give stability on the thin <b>compression</b> <b>flange</b> because of its high compressive strength.

40|$|The {{economic}} use of cold-formed steel members {{means that}} buckling {{and the possible}} loss of effectiveness it produces are important features of design. Cross-sectional instabilities in laterally-restrained cold-formed steel beams include local and distortional buckling. The prediction of the true buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel beams accounting for all governing features such as geometrical imperfections, spread of yielding, postbuckling etc. has been possible {{with the development of}} advanced numerical modelling. In this thesis, the finite element (FE) method (ABAQUS) has been used to develop numerical analyses to study the buckling behaviour of laterally-restrained cold-formed steel lipped Z-section beams. The FE models were verified against a series of four-point bending tests available from previous research, with special references to material and geometrical nonlinearities. Two sets of analyses have been conducted: FE analyses allowing for both local and distortional buckling and ones allowing for local buckling while distortional buckling is restrained using appropriate boundary conditions. For the former, the controlling buckling mode (local, distortional or combined) at different stages of loading (up to, at and beyond maximum load) has been realized. Comparing the results of two sets of analyses, the effect of distortional buckling on performance for different geometric proportions has been studied. The effect of the lip size, flange width, angle of inclination of the edge stiffener (lip), size and position of the intermediate stiffener and material strength as well as the interaction between them on both the ultimate strength and the buckling of cold-formed Z-section beams has been investigated. Limits for optimum design of the section were proposed. Depending on the geometric properties and material strength of the section, transitions between local, distortional and combined local/distortional buckling were observed. The lip/flange interaction including the interaction between the edge stiffener (lip) and the intermediate stiffener was the key governing feature of behaviour. The effect of the linear moment gradient and sharply varying bending moment on both the ultimate strength and the buckling of cold-formed Z sections was investigated. The latter occurred in two-span continuous beams subject to uniformly distributed loading. The results of moment gradient cases were compared with those of pure bending cases. The suitability of the design treatments available in Eurocode 3 (EC 3) for local, combined local/distortional and distortional buckling of cold-formed Z-section beams was assessed. Overall, the EC 3 predictions for cross-sectional bending resistances were unconservative. Shortcomings were identified and some suggestions for improvements were made.
