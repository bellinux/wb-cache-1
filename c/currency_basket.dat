In 1991, the markka was pegged to the <b>currency</b> <b>basket</b> ECU, but the peg {{had to be}} withdrawn after two months with a devaluation of 12%. In 1992, Finland {{was hit by a}} severe recession, the Early 1990s depression in Finland. It was caused by several factors, the most severe being the incurring of debt, as the 1980s economic boom was based on debt. Also, the Soviet Union had collapsed, which brought an end to bilateral trade, and existing trade connections were severed. The most important source of export revenue, Western markets, were also depressed during the same time. As a result, by some opinions years overdue, the artificial fixed exchange rate was abandoned and the markka was floated. Its value immediately decreased 13% and the inflated nominal prices converged towards German levels. In total, the value of the markka had decreased 40% {{as a result of the}} recession. Also, as a result, several entrepreneurs who had borrowed money denominated in foreign currency suddenly faced insurmountable debt.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the week}} of 10 August 2015, against the {{background}} of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.

A market-based [...] "representative" [...] exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is one of the requirements for designation of a currency as one with Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one of China's goals. Since the late-2000s, China has sought to internationalize the renminbi. As of 2013, the RMB is the 8th most widely traded currency in the world.

40|$|The {{question}} that Less Developed Countries have faced {{since the advent}} of floating exchange rates among the Industrial Countries is whether they should also adopt a floating exchange rate system. The Less Developed Countries have opted for a pegged exchange rate system, since their economic characteristics and institutional structure indicate that floating for the Less Developed Countries would result in volatile or unstable exchange rates. Since Less Developed Countries peg t heir exchange rates in the presence of flexible rates among industrial countries, the Less Developed Countries pegged exchange rates move in accordance to the exchange rates to which they are pegged.

The technical particularities of a <b>basket</b> <b>currency</b> are discussed before we turn to the criteria for determining the shares of participating currencies. We show that there are no iron-clad economic principles and therefore there is some room for political considerations. In Europe three criteria were used for determining the weights: GDP shares, international trade shares, and financial market indicators. In addition, weights will change with exchange rate movements. Appreciating currencies will experience increasing weights and depreciating currencies decreasing weights. This may require a correction mechanism for political acceptability. In Europe, weights were rescaled by political authorities every five years. From an economic viewpoint, weights depend critically on the purpose of the basket currency: is it a reference indicator, is it a currency for international transactions, or is it a parallel currency?

The optimality of the exchange rate regime is defined as minimizing the fluctuation of trade balances, in the environment where the yen-dollar exchange rate fluctuates. Since the de facto dollar peg regime is blamed {{as one of the}} factors that caused the Asian currency crisis, the question of the optimal exchange rate regime is quite relevant in Asia. The novelty {{of this paper is to}} show how an emerging market economy's choice of the exchange rate regime (or weights in the basket) is dependent on the neighboring country's.

40|$|January 2003 Before {{the crisis}} of 1997 - 98, the East Asian economies—except for Japan but {{including}} China— pegged their currencies to the US dollar. To avoid further turmoil, the IMF now argues that these currencies should float more freely. However, our econometric estimations show that the dollar’s predominant weight in East Asian <b>currency</b> <b>baskets</b> has returned to its pre-crisis levels. By 2002, the day-to-day volatility of each country’s exchange rate against the dollar has again become negligible. In addition, most governments are rapidly accumulating a “war chest” of official dollar reserves, which portends that this exchange rate stabilization will come to extend over months or quarters. From the doctrine of “original sin” applied to emerging-market economies, we argue that this fear of floating is entirely rational {{from the perspective of}} each individual country.
