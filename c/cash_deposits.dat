Cash transactions in excess of a certain amount must be reported on a currency transaction report (CTR), identifying the individual making the transaction as well as the source of the cash. The law originally required all transactions of US$5,000 or more to be reported, but due to excessively high levels of reporting the threshold was raised to US$10,000.

This study presents a model for determining the optimal <b>cash</b> <b>deposit</b> amount {{when there is a}} fixed per-payment cost; the model balances the tradeoff between the fixed payment cost with the lost interest on the <b>cash</b> <b>deposit.</b> We use a renewal theory approach to obtain the long-term expected total cost per period when the bill amounts in a future period are deterministic, exponentially distributed, normally distributed, or Poisson occurrence based with a constant per occurrence charge. For the first two cases, we obtain explicit expressions for the optimal deposit amount; for the latter two, we give numerical procedures. An example in each case is presented, along with a comparison with the usual pay-each-period strategy. We conclude that the advance payment strategy offers significant cost savings when the per-payment cost is relatively large compared with the lost interest of one period's average bill amount; i. e. when interest rate is low or the average bill amount is small. cost models deposit policy inventory theory application...|$|R
