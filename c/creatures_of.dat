5|$|Gilbert {{had already}} written a {{considerable}} body of stories, plays, poems, criticism and other works before writing <b>Creatures</b> <b>of</b> Impulse. He later wrote the libretti {{to the famous}} series of Savoy operas (composed by Arthur Sullivan) between 1871 and 1896.|$|E
5|$|<b>Creatures</b> <b>of</b> Impulse is a stage {{play by the}} English dramatist W. S. Gilbert, {{with music}} by the composer-conductor Alberto Randegger, which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both the play and the short story concern an {{unwanted}} and ill-tempered old fairy who enchants people to behave in a manner opposite to their natures, with farcical results.|$|E
5|$|Early species had long, fully toothed {{jaws and}} long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats {{made up of}} hair-like {{filaments}} known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pterosaurs spanned {{a wide range of}} adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> all time, including Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
500|$|Although {{almost every}} Carnivàle episode has a {{distinctive}} {{story with a}} new carnival setting, all episodes {{are part of an}} overarching good-versus-evil story that only culminates and resolves very late in Season 2. The pilot episode begins with a prologue talking <b>of</b> [...] "a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> light and a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> darkness" [...] (also known as Avatars) being born [...] "to each generation" [...] preparing for a final battle. Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, and makes the nature of suggested Avatars a central question. Reviewers believed Ben to be a <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Light and Brother Justin a <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Darkness.|$|R

[...] "I cannot say that woman is a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> prey. Nor can I say she is a creature preyed upon. Nor will I say she is a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> unfaltering joy to man. But I will say that she is a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> much joy to man-- [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't you see," [...] protested Leo, [...] "all {{such talk}} makes woman a monster, a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> prey." [...] As {{he turned to}} Dick, he stole a side glance at Paula and love welled in his eyes. [...] "Is she a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> prey, Dick?" ...|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy Fables is a Final Fantasy spinoff {{starring}} a Chocobo in {{a setting}} which features common elements and <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> the series. Music {{from the rest of}} the series is also reused. The game is composed of a number of minigames woven into a main adventure. The game was received positively by critics, who appreciated the originality and light-hearted nature of the title.|$|E
5|$|Spoo is {{a fictional}} {{foodstuff}} {{that served as}} a running joke within the Babylon 5 science fiction television series. In the series' fictional universe, spoo is made from worm-like <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> the same name and is generally regarded as the most delicious food in the galaxy; the creature itself, however, is regarded with contempt by most species. Despite appearing only in a few episodes, spoo was embraced by fans and became part of the series' extended mythology.|$|E
5|$|This was the {{original}} idea for the story to open the tenth season. This story took aspects from The Seventh Seal, with the ruler of the Time Lords playing a variation of Chess with Death, who was leading a Federation of Evil. The three Doctors would get transported to an Underworld-like realm, where they would face such <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> evil like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the Seven Deadly Sins. This was deemed too expensive and not suitable for a family show.|$|E

5|$|Delta Squad {{kills the}} Riftworm {{before it can}} sink Jacinto {{and returns to the}} surface. They are ordered to {{investigate}} a nearby abandoned COG outpost where they encounter experimented <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin and learn of a back door entrance to the Hollow in the nearby Kadar Mountains. They find prisoner cages and Dom convinces Marcus that Maria (Dom's wife) must be inside one of them. They manage to find her, but the Locust imprisonment and torture has left her severely disfigured and traumatized, unable to communicate. Faced with the nigh-vegetative state Maria is in, Dom tearfully chooses to euthanize her. Marcus and Dom then charge into the Locust stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Following Kid, {{the group}} infiltrates Viper Manor {{on the night}} of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> legend while {{unraveling}} the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core. The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality. Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} {{an existential}} quest {{to establish his}} identity, seemingly finding an answer in the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E

5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E
5|$|The Pitch Document {{described}} Avatars as {{sharing the}} ability to envision the past, present and future, both literally and symbolically. Accessing this plane of pure truth is given as an Avatar's birthright and can be improved through study and practice. Avatars can manipulate and transmit the resulting visions through dreams to others. As far as established, only <b>Creatures</b> <b>of</b> Darkness suffer physical weakness or pain when their opposite makes use of his powers. Avatars can sense the existence of their moral opponent, but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity. They can, however, easily detect and locate an Avatar of like kind over great distances with great accuracy. These abilities contribute to the convergence of the two storylines in Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|The god Hermes {{is not in}} the game, but in the novel, he is {{responsible}} for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide. New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains how certain <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> the mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna, and was released by Ares.|$|E
5000|$|Rod Serling said of Star Trek, [...] "Star Trek {{was again}} a very {{inconsistent}} show which at times sparkled with true ingenuity and pure science fiction approaches. At {{other times it}} was more carnival-like, and very much more the <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> television than the <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> a legitimate literary form." ...|$|R

5|$|The idea of Ranko brought {{together}} two popular fictional <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> the 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, {{who had been}} introduced in the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, itself an adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E
5|$|The spire can {{be divided}} into three sections. The lower section, which is the base, is formed of seven {{superimposed}} layers, each layer representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is {{in the shape of a}} bell; however the roundness has been flattened to create a four sided shape. This represents the stupa in which the Buddha's ashes have been interred. The top section is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or the crystal dew drop signifying the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on its four sides; as well as being the symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> the Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and time frame as that of Half-Life, taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. As in Opposing Force, Blue Shift shows the events of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different protagonist. The player assumes the role of Barney Calhoun, a security guard working near the labs where the accident takes place. Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of equipment and materials and the welfare of research personnel, and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone, he must work with Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist involved in the experiment, to evacuate the facility.|$|E

500|$|As {{confirmed}} by Daniel Knauf and the Pitch Document, the Avatars {{of the current}} generation (at the end of Season 2) are Ben as the <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Light and Brother Justin as the <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Darkness. Justin is also the Usher, spiritually represented by the Tattooed Man. Their respective fathers were Avatars of the previous generation: Henry Scudder was the <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Darkness, and Lucius Belyakov (Management) was the <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Light. At each time, an Avatar's blood color mirrored his status. Ben's and Brother Justin's blood were red when they were Princes, and upon becoming Prophets, their blood turned into Vitae Divina (blue blood). [...] Scudder's father Hilton was an Avatar of undisclosed nature. The mentalist of the carnival, Lodz, was merely a mortal who had once received Avataric skills from Scudder {{in exchange for his}} sense of sight.|$|R

5|$|Decay {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and timeframe as Half-Life. Half-Life takes place at a laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility, situated in a remote desert in New Mexico. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. Like the previous expansions, Decay shows the story of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different set of protagonists. In Decay, players assume the roles of Colette Green and Gina Cross, two doctors who work in the same labs as Freeman, analyzing anomalous materials and specimens retrieved from Xen in prior teleportation experiments. After the experiment that causes the alien invasion takes place, Green and Cross must work with two ranking members of the science team, Dr. Richard Keller and Dr. Rosenberg, to contain and stabilize the deteriorating situation in Black Mesa.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{later in the}} game that the true villain is Ganon, King of Darkness. He has stolen a powerful trident {{and used it to}} take control of parts of Hyrule. He then stole the dark mirror and used it to create Shadow Link and then sent him to kidnap the shrine maidens and trick Link into releasing Vaati. In order to gain as much power as possible and build up his army, Ganon wants {{to take control of the}} shrine maidens' power as well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army. Vaati unknowingly furthered his plans by creating monsters to add to his army. It {{is revealed}} that the Knights of Hyrule were murdered by Ganon and their souls were trapped in the World of Darkness where they became <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> Darkness. The four Links eventually save the shrine maidens, retrieve the Dark Mirror, destroy Shadow Link and Vaati, and face Ganon in a final battle. Trying to stop him from plunging the world into chaos, the four Links use the Power of the Maidens of Shrines, Including Zelda, to defeat Ganon, penetrating him.|$|E
5|$|Menace is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players control a powerful alien space fighter, moving through six stages {{on the planet}} of Draconia to advance through the game. Players use the ship's weaponry—lasers and cannons—to attack all advancing enemies, and defeat the level's boss: a guardian of Draconia. The six bosses act as Draconia's living defence mechanisms—the planet was created to habituate gruesome and harmful <b>creatures,</b> <b>of</b> which there are over sixty, participating in unlawful tasks. In the game's levels, players discover space debris, which can be converted into upgrades for the ship. The debris appears as tokens, and grants players additional weapons and upgrades, such as lasers, cannons, and improved ship and weapon power. The ship also has a shield, which provides temporary protection from enemies; contact with enemies and walls depletes the shields, increasing players' vulnerability to death.|$|E
