40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Medicare <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> [...] managed care plans paid based on the reasonable costs of delivering Medicare-covered services [...] enroll {{a small number of}} beneficiaries compared to Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicare's managed care program in which the plans accept financial risk if their costs exceed fixed payments received for each enrolled beneficiary. Despite the small enrollment, industry representatives stated that <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> provide a managed care option in areas that traditionally had few or no MA plans. Current law allows existing <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> to continue operating unless specific MA plans of sufficient enrollment serve the same area. In such cases, the <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> must discontinue serving that area beginning in 2011. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) required the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine issues related to the conversion of Medicare <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> to MA plans. In response, GAO (1) determined the MA options available to beneficiaries in <b>cost</b> <b>plans,</b> (2) described key differences for beneficiaries between <b>cost</b> <b>plans,</b> MA plans, and Medicare fee-for-service (FFS); (3) determined the extent to which organizations offering <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> also offer MA plans; and (4) described concerns <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> have about converting to MA plans. GAO analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare.

40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} of final tender sums of building projects from the <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> has posed challenges for construction industry practitioners in New Zealand, especially Quantity Surveyors. No {{matter how much}} care and effort is put into the preparation of design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans,</b> significant deviations are usually observed between these <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> and the final tender sum. The major reason for this deviation is the risk inherent in both design and construction. This study is a literature-based theoretical exploration and part of an on-going doctoral research aimed at assessing the impacts of risk on the variability between design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> and final tender sum. This paper first provides {{a review of the}} risk elements inherent in preparing the design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> by demonstrating the theoretical context. Also, it develops a methodology for assessing risk impacts on the variability between the design stage elements <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> and final tender sum. The insights gained from the foregoing steps then helped in devising theoretical concepts for securing the design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> as a reliable budgetary tool that guarantees cost certainty for building projects, and also a methodological frame-work for assessing the variability between the design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> and final tender sum...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of final tender sums (contract sums) of building projects depends on reliable projections of baseline <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> {{developed at the}} design development stage. However, {{no matter how much}} care and effort is put into the preparation of design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans,</b> deviations are usually observed between these <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> and the final tender sum. This makes accurate predictions challenging for construction practitioners in New Zealand. The major attributable factors for the observed variability are inherent risks in the design stage elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> development. Whilst this is recognised, this study evaluates the reliability of elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> in traditional building procurement. The study seeks to answer the question: is elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plan</b> a reliable budgetary tool for construction projects? The study was undertaken based on 20 completed building projects from which secondary data were collected within the New Zealand construction industry. Data analysis was carried out using document analysis and percentage deviation of final tender sums from the <b>cost</b> <b>plans.</b> Further analyses were carried out using root mean square and relative mean absolute deviation methods of analyses. The results showed that the budgetary reliability of elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> varied depending on project types. Whilst a deviation of - 3. 67 % and + 3. 95 % was obtained on the residential projects analysed, the deviation on educational projects was between - 3. 98 % and + 12. 15 %. Commercial projects attracted - 14. 22 % and + 16. 33 % while in the case of refurbishment projects, a deviation of - 10. 07 % and + 30. 14 % was obtained. These findings suggest that the larger or more complex a project is, the less reliable it is to use elemental <b>cost</b> <b>plans</b> to guarantee <b>cost</b> certainty...|$|R

40|$|For {{several years}} tax dollars have {{gradually}} diminished, causing {{parks and recreation}} managers to become more entrepreneurial in developing financial strategies for delivering high quality and cost efficient recreational services to the citizens. One financial tool, under much discussion, is for parks and recreation managers to establish formal <b>cost</b> recovery <b>plans</b> for their departments. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study in which local Nevada governmental parks and recreation departments were surveyed and evaluated to determine if they are using formal <b>cost</b> recovery <b>plans</b> and if <b>cost</b> efficiencies have been improved. The research focused on identifying factors associated with the development of formal <b>cost</b> recovery <b>plans</b> and the financial impact of formal <b>cost</b> recovery <b>plans.</b> The survey results indicate that Nevada‚Äôs parks and recreation departments continue to be reliant on the general fund. On average, departments derive 70 % of their operational dollars from the general fund and collect approximately 25 % from fees and charges. The data collected show that all organizations responding have some type of cost recovery practice, mostly from fees and charges, but less than 35 % have a formal <b>cost</b> recovery <b>plan.</b> This number will increase to approximately 50 % when current plans in the developmental process are completed and implemented. Urban cities with large budgets and serving large populations report having formal <b>cost</b> recovery <b>plans.</b> None of the county agencies reports having a formal <b>cost</b> recovery <b>plan</b> established for their parks and recreation departments. Caution must be taken when drawing conclusions regarding county parks and recreation departments as only 50 % of the counties returned a survey.
