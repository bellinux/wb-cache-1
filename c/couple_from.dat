5|$|Davis {{contacted}} Beshear, {{asking for}} an executive order to protect clerks who have moral objections against personally issuing such marriage licenses, as Kentucky law requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses in their names. She began turning away gay couples from her county office who were seeking marriage licenses. David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex <b>couple</b> <b>from</b> Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a marriage license and requesting that they turn off their camera. The video went viral overnight.|$|E
5|$|On November1, 1941, the Rainbow Bridge {{was officially}} opened during a simple ceremony. The oldest living couple {{known to have}} wed in Niagara Falls, a pair from Pennsylvania, {{were the first to}} cross, {{followed}} by a newlywed <b>couple</b> <b>from</b> Georgia. This symbolically tied the history of the two bridges together, and was followed by McQuesten and Johnson walking towards the centre of the structure from the Canadian and American sides, respectively, and shaking hands at the centre. Several pyrotechnic explosions at both ends capped the ceremony, and the bridge was opened to traffic.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his sudden death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the <b>couple</b> <b>from</b> his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E
5|$|George {{was deeply}} devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was {{not shared by}} his brothers. George was appalled {{by what he saw}} as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer, and the {{following}} year Cumberland married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the <b>couple</b> <b>from</b> the Hanoverian succession. George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.|$|E
5|$|Judy was a {{pure-bred}} {{liver and}} white Pointer. She {{was born in}} February 1936 in the Shanghai Dog Kennels, a boarding kennel used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China. Judy was one of seven puppies to a dog named Kelly owned by a <b>couple</b> <b>from</b> Sussex. At {{the age of three}} months, she escaped and had been kept in a back alley by a shopkeeper until she was six months old. Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the kennel, her mother and siblings were no longer there.|$|E

In the present, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), leaves Grey {{and their two children}} to go to Washington to resign from the President's brain mapping project. While she is at Grey-Sloan, Grey returns a call from Shepherd as he drives to the airport, and the two speak briefly until his phone loses its signal. Shortly thereafter, Shepherd witnesses a road accident and stops to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated leg. With assistance from Winnie, he rescues another <b>couple</b> <b>from</b> their car right before it explodes, and offers them emergency medical care.|$|E
5|$|Victoria married Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich in 1905. They wed {{without the}} formal {{approval}} of Britain's King Edward VII, {{required by the}} Royal Marriages Act 1772, and in defiance of Tsar Nicholas II. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honours, also initially banishing the <b>couple</b> <b>from</b> Russia. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas recognized her as Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna. After {{the fall of the}} Russian monarchy in 1917, they escaped to Finland where she gave birth to her only son. In exile they lived for some years among her relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac. In 1926, Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile and Victoria supported her husband's claims. Victoria died after suffering a stroke while visiting her daughter Maria in Amorbach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{demonstrate}} {{how to apply}} <b>Coupling</b> <b>from</b> the Past, a simulation technique for exact sampling, to Markov chains based on TCP variants. This approach provides a new, statistically sound paradigm for network simulations: instead of simulating a protocol over long times, or explicitly finding the stationary distribution of a Markov chain, use <b>Coupling</b> <b>from</b> the Past to quickly obtain samples from the stationary distribution. <b>Coupling</b> <b>from</b> the Past is most efficient when the underlying state space satisfies a partial order and certain monotonicity conditions. To efficiently apply this general paradigm to TCP, we demonstrate that the states of a simple TCP model possess a monotonic partial order; this order appears interesting in its own right. Preliminary simulation results indicate that this approach is quite efficient, and produces results which {{are similar to those}} obtained by simulating a TCP-Tahoe connection.
