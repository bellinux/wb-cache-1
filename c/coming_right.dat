5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E
25|$|The Opotiki {{district}} is bounded on one long side by {{the eastern half}} of the Bay of Plenty embayment of the Pacific Ocean and on the other long side by the Raukumara mountain range which rises to 1754m (5755ft) at Mt. Hikurangi. The {{district is}} predominantly steep hills dissected by fast-flowing rivers, the largest being the Motu. The coastal riverine floodplains (‘flats’) and terraces (‘tablelands’) provide the only flat land. Opotiki township is situated on the largest flat at the conjunction of two of these, the Otara River and the Waioeka River. Sandy beaches, lower hills and larger flats are characteristic of the southwest area of the district; pebbly or rocky beaches and high hills <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> down to the sea are characteristic of the northeast. Current human population is therefore concentrated in the coastal southwest. The district has a land area of 3,104.54km² (1,198.67 sq mi).|$|E

Visual Effects Supervisor John Wash recalls, [...] "We devised a laser effect where a device {{is going into}} his mouth and some other weird lens effects that were going over the scene to give it an alien, other-world-like quality." [...] On the subject of using not only a challengingly minuscule method of filming but also additional sound effects, supervising producer Paul Rabwin recounts, [...] "I had to set up a very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> at us. It was very, very scary. We ended up putting some really cool sound effects in there, little servos and motors." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Yao's {{first meeting}} with Shaquille O'Neal on January 17, 2003, O'Neal said, [...] "Tell Yao Ming, Ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh", {{prompting}} accusations of racism. O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, {{and said he was}} only joking. Yao also said he believed O'Neal was joking, but he said a lot of Asians would not see the humor. In the game, Yao scored the Rockets' first six points of the game and blocked O'Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O'neal, all 4 of those attempts <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10seconds left in overtime. Yao finished with 10points, 10rebounds, and 6blocks; O'Neal recorded 31points, 13rebounds, and 0blocks. O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E
500|$|Stan's Uncle Jimbo and his Vietnam War buddy Ned take Stan, Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman on {{a hunting}} {{trip in the}} mountains. As they arrive, Jimbo {{explains}} to the boys how to hunt. Whenever they see a creature, they shoot it after yelling, [...] "It's <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> for us!", so they can claim the shooting was in self-defense. Stan {{does not have the}} proper temperament to enjoy hunting, and finds himself unable to shoot a living target. Unlike Stan, Kenny is able to shoot animals, impressing Jimbo. Meanwhile, South Park geologist Randy discovers that the mountain on which the boys are hunting is a volcano that is about to erupt. He reports his findings to the Mayor, who directs one of her aides to make appropriate decisions about the crisis.|$|E

500|$|The Astonishing is Dream Theater's second concept album after 1999's [...] Described as an [...] "honest-to-God rock opera" [...] by Rolling Stone, it {{has been}} {{compared}} to The Who's Tommy (1969), Rush's 2112 (1976), Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979), and Queensrÿche's [...] (1988). 2112 also revolves around music being used to achieve freedom in a futuristic setting. The album's story was inspired by Petrucci's love of fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, as well as his observations on the role of technology in modern-day society. In an interview with Billboard, he explained, “I was thinking of all of the things now that people used to do that they don’t do anymore because they’re automated or done by robots: lots of jobs, self-driving cars <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> around the corner ... My thought was, 'What would happen if ... music [...] all artificial?’” ...|$|E
500|$|At 8:15 am Missouri {{crossed the}} danger bearing into the shoal water. At this time Commander Peckham {{sent a message}} to Captain Brown stating [...] "Ship heading into Danger shoals. Recommend you come right immediately!", but this message was relayed by [...] "talkers" [...] (men charged with {{relaying}} messages for officers to different stations) and the talker who was supposed to pass Peckham's message to Brown had a tendency to mumble badly. At the same time Peckham was attempting to alert Brown of the impending grounding, Morris again approached Brown and recommended <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> to avoid the shoal water. Captain Brown did not recall being informed of this, and made no reply to Morris. At this point Morris took a bearing on Thimble Shoals, and alarmed at the impending grounding Morris frantically returned to the captain waving his arms and shouting [...] "Come right! There's shoal water ahead!" [...] A disbelieving Captain Brown dismissed Morris pleas by stating that it was his belief that the navigator did not know where they were. To verify Morris' claims of impending shoal water, Brown asked Commander Millet to check Morris's position. As a precautionary move, Brown then ordered Quartermaster Travis, Missouris helmsman, to alter course to 058, but this order came too late.|$|E
500|$|The Jesus Vs. Satan {{pay-per-view}} event [...] "Boutin' at the Mountain" [...] is {{a parody}} of similarly advertised pay-to-watch boxing events featured on the premium cable channel HBO. Before Jimbo shoots Kenny in his platypus state, he screams, [...] "It's <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> for us!" [...] This is {{a reference to the}} previous South Park episode [...] "Volcano", in which Jimbo takes the children hunting and tells them to shout the phrase before shooting anything to get around restrictive hunting laws. Cartman insults Damien by asking if he got his haircut from Stevie Wonder, a blind soul and R singer. For his birthday, Cartman wants the complete line of a set of action figures called Mega Man. Although named Mega Man, the multi-colored figures were actually inspired by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the 1993 children's action series which was still popular {{at the time of the}} episode's original broadcast. The script was originally written with direct references to the Power Rangers, but Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to change the name due to copyright issues. Cartman receives Ants in the Pants, an actual children's tabletop game, as a birthday present. Stone described Ants in the Pants as [...] "the lamest game ever", which is why Cartman responds so negatively to the gift in the episode.|$|E

500|$|Having {{become a}} {{political}} liability in Virginia, Beauregard was transferred to Tennessee to become second-in-command to General Albert Sidney Johnston (no relation to Joseph E. Johnston) in his Army of Mississippi, effective March 14, 1862. The two generals planned the concentration of Confederate forces to oppose the advance of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant before he could combine his army with that of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell in a thrust up the Tennessee River toward Corinth, Mississippi. [...] The march from Corinth was plagued by bad weather, which delayed the army's arrival by several days, and during that time, several contacts were made with Union scouts. [...] Because of this, Beauregard felt {{the element of surprise}} had been lost and recommended calling off the attack, but Johnston decided to proceed with the plan. [...] In the Battle of Shiloh, which began April 6, 1862, the Confederates launched a surprise attack against Grant's Army of the Tennessee, which despite days of prior reports of Confederate troop movements, were completely unaware that the entire Army of Mississippi was <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> at them. Once again a more senior general named Johnston deferred to the junior Beauregard in planning the attack. The massive frontal assault was marred by Beauregard's improper organization of forces—successive attacks by corps in lines [...] long, rather than assigning each corps a discrete portion of the line for a side-by-side assault. This arrangement caused intermingling of units and confusion of command; it failed to concentrate mass at the appropriate place on the line to affect the overall objectives of the attack. In midafternoon, Johnston, who was near the front of the battle action, was mortally wounded. Beauregard, positioned {{in the rear of the}} army to send reinforcements forward, assumed command of the army and Johnston's overall Western department (officially designated [...] "Department Number Two"). As darkness fell, he chose to call off the attack against Grant's final defensive line, which had contracted into a tight semicircle backed up to the Tennessee River at Pittsburg Landing.|$|E
