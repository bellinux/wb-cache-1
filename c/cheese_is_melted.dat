40|$|<b>Cheese</b> Fondue <b>is</b> a Swiss {{national}} dish {{which combines}} cheese and bread. In years past, quantities {{of bread and}} <b>cheese</b> <b>were</b> made during the winter for use throughout the year. Gradually, both became very hard. To make them more edible, the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> <b>melted</b> and the bread dunked in this mixture. Fondue to served informally in a festive atmosphere. Each person spears a piece of crusty bread with a fork, going through the soft part first to secure the points in the crust. The bread is dunked in the fondue with a stirring motion. This extension circular discusses the fondue equipment, how to use, care and store it. The different ingredients {{that can be used}} in fondue and recipes using cheese, chocolate, and wine are also covered...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{recipe for}} cheese fondue {{as we know}} it today comes from a 1699 book published in Zurich, under the name [...] "Käss mit Wein zu kochen", [...] "to cook cheese with wine". It calls for grated or cut-up <b>cheese</b> to <b>be</b> <b>melted</b> with wine, and for bread to be dipped in it.|$|R
50|$|The cheesesteak is a {{sandwich}} traditionally made with sliced beef and melted cheese on an Italian roll. In the 1930s, the phenomenon as a steak sandwich began when hot dog vendor brothers Pat Olivieri and Harry Olivieri put grilled beef {{on a hot}} dog bun {{and gave it to}} a taxi driver. Later, after Pat and Harry had started selling the sandwich on Italian rolls, the cheesesteak was affixed in the local culture when one of their cooks put melted cheese on the sandwich. Originally, the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> <b>melted</b> in a separate container to accommodate their large clientele who followed kosher rules (thereby not mixing dairy and meat). Today, cheese choices in Philadelphia eateries are virtually limited to American, Provolone, or Cheez Whiz. The latter is especially popular in those places that prominently carry it.|$|R
50|$|The cheese used in cheese saganaki {{is usually}} graviera, kefalograviera, halloumi, kasseri, kefalotyri, or sheep's milk feta cheese. Regional {{variations}} {{include the use}} of formaela cheese in Arachova and halloumi in Cyprus. The <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> <b>melted</b> in a small frying pan until it is bubbling and generally served with lemon juice and pepper. It is eaten with bread.|$|E
50|$|When assembled, the {{sandwich}} can be toasted in a sandwich press called a plancha, {{which is similar}} to a panini press but without grooved surfaces. The plancha both heats and compresses {{the sandwich}}, which remains in the press until the bread surface is slightly crispy and the <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> <b>melted.</b> It is usually cut into diagonal halves before serving.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{preparation}} involves {{cheese and}} other ingredients sandwiched between two flour tortillas, {{with the whole}} package grilled on an oiled griddle and flipped so both sides are cooked and the <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> <b>melted.</b> This version is often cut into wedges to serve. A home appliance (quesadilla maker) is sold to produce this kind of quesadilla, although it does not use oil and cooks both sides at once. This type {{is similar to the}} Mexican sincronizada; but in the United States, they often also have fajita beef or chicken or other ingredients instead of ham. That kind of quesadilla is also Mexican, and it is called [...] "gringa" [...] (the name varies in some regions in Mexico, there's also a type of quesadilla called [...] "chavindeca").|$|E

50|$|The steamed cheeseburger {{is cooked}} in a {{stainless-steel}} cabinet which contains small trays that hold either an individual hamburger or {{a chunk of}} <b>cheese</b> to <b>be</b> <b>melted.</b> The cheeseburger <b>is</b> served by scooping the meat onto a bun and pouring the melted cheese over the meat.

50|$|A modern way {{of serving}} raclette {{involves}} an electric table-top grill with small pans, known as coupelles, {{in which to}} melt slices of raclette cheese. Generally the grill is surmounted by a hot plate or griddle. The <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> brought to the table sliced, accompanied by platters of boiled or steamed potatoes, other vegetables and charcuterie. These are then mixed with potatoes and topped with cheese in the small, wedge-shaped coupelles that are placed under the grill to melt and brown the cheese. Alternatively, slices of <b>cheese</b> may <b>be</b> <b>melted</b> and simply poured over food on the plate. The emphasis in raclette dining is on relaxed and sociable eating and drinking, the meal often running to several hours. French and other European supermarkets generally stock both the grill apparatus and ready-sliced cheese and charcuterie selections, especially around Christmas. Restaurants also provide raclette evenings for parties of diners.|$|R
40|$|Nonfat (0 % fat), reduced-fat (11 % fat), {{and control}} (19 % fat) mozzarella <b>cheeses</b> <b>were</b> made using direct {{acidification}} {{to test the}} influence of three levels (0. 25 X, 1 X, and 4 X) of coagulant concentration on proteolysis, meltability and rheological properties of cheeses during 60 d of storage at 5 °C. Changes in meltability, level of intact αs 1 -casein and β-casein (by capillary electrophoresis), 12. 5 % TCA-soluble nitrogen, and complex modulus were measured. There were differences in rate of proteolysis and functional properties {{as a function of}} fat content of the cheese, but some of these differences could be attributed to differences in moisture contents of the cheeses. As fat level decreased, the percent moisture-in-nonfat-substance of the cheeses also decreased. Cheeses with the lower fat contents (and consequently the lowest moisture-in-nonfat-substance content) had slower rates of proteolysis. Fat content influenced the complex modulus of the cheese, with the biggest effect occurring when fat content was reduced from 11 to 0 %. Coagulant level had only a small effect on initial modulus. Cheeses became softer during storage, and the decrease in modulus was influenced by the level of coagulant. At 0. 25 X, there was very little decrease in modulus after 60 d, while at 1 X and 4 X coagulant levels the softening of the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> more evident. The influence of coagulant level and fat content on <b>cheese</b> <b>melting</b> <b>was</b> similar to their effects on complex modulus. In general, higher fat contents promoted more melting and so did higher coagulant levels. Melting increased during storage although very little change was observed in the nonfat cheese...|$|R
5000|$|Asiago ( [...] or [...] ) is an Italian cow's milk cheese {{that can}} assume {{different}} textures, {{according to its}} aging, from smooth for the fresh Asiago (Asiago Pressato) to a crumbly texture for the aged cheese (Asiago d'allevo), the flavor of which is reminiscent of Parmesan.

40|$|The basic raw {{materials}} {{for the production of}} processed <b>cheese</b> <b>are</b> natural <b>cheese</b> which <b>is</b> treated by heat with the addition of emulsifying salts.
