50|$|Apart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial, {{can cause}} {{parotitis}} (acute suppurative parotitis or <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis).</b> These infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external compression. Parotid gland swellings {{can also be}} due to benign lymphoepithelial lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sjögren syndrome. Swelling of the parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating {{the look of a}} heavy jaw line. With the inflammation of mumps or obstruction of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.|$|E
5000|$|Painless, noticeably felt growths are {{the most}} common presentations {{described}} in medical literature. [...] Benign parotid gland neoplasms typically present after the age of 40 and have an equal presentation in both genders. [...] Malignant growths predominantly affect women over the age of 60. [...] The most common form of benign parotid neoplasms are pleomorphic adenomas.The most common form of malignant parotid neoplasms are mucoepidermoid carcinomas. [...] The exact cause of malignant parotid tumors is still unknown, however they can be caused by metastasis (spread of cancer) from other areas of the body, certain work exposures, reduced immunity, HIV, as well as radiation exposure. Contrary to other cancers, it is believed that smoking and drinking do not influence salivary gland malignancies. [...] Inflammation ailments of the parotid gland, such as parotid abscesses (collections of pus), deep salivary calculi (mineral deposits), and <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis</b> (long-term inflammation) may necessitate a total parotidectomy. [...] Also, sialorrhea (excessive salivation) may be remedied by a parotidectomy, yet treatment by medication or even duct ligation (surgical tying) are the less invasive approaches.|$|E

40|$|Sixteen human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) —seropositive children aged 5 to 12 years (nine girls and seven boys), born to HIV- 1 —infected mothers, were diagnosed between 1984 and 1987 in Kigali, Rwanda. They were compared {{with a group of}} age- and sex-matched HIV- 1 —sero-negative children consecutively selected from the outpatient department. Two subjects were asymptomatic. Chronic cough was the most frequent symptom (seven of 16 patients). The most common signs were short stature (12 of 16 patients), low weight for age (seven of 16 patients), <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis</b> (eight of 16 patients), persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (seven of 16 patients), and pulmonary tuberculosis (four of 16 patients). Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis was diagnosed on radiologic grounds in five of 16 patients. Evidence of perivasculitis in the fundus was noted in three of 16 patients. Two children died during the study period (mean duration of follow-up, 40 months; range, 27 to 62 months); none of the other children had life-threatening infection or loss of developmental milestones. Immunologic assessment in the 16 children revealed high levels of IgG, decreased CD 4 + /CD 8 + ratio, and skin test anergy. Endocrinologic investigations revealed normal thyroid function and normal basal human growth hormone levels but low basal insulinlike growth factor I levels (0. 21 ± 0. 07 vs 0. 44 ± 0. 20 U/mL for controls). In Kigali, perinatally HIV- 1 —infected children surviving beyond 5 years of age often present with moderate signs and symptoms, principally pulmonary involvement, <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis,</b> and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. Short stature is the major clinical manifestation in these patients and may be due, in part, to low growth hormone secretion rather than to malnutrition. © 1991, American Medical Association.

40|$|Swelling of {{the parotid}} {{suggests}} pathological change. Enlargement of {{the parotid gland}} may result from infections, duct obstruction, benign or malignant tumors, allergies, autoimmune or systemic disease syndromes or lymphoproliferative diseases. Acute swelling is typically associated with viral infection or recurrent <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis.</b> A rare cause of acute swelling is insufflation of air from the mouth via Stensenâs duct into the parotid region. We report a case of recurrent self-induced chronic pneumoparotitis with parapharyngeal extension in a teenager. Pneumoparotitis is rare and is often misdiagnosed and mistreated. Patients typically present with unilateral or bilateral painless swelling and tenderness in the parotid region. Imaging, including computer tomography scans, shows air within the parotid system that extends into the neighboring areas in cases of rupture of the parotid fascia. Salivary gland enlargement resolves spontaneously over 1 â 3 days. Some authors recommend anti-inflammatory drugs and prophylactic antibiotics to avoid superinfection. Several surgical treatments have been suggested for chronic and recurrent pneumoparotid. However, the primary challenge is to educate the patient to prevent an increase in intraoral pressure.

Our aim was to evaluate the involvement of respiratory and oropharyngeal viruses in acute episodes of ICRP. Seventy children were studied, 50 patients and 20 age-matched controls, in a 2 -year follow-up study. Saliva samples were taken from the parotid duct and analyzed by viral isolation and immunofluorescence for adenovirus (Ad), respiratory sincitial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PI), influenza virus (Flu), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Paired sera samples were tested by ELISA for anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgG and anti-mumps IgM and IgG. Viral infections were detected in 7 / 50 (14 %) cases of the ICRP group: one CMV; 2 Enteroviruses isolated in human embryonic lung fibroblast cells; 1 Flu A; and 3 mumps virus. No EBV seroconversions were detected. In the control group, 2 out of the 20 children had an asymptomatic mumps positive IgM titer.

40|$|During {{the active}} phase of <b>chronic</b> {{recurrent}} <b>parotitis</b> there zs a marked elevation in the parotid concentration of lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding glycoprotein with antibacterial properties. The Lf concentration decreases during the recovery period, but still remains above normal levels. The changes of Lf in parotitis parallel recent findings in mastitis and pancreatitis. Elevations in Lf were also noted {{in five of}} six subjects with Sjfgren's disease, but not in subjects with sarcoidosis, diabetes or "dry mouth " without sialographic changes. The source of the Lf has not been determined; it coutld arise in part from disrupting polymorph-onuclear leucocytes and in part from epithelial cells that synthesize Lf in the salivary glands. Inflammatory stimulation of Lf synthesis would-suggest a basic protective mqchanism in exo-crine glands and should be fully explored. J Dent Res 57 (1) : 43 - 47 January 1978. Elevations {{in the level of}} lactoferrin (Lf), an antibacterial iron-binding glycoprotein, have been reported in a number of infectious proces-ses, including bovine mastitis", 2 and human pancreatitis. " 4 The bacteriostatic properties of Lf have been attributed to "nutritional immun-ity,' 5 the ability of the unsaturated protein to bind two iron atoms per molecule and thus withhold metabolically essential iron from in-vading bacteria. It has been suggested 6 that Lf plays a particularly important role in protection-of epithelial tissues from infection.

40|$|Ceruminous adenomas are benign tumors {{that are}} rare in humans and present with a nonspecific symptomatology. The {{treatment}} of choice is surgical excision. We present an 87 -year-old woman who presented with a reddish, tender, round, soft mass of the outer third of the inferior wall of the left external auditory canal, discharging a yellowish fluid upon pressure. Coincidentally, due to her poor general condition, this patient also showed symptoms consistent with <b>chronic</b> otitis media, <b>parotitis,</b> and cervical lymphadenopathy, such as otorrhea, through a ruptured tympanic membrane and swelling of the parotid gland and cervical lymph nodes.

40|$|Postsurgical acute {{suppurative}} parotitis is {{a bacterial}} gland infection that occurs from a few days up to some weeks after abdominal surgical procedures. In this study, the authors analyze the prevalence of this complication in Hospital das Clínicas/São Paulo University Medical School by prospectively reviewing the charts of patients who underwent surgeries performed by the gastroenterological and general surgery staff from 1980 to 2005. Diagnosis of parotitis or sialoadenitis was analyzed. Sialolithiasis and <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis</b> previous to hospitalization were exclusion criteria. In a total of 100, 679 surgeries, 256 patients were diagnosed with parotitis or sialoadenitis. Nevertheless, only three cases of acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis associated with the surgery were identified giving an incidence of 0. 0028 %. All patients presented with risk factors such as malnutrition, immunosuppression, prolonged immobilization and dehydration. In the past, acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis was a relatively common complication after major abdominal surgeries. Its incidence decreased {{as a consequence of}} the improvement of perioperative antibiotic therapy and postoperative support. In spite of the current low incidence, we believe it is important to identify risks and diagnose as quick as possible, in order to introduce prompt and appropriate therapeutic measures and avoid potentially fatal complications with the evolution of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Hyper IgM {{syndrome}} (HIM SX) {{is a rare}} congenital {{primary immunodeficiency}} that affects males more than females (70 %, x-Iinked recessive), but {{there are reports of}} autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritances. In this study, we review medical histories of 2 affected girls and one affected boy. Our 3 cases fulfill clinical and laboratory criteria of this syndrome. Their clinical signs include recurrent pyogenic and opportunistic infections especilly in skin, respiratory and GI tracts, case 2 suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections too. Case 3 experienced P. carinii pnemonia during a severe neutropenic episode. Other signs were 1 - Autoimmunities as neutropenia, throbocytopenia, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia and <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis</b> in second case, 2 - lymphoid hyperplasia presenting as generalized lymphadenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of intestine. Case 3, the 5 year old boy had an ataxic gait and suffered from recurrent herpetic keratoconjunctivitis and stomatitis. All the cases had very high serum levels of IgM (> 1000 mg/dl) while other immunoglobulins were low. Sm IgM -f B lymphocytes were increased in the first two cases and CD 40 L on Tcell of the 3 rd case was absent. Occurance of this syndrome in girls is a very rare phenomenon. Presence of high or normal serum IgM level in a hypogammaglobulinemic patient should be a clue for diagnosing this syndrome and could be further confirmed either by studying CD 40 L/CD 40 pathway or through a genetic survey...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} fifteen years, {{increasing}} public demand for minimally-invasive surgery and recent technological advances {{have led to the}} development of a number of conservative options for the therapeutic management of obstructive salivary disorders such as calculi and duct stenosis. These include extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, sialoendoscopy, laser intra-corporeal lithotripsy, interventional radiology, the video-assisted conservative surgical removal of parotid and sub-mandibular calculi and botulinum toxin therapy. Each of these techniques may be used as a single therapeutic modality or in combination with one or more of the above-mentioned options, usually in day case or one-day case under local or general anaesthesia. The multi-modal approach is completely successful in about 80 % of patients and reduces the need for gland removal in 3 %, thus justifying the combination of, albeit, time-consuming and relatively expensive techniques as part of the modern and functional management of salivary calculi. With regard to the management of salivary duct anomalies, such as strictures and kinkings, interventional radiology with fluoroscopically controlled balloon ductoplasty seems to be the most suitable technique despite the use of radiation. Operative sialoendoscopy alone is the best therapeutic option for all mobile intra-luminal causes of obstruction, such as microliths, mucous plugs or foreign bodies, or for the local treatment of inflammatory conditions such as recurrent <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis</b> or autoimmune salivary disorders. Finally, in the case of failure of one of the above techniques and regardless of the cause of obstruction, botulinum toxin injection into the parenchyma of the salivary glands using colour Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring should be considered before deciding on surgical gland removal...|$|E

40|$|TUMOURS of the {{salivary glands}} are {{relatively}} uncommon. From 1958 through 1968 {{a total of}} 77 lesions of all the salivary glands were seen by one of us (M. B.) and 67 involved the parotid, 8 the submaxillary, one the sublingual and one an ectopic gland. In this paper we present our experience with the 'partoid ' lesions, which comprise the largest group in the series, 67 {{out of a total}} of 77, as enumerated in Table I. CLINICAL FEATURES The classical and frequently the only symptom and sign of a parotid tumour is a swelling. Only occasionally is slight pain or discomfort noted. Very often there is a long delay from the time the swelling is first noticed until the patient is referred to hospital, and in this series it varied from six weeks to 38 years. Of the 7 patients with carcinoma of the parotid, 5 had local pain. Some degree of facial paresis is often mentioned as an early sign, but in this series 5 out of 7 cases had no facial paresis when first seen. So far as could be ascertained, 4 patients had no pre-existing tumour, while in the remaining three there had been a preexisting tumour, presumably benign, for several years. In one instance a tumour had been present for about 30 years, but two months before referral to hospital it began to increase in size, the patient developed pain and there was weakness of the facial nerve. DIFFICULTY IN DIAGNOSIS Accurate pre-operative diagnosis of a swelling in the parotid gland is difficult. Patey (1968) quoted Bland Sutton, who said that swellings in the parotid were "interesting lumps that required removal. " In some cases the history is helpful, and in a few the diagnosis is comparatively easy. Of the lesions listed in Table I, acute non-purulent parotitis, <b>chronic</b> <b>parotitis</b> and calculus are fairly readily diagnosed. Also cystic hygroma and branchial cyst should be suspected from the clinical features. In all the other lesions seen diagnosis was not possible from th...|$|E
