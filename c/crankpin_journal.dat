In preparation of the industrial application, previously ground <b>crankpin</b> <b>journals</b> of crankshafts could successfully be cladded with identical parameters as found on flat specimens in the lab.

40|$|The {{crankshaft}} is {{a complex}} component, and as such, the influence of its geometric parameters on stresses seen under service loads is not well understood. The objectives of this work are to investigate {{the effects of a}} wide range of geometric parameters on stresses in overlapped crankshafts, to find correlation between results and to formulate simple methods of predicting peak stress levels: It is intended to achieve this by use of the Finite Element (FE) and Boundary Element (BE) methods. Individual crankthrows are loaded under the important load cases of bending and torsion. Stress concentration factors are determined by normalising peak stresses with respect to the nominal stress occurring in the most appropriate section in the neck between the fillets. Analyses are carried out in 2 D and 3 D, making use of symmetry as far as possible. Many of the governing dimensions of the crankthrow are included in the analyses; <b>crankpin</b> and <b>journal</b> diameters, <b>crankpin</b> and <b>journal</b> overlap, and web thickness. Variations in SCF are plotted over a wide range for each of these parameters. Additionally, features such as fillet size and shape, bore-holes, dimples, cut-back webs and oil holes are investigated. It is found that the effects on stress of individual parameter changes can be superimposed to accurately predict the effect of combining various parameter changes in one model. The <b>crankpin</b> and <b>journal</b> fillet radii and the length of the minimum section between the fillets are shown to be the critical parameters in determining the peak stress levels in the crankshaft. SCFs obtained from the range of analyses performed show good agreement with the classical theory of SCFs in notched bars. Bore-holes and dimples are found to offer significant benefits in terms of peak stress reduction, in addition to their common usage of reducing the out of balance crankpin mass. The FE and BE methods give accurate results for stress analysis of crankshafts and offer several advantages over traditional experimental techniques; they are ideally suited to parametric analyses, can be carried out relatively quickly, results are repeatable because boundary conditions can be exactly defined, and the cost of analysis is significantly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Repairing {{marine diesel}} engine {{crankshafts}} {{is a significant}} part of overall engine repairs and thus is very important for the ship building and ship repair industry. When a ship’s diesel engine is repaired, crankshaft journal surfaces must be renewed according to very precise geometrical and surface roughness requirements. Although current technologies are sufficient to meet these requirements, they are very time consuming and consequently expensive. A comprehensive research into the surface machining of marine diesel engine crankshaft journals allowed to improve technological processes and to identify respective surface roughness parameters, as well as to provide appropriate technological recommendations. It {{is important to note that}} crankshaft journal surfaces must be seen as 3 D objects, whose micro-topographical surface roughness parameters have to be defined so that they reflect the actual surface. To summarize all available scientific research in this field, we can state that there has been no analysis into the impact of technological regimes on the surface micro-topography of marine engine crankshaft journals. Bearing in mind the aforementioned arguments a study has been launched to develop a novel grinding technology, enabling diesel engine crankshafts with medium-sized <b>crankpin</b> <b>journals</b> to be repaired directly inside the engine housing. This paper covers the following issues: 1) Description of the novel technological equipment for crankshaft journal grinding; 2) 3 D roughness model of the crankshaft journal surface; 3) calculation of 3 D parameters based on practical metrological and technological characteristics. This technology saves significant financial resources as well as reduces engine repair time. By solving problems related to surface accuracy, it is possible to considerably improve the crankshaft machining process, along with the performance of maintenance operations and consequently the overall quality of repair work. In this paper, the crankshaft journal surfaces will be defined using 3 D surface roughness parameters...|$|R
40|$|The IC engine crnakshaft bearings, {{especially}} at the crankpin journals, are very loaded elements.

Selection of lubricating oil from the standpoint of physical characteristics, primarily the appropriate viscosity, has an important place in the area of reducing friction losses in journal bearings and increasing IC engine efficiency. This paper deals with the impact of lubricating oil viscosity on the working conditions of vehicle turbocharged diesel engine crankpin journals. Analyzed parameters are: an oil temperature in the bearing, a change of the maximum value of the average pressure in the oil, the minimum carrying oil layer and the share of mixed friction, all in the function of oil viscosity at the bearing inlet, with different clearances between bearing and <b>crankpin</b> <b>journal.</b> Results were obtained using the model and own developed software to simulate the working conditions of journal bearings with an experimental verification. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Renovation {{of marine}} diesel engine {{crankshaft}} main and crankpin journals surfaces is usually done when ships engine is undergoing repairs. Often heavy {{working conditions and}} intensive wear accompanied with lubrication failures require a complete renovation of these worn-out surfaces. In {{most of the cases}} these repairs are done in the workshop, by removing crankshaft from engine and subsequently performing journal grinding. Where it is necessary also various types of build-up operations are carried out. Final technical requirements for these repairs are demanding: fine surface quality, geometrical accuracy and high surface roughness (texture) parameters have to be ensured. Although available technologies are able to deliver these results, they are very expensive, time consuming and usually can be done only in workshop conditions by highly sophisticated and expensive grinding machinery. This article describes novel technology which has been developed to perform crankshaft <b>crankpin</b> <b>journal</b> surfaces grinding operations directly in engine housing. Furthermore, a comprehensive study of laser build-up techniques and their potential applications for marine crankshaft specifics is outlined. Study confirmed that previously adopted grinding platform can be extended to laser cladding technology.
