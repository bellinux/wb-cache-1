25|$|Wild Oats was co-founded in 1986 by {{husband and}} wife team Mike Gilliland and Libby Cook in 1987 in Boulder, Colorado. Originally {{purchasing}} a convenience store, which they bought with cash advances on 17 credit cards and a second mortgage on Gilliland's mother's house, the pair decided to buy a natural foods market, Crystal Market, which they felt would prosper in health-conscious Boulder. The $300,000 purchase, completed in 1987, thrust the couple into an environment {{quite different from the}} junk-food focus of convenience stores, an environment that gradually persuaded Gilliland and Cook to become healthy eaters themselves. In that first store, Gilliland worked the counter, while Cook worked the deli. Soon, the couple had opened another natural foods store, {{on the south side of}} Boulder, called Wild Oats <b>Community</b> <b>Market.</b> As the Wild Oats business expanded, a holding company was formed, and Gilliland became chief executive officer and president, while Cook became vice-president and in-house attorney.|$|E
