5|$|In 2010, Alexander Shatravka {{published}} his book Pobeg iz Raya (Escape from Paradise) {{in which he}} described {{how he and his}} companions were caught after they illegally <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between Finland and the Soviet Union to escape from the latter country and, as a result, were confined to Soviet psychiatric hospitals and prisons. In his book, he also described methods of brutal treatment of prisoners in the institutions.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{northern}} and central Durand line is quite mountainous, where <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> is often only practical in the numerous passes through <b>the</b> mountains. <b>Border</b> crossings are very common, especially among Pashtuns who <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> to meet relatives or to work. [...] The movement of people <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> has largely been unchecked or uncontrolled, although passports and visas are at times checked at official crossings. In June 2011 the United States installed a biometric system at <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> near Spin Boldak aimed at improving the security situation and blocking the infiltration of insurgents into southern Afghanistan.|$|R

5|$|When Indonesian forces <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Sebatik Island, Sabah on 28 June 1965, HMAS Yarra {{was called}} on to carry out bombardments disrupting the {{withdrawal}} of the Indonesians. Yarra carried out two more bombardments of the border area on 5 and 10 July. During three runs, Yarra fired a total of 70 rounds on the enemy. On 13 August 1966, an agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia brought an end to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas, the {{dictator}} of Argentina, had assisted the separatist rebels in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul during the 1830s, {{and continued to}} attempt its annexation. In addition to the threat to Brazil's territorial integrity, Rosas had ambitions to conquer Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. Brazil's Conservative Cabinet decided to form military alliances with the countries threatened by {{the dictator}}. On 4 September 1851, Brazil's army, commanded by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (then Count of Caxias), <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into Uruguay.|$|E

5|$|Louis XVIII's {{underestimation}} of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, {{the army}} stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital {{with a small}} escort at midnight. Louis decided to go first to Lille, and then <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent. Other leaders, most prominently Alexander I of Russia, debated whether {{in the case of}} a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orléans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.|$|E
5|$|Tension in the Golan Heights area {{remained}} {{high and}} on 9January the Jewish settlements of Dan and Kfar Szold {{were attacked by}} Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army, who <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> from Syria. The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.|$|E

5|$|The Causeway Bay Books disappearances are {{a series}} of {{international}} disappearances concerning five staff members of Causeway Bay Books, located in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Between October and December 2015, five staff of Causeway Bay Books went missing. At least two of them disappeared in mainland China, one in Thailand. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, and eventually revealed to be in Shenzhen, across the Chinese border, without the travel documents necessary to have <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> through legal channels.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican Revolutionary General Pancho Villa, who had at {{one time}} been {{supported}} by the United States, felt betrayed when the Americans backed Carranza. In January 1916, Villa's followers, known as Villistas, attacked a train and killed 16 American businessmen who were aboard. Two months later Villa's men <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into the United States and attacked the town of Columbus, New Mexico, killing an additional 19 Americans. Following these attacks, General Pershing took his forces into Mexico to pursue Pancho Villa.|$|E
5|$|First Russian forces <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in Ukraine on {{the night}} of 18/19 May 1792. The Russians in that theater would {{encounter}} significantly more resistance than they expected, as Commonwealth's top commanders, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were stationed there. Kościuszko joined Prince Poniatowski near Janów on 29 May. The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four columns of enemy armies advancing into West Ukraine and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the Southern Bug River, towards Lubar and Połonne, with Kośiuszko commanding the rear guard. Poniatowski, in face of a significant numerical inferiority of his forces, and promised reinforcements by King Poniatowski, decided to abandon Ukraine and move to Volhynia, where Połonne was to be fortified as a major defensive point, and where Lubomirski was tasked with gathering supplies.|$|E

5000|$|Important to note is the {{mortality}} rate of those attempting to illegally <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> Since 2006, when the Secure Fence Act was introduced, crossing mortalities have exponentially increased. In the last 15 years, around 3,600-5,100 {{people have been killed}} attempting to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> By 2009, <b>the</b> risk of dying while <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in Arizona was 17 times greater than it was a decade earlier, according to one analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union. The current plans for increased border security will heighten this tension. Although illegal border crossings have decreased in recent years, mortalities while crossing have increased.|$|R
5|$|German {{ground forces}} <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} {{the declaration of}} war at 06:00. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid {{from the direction of}} Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based Fliegerführer Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|He {{was shot}} down most {{probably}} by Italian Spanish Civil War ace Tenente Lieutenant) Franco Lucchini of 90a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo ("group"), 4° Stormo ("wing"). He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E
5|$|Henry <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in mid-August. Given-Wilson {{has noted}} the care Henry took not to ravage or pillage the {{countryside}} on their march through Berwickshire and Lothian. This was {{in marked contrast}} to previous expeditions, and Given-Wilson compares it specifically to the 'devastation wreacked' in last such campaign, by Richard II in 1385. This he puts this down to the presence in the English army of the earl of Dunbar, whose lands they were. Brown has suggested the king 'envisaged... a punitive expedition' with either a confrontation or such a chevauchée that the Scots would be eager to negotiate. In the event, they offered no resistance as the English army marched through Haddington.|$|E

5|$|On 21 June, at 13:00 Army Group North {{received}} the codeword Düsseldorf, indicating Barbarossa would commence the next morning, and passed down its own codeword, Dortmund. At around 03:15 on 22 June 1941, the Axis Powers commenced {{the invasion of}} the Soviet Union with the bombing of major cities in Soviet-occupied Poland and an artillery barrage on Red Army defences on the entire front. Air-raids were conducted as far as Kronstadt near Leningrad, Ismail in Bessarabia, and Sevastopol in the Crimea. Meanwhile, ground troops <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> accompanied in some locales by Lithuanian and Ukrainian fifth columnists. Roughly three million soldiers of the Wehrmacht went into action and faced slightly fewer Soviet troops at the border.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Army was not {{directly}} attacked {{during the first}} few days after the invasion commenced, but attacks on its flanks resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Danube and then the Sava. The Hungarians then <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in the sector for which the 1st Army had been responsible, but the Yugoslavs were already withdrawing and the Hungarians faced almost no resistance. This was followed by the German capture of Belgrade and the rear area units of 1st Army. Remnants of the 1st Army continued to resist along the line of the Sava, within days, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers had been captured. The Germans closed on Sarajevo, and accepted the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April, which came into effect at the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Russian army {{numbered}} nearly 98,000. It was {{commanded by}} generals Mikhail Krechetnikov and Mikhail Kakhovsky. The Russians {{also had an}} advantage in combat experience. The Russian plan called for Kakhovsky to advance through Ukraine, taking Kamieniec Podolski, Chełm and Lublin, and approach Polish capital of Warsaw from the south. Krechetnikov was to advance through Minsk, Wilno, Brześć Litewski and Białystok, and approach Warsaw from the north, where he was to link with Kakhovsky. Whereas the Russians had good intelligence network in Poland, and were mostly aware of Polish army distribution and strength; the Poles had much less intelligence, receiving contradictory and often erroneous reports, and unsure whether the war would even start {{up to the point}} the Russian troops <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E
