She finished eighth in the sprint, in which she crashed on a downhill slope, and came in eleventh in the pursuit race. She was not appointed for the individual race and could not start in the mixed relay due to her <b>cold.</b> <b>On</b> 21 February 2009, Neuner claimed silver as part Germany's women's relay team, alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm.

5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the <b>cold</b> <b>on</b> Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter <b>cold</b> <b>on</b> the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|E

500|$|During {{this period}} {{there was a}} fear that, despite the rationing, food {{supplies}} could run out owing {{to the effects of}} the <b>cold</b> <b>on</b> vegetables, livestock and delivery vehicles. In response, the government started a largely unsuccessful campaign to popularise Snoek, an inexpensive South African variety of fish; the public found the fish unpalatable and its stocks were eventually used as cat food.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the effects of naturally-occurring <b>colds</b> <b>on</b> visual attention, psychomotor performance and subjective indices of stress. 204 participants performed a battery of tasks assessing simple reaction time, focused attention, categoric search and vigilance, on two separate occasions. Affective, motivational and cognitive stress state dimensions were measured using a validated questionnaire. On the first occasion, all participants were healthy. On the second occasion, approximately half the sample suffered from a cold. Comparison of cold sufferers with healthy controls showed significant cold effects. In the cold group, response was slower on simple reaction time and focused attention tasks, and detection rate on the vigilance task was lower. Colds reduced subjective task engagement (e. g., lower energy and motivation) and increased distress (e. g., more negative mood). Regression analysis indicated a direct effect of <b>colds</b> <b>on</b> simple reaction time, whereas the <b>cold</b> effect <b>on</b> vigilance appeared to be statistically mediated by reduced task engagement.
