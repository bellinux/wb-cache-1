40|$|Mediation is {{a special}} form of {{alternative}} dispute resolution which {{is becoming more and}} more popular. This thesis is concerned with the development of the legal framework and the practical use of mediation in Germany, Scotland and Switzerland. To harmonize the rules on mediation within the European Union, Directive 2008 / 52 /EC was created imposing mandatory standards on certain aspects of mediation. The Directive is binding only in respect of <b>cross-border</b> <b>dispute</b> mediations (i. e. where at least one of the parties to the dispute is domiciled or habitually resident in a Member State other than that of any other party), but its provisions may also be applied to internal dispute mediation processes. This led to the monistic approach on the one hand, where a legislation system simultaneously seeks to regulate both internal dispute and <b>cross-border</b> <b>dispute</b> mediations and thus treats them equally, and the dualistic approach, on the other hand, where <b>cross-border</b> <b>dispute</b> mediations are regulated separately, and thus internal dispute and <b>cross-border</b> <b>dispute</b> mediations may be treated differently. In particular, this thesis is concerned with the question whether the distinction between internal dispute and <b>cross-border</b> <b>dispute</b> mediations drawn by Directive 2008 / 52 /EC complicates the harmonization of the rules on mediation. The implementation of Directive 2008 / 52 /EC by the monistic approach in Germany, and by the dualistic approach in Scotland, and the autonomous handling of mediation legislation in Switzerland (which is not a Member State of the European Union and thus not bound by Directive 2008 / 52 /EC) show different patterns of development with regard to mediation in Europe. The comparison among those different developments (regarding domestic dispute mediation and cross-border-dispute mediation) finally answers the question whether Directive 2008 / 52 /EC in its current form was appropriate. </p...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{resistance}} to the All-American Canal Lining Project came {{from both sides of}} the border as a coalition of economic and environmental groups which used the United States legal system in an attempt to block the loss of water upon which a fragile ecosystem and Mexican far-mers depend.

This article examines and contrasts the legal framework within which the decision was made with popular understandings and explanations of the process as held by the Mexicali Valley’s water managers. With important implications for future compensation claims and <b>cross-border</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution, it concludes that the decision to litigate in US courts did not formally include a key group, the agricultural water users of the Mexicali Valley.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the theory and practice of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). It outlines the demand for methods other than litigation to resolve disputes, and focuses upon the growth of mediation, arbitration, and court-annexed procedures in Australia. Other methods of dispute resolution are also discussed. In the context of mediation, the structure of the mediation process is outlined, and the nature of consensual dispute resolution is explained. Four of the key features of mediation, namely accessibility, voluntariness, confidentiality and facilitation are analysed. Other issues such as power imbalance, enforceability of agreements to mediate and evaluation of mediation are also discussed. The process of arbitration is then introduced, and the requirements of the Commercial Arbitration Acts are outlined. The process of international arbitration, the most popular form of <b>cross-border</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution, is briefly discussed. Finally, court-annexed mediation and arbitration, mediator certification and practice standards, {{and the role of the}} legal profession in ADR practice are discussed. Underlying the discussion in this chapter are four broader goals: 1. to encourage readers to recognise some of the limitations of litigation and competitive negotiation; 2. to provide an evaluative introduction to mediation; 3. to help readers understand that the practice of law is broader than the practice of litigation; and 4. that the litigation rules themselves and professional responsibility statutes require that a case has a reasonable prospect of success and that reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the dispute without recourse to litigation...|$|E

Faced with inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the courts regulators are constantly looking into alternatives to increase access to justice and improve efficiency of the dispute resolution mechanisms. The EU has recently enacted ADR and ODR regulations for consumer <b>cross-border</b> <b>disputes.</b> At the same time, we have witnessed parallel attempts from several public bodies and international organisations to introduce the legal framework for the resolution disputes coming out of online transactions. These proposals are in principle focusing on e-commerce aspects of dealing with low-cost consumer/seller disputes. The development of cloud computing services, as a form of e-commerce last decade, raised new issues of applicable law, jurisdiction, access to justice, the legal nature of the disputes, consumer protection etc. To obtain cloud computing services users generally accept a predefined contract of adhesion, where the terms should be accepted on “as is” basis. Non-negotiable predefined terms often tend to be in favor of providers.
