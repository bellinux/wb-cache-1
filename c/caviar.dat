Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal {{in reference to the}} twelve apostles and Christ.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, <b>caviar,</b> pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{the annual}} Teamsters {{convention}} {{was held at}} Caesars with a $650,000 party. The lavish feast included <b>caviar,</b> crab claws, roast beef {{and a range of}} 15 different desserts. In 1991, Sheila King won a $250,000 jackpot in the casino at Caesars Palace on a $500 machine, and won $50,000 twice soon afterwards. Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping the money back into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she spent much of her time {{over the next four years}} in the law courts claiming that the casino operators had tampered with her machines and deceived her to keep her winning.|$|E

He {{substitutes}} petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is {{fit to be}} his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons his port. From {{the window of his}} flat, Louis then uses a bow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of <b>caviar</b> which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, he insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.|$|E
5|$|Though never {{believed}} to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government {{and most of the}} states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as <b>caviar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bond accosts Zukovsky at his <b>caviar</b> {{factory in}} the Caspian Sea, which is then {{attacked}} by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was {{in exchange for the}} use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his cane gun with his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.|$|E

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} by female animals of many {{different}} species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and fish, and have been eaten by humans for thousands of years. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs. Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail are also eaten. Fish eggs are called roe and <b>caviar.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the {{internal}} ovaries or egg masses {{of fish and}} certain marine animals are ripe for spawning they are called roe. Roe from certain species, such as shrimp, scallop, crab and sea urchins, are sought as human delicacies {{in many parts of}} the world. <b>Caviar</b> is a name for the processed, salted roe of non-fertilized sturgeon. The term soft roe or white roe denotes fish milt. Lobster roe is called coral because it turns bright red when cooked. Roe (reproductive organs) are usually eaten either raw or briefly cooked.|$|E
25|$|The {{five men}} aboard Question Mark {{underwent}} medical examinations before the flight, and their flight surgeon planned a special diet. However, an electric stove to heat food was eliminated to save weight, and hot meals were sent aloft by the refuelers, including a turkey dinner on New Years Day prepared by {{a church in}} Van Nuys. The crew warded off boredom by reading, playing cards, sleeping in bunks mounted over the fuel tanks, and writing letters. After the existing endurance record was surpassed on Thursday evening, January 3, the support crew sent up cheese, figs, olives and five jars of <b>caviar</b> for an in-flight celebration.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of farm produce is {{available}} in many of Kiev's farmer markets with the Besarabsky Market located in the very centre of the city being most famous.

25|$|Access to the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, {{and many}} river basins {{provides}} Iran {{the potential to}} develop excellent fisheries. The government assumed control of commercial fishing in 1952. One government-owned enterprise, the Northern Sheelat Company, was established in 1952, and a second, the Southern Sheelat Company, was established in 1961. In recent years, illegal and off-season fishing, discharge of industrial and agricultural pollutants, overfishing by other Caspian littoral states, and other unfavorable conditions have endangered Caspian fish resources. Between 1990 and 2004, Iran’s total annual Caspian Sea catch declined from 98,000 tons to 32,533 tons, including 463 tons of sturgeon, which yields high-quality <b>caviar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the senior}} German {{officers}} held at Zavarykino, Schmidt {{was the most}} disliked by the Soviets; on one occasion he apparently reduced a mess waitress to tears during lunch, for which a Soviet officer, Lieutenant Bogomolov, made him apologise. Unlike many German prisoners of war, such as Paulus himself and von Seydlitz-Kurzbach, Schmidt refused to co-operate with the Soviets, despite the NKVD's attempt to ingratiate themselves by serving him <b>caviar</b> and champagne in a luxury railway coach. Together with most German officers, Schmidt was moved to Camp 48 at Voikovo, although he was kept away from Paulus by the NKVD, apparently because he {{was considered to be}} a bad influence on him.|$|E
25|$|On May 2, 2006, a non-fiction {{television}} special named Dynasty Reunion: Catfights & <b>Caviar</b> {{aired on}} CBS. It assembled former cast {{members from the}} series, including John Forsythe, Joan Collins, and Linda Evans, {{as well as the}} four original actors who played the Carrington children (Pamela Sue Martin, Al Corley, Gordon Thomson, and Catherine Oxenberg). Heather Locklear, John James, and Diahann Carroll declined to participate, but cast members Pamela Bellwood and Emma Samms were included in prerecorded interviews. The special showed various clips from the series, as the cast reminisced about their time on the show. The special was filmed at the Filoli estate, the location originally used for exterior shots of the Carringtons' mansion in the series.|$|E
25|$|Lazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' {{raising of}} Lazarus from the dead, {{just before he}} went to Jerusalem himself. The main themes {{anticipate}} the Resurrection of Jesus, showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, <b>caviar),</b> lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday {{is considered one of the}} Great Feasts of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday services are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday service.|$|E
25|$|The {{stage setting}} for the show, , the {{high-quality}} (and sometimes very expensive) ingredients used in the cooking battles, and Kaga's extravagant costumes required the show to have a budget far {{higher than that of}} most other cooking shows. Some statistics: 893 portions of foie gras, 54 sea breams, 827 Ise shrimp, 964 matsutake mushrooms, 4,593 eggs, 1,489 truffles, 4,651grams of <b>caviar,</b> and 84 pieces of shark fin were used during the show, bringing the total grocery bill to ¥843,354,407 (or about $7,115,520). One of the most expensive battles was Battle Swallow's Nest, which ran over $40,000 solely for that ingredient, not counting large quantities of shark's fin; for the battle, the producers were permitted to return any unused portions to Hattori Nutrition College.|$|E
25|$|When Genghis Khan's {{grandson}} Kublai Khan (1215–1294) invaded Moscow, {{he and his}} warriors introduced minced horsemeat to the Muscovites. This {{was later}} called steak tartare. The city states {{of what is now}} Germany took to this ground meat product and created many of their own dishes by adding capers, onions and even <b>caviar</b> to the blend and selling it on the streets. It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared. While not providing a clear name, the first description of steak tartare was given by Jules Verne in 1875 in his novel Michael Strogoff. There are certain similarities between steak tartare and the German dishes Labskaus and Mett. Other similar raw, chopped meats appeared in the 20th century, such as the Italian carpaccio, which itself was invented in 1930 at Harry's Bar in Venice. Similarly, one of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in 1763 in the cookbook entitled Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770). Hamburgh Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices, including nutmeg, cloves, black pepper, garlic, and salt, and is typically served with toast. A wide variety of traditional European dishes are also made with minced meat, such as meatloaf, the Serbian pljeskavica, the Arab kofta, and meatballs.|$|E
25|$|The culinary {{traditions of}} Roman times lived {{on in the}} Byzantine empire. Inherited from Greek traditions {{was the use of}} olives and olive oil, wheat bread, and plenty of fish. These would very often be served or {{prepared}} with garós, the Greek term for garum, a sauce made out of fermented fish that was so popular that it more or less replaced salt as the common food flavoring. The Byzantine kitchen was also influenced by Arab cuisine from which it imported the use of eggplants and oranges. Seafood was very popular and included tuna, lobster, mussels, oysters, murena, and carp. Around the 11th century the habit of eating roe and <b>caviar</b> was also imported from the Black Sea region. Dairy products were consumed in the form of cheese (particularly feta), and nuts and fruits such as dates, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and apples. The choice of meats were lamb, and several wild animals like gazelles, wild asses, and suckling young in general. Meat was often salted, smoked or dried. Wine was popular, like elsewhere around the Mediterranean, and it was the drink of choice among the higher social classes, where sweet wines like Muscat or Madeira/Malmsey were popular. Among the lower classes, the common drink tended to be vinegar mixed with water. Like all Christian societies the Byzantines had to abide by the dietary restrictions of the church, which meant avoiding meats (and preferably general excesses) on Wednesdays and Fridays and during fast and Lent.|$|E
