50|$|Unfortunately, for all VLSI's initial {{competence}} in design tools, {{they were not}} leaders in semiconductor manufacturing technology.

50|$|Also in 2009, {{the company}} {{released}} the first so-called MegaLibrary(TM) for 65 nm SoC design. A MegaLibrary {{is a very}} large standard <b>cell</b> <b>library</b> in terms of logic functions and variants in terms of drive strength and relative transistor sizing (such as P/N ratio or tapered inputs). A pre-made MegaLibrary presents an alternative to creating new standard cells on-the-fly (e.g. using NanGate Library Creator) for optimization purposes. As a typical standard <b>cell</b> <b>library</b> contains only a small subset of the possible Boolean functions, 2 or more standard cells are needed to implement functions not found in the library. As an example, there are 3984 Boolean P-equivalent functions with 4 inputs and about 37 million with 5 inputs. The concept of automatic generation of footprint-compatible cells was also introduced. A set of standard cells are said to be footprint compatible when they are interchangeable from a place-and-route perspective without causing DRC errors. Footprint-compatibility is typically obtained from a maximum sized base cell from which versions are derived having identical layers from metal-1 and up but having differently sized diffusion areas to implement transistor sizing variants.|$|E

50|$|NanGate, Inc is {{a privately}} held US/Silicon Valley-based {{multinational}} corporation dealing in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for electrical engineering and electronics. NanGate {{was founded in}} October 2004 {{by a group of}} semiconductor professionals with a background from Intel Corporation and Vitesse Semiconductor Corp.

The company is today owned and controlled by its management following a management buy-out in 2012.

The market focus is standard <b>cell</b> <b>library</b> design and optimization for 14-28 nanometer CMOS processes.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of the standard <b>cell</b> <b>library</b> design methodology are many but compared to full-custom IC design {{there is a large}} gap between what can be achieved when comparing the two methodologies in terms of highest possible operating frequency, lowest possible die area and power consumption. This is first and foremost {{due to the fact that}} in full-custom IC design, the engineer can handcraft and optimize the design on the transistor level without having to use only fixed-sized standard cells. Full-custom IC design is much more resource and time-consuming and only a minority of ICs have a market potential that is able to pay for such an investment in research and development.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} and market {{idea behind the}} foundation of NanGate was to address and solve the inherent shortcomings of standard cell based ASSP/ASIC design as compared to full custom IC design. In standard cell design the designer uses cells from a standard <b>cell</b> <b>library</b> to implement the desired logic functionality of the IC while trying to obtain the target operating frequency at the lowest possible cost in terms of die area and power consumption. The standard cells form the basic building blocks used to build the IC together with macro blocks such as embedded memory, Input-Output (IO), mixed-signal and analog blocks. Each standard cell represents a relatively primitive logic function, such as a NAND gate, with fixed area, timing and power characteristics and is constructed from transistors most often arranged in the pull-up/pull-down fashion of CMOS. A typical standard-cell library for e.g. 40 nanometer CMOS has 500-1500 standard cells and about 150-300 different logic functions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a robust and {{scalable}} con-stant- rail-to-rail CMOS input stage for VLSI <b>cell</b> <b>libraries.</b> The proposed circuit does {{not rely on}} the characteristics and par-ticular operation (strong, moderate, and weak inversion) regions of the input transistorsand is insensitive tomismatches between p- and n-channel devices.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel flow to enable {{computationally}} efficient statistical characterization of delay and slew in standard <b>cell</b> <b>libraries.</b> The distinguishing {{feature of the}} proposed method is the usage of a limited combination of output capacitance, input slew rate and supply voltage for the extraction of statistical timing metrics of an individual logic gate. The efficiency of the proposed flow stems from {{the introduction of a}} novel, ultra-compact, nonlinear, analytical timing model, having only four universal regression parameters. This novel model facilitates the use of maximum-a-posteriori belief propagation to learn the prior parameter distribution for the parameters of the target technology from past characterizations of <b>library</b> <b>cells</b> belonging to various other technologies, including older ones. The framework then utilises Bayesian inference to extract the new timing model param-eters using an ultra-small set of additional timing measurements from the target technology. The proposed method is validated and benchmarked on several production-level <b>cell</b> <b>libraries</b> including a state-of-the-art 14 -nm technology node and a variation-aware, compact transistor model. For the same accuracy as the conven-tional lookup-table approach, this new method achieves at least 15 x reduction in simulation runs. I...|$|R
