2500|$|Following his {{appointment}} as managing director in 1972, Bishop withdrew the One-Elevens from service, {{two of which}} were swapped for three Handley Page Dart Heralds while the third was subsequently leased to Court Line. As the early-model, high-time second-hand 707s commanded a low resale value, the airline decided to keep these aircraft and lease them out to other airlines on a wet lease basis, beginning in November 1972 with a £3.3million, two-year contract to operate Sudan Airways' Blue Nile service between Khartoum and London. The decision {{to pull out of}} both the IT and [...] "affinity group" [...] markets was taken to reverse heavy losses BMA had incurred on these charter operations due to its lack of scale and lack of vertical integration with a tour operator, which put it at a commercial disadvantage vis-à-vis the competition, as well as uneconomical <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> as a result of overcapacity. This resulted in BMA concentrating on regional, short-haul scheduled services and ad hoc charters using turboprops such as the Herald and Viscount as these were more economical than contemporary jets on short, thin routes. The success of the airline's wet lease operation resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of Boeing 707s allocated to this activity, including the addition of several later model 707-320B and -320C aircraft from 1976. All of these were leased to other operators, with none operating for BMA on scheduled or charter services until 1981.|$|E

40|$|Chartering {{rather than}} owning a vessel is a {{recurrent}} question for liner operators. This article aims at identifying {{the extent of}} such chartering practices, the characteristics of vessels chartered and if an impact on liner profitability can be found. To do so, an initial dataset collected in 2009 on 510 liner operators and 5, 005 vessels is used. Results from random effect Probit models point out first that <b>chartering</b> <b>rates</b> are not different between small and large operators. Furthermore, findings suggest that chartering of small and young vessels is more common and that <b>chartering</b> <b>rates</b> have increased for companies subject to higher fleet growth from 2007 to 2009. An analysis using a fixed effect Logit model on intra-fleet management of 17 selected liner companies further stresses that larger companies have chartered more small vessels during the last 2 years, a result that may be explain {{by the need to}} allocate the financing to new larger vessels. We then study whether the <b>chartering</b> <b>rate</b> and the size of these 17 liner companies have had an influence on their observed profitability in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present, {{for the first}} time, the price {{formation}} of China’s dry bulk carrier using vessel prices quoted by major Chinese shipyards in actual shipbuilding orders. This allows us to investigate the relationship of price and determinants in the Chinese shipbuilding industry by including generic market factors as well as Chinese elements. The analysis, employing Principal Component Regression (PCR) approach, indicates that the time <b>charter</b> <b>rate</b> has the most significantly positive impact. While increases in other four factors, namely shipbuilding cost, price cost margin, shipbuilding capacity utilization and credit rate, have descending order of positive influences. Different from traditional perception, we assert {{that the most important}} role of time <b>charter</b> <b>rate</b> plays mainly attributes to the ‘China Factor’ in bulk carrier sector. In addition, simulations are performed to investigate {{what would happen to the}} Chinese dry bulk carrier prices under changes of time <b>charter</b> <b>rate</b> and shipbuilding cost.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops structural {{models for}} analyzing shipping investment decisions, namely ordering, scrapping and lay-up {{decisions in the}} tanker industry. We develop models, based on a microeconomic specification, {{that allow us to}} understand the dynamics of shipping investment decisions under uncertainty and test interrelated economic assertions with aggregate data. The main framework is a three-party model with a structural specification of the time <b>charter</b> <b>rate</b> process, based on market clearing conditions. Structural estimation of shipping investment decisions is performed by using advanced econometric methods consistent with the Real Options and Market Microstructure literature. Several statistical tests are employed, in order to evaluate alternative specifications. Once the aggregate models have been identified and estimated, some of the early hypotheses in maritime economics are addressed and re-evaluated. Finally we integrate the three different investment modules and reconstruct the structural transportation supply function that determines the equilibrium time <b>charter</b> <b>rate.</b> System identification techniques and advanced econometric methods are employed separately and then combined, resulting in an exceptional "within-sample", as well as "out-of-sample" performance of the integrated model. by George N.

500|$|From 2003, {{the demand}} for new ships started to grow, {{resulting}} in 2007 in a record breaking order backlog for shipyards, exceeding their capacity with rising newbuilding prices as a result.

Typically, the center tanks of the oil tanker would be split into dry cargo holds while the side tanks {{would be used for}} ballast or remain empty. Holes cut on the main deck for cargo hatches and coamings would require additional structural strengthening to retain sufficient longitudinal strength after conversion.

50|$|Lack of fleet {{standardisation}} and low, all-year round aircraft utilisation due to seasonal {{peaks and}} troughs in its charter and scheduled markets drove up Channel's unit costs while low <b>charter</b> <b>rates</b> and poor yields on short-haul scheduled routes served in competition with British Air Ferries from Southend depressed revenues.

A week later, Channel's main lender, Barclays Bank, appointed a receiver and put the airline up for sale while operations continued. Potential buyers' lack of interest in Channel Airways as a going concern forced the break-up of the company. As by winter 1971/2 work for the remaining jet fleet had all but dried up, jet services ceased on 15 February 1972. Operations ceased completely on 29 February, when de Havilland Heron 1B G-APKW, the first and only aircraft to which Air England titles were actually applied, had completed the last Channel Airways flight from Ostend to Southend. Permanent cessation of operations was followed by withdrawal of Channel Airways's air operator's certificate at the end of March 1972.|$|E

The weekly <b>charter</b> <b>rate</b> of luxury yachts around the world ranges from tens of thousands to over a million dollars/euros.

The luxury yacht charter industry functions effectively because private yacht owners mitigate their running costs with charter income as well as keeping their yachts and crew in top running order. Conversely, private charterers charter yachts (rather than owning them) because it is generally considered to be less expensive, and less hassle, than owning a yacht and it also provides them with extra choice related to yacht type, location and crew.|$|R
