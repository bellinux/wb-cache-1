Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to listen to {{what they had to say}} but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a <b>confidential</b> <b>nature.</b> Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E

It is an empirical study that involves in-depth analysis of the shared knowledge type and knowledge sharing activities. More importantly, we found that when external rules and regulations mandate how business is conducted in this industry, explicit measures need to be employed at the organizational level to ensure conformance. These measures include appropriate quality assurance infrastructure, appropriate technological solutions, and employee recruitment, training and rewards. At the individual level, employees take extra measures on their own accord to ensure quality due to possible serious repercussions for making mistakes if these rules/regulations are breached. This research begins a theoretical foundation for knowledge sharing in highly regulated industries...|$|R

The ASRS is run by NASA, a neutral party, since it has no power in enforcement. The success of the system serves as a positive example that is often used as a model by other industries seeking to make improvements in safety.|$|R
60|$|One of {{them was}} right under the shark, {{nibbling}} at his ventral fin; another above, hovering about his dorsal appurtenance; one on each flank; and a frisking fifth pranking about his nose, seemingly having something to say of a <b>confidential</b> <b>nature.</b> They were of a bright, steel-blue color, alternated with jet black stripes; with glistening bellies of a silver-white. Clinging {{to the back of}} the shark, were four or five Remoras, or sucking-fish; snaky parasites, impossible to remove from whatever they adhere to, without destroying their lives. The Remora has little power in swimming; hence its sole locomotion is on the backs of larger fish. Leech-like, it sticketh closer than a false brother in prosperity; closer than a beggar to the benevolent; closer than Webster to the Constitution. But it feeds upon what it clings to; its feelers having a direct communication with the esophagus.|$|E
60|$|At {{the time}} when the man-of-war's boat rowed {{alongside}} of the little jetty of Fairway, an interesting couple chanced to be seated in a bower at the back of a very small but particularly neat cottage near the shore. The bower was in keeping with its surroundings, being the half of an old boat set up on end. Roses and honeysuckle were trained up the sides of it, and these, mingling their fragrance with the smell of tar, diffused an agreeable odour around. The couple referred to sat very close to each other, and appeared to be engaged in conversation of a <b>confidential</b> <b>nature.</b> One was a fair and rather pretty girl of the fishing community. The other was a stout and uncommonly handsome man of five-and-twenty, apparently belonging to the same class, but there was more of the regular sailor than the fisherman in his costume and appearance. In regard to their conversation, it may be well, perhaps, to let them speak for themselves.|$|E

Her love, her passionate, engrossing attachment, she did not scruple to avow; but she could not become a bride while the stains of blood seemed so recent on the very hearth around which they were sitting. She still saw the forms of the dead, in their customary places, heard their laughs, the tones of their affectionate voices, the maternal whisper, the playful, paternal reproof, or Beulah's gentle call.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Providing {{management}} insights regarding moral case deliberation (MCD) {{from the}} experiential perspective of nursing managers. Background: MCD concerns systematic group-wise reflection on ethical issues. Attention to implementing MCD {{in health care}} is increasing, and managers' experiences regarding facilitating MCD's implementation {{have not yet been}} studied. Method: As part of an empirical qualitative study on implementing MCD in mental health care, a responsive evaluation design was used. Using former research findings (iterative procedures), a managers' focus group was organised. Results: Managers appreciated MCD, fostering nurses' empowerment and critical reflection - according to managers, professional core competences. Managers found MCD a challenging intervention, resulting in dilemmas due to MCD's <b>confidential</b> and egalitarian <b>nature.</b> Managers value MCD's process-related outcomes, yet these are difficult to control/regulate. Conclusions: MCD urges managers to reflect on their role and (hierarchical) position both within MCD and in the nursing team. Implications for nursing management: MCD is in line with transformative and participatory management, fostering dialogical interaction between management and nursing team. © 2015 John Wile...|$|R

60|$|This, {{and much}} more wisdom I imbibed while assenting to my chief's greatness. For Mr. Varney was right,--one could feel enthusiasm for Theodore Watling; and my growing {{intimacy}} with him, the sense that I was having a part in his career, a share in his success, became for the moment the passion of my life. As the campaign progressed I gave {{more and more time}} to it, and made frequent trips of a <b>confidential</b> <b>nature</b> to the different counties of the state. The whole of my being was energized. The national fever had thoroughly pervaded my blood--the national fever to win. Prosperity--writ large--demanded it, and Theodore Watling personified, incarnated the cause. I had neither the time nor the desire to philosophize on this national fever, which animated all my associates: animated, I might say, the nation, which was beginning to get into a fever about games. If I remember rightly, it was about this time that golf was introduced, tennis had become a commonplace, professional baseball was in full swing; Ham Durrett had even organized a local polo team.... The man who failed to win something tangible in sport or law or business or politics was counted out. Such was the spirit of America, in the closing years of the nineteenth century.|$|E

There is an agent of ours, a fellow I have been employing for purchasing supplies, a perfectly honest man. He is coming here from the north by the ten o’clock train with some papers for me of a <b>confidential</b> <b>nature.</b> I was rather embarrassed about it.

[...] "Her kindness," [...] Alcide said, [...] "had made a green place in the desert of his existence,--her suavity would ever contrast in memory with the grossierete of the rustic population, who were not worthy to possess such a jewel." [...] An intimacy of the most <b>confidential</b> <b>nature</b> thus sprang up between the milliner and the chief of the kitchen; but I do not know whether it was with pleasure or mortification that Madame received the declarations of friendship which the young Alcides proffered to her, for he persisted in calling her [...] "La respectable Fribsbi," [...] "La vertueuse Fribsbi,"--and in stating that he should consider her as his mother, while he hoped she would regard him as her son. Ah! it was not very long ago, Fribsby thought, that words had been addressed to her in that dear French language, indicating a different sort of attachment. And she sighed as {{she looked up at the}} picture of her Carabineer. For it is surprising how young some people's hearts remain when their heads have need of a front or a little hair-dye,--and, at this moment, Madame Fribsby, as she told young Alcide, felt as romantic as a girl of eighteen.|$|E
40|$|Objective Clinical {{psychology}} students and clinicians in regional and remote areas face challenges accessing required supervision and peer consultation. Distance supervision using existing online conferencing tools (e. g., SKYPE) is one option, but limitations of existing platforms require an external method of initiating a supervisory relationship and securely sharing confidential documents and videos. This paper addresses {{the development of}} an e-supervision application to overcome these limitations, and examines issues inherent to such a development. Method A newly developed e-supervision application provides online access to a database of clinical supervisors and peers for students to search, contact and meet, with additional document sharing and video annotation tools to support standard supervision activities. The authors provide a selected review of clinical, technical, legal and ethical considerations that have arising during the design, development and testing of this application. Results Technological barriers exist, both in internet capacity in rural areas, and with institutions allowing access to common meeting platforms. Online interactions necessitate a different communication style, which may deter new users. The highly <b>confidential</b> and sensitive <b>nature</b> of supervision resources (client videos and notes) requires the implementation of best practice security measures, and consideration of Australian Privacy law and informed consent procedures for clients. Conclusions Issues around online security, confidentiality and verification of users need to be considered and addressed in the development of online supervision services. User perceptions of security and utility will ultimately determine uptake of online supervision services, and further investigation of user perceptions is required...|$|R
40|$|Present study {{deals with}} {{training}} and development strategies in IT service industry in Kolkata region. This study highlighted present trends and common practices {{in training and}} development activities in specific and in human resources management in general. InfoTech sector is a thrust area of economic development in developing economies, like in India. Government and private joint initiatives make this sector a sunshine industry sector. Potentials of human resources explore in the professionally managed IT service companies. The training and development activities strengthen capabilities of IT service companies and help them to achieve excellence. Present study evaluated {{the heart of this}} knowledge industry, which centered on knowledge workers. Present study briefly elaborated the training and development practices of two top-ranked companies in Kolkata and found some unique modes of delivery of training. This study also pointed out that companies placed in higher value-chain have long-term vision as compared to ones in lower in value-chain. This report is a modest attempt to study a sunshine industry in India and particularly in Kolkata region, within a limited timeframe and resources. The findings and observations are based on my understanding on the industry profile in respect to the training and development practices. The companies operating from Kolkata are placed in different levels in value-chain, where the top revenue earning companies are placed in highest value-chain and others are moving up the value-chain. Similarly, different companies are targeted to different market segments, like, domestic market and international market segments. Thus, their training and development practices and policies are significantly different. The companies surveyed here sometimes could not share information, which are <b>confidential</b> in <b>nature.</b> Also there is limited statistics with the respondents, as most training programmes are organised for the requirements of particular projects. The information technology (IT) service industry sometimes refers as IT industry or software industry or InfoTech sector. The term is used here interchangeably. The study report is presented here in chapters. The chapter one introduces basic concepts and industry profile in India and in Kolkata region. Chapter two states the objectives and methodology of this study. Chapter three represents analytical general discussions on results and findings, and depth study of two cases. These two cases represent some unique features of their training and development practices. These companies are placed in higher value-chain and thus their training objectives are much focused for the growth of the companies. Chapter four concludes the study and suggests a future direction for further growth of the industry in Kolkata. At the end a list of references and two annexures are appended...|$|R
