Therefore, unit labor costs have been calculated for the Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. All of the analyzed countries are transition countries, on the similar level of GDP per capita, and are or will be in the near future EU members. Therefore, it is more than obvious that all of the analyzed countries will be direct competitors in the common European markets.

When unit labor costs of Turkey and its trading partners are compared, it is seen that especially over the 1999 - 2003 period, Turkey's unit labor costs remained far below those of its trading partners and hence the unit labor <b>cost</b> based <b>competitiveness</b> index turned in favor of Turkey. Hence, during this period the overvaluation of the TL was more than compensated by the reduction inunit labor costs.

40|$|The EU has a {{consolidated}} {{climate and}} energy regulation: it played a pioneering role by adopting {{a wide range}} of climate change policies and establishing the first regional Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). These policies, however, raise several concerns regarding both their environmental effectiveness and their potentially negative effect on the economy, especially in terms of growth and competitiveness. The paper reviews the European experience in order to understand if these concerns are supported by quantitative evidence. It thus focuses on key economic indicators, such as <b>costs,</b> <b>competitiveness</b> and carbon leakage as assessed by quantitative ex-ante and ex-post analyses. A dedicated section, extends the investigation to the potential extra-EU spillover of the EU mitigation policy with a particular attention to developing countries. The objective of the paper is to highlight both the limits and the opportunities of the EU regulatory framework in order to offer policy insights to emerging and developing countries that are on the way to implement climate change measures. Overall, the European experience shows that the worries about the <b>costs</b> and <b>competitiveness</b> losses induced by climate regulation are usually overestimated, especially in the long term. In addition, a tightening climate policy regime in the EU might in fact negatively impact developing countries via deteriorated trade relations. Nonetheless it tends to facilitate a resource relocation that if well governed could be beneficial to those countries where the poor are mainly involved in rural activities...|$|R
40|$|We draw on {{the policy}} {{diffusion}} literature to shed more light on the determinants of treaty ratification, a crucial step {{in the formation of}} international regimes. Our hypotheses stipulate that a country's ratification behaviour is influenced by the ratification choices of other countries in general, or of specific types of other countries. The underlying argument is that the ratification behaviour of (specific) other countries sends particular signals - for instance signals about implementation <b>costs,</b> <b>competitiveness</b> effects or reputation costs - to the country in question. The empirical testing is done on data for ratification of the UN Economic Commission for Europe's agreements on long-range transboundary air pollution. The results show that international factors are as important in influencing ratification choices as domestic factors. This result raises interesting questions about the relative importance of international and domestic determinants in different policy areas and at different stages of international regime formation. air pollution; environment; international regimes; policy diffusion; ratification...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} two {{apparent}} puzzles for the Italian economy: i) How can an extremely {{poor performance in}} productivity growth be compatible with strong employment growth?; and ii) How can {{a sharp decline in}} competitiveness come along with higher export prices and a general situation for exporters that looks far from desperate? Some possible explanations to these puzzles are presented in this paper. Special factors such as regularisation of immigrant workers and the entry of low-skilled workers into the labour market may have contributed to depressing measured productivity and overstating the loss in competitiveness. Against the backdrop of Italy?s structural problems, this paper asks whether the Italian economy can adjust and grow. Medium-term prospects for the Italian economy remain challenging: for instance, growth in total factor productivity is still disappointingly low and competitiveness keeps deteriorating. However, there have been encouraging signs of improvement, notably the labour market has performed well {{over the past few years}} and in response to pressures from fierce foreign competition some adjustment appears to have taken place in the exposed sectors.
