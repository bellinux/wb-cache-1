Cars carrying dozens of officers from both the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s Department rushed to the area. Although no sign of the threat that brought all this about materialized, for many days after the canyon resembled an armed camp.|$|E
500|$|Prado Navarette v. California, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the United States Supreme Court {{clarified}} when police officers may make arrests or conduct temporary detentions based on information provided by anonymous tips. In 2008, police in California received a 911 <b>call</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> pickup truck was driving recklessly along a rural highway. Officers spotted a truck matching the description provided in the 911 call and followed the truck for five minutes, but did not observe any suspicious behavior. Nevertheless, officers conducted a traffic stop and discovered [...] of marijuana in the truck. At trial, the occupants of the car argued that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, because the tip was unreliable, and officers did not personally observe criminal activity. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call was reliable, and that officers need not personally observe criminal activity when acting upon information provided by an anonymous 911 call.|$|E

500|$|When Bart and Milhouse {{visit the}} local video arcade at the {{beginning}} of the episode, Martin Prince is seen playing an arcade game based on the 1981 film My Dinner with Andre. Other games at the arcade include a game based on the 1984 film The Terminator. The [...] "Springfield, Springfield" [...] number performed by Bart and Milhouse on their night out in town is a reference to the musical number [...] "New York, New York" [...] from the film On the Town, starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. During a scene in which Hans Moleman and Moe fight with knives, Hans tells Moe, [...] "You <b>call</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> knife?

While on the raft, Homer misquotes lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner when he says [...] "Water, water everywhere/So let's all have a drink. The scene in which Borgnine and the other rafters drift through a dark forest watched by mountain men is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film Deliverance, and the scene features the music from the film's [...] "Dueling Banjos" [...] scene. The unseen person or creature that attacks Borgnine at the end of the episode is implied to be Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th film series.|$|E

2500|$|The New York Times {{reporter}} Judith Miller {{also claims}} to have learned Plame's CIA affiliation from Scooter Libby. Though she never published {{an article on the}} topic, Miller spent twelve weeks in jail when she was found in contempt of court for refusing to divulge the identity of her source to Fitzgerald's grand jury after he subpoenaed her testimony. Miller told the court, before being ordered to jail, [...] "If journalists cannot be trusted to keep confidences, then journalists cannot function and there cannot be a free press." [...] Miller was released from jail on September 29, 2005, after Libby assured her in a telephone <b>call</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> waiver he gave prosecutors authorizing them to question reporters about their conversations with him was not coerced. Libby also wrote Miller a letter while she was in jail urging her to cooperate with the special prosecutor. The letter has come under scrutiny, and Fitzgerald asked Miller about it during her grand jury testimony. Fitzgerald attempted to enter the letter into evidence at Libby's trial, arguing it showed Libby tried to influence her prospective testimony to the grand jury. Judge Walton ruled it inadmissible.|$|E
