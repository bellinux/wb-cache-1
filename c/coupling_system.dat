25|$|The Finnpusku {{system uses}} a unique rigid <b>coupling</b> <b>system,</b> Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, which {{consists}} of two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|E
25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid <b>coupling</b> <b>system,</b> Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, which {{consists}} of two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia.

Three types of vibration mode of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> appear and the mode depends on the frequency and intensity of travelling magnetic field and the shape of the magnet. Basically the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> follows the travelling magnetic field in the range of low frequency, while the system cannot follow the travelling field when the frequency of the travelling magnetic field is high.

30|$|As {{far as we}} know, {{there are}} a lot of papers dealing with the ISS of {{individual}} control systems but few papers dealing with the ISS of CCSs. In general, the study of ISS for CCSs is complex, because it is very difficult to straightly construct an appropriate Lyapunov function for CCSs. However, in [5], Li and Shuai studied the global-stability problem of equilibrium and developed a systematic approach that allows one to construct global Lyapunov functions for large-scale <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> from building blocks of individual vertex systems. Later, this technique was appropriately developed and extended to some other <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b> In [6 – 8] several delayed <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> were discussed, and some sufficient conditions were obtained. Li et al. in [9 – 12] investigated the stochastic stability of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> with both white noise and color noise. Moreover, by using this technique, Su et al. derived sufficient conditions ensuring global stability of discrete-time <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [13, 14], and Zhang et al. extended this technique to multi-dispersal <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [15]. Besides, this technique is also applied to many practical applications, such as biological systems [16 – 18], neural networks [19, 20], and mechanical systems [20 – 23]. Hence, the graph theory is a great method in the study of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
