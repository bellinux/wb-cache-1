40|$|This {{research}} is part of our on-going investigations of public transport futures for Melbourne. Since 2005, we have worked with many colleagues and with our students at the University of Melbourne and at RMIT to incorporate understanding of the technical and operational requirements for effective public transport networks into contemporary architectural and urban design processes. Much of this work has been supported by a large cohort of industry partners in state and local government, and in the private sector. Its directions have been set though research made possible through Australian Research Council grants. In 2012, we turned our attention to the experience of passengers in and around stations. We wanted to know how station design could best contribute to greater public transport use by encouraging pedestrians and cyclists, improving bus-train interchanges, and creating space for socially useful urban development. Through the Transit for All project, funded by the University of Melbourne&# 039;s Carlton <b>Connect</b> <b>Initiative</b> and our industry partners, student designs for new stations across the Melbourne suburban rail network were used to stimulate critical debate among the public and private sector networks of professionals responsible for much of Melbourne&# 039;s recent work on new stations and level-crossing removals. We began that project with an agnostic position on the relative merits of rail-under or rail-over options for level-crossing removals. However, after reviewing the work produced over three iterations of our design-research process, it became clear that elevated rail had some distinct advantages over the typical &# 039;trenched-rail&# 039; designs being constructed around Melbourne. We are grateful to the Level Crossing Removal Authority for their support, which allowed us to continue this independent research in 2015...|$|E

30|$|A growing {{appreciation}} {{for the importance of}} climate variations to societies, the need to better manage the associated impacts and potential opportunities, and the relevance of this for development objectives led to the growing interest and action around climate services. The Climate Services Partnership (CSP) draws on this growing interest and engagement across a global community. The CSP – an outcome of the first International Conference on Climate Services (Columbia University, New York, October 2011) – is an informal, non-governmental platform for promoting and advancing climate services throughout the world. Made up of researchers, providers, users and funders of climate services, the CSP aims to support climate services capabilities through strengthening knowledge capture and exchange, fostering collaboration and supporting institutional linkages across relevant agencies and programs. This initiative provides a platform for <b>connecting</b> <b>initiatives</b> and actors within the larger climate services agenda that is taking shape today, into a growing community of practice.|$|R

We will draw on participant accounts arising from the course of the action research project and a number of purposeful focus groups and interviews relevant to the experience of (i) developing and managing a mental health film festival and (ii) participating in a mini-project to produce video/re-usable learning objects, in effect service users making their own films to support practitioner education.
