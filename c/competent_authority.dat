25|$|Whilst {{the full}} lifting of border {{restrictions}} in 1985 was significant and Spain transformed itself from a fascist state to a democracy, {{the legacy of}} Gibraltar's isolation by Franco continued to cast a shadow.

25|$|Similarly, in 1996, member {{countries}} of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed {{to a number of}} exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the <b>competent</b> <b>authority.</b> Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances. Nonetheless, many {{children under the age of}} 13 do work, even in the most developed {{countries of the}} EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job, the most common being babysitting.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1713, Nehemiah Chiya Chayun {{arrived at}} Amsterdam and {{requested}} {{permission of the}} Portuguese congregation to circulate his writings, which had been published at Berlin. Ashkenazi thought Chayun was an old enemy of his from Sarajevo and Salonica, and at once requested Solomon Ayllon, Chacham of the Portuguese congregation, not to accord patronage to the stranger, who was unfavorably known to him. Ashkenazi believed himself justified in making this demand, as the Portuguese congregation and its rabbi had, from the beginning, treated him most courteously, and had already, during his term at Altona, repeatedly sent {{to him from the}} Sephardim of Hamburg, Amsterdam, and London religio-legal questions for his decision. Chayun thereupon called on Ashkenazi personally and made an explanation; whereupon the rabbi retracted his accusation, stating that {{it was a case of}} mistaken identity. Meanwhile, several members of the Portuguese congregation had submitted Chayun's writings to the judgment of Moses Hagiz, a messenger from Jerusalem then sojourning at Amsterdam, who immediately discovered their Sabbatian principles and tendencies and gave the alarm. He also called the attention of Ashkenazi to the dangerous doctrines published in Chayun's book, whereupon the rabbi again warned the directorate of the Sephardim congregation not to support the author. Ashkenazi rejected a proposition to designate the objectionable passages, and declined to act as member of a committee of investigation, because he did not regard Ayllon, the rabbi of the Sephardim, as a <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> on such questions. Thereupon a fierce contention ensued, during the progress of which Hagiz fought valiantly beside Ashkenazi.|$|E
500|$|In a {{previous}} investigation that Charles Dana headed in 1872, Robeson had been suspected of awarding a $93,000 bonus to a building contractor in a [...] "somewhat dangerous stretch of official authority" [...] {{known as the}} Secor claims.
