40|$|In {{co-operation}} {{with the}} Dutch Inspectorate for Health Care, RIVM {{has developed a}} method for {{the enforcement of the}} Dutch Decree on medical devices under "Class I devices". This method was used for assessing the contents of technical files according to the requirements in the Decree. Manufacturers are legally bound to compile technical files as part of the <b>conformity</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> The study included the development of a file evaluation form and a pilot study for examining 40 technical files. This method met the expectations, with minor adaptations being proposed. Of the 40 manufacturers, five withdrew their registrations leaving 35 files. Of these, 33 were received within 16 weeks and one later. None of these 34 files succeeded in meeting all the requirements. The number of shortcomings varied between 2 and 14. For 20 files, additional information for evaluating these files was requested. For 15 files, this information was received in time, allowing 29 files to be fully evaluated. The number of essential requirements that had been insufficiently addressed varied between 1 and 8 per file. All files had flaws in labelling and instructions for use. The results imply that most manufacturers participating in this study were familiar with the Decree. The quality of the technical files should be improved. This will stimulate a systematic evaluation of the safety and suitability aspects of devices to be put on the market...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of market surveillance has been recognised by many agencies and individuals in many contexts. Without market surveillance, the conformity {{of the products}} on the market, {{as well as the}} common playing field for entrepreneurs, can not be guaranteed. Safety is {{the most important aspect of}} conformity. For the realistic realisation of market surveillance, exceptional resources are called for; it can not be done superficially and needs total commitment. About 8. 5  M€ has been allocated to market surveillance in Finland annually. Irrespective of these facts, very little research has been carried out on the market surveillance of any product field. The safety and environmental compatibility enforcement of electrical equipment in Finland changed in 1994 when Finland joined the European Economic Area (EEA). Today, supervision is based on international obligations and TUKES is responsible for maintaining it in Finland. Finland has invested considerably in the surveillance of electrical products, and TUKES has a recognised reputation for its work in Finland and abroad. The aim of this research was to clarify 1) if today's governing systems (legislation, standards, etc.) ensure that electrical equipment is safe and compatible; and 2) if TUKES's market surveillance is appropriate for today's needs and if it fulfils the principles of modern authority supervision. Following these clarifications, this research specified the means and methods as to how the governing systems and TUKES's operations should be improved so as to better fulfil the needs of citizens and entrepreneurs now and in the future. The empirical study consisted of four parts. One of them assessed TUKES's market surveillance of electrical products by utilising the European Foundation for Quality Management criterions. Another part examined through interview surveys, the way importers of electrical equipment operate and the expectations and opinions of subjects of supervision with regard to how TUKES carries out surveillance. The interviewed individuals were selected from TUKES's product consistency enforcement database (the TUVA database), which contains information on all market surveillance cases with regard to electrical equipment in Finland since 1994; to date over 10, 000 cases have been recorded. The actual research material consisted of profound face-to-face interviews with ten importers and a telephone survey of 101 entrepreneurs. The third part of the empirical study was composed of TUKES's market surveillance projects that inspected the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of products. The projects were carried out 1997 - 2002 and they were directed to equipment groups whose EMC features had been known to be problematic: uninterruptible power supplies, personal computers, frequency converters and energy-saving lamps. In each project, typical products of this group were tested, results were analysed and the reasonableness of products' EMC requirements were evaluated from technical, as well as administrative points of view. In the fourth part of the empirical study, the TUVA database was statistically analysed. Also, the Finnish Communication Regulatory Authority's and Digita Ltd's interference statistics were researched for provision of comparative information for analysing TUKES's EMC surveillance. The main focus of market surveillance is to inspect the operation of the "system" and to see that all parties concerned observe their responsibilities. This research indicated that both the governing systems and TUKES's market surveillance met expectations, even though there was room for improvement. The biggest problems in governing systems were found to be in technical standards. Another big problem is the fact that levels of market surveillance in the EEA are very different. Market surveillance is a good system for supervising series products intended for the normal consumer. On the other hand, the supervision of non-serial products as well as business-to-business products is much more complicated. Unfortunately, market surveillance does not make it possible to have an influence on the compatibility of products, whose electromagnetic features mostly depend on the method of installation and how and where they are used. If the manufacturer has specified these aspects so as to fulfil his/her own vested interest, the Authority has no tools. This is because legislation concerning EMC does not require that a product be manufactured so as to cater for any possible impending misuse. From the safety legislation point of view, this requirement is strictly observed. The most effective way to prevent the appearance of more dangerous or non-compatible electrical equipment is to change legislation and general attitudes so that it should always be more profitable and rewarding to follow the safety and conformity rules, which is far better than trying to do the <b>conformity</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> at as low a price as possible. Finland is a small market area and for this reason, global manufacturers are not interested in making products solely for the Finnish market. It is reasonable to believe that improvements in only TUKES's own market surveillance would hardly reduce the number of non-conforming products on the Finnish market. If market surveillance were effectively operational throughout the EEA, manufacturers would be driven to invest more in the quality and conformity of their products. TUKES must actively strive towards better and more effective EEA-levels of market surveillance, at the same time, nevertheless not neglecting its prime responsibilities in monitoring the Finnish market. Today, goods flow around the world at unbelievable speed. In the long term, global safety and EMC requirements as well as their enforcement throughout should be the target to aim for. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The WTO {{stipulates}} in the TBT Agreement {{that countries}} shall not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. Since differences in technical regulations, standards, {{as well as}} <b>conformity</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> create possibilities of preventing the free movement of goods, members have agreed to use international standards {{as a basis for}} these measures. Conclusions of FTAs are increasing as a strategy to facilitate international trade. Accordingly, measures to alleviate technical barriers to trade by means of FTAs are being increasingly implemented. There is a necessity to evaluate standardization policies that include aspects of technical regulations, standards and <b>conformity</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> considering that agreements finalized in the FTAs are based on the domestic policies of contracting parties. For instance, EU’s standardization policy is significant in regards to the effectuation of the Korea-EU FTA. The standardization policy of the EU evolved from the old approach through the new approach that harmonized standards within the region to the global approach that promotes the international standardization of European standards. EU’s policy which concentrates on harmonization based on international standards following the global approach was reflected in the articles of Korea-EU FTA. In the area of electronics and motor vehicles, Korea was required to harmonize its standards to the relevant international standards and in regards to <b>conformity</b> <b>assessment,</b> it was ultimately agreed that Korea implement the EU-type SDoC. Implications for countries that are expected to finalize an FTA with the EU are centered in the international standardization of national or regional standards to tackle EU standardization policy...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{its work}} on regionalism, the OECD Trade and Agriculture Directorate has {{completed}} {{a series of studies}} that compare rule-making provisions in regional trade agreements with those in the World Trade Organisation (e. g., in the area of services, investment and competition). This paper aims to complement existing studies, by examining legal provisions regarding "technical barriers to trade" (i. e., technical regulations, standards and <b>conformity</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures)</b> in selected bilateral and regional trade agreements, and their degree of similarity and convergence with the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, and with each other. The study reveals that most provisions regarding technical barriers to trade (TBT) included in bilateral and regional trade agreements converge towards the multilateral trading system. When implemented effectively, agreements seeking deeper economic integration and regulatory cooperation, in particular, can complement and strengthen the implementation the WTO Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade by setting the pace for improved regulatory practices and TBT-related infrastructure in member countries (e. g., through regional consultation fora and joint standardisation and accreditation bodies). Some caveats however remain. When overlapping agreements promote different criteria for the harmonisation of standard-related measures and when bilateral or regional initiatives are conducted in isolation from international efforts and divert attention from multilateral trade and standards-related negotiations, new obstacles may arise both for regulators and businesses. Such constraints are further magnified for low income countries afflicted by administrative and technical capacity-related problems. To remedy these potential problems, the study proposes a number of policy recommendations. standards, technical barriers to trade, technical regulations, bilateral free trade agreements, multilateral trading system, mutual recognition agreement, certification, regulatory measures, testing, metrology, WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, equivalence, non-tariff barriers, regionalism, regional trade agreements, TBT, <b>conformity</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures,</b> harmonisation, custom unions...|$|R
