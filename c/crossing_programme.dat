50|$|The aim was {{to create}} an autosexing utility breed {{with a focus on}} egg laying, where male and female day old chicks could easily be sexed by their colour. To achieve this Punnet and Pease used a <b>crossing</b> <b>programme</b> with {{excellent}} egg layers, the Leghorn and the Barred Plymouth Rock. The Barred Plymouth Rock was used to introduce the sex-linked barring gene ('barring' (B)) into the Leghorn. By crossing Brown Leghorn and Barred Plymouth Rock the Gold Legbar was created and standardised in 1945. The Silver Legbar followed in 1951. It had been created by crossing the Gold Legbar with White Leghorn and Silver Cambar.The Cream Legbar were standardised in 1958 but nearly died out in the 1970s as blue eggs were not in demand. They were created by crossing Gold Legbar with White Leghorn and creme-coloured Araucana chicken. The Araucanas introduced the dilute creme gene ('inhibitor of gold' (ig)), as well as the crest and the blue eggs into this variety.|$|E
50|$|The variety called ‘Madeleine Angevine’ in the UK is more {{properly}} called Madeleine x Angevine 7672. In 1957 Ray Brock at Oxted was sent cuttings of several varieties by Dr Zimmerman from Alzey {{and one of}} them was labelled ‘Sämling seedling 7672’. Just when this crossing was made is not known, although the timing would suggest that it was while Georg Scheu - responsible for varieties such as Huxelrebe, Faberrebe, Kanzler, Regner, Scheurebe, Septimer, Siegerrebe and Würzer - was the Alzey Institute’s Director. By 1960 Brock was able to report that it was: giving large crops which ripen with Riesling Sylvaner MT. Considered to be a promising variety. Not having been given the crossing details of Sämling 7672, Brock wrote to Zimmerman and asked for them. He was informed that it was a ‘freely pollinated seedling of Madeleine Angevine’. When Brock started to sell cuttings of the variety (as he did with all promising varieties) he gave it the name Madeleine x Angevine 7672 and it was under this name that it was known for many years. As it became quite popular, the name on wine labels became shortened to simply ‘Madeleine Angevine’. This was an unfortunate name as another variety already existed under this name.The true Madeleine Angevine (also sometimes called Madeleine d’Angevine), is a female only table-grape variety, a crossing of Précoce de Malingre and Madeleine Royale made by Pierre Vibert at the Moreau-Robert nurseries in Angers in 1857 (some reports say 1859). It is one of the earliest table-grape varieties for open cultivation in France. Having only female flowers and being very early, it has been used by plant breeders in a number of crosses over the years. Morio and Husfeld used it for Forta and Noblessa and it is one grandparent of Reichensteiner. Scheu himself used it to produce Siegerrebe and interestingly, this variety, which at one time was credited with being a Madeleine Angevine x Gewürztraminer crossing, was unmasked by Heinz Scheu - Georg’s son - as also being a freely pollinated Madeleine Angevine seedling. It is conceivable that the variety we now grow in the UK as Madeleine x Angevine 7672 comes from the same <b>crossing</b> <b>programme</b> that produced Siegerrebe. In 1992, I asked Professor Dr Alleweldt, then head of the Geilweilerhof State Institute for Grapevine Breeding, to see if he could discover more about our Mad Angie (as it is often known). He located Georg Scheu’s old breeding books in the Alzey archives and found that ‘Sämling 7672’ was - as Brock was originally told - an ‘open pollinated progeny of Madeleine Angevine’.|$|E

Sponsorship: BBSRC; DEFRAThe genus Trifolium (Leguminosae) or clovers includes {{a number of}} agriculturally important forage species. In particular Trifolium repens (white clover) and Trifolium pratense (red clover) are widely used in temperate livestock agriculture. Interspecific <b>crossing</b> <b>programmes</b> within this genus {{have been carried out}} for more than 50 years, in many cases involving embryo rescue or ovule culture techniques. In general, the aims of these have been twofold: to aid understanding of evolutionary relationships within the genus and to introgress useful traits, predominantly into white or red clover. In the case of white clover, the greatest efforts have been made with respect to crossing with Trifolium nigrescens and Trifolium ambiguum. Novel germplasm has been developed and useful traits transferred, although no material has yet been commercialized. The main emphasis with respect to red clover has been increasing longevity through crosses with more persistent species, particularly Trifolium medium.

The proportion of the subsequent basal stem lesions was measured 3 days after inoculation. Highly significant differences were observed among sunflower genotypes and S. sclerotiorum isolates, with the isolates interacting differentially with sunflower genotypes. Two genotypes had high partial resistance to all S. sclerotiorum isolates, whereas others were susceptible to all isolates. Isolates of S. sclerotiorum differed in virulence to host genotypes.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was {{to examine}} Non Governmental Organizations' (NGOs) {{programmes}} for integration of refugees as a necessary supplement to the governmental programme. A relatively recent law made it compulsory for newly arrived refugees to attend classes in Norwegian language and Norwegian culture and society. This governmental programme also offers other courses and work experience over a 37. 5 hour paid week. In addition, several NGOs {{offer a variety of}} programmes. In Bergen, Norway, 35 refugees each year join a Red <b>Cross</b> <b>programme</b> called The Refugee Guide", as a part of this 37. 5 hour work-week. This programme offers refugees a new friend and a guide to the Norwegian society. The refugee guides are volunteers who are interested to get to know their new fellow citizens. This thesis focused on this Red <b>Cross</b> <b>programme</b> and the programme Ada" of another well known Norwegian NGO. Ada encompasses kindergartens where parents join their children, an international programme called Home-start which gives families who struggle a qualified volunteer to lean on, and a group for immigrant women. These two, and other NGOs, attempt to offer solutions to the problem of lack of contact between the majority and minority groups. Several qualitative methods were used to assess the programmes of these NGOs. Semi- structured interviews were used to interview employees of the NGOs and of the governmental programme. Focus groups were used to gather information from refugees using The Refugee Guide". In addition, two published studies with quantitative data were used as a supplement to the qualitative data. The results of this study showed that users of The Refugee Guide and Ada were satisfied with the programmes. Public servants also approved of these programmes and were pleased that these NGOs were covering areas they could not. They teached the language, helped with housing and prepare the refugees for working life. However, there was a great need of social contact, a larger network and friends and the NGOs were doing a good job bringing Norwegians, refugees and other immigrants together. This contact was important for the integration of refugees for three reasons: many refugees were lonely, and in need of new friends, thus having Norwegian friends could raise the refugees' self-esteem; refugees needed Norwegian friends to learn more about Norwegian customs and norms; and refugees needed Norwegian friends to practice the language. These areas were lacking in the public programme, and could not be provided by the public servants. In conclusion, The Refugee Guide" and Ada" provide a necessary supplement to the governmental programme. Indeed, the quality of some people's lives had improved by participating in these programmes. Public servants should receive more information about what these NGOs can offer to improve integration to help them provide a better service to the refugees they work for...|$|R
