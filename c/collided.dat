40|$|In this paper, we {{discovered}} {{a new class of}} <b>colliding</b> key pairs of RC 4, namely, two different secret keys generate the same internal state after RC 4 ’s key scheduling algorithm. This is to our knowledge the first discovery of RC 4 <b>colliding</b> keys with hamming distance greater than one, that is, the <b>colliding</b> key pairs we found can differ from each other at three different positions, and the value difference between these positions needs not be fixed. We analyzed the transition pattern and evaluated the probability of the existence of this new class of <b>colliding</b> key pairs. Our result shows that RC 4 key collision could be achieved by two keys with greater hamming distance than the ones found in [1] and [2]. And this newly discovered class of <b>colliding</b> key pairs reveals the weakness that RC 4 ’s key scheduling algorithm could generate even more <b>colliding</b> keys. We also proposed an algorithm for searching <b>colliding</b> key pairs within this new class. Some concrete <b>colliding</b> key pairs are demonstrated in this paper, among which 55 -byte <b>colliding</b> key pair is the shortest one we found by using our algorithm within one hour time.

40|$|Using self-gravitational hydrodynamical {{numerical}} simulations, {{we investigated}} {{the evolution of}} high-density turbulent molecular clouds swept by a <b>colliding</b> flow. The interaction of shock waves due to turbulence produces networks of thin filamentary clouds with a sub-parsec width. The <b>colliding</b> flow accumulates the filamentary clouds into a sheet cloud and promotes active star formation for initially high-density clouds. Clouds with a <b>colliding</b> flow exhibit a finer filamentary network than clouds without a <b>colliding</b> flow. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the density and column density can be fitted by lognormal functions for clouds without <b>colliding</b> flow. When the initial turbulence is weak, the column density PDF has a power-law wing at high column densities. The <b>colliding</b> flow considerably deforms the PDF, such that the PDF exhibits a double peak. The stellar mass distributions reproduced here {{are consistent with the}} classical initial mass function with a power-law index of $- 1. 35 $ when the initial clouds have a high density. The distribution of stellar velocities agrees with the gas velocity distribution, which can be fitted by Gaussian functions for clouds without <b>colliding</b> flow. For clouds with <b>colliding</b> flow, the velocity dispersion of gas tends to be larger than the stellar velocity dispersion. The signatures of <b>colliding</b> flows and turbulence appear in channel maps reconstructed from the simulation data. Clouds without <b>colliding</b> flow exhibit a cloud-scale velocity shear due to the turbulence. In contrast, clouds with <b>colliding</b> flow show a prominent anti-correlated distribution of thin filaments between the different velocity channels, suggesting collisions between the filamentary clouds.

50|$|For two balls <b>colliding,</b> {{only the}} two {{equations}} for conservation of momentum and energy are needed to solve the two unknown resulting velocities. For three or more simultaneously <b>colliding</b> elastic balls, the relative compressibilities of the <b>colliding</b> surfaces are the additional variables that determine the outcome.

50|$|Per-polygon {{collision}} (default): individual polygons <b>collide</b> with actors. Each material (i.e. {{each part}} of the Static Mesh using a separate texture) can be set to <b>collide</b> or not independently from the rest. The advantage of this method is that one part of the Static Mesh can <b>collide</b> while another doesn't (a common example: a tree's trunk <b>collides,</b> but its leaves don't). The disadvantage is that for complex meshes this can take a lot of processing power.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the total}} energy and {{momentum}} of the system are conserved and the rest masses of the <b>colliding</b> bodies do not change, it is shown that the {{momentum of the}} <b>colliding</b> body is decided by the rest masses of the <b>colliding</b> bodies, total energy and the total momentum.
