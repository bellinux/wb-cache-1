40|$|Predatory {{insects and}} spiders are key {{elements}} of integrated pest management (IPM) programmes in agricultural crops such as cotton. Management decisions in IPM programmes should {{to be based on}} a reliable and efficient method for counting both predators and pests. Knowledge of the temporal constraints that influence sampling is required because arthropod abundance estimates are likely to vary over a growing season and within a day. Few studies have adequately quantified this effect using the beat sheet, a potentially important sampling method. We compared the commonly used methods of suction and visual sampling to the beat sheet, with reference to an absolute <b>cage</b> <b>clamp</b> method for determining the abundance of various arthropod taxa over 5 weeks. There were significantly more entomophagous arthropods recorded using the beat sheet and <b>cage</b> <b>clamp</b> methods than by using suction or visual sampling, and these differences were more pronounced as the plants grew. In a second trial, relative estimates of entomophagous and phytophagous arthropod abundance were made using beat sheet samples collected over a day. Beat sheet estimates of the abundance of only eight of the 43 taxa examined were found to vary significantly over a day. Beat sheet sampling is recommended in further studies of arthropod abundance in cotton, but researchers and pest management advisors should bear in mind the time of season and time of day effects...|$|E
40|$|While welding {{technology}} has advanced in recent years, methods of fitting pipe remained primitive. Chain Clamps are versatile: each clamp can fit-up elbows, tees, flanges, and other pipe fittings. All carbon steel Chain Clamps are zinc plated to resist spatter and corrosion. On the average, one Chain Clamp costs about 40 % less and weighs about 77 % {{less than the}} required number of <b>cage</b> <b>clamps</b> to cover the same range of pipe diameter...|$|R
50|$|When a {{cable is}} {{terminated}} by a connector, the various wires {{in the cable}} are connected to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, <b>cage</b> <b>clamping,</b> crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Brown {{and white}} adipose tissue exerts {{pleiotropic}} effects on systemic energy metabolism {{in part by}} releasing endocrine factors. Neuregulin 4 (Nrg 4) was recently identified as a brown fat-enriched secreted factor that ameliorates diet-induced metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. However, the physiological mechanisms through which Nrg 4 regulates energy balance and glucose and lipid metabolism remain incompletely understood. The aims {{of the current study}} were: i) to investigate the regulation of adipose Nrg 4 expression during obesity and the physiological signals involved, ii) to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Nrg 4 regulation of energy balance and glucose and lipid metabolism, and iii) to explore whether Nrg 4 regulates adipose tissue secretome gene expression and adipokine secretion. METHODS: We examined the correlation of adipose Nrg 4 expression with obesity in a cohort of diet-induced obese mice and investigated the upstream signals that regulate Nrg 4 expression. We performed metabolic <b>cage</b> and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic <b>clamp</b> studies in Nrg 4 transgenic mice to dissect the metabolic pathways regulated by Nrg 4. We investigated how Nrg 4 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism in the fasting state and explored the effects of Nrg 4 on adipose tissue gene expression, particularly those encoding secreted factors. RESULTS: Adipose Nrg 4 expression is inversely correlated with adiposity and regulated by pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling. Transgenic expression of Nrg 4 increases energy expenditure and augments whole body glucose metabolism. Nrg 4 protects mice from diet-induced hepatic steatosis in part through activation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Finally, Nrg 4 promotes a healthy adipokine profile during obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Nrg 4 exerts pleiotropic beneficial effects on energy balance and glucose and lipid metabolism to ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic disorders. Biologic therapeutics based on Nrg 4 may improve both type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients.
