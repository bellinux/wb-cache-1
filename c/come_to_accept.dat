5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century the Norwegian crown had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that Caithness was held by the Earls of Orkney as a fiefdom from the Kings of Scotland although its Norse character was retained throughout the thirteenth century. Raghnall mac Gofraidh was granted Caithness after assisting the Scots king in a conflict with Harald Maddadson, an earl of Orkney in the early thirteenth century.|$|E

At home, Black learns that his daughter has been having vivid nightmares {{about the end of}} the world, in which she and her parents are isolated in a woodland cabin. Black admits to his wife that he has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the Group as a cult, and wishes to leave. He arranges to see a doctor, wishing to be tested but wanting the results to remain secret.|$|E
5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} to find another school for Chris, Lois asks her father, Carter Pewterschmidt, to utilize his superior influence to get Chris admitted to the upper-class Morningwood Academy, which he agrees to {{on the condition that}} Peter humiliate himself by starring in a shot-by-shot remake of Liar Liar, and eventually succeeds in doing so. At his new school, Chris is shunned by the wealthy students at the academy, being both verbally and physically assaulted, including being hit with socks full of paper money. After hearing this, Lois again turns to her father to help Chris, by inviting him to {{become a member of the}} Skull and Bones society with the other students, who eventually <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> him.|$|E

5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only {{portion of the}} Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler and the Doctor {{decide to}} visit Rose's mother Jackie. Jackie {{is pleased to}} see them, but makes a strangely happy remark that her {{deceased}} father will be joining them shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E

25|$|Ukrainization (also spelled Ukrainisation or Ukrainianization) is {{a policy}} of {{increasing}} the usage and facilitating {{the development of the}} Ukrainian language and promoting other elements of Ukrainian culture, in various spheres of public life such as education, publishing, government and religion. The term is also used to describe a process by which non-Ukrainians or Russified Ukrainians <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Ukrainian culture and language as their own.|$|E
25|$|In his Daybooks he {{provided}} an unusually detailed {{record of his}} evolution as an artist. Although he initially denied that his images reflect his own interpretations of the subject matter, by 1932 his writings revealed that he had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the importance of artistic impression in his work. When combined with his photographs, his writings provide an extraordinarily vivid series of insights into his development {{as an artist and}} his impact of future generations of photographers.|$|E

25|$|The only {{common bond}} between the two Pakistani wings was religion. But there were {{differences}} even in religious practices. Bengali Muslims tended to be less conservative in religious zeal, and had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> their Hindu minority and neighbours despite some communal clashes. Many Bengali Muslims strongly objected to the Islamist paradigm imposed by the Pakistani state. Most members of West Pakistan's ruling elite also belonged to a liberal society, yet understood a common faith as the mobilising factor behind Pakistan's creation and the subsuming of Pakistan's multiple identities into one.|$|E
25|$|Western {{churches have}} arrived at the {{position}} that, although the Filioque is doctrinally sound, {{the way that it}} was inserted into the Nicene Creed has created an unnecessary obstacle to ecumenical dialogue. Thus, without abandoning the Filioque, some Western churches have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that it could be omitted from the Creed without violating any core theological principles. This accommodation on the part of Western Churches has the objective of allowing both East and West to once again to share a common understanding of the Creed as the traditional and fundamental statement of the Christian faith.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October two neutral American officers, General Ambrose Burnside and Colonel Paul Forbes, {{were granted}} {{permission}} by the Germans to visit Paris as observers. When they returned they {{reported to the}} Germans the French conditions for an armistice: that it last two weeks, that elections be held, that Paris be revictualled and that no territory be cededâ€”although Favre had apparently <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the loss of Alsace. The American effort had no effect but to clarify to each side what was unacceptable to the other: the revictualling of Paris to the Germans and territorial concessions to the French.|$|E

25|$|Though {{at first}} the idea would shock the general public some {{eventually}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> it, as they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the 'atomist' representation of the universe as a multitude of dots consisting of primary colors. Just as each color is modified by its relation to adjacent colors {{within the context of}} Neo-Impressionist color theory, so too the object is modified by the geometric forms adjacent to it within the context of Cubism. The concept of 'mobile perspective' is essentially an extension of a similar principle stated in Paul Signac's D'EugÃ¨ne Delacroix au nÃ©o-impressionisme, with respect to color. Only now, the idea is extended to deal with questions of form within the context of both space and time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next two}} centuries {{witnessed}} a broad convergence of legal methodologies which {{gave rise to}} the classical theory of Sunni jurisprudence (uá¹£Å«l al-fiqh). Hanafi and Maliki jurists gradually <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the primacy of the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement, restricting the use of other forms of legal reasoning to interpretation of these scriptures. This [...] "traditionalizing" [...] of legal reasoning is exemplified in the work of Malik's student Al-Shafiâ€˜i, which laid the foundation of the Shafi'i legal school. In turn, Hanbali jurists, who led the traditionalist movement and initially opposed the use of qiyas, gradually <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> it as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.|$|R
25|$|Machiavelli is {{generally}} {{seen as being}} critical of Christianity as it existed in his time, specifically its effect upon politics, and also everyday life. In his opinion, Christianity, along with the teleological Aristotelianism that the church had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept,</b> allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary ideals and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to providence or, as he would put it, chance, luck or fortune. While Christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful, Machiavelli took a more classical position, seeing ambition, spiritedness, {{and the pursuit of}} glory as good and natural things, and part of the virtue and prudence that good princes should have. Therefore, while it was traditional to say that leaders should have virtues, especially prudence, Machiavelli's use of the words virtÃ¹ and prudenza was unusual for his time, implying a spirited and immodest ambition. Famously, Machiavelli argued that virtue and prudence can help a man control more of his future, in the place of allowing fortune to do so.|$|E
25|$|Eden's major mistake {{had been}} not to strike in July 1956 {{when there was}} {{widespread}} anger at Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, as {{by the fall of}} 1956 public anger had subsided, with many people in Britain having <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the fait accompli, and saw no reason for war. This was especially the case as Eden's claims that the Egyptians would hopelessly mismanage the Canal had proven groundless, and that by September 1956 {{it was clear that the}} change of management had not affected shipping. Even more importantly, Eden's obsession with secrecy and his desire to keep the preparations for war as secret as possible meant that the Eden government did nothing in the months running up to the attack to explain to the British people why it was felt that war was necessary. Many of the reservists who were called up for their National Service in the summer and fall of 1956 recalled feeling bewildered and confused as the Eden government started preparing to attack Egypt while at the same time Eden insisted in public that he wanted a peaceful resolution of the dispute, and was opposed to attacking Egypt. The British author David Pryce-Jones recalled that as a young officer, that after the ultimatum was submitted to Egypt he had to explain to his troops why war with Egypt was necessary without believing a word that he was saying. Only one British soldier, however, refused to fight.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the idea}} of moving around objects to capture several angles {{at the same time}} would shock the public they {{eventually}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> it, as they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the 'atomist' representation of the universe as a multitude of dots consisting of primary colors.

500|$|One {{significant}} {{expectation of}} the American advance into Quebec {{was that the}} large French Catholic Canadien population of the province and city would rise against British rule. Since the British {{took control of the}} province, during the French and Indian War in 1760, there had been difficulties and disagreements between the local French Catholics and the Protestant English-speaking British military and civilian administrations. However, these tensions had been eased by the passage of the Quebec Act of 1774, which restored land and many civil rights to the Canadiens (an act which had been condemned by the thirteen rebelling colonies). The majority of Quebec's French inhabitants chose not to play {{an active role in the}} American campaign, in large part because, encouraged by their clergy, they had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> [...] British rule with its backing of the Catholic Church and preservation of French culture.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage has {{a form of}} dwarfism, achondroplasia, {{which affects}} bone growth. As a result, he is [...] tall, with a typical-sized head and torso but short limbs.

Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E

[...] He discovers that his Kalo collection may always remain incompleteâ€”though the family once had a scrapbook filled with Kalo's cartoons, they long ago threw it away. [...] By the end of the story, Seth has found a mere eleven of them. [...] When Kalo's mother reveals Kalo's contentment with his choice to give up cartooning, Seth must face the anxiety of his life choices and what a [...] "good life" [...] may mean to him. [...] As a mother who has outlived her son yet does not mire herself in the past, Mrs Kalloway provides an unsentimental contrast to how Seth views and deals with the world.|$|E
