25|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the Uranian atmosphere, extending for thousands of kilometres, is the thermosphere/exosphere, which has a uniform temperature of around 800 to 850K. This is much higher than, for instance, the 420K observed in the thermosphere of Saturn. The heat sources necessary to sustain such high temperatures are not understood, since neither solar FUV/EUV radiation nor auroral activity can provide the necessary energy. The weak <b>cooling</b> <b>efficiency</b> due to the depletion of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere may contribute to this phenomenon.

With an angular {{design and}} an exceptionally low slung body, {{the highest point}} of the roof is just under 4 feet above the ground. One of the vehicle's most distinguishing features are its scissor doors. which lends to the extreme image. First-generation Murciélagos, produced between 2001 and 2006, were powered by a Lamborghini V12 that traces its roots back to the company's beginnings in the 1960s. The rear differential is integrated with the engine itself, with a viscous coupling center differential providing drive to the front wheels. Power is delivered through a 6-speed manual transmission. The Murciélago suspension uses an independent double-wishbone design, and bodywork features carbon fiber, steel and aluminum parts.

500|$|Several gaming and {{technology}} sites reported an [...] "overheating bug" [...] with StarCraft II {{that in some}} cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards. The source of the problem {{is the fact that the}} frame rate is not locked on menu screens. This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image, resulting in excessive heat. Blizzard has acknowledged the problem, and posted a temporary workaround. [...] They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the videocard manufacturer for hardware-related issues. In response to the reports, Blizzard's Public Relations Manager, Bob Colayco said: [...] "There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat. When we saw this issue first reported, we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem, the cause is most likely hardware-related." [...] CrunchGear has also suggested that the problem is not with StarCraft II, but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling. They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non-framerate locked screens and provide the fix that Blizzard has offered to users. [...] Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the <b>cooling</b> <b>efficiency</b> of their systems. Blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding the issue that has since been removed. The message was: [...] "Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient. This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSolar thermal cooling has {{difficulty}} {{to emerge as}} an economically competitive solution for small systems mainly due to high investment cost and system complexity [1]. Therefore developments of principally new system solutions are needed. This paper describes such a solution with sorption modules directly integrated into a solar thermal collector. The focus of the work has been to find key parameters influencing the module and the system efficiency. A validated model of a sorption collector has been implemented into a simplified system deck providing cooling, heating and domestic hot water to static loads in the system modelling environment TRNSYS [2]. Simulations have been conducted for different boundary conditions and at two locations with different climatic conditions. Thermal losses from the collector as well as internal thermal losses inside the collector {{were found to be}} the most important parameters influencing efficiency.

40|$|An {{open-circuit}} low-speed {{wind tunnel}} {{was used to}} study the performance of evaporative cooling with cellulose and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) corrugated media. These two film media were selected {{as part of a}} broader investigation on pre-cooling the entering air of natural draft dry cooling towers. The heat and mass transfer and pressure drop across the two media with three thicknesses (i. e., 100, 200 and 300 mm) were experimentally studied in the wind tunnel. The test data were non-dimensionalized and curve fitted to yield a set of correlations. It was found that the pressure drop range of the cellulose media is 1. 5 - 101. 7 Pa while the pressure drops of the PVC media are much lower with the range of 0. 9 - 49. 2 Pa, depending on the medium thickness, air velocity and water flow rate. The <b>cooling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the cellulose media vary from 43 % to 90 % while the <b>cooling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the PVC media are 8 % to 65 %, depending on the medium thickness and air velocity.

40|$|The {{performance}} of natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) {{can be improved}} by wetted-medium evaporative pre-cooling. However, the pre-cooling benefit is season dependent and is significantly affected by wetted media. To further investigate the effect of wetted medium type on pre-cooling performance, the current study simulates a pre-cooled NDDCT using two typical types of wetted media, i. e., film (Cellulose 7060 and PVC 1200) and trickle (Trickle 125 and Trickle 100). A MATLAB program was developed and was validated against published data. The model was then used to carry out case study of a 120 m-high NDDCT pre-cooled using the selected wetted media with fixed thickness of 300 mm. Both the medium performance and pre-cooled NDDCT performance were compared to recommend the characteristics of wetted media promising for evaporative pre-cooling. Simulation finds that the media with high or low <b>cooling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and pressure drops are not promising for the studied pre-cooling case while those media with middle <b>cooling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and pressure drops intend to produce much performance enhancement and Cellulose 7060 is a representative of such kind of medium. For the 120 m-high NDDCT, the wetted-medium pre-cooling can raise the heat rejection rate of the tower without pre-cooling from 45 MW to 92 MW, 76 MW, 68 MW and 65 MW by Cellulose 7060, PVC 1200, Trickle 125 and Trickle 100, respectively at ambient temperature of 50 °C and humidity of 20 %...|$|R
