25|$|Although his {{reputation}} is largely based upon his operas, Boieldieu also composed other works. Among them was his Harp Concerto in C, written in 1800–1801 {{and one of}} the masterpieces of the harp repertory. He became professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire and in 1817 he succeeded Méhul as one of the forty members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. He received the Légion d'honneur in 1820. He gradually lost the ability to speak, no doubt due to <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larynx.</b> The bankruptcy of the Opéra-Comique and the revolution of 1830 added to his woes. To save him from poverty, Adolphe Thiers awarded him a state pension of 6,000 francs. On September 25, 1834, he made his last public appearance at the premiere of Adolphe Adam's Le chalet. In this way, he stylishly passed on the baton to his brilliant pupil.|$|E
500|$|Frederick III ( [...] ; 18 October 1831– 15 June 1888) was German Emperor and King of Prussia for ninety-nine days in 1888, the Year of the Three Emperors. Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl, known informally as [...] "Fritz", was {{the only}} son of Emperor Wilhelm I and was raised in his family's {{tradition}} of military service. Although celebrated {{as a young man}} for his leadership and successes during the Second Schleswig, Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars, he nevertheless professed a hatred of warfare and was praised by friends and enemies alike for his humane conduct. Following the unification of Germany in 1871 his father, then King of Prussia, became the German Emperor. Upon Wilhelm's death at the age of ninety on 9 March 1888, the thrones passed to Frederick, who had by then been German Crown Prince for seventeen years and Crown Prince of Prussia for twenty-seven years. Frederick was suffering from <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larynx</b> when he died on 15 June 1888, aged fifty-six, following unsuccessful medical treatments for his condition.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{proposed}} relation between gastro-esophageal reflux disease and <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larynx</b> and pharynx. Experimental Design: A cohort of 66, 965 patients with discharge diagnoses of heartburn, hiatal hernia, or esoph-agitis was {{identified in the}} Swedish Inpatient Register. We observed a total of 376, 622 person-years in <b>the</b> cohort. Identification <b>of</b> laryngeal and pharyngeal cancers was achieved through the Swedish Cancer Register. Standardized incidence ratios, <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed to <b>the</b> expected number <b>of</b> <b>cancers,</b> derived from <b>the</b> general Swedish population and adjusted for sex, age, and calendar year, was used to estimate the relative risk. Results: During follow-up, 30 cases of laryngeal and 31 cases <b>of</b> pharyngeal <b>cancer</b> were detected in the cohort. Slightly increased risks of laryngeal [relative risk, 1. 6; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 1 - 2. 2] and pharyngeal carcinomas (relative risk, 1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 2. 8) were observed in the total reflux cohort. After stratification to exclude cohort members with a diagnosis of alcoholism, no significant increase in <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> laryngeal (relative risk, 1. 3; 95 % CI, 0. 8 - 2. 0) or pharyngeal carcinomas (relative risk, 1. 0; 95 % CI, 0. 5 - 1. 6) was found compared with the general population. Furthermore, there were no dose-response patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk for laryngeal and pharyngeal <b>cancers</b> with years <b>of</b> cohort follow-up, indica-tors of reflux severity, or specificity of reflux diagnosis. Conclusion: This study provides no evidence in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed association between gastroesophageal reflux disease and <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larynx</b> or pharynx.

40|$|A lesser known {{reason of}} {{epidemic}} proportion <b>of</b> oral <b>cancer</b> in India is <b>the</b> rampant use <b>of</b> Areca nut chewing. Just like tobacco, areca nut or betel nut is a psychostimulant, an addictive substance and a carcinogen. <b>The</b> <b>cancer</b> causing properties <b>of</b> areca nut have been well-reported in animal, human and epidemiologic studies.
