40|$|Abstract. An {{intelligent}} agent should be rational, in particular it {{should at least}} avoid pursuing goals which are definitely conflicting. In this paper we focus on resource conflict in agents that use a plan library organised around goals. We characterise different types of resources and define <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> summaries. We give algorithms for deriving <b>resource</b> <b>requirements,</b> using <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> to detect conflict, and maintaining dynamic updates of <b>resource</b> <b>requirements.</b> We also discuss ways of resolving resource conflict. Our approach does not represent time, rather it keeps resource summaries current. This enables an agent’s decisions {{to be made on}} the basis of up-to-date information and allows us to develop efficient runtime (online) algorithms. ...|$|R

Each VNFC is modeled using {{a pair of}} supervised FNNs that learn the trend of <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> for the VNFC by combining historical local VNFC resource utilization information with the information collected from its neighbors. The first FNN learns the dependence of the <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> {{for each of the}} VNFCs, which is used by the second FNN to forecast the <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> for each VNFC. The predictions are leveraged to spin-up and configure new VNFCs or deallocate resources to turn off VNFCs. Evaluation based on real-time VoIP traffic traces on a virtualized IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) reveals a prediction accuracy of approximately 90 %.|$|R

50|$|In Grid systems, the Quality of Service (QoS) is {{not limited}} to the network bandwidth, but extends to the {{processing}} and storage capabilities of the nodes. Thus the focus is on the degree a Grid can provide end-to-end QOS rather than providing only QOS on the network. When a Grid job has QOS requirements, it may be necessary to negotiate a service level agreement (SLA) to enforce the desired level of service. Resource reservation is one of the ways of providing guaranteed QOS in a Grid with dedicated resources. One of the major issues in resource reservation is correct matching of available resources with required resources, this results effectively utilize various resources in the system, such as CPU cycle, memory, communication network, and data storage. Correct matching operation depends on percept job <b>resource</b> <b>requirements.</b> This can be obtained by two methods. In the first method, environment can ask <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> from user. This is not proper inQOS. Another method is that architecture itself predicts <b>resource</b> <b>requirement.</b> job <b>resource</b> <b>requirements</b> prediction algorithms operate on the principle that jobs with similar characteristics have similar <b>resource</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|R

The required project completion date {{is up to the}} project manager to be specified and may depend on several considerations. This requirement is such that any project completion later than this has low value. Thus, the required project completion date serves as a limit or deadline on how late the completion of the project can be.
