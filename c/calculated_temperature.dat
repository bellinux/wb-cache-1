6000|$|It may be well to {{consider}} more closely, {{what is the}} probable condition of the Sun's surface. Round the globe of incandescent molten substances, thus conceived to form the visible body of the Sun [which in conformity with the argument in a previous section, now transferred to the Addenda, was inferred to be hollow and filled with gaseous matter at high tension] there is known to exist a voluminous atmosphere: the inferior brilliancy of the Sun's border, and the appearances during a total eclipse, alike show this. What now must be the constitution of this atmosphere? At a temperature approaching a thousand times that of molten iron, which is the <b>calculated</b> <b>temperature</b> of the solar surface, very many, if not all, of the substances we know as solid, would become gaseous; and though the Sun's enormous attractive force must be a powerful check on this tendency to assume the form of vapour, yet it cannot be questioned that if {{the body of the}} Sun consists of molten substances, some of them must be constantly undergoing evaporation. That the dense gases thus continually being generated will form the entire mass of the solar atmosphere, is not probable. If anything is to be inferred, either from the Nebular Hypothesis, or from the analogies supplied by the planets, it must be concluded that the outermost part of the solar atmosphere consists of what are called permanent gases--gases that are not condensible into fluid even at low temperatures. If we consider what must have been the state of things here, when the surface of the Earth was molten, we shall see that round the still molten surface of the Sun, there probably exists a stratum of dense aeriform matter, made up of sublimed metals and metallic compounds, and above this a stratum of comparatively rare medium analogous to air. What now will happen with these two strata? Did they both consist of permanent gases, they could not remain separate: according to a well-known law, they would eventually form a homogeneous mixture. But this will by no means happen when the lower stratum consists of matters that are gaseous only at excessively high temperatures. Given off from a molten surface, ascending, expanding, and cooling, these will presently reach a limit of elevation above which they cannot exist as vapour, but must condense and precipitate. Meanwhile the upper stratum, habitually charged with its quantum of these denser matters, as our air with its quantum of water, and ready to deposit them on any depression of temperature, must be habitually unable to take up any more of the lower stratum; and therefore this lower stratum will remain quite distinct from it.[20] ...|$|E

Although deviation of <b>calculated</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{for the experimental}} fluids is quite small (124  °C for the andesite experiment and 133  °C for the tonalite experiments), estimations for some springs lead to implausible low values, ranging below the discharge temperature (e.g., discharge temperature/calc. temperature for Car =  82 / 77  °C or Chi =  85 / 69  °C).

40|$|Summary The {{admittance}} {{method of}} <b>calculating</b> maximum summertime <b>temperatures</b> in buildings, {{as used in}} the CIBSE Guide, is the standard method in the UK. It was developed for manual calculations, where it is only feasible to consider one room or zone a t a time, and is now used for <b>calculating</b> <b>temperatures</b> using a microcomputer. Other digital methods of <b>calculating</b> <b>temperatures</b> were developed originally with larger computers. This paper shows how the admittance method {{can be used to}} predict the temperature in multiple zones. A set of simultaneous equations relating the mean temperature in each room is derived, and these are solved by standard computer methods.

50|$|A simple {{polarimeter}} {{to measure}} this rotation {{consists of a}} long tube with flat glass ends, into which the sample is placed. At {{each end of the}} tube is a Nicol prism or other polarizer. Light is shone through the tube, and the prism at the other end, attached to an eye-piece, is rotated to arrive at the region of complete brightness or that of half-dark, half-bright or that of complete darkness. The angle of rotation is then read from a scale. The same phenomenon is observed after an angle of 180°. The specific rotation of the sample may then be <b>calculated.</b> <b>Temperature</b> can affect the rotation of light, which should be accounted for in the calculations.|$|E

Bell scales are unique to each bell and are usually attached vertically with a needle-like pointer. When proving a meter using a manually controlled bell, an operator must first fill the bell with a controlled air supply or raise it manually by opening a valve and pulling a chained mechanism, seal the bell and meter and check the sealed system for leaks, determine the flow rate needed for the meter, install a special flow-rate cap on the meter outlet, note the starting points of both the bell scale and meter index, release the bell valve to pass air through the meter, observe the meter index and calculate {{the time it takes}} to pass the predetermined amount of air, then manually calculate the meter's proof accounting for bell air and meter temperature and in some cases other environmental factors.|$|E
