50|$|This {{technique}} {{can also}} be used to assess the quality and development stage of certain translucent plant seeds, especially those of Lilies and their close relatives. Ripe, viable seeds have a visible embryo within them when viewed in transmitted light, so good seeds can be sorted out from the non-viable seeds and chaff, if desired. <b>Candling</b> is a highly useful method with certain species that germinate erratically or very slowly, as seed germination causes the embryo to enlarge. <b>Candling</b> can thus be used to estimate the optimal time for planting seeds that are being stratified. Care must be taken during <b>candling,</b> as drying or overheating will kill the developing seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Ear <b>candling</b> {{also should}} be avoided. Ear <b>candling</b> is a {{practice}} in which a hollow candle is inserted into {{the external auditory canal}} and lit, with the patient lying on the opposite ear. In theory, the combination of heat and suction is supposed to remove earwax. However, in one trial, ear candles neither created suction nor removed wax and actually led to occlusion with candle wax in persons who previously had clean ear canals. Primary care physicians may see complications from ear <b>candling</b> including candle wax occlusion, local burns, and tympanic membrane perforation. The Spokane Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic conducted a research study in 1996 which concluded that ear <b>candling</b> does not produce negative pressure and was ineffective in removing wax from the ear canal. Several studies have shown that ear candles produce the same residue when burnt without ear insertion and that the residue is simply candle wax and soot.|$|E

5000|$|Ear <b>candling</b> {{appears to}} be popular and is heavily advertised with claims that could seem {{scientific}} to lay people. However, its claimed mechanism of action has not been verified, no positive clinical effect has been reliably recorded, and it is associated with considerable risk. No evidence suggests that ear <b>candling</b> is an effective treatment for any condition. On this basis, we believe it can {{do more harm than}} good and we recommend that GPs discourage its use.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>candle</b> holders use a friction-tight socket to {{keep the}} <b>candle</b> upright. In this case, a <b>candle</b> that is {{slightly}} too wide will not fit in the holder, and a <b>candle</b> that is slightly too narrow will wobble. <b>Candles</b> that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; <b>candles</b> that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the <b>candle</b> and <b>candle</b> holders {{were made in the}} same place, so they were appropriately sized, but international trade has combined the modern <b>candle</b> with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting <b>candle</b> more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For tea light <b>candles,</b> {{there are a variety of}} <b>candle</b> holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for votives. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive <b>candles.</b> For pillar-type <b>candles,</b> the assortment of <b>candle</b> holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, is a <b>candle</b> holder for a pillar-style <b>candle.</b> A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style <b>candle</b> is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.|$|R
5000|$|Votive <b>candles</b> {{are made}} from {{different}} types of waxes including paraffin, soy wax or beeswax. There are different grades of wax with different melting points. Paraffin is often mixed {{with other types of}} waxes, such as beeswax or vegetable wax. This is done to obtain the rigidity necessary for the type of <b>candle</b> being made. The speed at which the <b>candle</b> burns depends on the composition of the wax. A taper <b>candle</b> that sits in a ring-shaped <b>candle</b> holder may have a low melting point and produce little to no oil, whereas a votive <b>candle</b> set in a glass cup may have a very low melting point and turn to oil. Pillar <b>candles,</b> large <b>candles</b> often with multiple wicks, have their own formula. Soy jar <b>candles</b> tend to have a lower melting point than pillars and votive <b>candles.</b> <b>Candle</b> quality also varies widely depending on the <b>candle</b> maker. The aroma of a lighted scented <b>candle</b> is released through the evaporation of the fragrance from the hot wax pool and from the solid <b>candle</b> itself.|$|R

50|$|Trick <b>candles</b> are {{a novelty}} <b>candle</b> often used at children's {{birthday}} parties. These <b>candles</b> relight themselves, using a fuse {{similar to those}} in dynamite sticks, the principle being that by igniting magnesium inserted into the wick of the <b>candle,</b> the paraffin vapour given off when a <b>candle</b> is blown out can be set alight, and through this, the <b>candle</b> can reignite.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>candle</b> wick {{is usually}} a braided cotton that holds the flame of a oil lamp or <b>candle.</b> A <b>candle</b> wick works by {{capillary}} action, conveying ("wicking") the fuel to the flame. When the liquid fuel, typically melted <b>candle</b> wax, reaches the flame it then vaporizes and combusts. The <b>candle</b> wick influences how the <b>candle</b> burns. Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, fire-resistance, and tethering.|$|R

500|$|The Peace <b>Candle</b> is {{believed}} to be the largest non-wax Christmas <b>candle</b> in the United States.
