50|$|Various {{neurodegenerative}} diseases {{have been}} associated with excessive NMDA receptor activation meant to mediate calcium dependent neurotoxicity. Researchers have examined many different NMDA antagonists and their therapeutic efficacy, none of which have concluded to be both safe and effective. For years, researchers have been investigating the effects of an open channel block, memantine, as a treatment option for neurotoxicity. They hypothesized that the faster blocking and unblocking rates, and overall kinetics, of memantine could be the underlying reason for the <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance.</b> As an uncompetitive antagonist, memantine should bring NMDA levels close to normal despite high glutamate concentration. Based on this information, researchers speculated that some day memantine could be used as an open channel block to prevent increasing glutamate levels associated with neurotoxicity with little to no side effects compared to other treatment options.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{introduce}} tools to improve the security of each IMRT patient treatment by determining action levels for the dose delivery process. To achieve this, the patient-specific quality control results performed with an ionization chamber—and which characterize the dose delivery process—have been retrospectively analyzed using a method borrowed from industry: Statistical process control (SPC). The latter consisted in fulfilling four principal well-structured steps. The authors first quantified the short term variability of ionization chamber measurements regarding the <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerances</b> used in the cancer center (± 4 % of deviation between the calculated and measured doses) by calculating a control process capability (Cpc) index. The Cpc index was found superior to 4, which implies that the observed variability of the dose delivery process is not biased by the short term variability of the measurement. Then, the authors demonstrated using a normality test that the quality control results could be approximated by a normal distribution with two parameters (mean and standard deviation). Finally, the authors used two complementary tools—control charts and performance indices—to thoroughly analyze the IMRT dose delivery process. Control charts aim at monitoring the process over time using statistical control limits to distinguish random (natural) variations from significant changes in the process, whereas performance indices aim at quantifying the ability of the process to produce data that are within the <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerances,</b> at a precise moment. The authors retrospectively showed that the analysis of three selected control charts (individual value, moving-range, and EWMA control charts) allowed efficient drift detection of the dose delivery process for prostate and head-and-neck treatments before the quality controls were outside the <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Therefore, when analyzed in real time, during quality controls, they should improve the security of treatments. They also showed that the dose delivery processes in the cancer center were in control for prostate and head-and-neck treatments. In parallel, long term process performance indices (Pp, Ppk, and Ppm) have been analyzed. Their analysis helped defining which actions should be undertaken in order to improve the performance of the process. The prostate dose delivery process has been shown statistically capable (0. 08 % of the results is expected to be outside the <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerances)</b> contrary to the head-and-neck dose delivery process (5. 76 % of the results are expected to be outside the <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerances)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{quantification}} of basophil activation by {{flow cytometry}} {{is a useful}} tool for the assessment of immediate-type responses to food allergens and the prediction of <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance</b> in food allergy patients. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how the analysis of allergen-induced CD 63 up-regulation by flow cytometry can be effective in monitoring the acquisition of <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance</b> by specific oral desensitization in food allergy. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine this topic. Materials and methods: Three male patients affected by cow’s milk allergy underwent successful oral desensitization to cow’s milk. In order to monitor the acquired <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance</b> that occurred after treatment, we performed laboratory tests for total and specific IgE, specific IgG 4 and the Basophil Activation Test (BAT) both at baseline and at the end of the desensitization protocol. Results: Using a fluorescent enzyme immunoassay, the comparison of specific cow’s milk antibodies before and after treatment showed a decrease of specific IgE levels, without reaching normal values, and an increase of specific IgG 4 levels. A complete suppression of cow’s milk proteins (a-lactoalbumin, b-lactoglobulin and casein) induced CD 63 regulation was observed in all three reported cases. Conclusions: Using flow cytometry, food allergen-specific basophil responses could be monitored in order to identify an acquired tolerance induced by desensitization treatment. Although further studies are needed to develop this important new topic, it was interesting to note that the BAT seemed to be more sensitive and characterized by a close correlation with <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance...</b>|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{acceptance}} of transplanted organs without requirement for indefinite immunosuppression remains {{the ultimate goal}} of transplant clinicians and scientists. This clinical state of allograft acceptance termed "operational tolerance" has been elusive in routine practice. However, there are published reports of recipients where immunosuppression has been discontinued, by intention or patient noncompliance, in which the outcome is a nondestructive immune response and normal function. The question now arises how <b>clinical</b> operational <b>tolerance</b> might be achieved in the majority of recipients. This review provides an overview of current approaches to achieve operational tolerance, including the use of donor bone marrow and depletion of recipient T cells and the resistance of liver transplants to rejection. It also describes the key role of clinical immune monitoring and future approaches to tolerance induction including inhibition of T-cell signaling, manipulation of costimulatory pathways, and expansion of regulatory T cells.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite {{reaching}} high {{percentages of}} desensitization using allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) {{in patients with}} food allergy, recent studies suggest only a low number of patients to reach persistent <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance.</b> This review describes current developments in strategies to improve safety and long-term efficacy of SIT. RECENT FINDINGS: Modified allergens or tolerogenic peptides, ultimately optimized for human leukocyte antigen background of the patient, are explored for tolerance induction, whereas anti-IgE antibody (Omalizumab) {{may be used to}} facilitate SIT safety. Adjunct therapies to enhance efficacy may make use of TH 1 polarizing agents, for example, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides combined with modified allergen packaged in nanoparticles. Preclinical studies showed insulin-like growth factor- 2, intravenous immunoglobulin, Tregitopes or allergen encased oligomannose-coated liposomes capable of inducing regulatory T-cells, recognized for their importance in <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance</b> induction. Dietary intervention strategies utilizing herbal formula 2, VSL# 3, nondigestible short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS) plus Bifidobacterium breve M- 16 V or n- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may facilitate safety and/or a favourable milieu for tolerance induction.

40|$|Food allergies, {{and peanut}} allergy in particular, are {{leading causes of}} anaphylactic {{fatalities}} worldwide. The immune mechanisms that underlie food allergy remain ill-defined and controversial, in part because studies in humans typically focus on analysis of {{a limited number of}} prototypical Th 1 /Th 2 cytokines. Here we determine the kinetics and prevalence of a broad panel of peanut-driven cytokine and chemokine responses in humans with current peanut allergy vs those with stable, naturally occurring <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance</b> to peanut. Our primary focus is identification of novel indicators of immune dysregulation. Antigen-specific cytokine mRNA and protein responses were elicited in primary culture via peanut or irrelevant antigen (Leishmania extract, milk antigens) mediated stimulation of fresh peripheral blood cells from 40 individuals. Peanut extract exposure in vitro induced a broad panel of responses associated with Th 2 /Th 9 -like, Th 1 -like and Th 17 -like immunity. Peanut-dependent Type 2 cytokine responses were frequently found in both peanut allergic individuals and those who exhibit <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance</b> to peanut ingestion. Among Th 2 /Th 9 -associated cytokines, IL- 9 responses discriminated between allergic and clinically tolerant populations better than did commonly used IL- 4, IL- 5 or IL- 13 responses. Comparison with responses evoked by unrelated control antigen-mediated stimulation showed that these differences are antigen-dependent and allergen-specific. Conversely, the intensity of IL- 12, IL- 17, IL- 23 and IFN-γ production was indistinguishable in peanut allergic and peanut tolerant populations. In summary, the ability to generate and maintain cytokine responses to peanut is not inherently distinct between allergic and peanut tolerant humans. Quantitative differences in the intensity of cytokine production better reflects clinical phenotype, with optimally useful indicators being IL- 9, IL- 5, IL- 13 and IL- 4. Equivalent, and minimal, Ag-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in both healthy and peanut allergic volunteers argues against a key role for such cytokines in maintenance of <b>clinical</b> <b>tolerance</b> to food antigens in humans...|$|E
