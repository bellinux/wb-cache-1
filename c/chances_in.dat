5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> this line. First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White is {{no longer able to}} bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4.|$|E
5|$|Since 2010, {{when the}} Big Four {{increasingly}} began {{to dominate the}} tour as a group, most articles and reports concentrate solely on {{the members of the}} Big Four and their <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> upcoming tournaments or how the previous one has affected them, with smaller sections {{on the rest of the}} players.|$|E
5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go one step further and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not good enough.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Senate, Stanley {{returned}} to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, he threw his support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve his chances of returning to the Senate in 1930. Beckham lost to Republican Flem D. Sampson, greatly diminishing Stanley's <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the senatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|Gripen first export bid was to Finland, {{where it}} competed against F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29 and Mirage 2000 to replace Finnish Air Force's J 35 Draken and MiG-21 fleet. In May 1992, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 was {{announced}} as a winner on performance and cost grounds. The Finnish Minister of Defence, Elisabeth Rehn, stated that delays in Gripen's development schedule had hurt its <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the competition.|$|E
5|$|After being {{handed the}} number 10 shirt and Italy's playmaking duties, much was {{expected}} of Totti in his debut World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. Despite a promising start at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea, as he set-up Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 2–0 opening win over Ecuador, disappointment followed, with Totti failing to score or make a significant impact throughout the tournament. Despite helping to set up Vieri's goal in a disappointing and controversial 2–1 defeat to Croatia in Italy's second group match, his lacklustre performances throughout the tournament were later criticised by the Italian media, in particular his failure to capitalise on several scoring <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> Italy's 1–1 draw against Mexico in their final group match, as Italy only narrowly qualified for the knockout stage.|$|E

5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{started his}} cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He {{struggled}} {{to break into}} the first team with his new county, and {{spent most of his time}} with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.|$|E

5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} on his knees and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{indications}} otherwise, Mathias {{announced on}} September 27, 1985, {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term. His announcement concerned Republican party officials in the state, who feared that local Republicans had poorer election chances without Mathias {{at the top of the}} ticket. At the national level, Mathias' announcement came shortly after news that Republican Paul Laxalt of Nevada would be retiring as well. The departure of two Republican senators from swing or Democratic-leaning states was treated by Republican party leaders as a poor sign of the party's <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the upcoming elections. Linda Chavez won the Republican primary for the Senate seat, and she lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Mikulski.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{unexpected}} naval success, the Confederate generals {{were still}} skeptical about their <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the fort and held another late-night council of war, where {{they decided to}} retry their aborted escape plan. At dawn on February 15, the Confederates launched an assault led by Pillow against McClernand's division on the unprotected right flank of the Union line. The Union troops, unable {{to sleep in the}} cold weather, were not caught entirely by surprise, but Grant was. Not expecting a land assault from the Confederates, he was up before dawn and had headed off to visit Flag Officer Foote on his flagship downriver. Grant left orders that none of his generals was to initiate an engagement and no one was designated as second-in-command during his absence.|$|E

5|$|Donaldson {{started his}} career with Hull City in 2002, scoring on his first-team debut in the Football League Trophy later that year. He was sent out on loan to non-League clubs on four occasions, and with <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the first team at Hull limited, he was {{released}} in 2005 and subsequently joined York City. In his first season at the club, he was voted as their Clubman of the Year and his second season saw him finish as the team's highest scorer and third highest scorer in the league.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{publication}} of the Commentaries, Blackstone's chances of judicial appointment remained slim. While he was old enough, experienced enough and widely respected, the presence of Lord Camden as Lord Chancellor and Blackstone's lack of aristocratic patrons at the time hindered his <b>chances.</b> <b>In</b> January 1770, however, Lord Grafton's government began to fall, with Camden resigning on 17 January and Solicitor-General John Dunning, following him. George III appointed Lord North as Prime Minister, and North picked Charles Yorke as Lord Chancellor. Yorke's death on 20 January, after holding the position for less than three days, left several important legal positions within the government open. As such, Blackstone, now MP for Westbury, was apparently approached to become Solicitor-General; he refused, not wanting to deal with the complicated duties attached to the position.|$|E
5|$|However, it did {{not take}} long for Fàbregas {{to become one of the}} most coveted and celebrated young talents in the game with his success at Arsenal. Functioning mostly as a playmaker and renowned for his passing range, he was {{described}} as the general of Arsenal's first team, bringing vision, creativity, and an innate understanding of timing and space to Arsenal's intricate passing game, displaying maturity that belied his age. He was the main creative force when he was at Arsenal, as exemplified by his 16 assists in all competitions in the 2006–07 season. Between 2006–07 and 2010–11, Fàbregas created the most <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the top-division leagues of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.|$|E

5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the runoff.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{two players}} {{did not tell}} their {{teammates}} or management about the deal, feeling that their interactions with bookmakers would meet with disapproval. They {{said that they did}} not feel that their liaisons were harming their team's <b>chances</b> <b>in</b> any way. They remained silent even after they reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, asserting that his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.|$|E
