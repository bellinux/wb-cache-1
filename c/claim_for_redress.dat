This has been the cry all through the war. [...] "We should have conquered the South," [...] says an American paper which I read this very day, [...] "but for England." [...] Was there ever such puling heard from men who have an army of a million, and who turn and revile a people who have stood as aloof from their contest as we have from the war of Troy? Or is it an outcry made with malice prepense? And is the song of the New York Times a variation of the Herald tune?--"The conduct of the British in folding their arms and taking no part in the fight, has been so base that it has caused the prolongation of the war, and occasioned a prodigious expense on our part. Therefore, as we have British property in our hands, we &c. &c." [...] The lamb troubled the water dreadfully, and the wolf, in a righteous indignation, [...] "confiscated" [...] him. Of course we have heard that at an undisturbed time Great Britain would never have dared to press its <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redress.</b> Did the United States wait until we were at peace with France before they went to war with us last? Did Mr. Seward yield the claim which he confesses to be just, until he himself was menaced with war? How long were the Southern gentlemen kept in prison? What caused them to be set free? and did the Cabinet of Washington see its error before or after the demand for redress?* The captor was feasted at Boston, and the captives in prison hard by. If the wrong-doer was to be punished, it was Captain Wilkes who ought to have gone into limbo. At any rate, as [...] "the Cabinet of Washington could not give its approbation to the commander of the 'San Jacinto,'" [...] why were the men not sooner set free? To sit at the Tremont House, and hear the captain after dinner give his opinion on international law, would have been better sport for the prisoners than the grim salle-a-manger at Fort Warren.|$|E
40|$|E quality {{between women}} and men has been a {{doctrine}} well recognizedin international law since the adoption of the 1948 Universal Dec-laration of Human Rights (United Nations 1958), and as a principle it enjoys popular support in many countries. The idea of gender equal rights has provided the formal basis for the international discussion of the position of women since the 1975 – 85 UN Decade for Women, which has been a key element in the story of global feminism (Bulbeck 1988). The idea that men might have a specific role in relation to this principle has emerged only recently. The issue of gender equality was placed on the policy agenda by women. The reason is obvious: it is women who are disadvantaged by the main patterns of gender inequality and who therefore have the <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redress.</b> Men are, however, necessarily involved in gender-equality reform. Gender inequalities are embedded in a multidimensional structure of relationships {{between women and}} men, which, as the modern sociology of gender shows, operates at every level of human experience, from economic ar-rangements, culture, and the state to interpersonal relationships and in...|$|E

In particular, {{with the use of a}} terminology belonging to the current law, without resorting to the specifications on the type of damage taken into consideration, I joined the school of thought that believes that the ultimate goal of a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redress</b> to the injured party from the non others is to compensate for any kind of damage, regardless of whether it is pecuniary or non-pecuniary. The structure of this research is divided into three chapters. The first chapter summarizes the main features of the system in the living law of non-pecuniary damage in contracting. A second chapter deals specifically and in detail the non-pecuniary damage in the Romanist doctrine.

40|$|The {{number of}} states, corporations, and {{religious}} groups formally disowning past records of egregious human injustice is mushrooming. Although the Age of Apology is a global phenomenon, the question of reparations—a tort-based mode of redress whereby a wrongdoing group accepts legal responsibility and compensates victims for the damage it inflicted upon them—likely consumes more energy, emotion, and resources in the U. S. {{than in any other}} jurisdiction. Since the final year of the Cold War, the U. S. and its political subdivisions have apologized or paid compensation to Japanese-American internees, native Hawaiians, civilians killed in the Korean War, and African American victims of medical experiments, racial violence, and lending discrimination; a barrage of lawsuits demanding reparations from slavery profiteers is on the dockets of several courts, and more are expected. In the U. S. circa 2004, reparations is the stuff not only of litigation but legislative proposals, academic and popular articles, news editorials, town hall meetings, campus demonstrations, television programs, office water cooler debates, dinner table conversations, and cyberchat groups. If reparations is not a uniquely American remedy, it is no stretch to say that in the U. S. 2 ̆ 2 reparations talk 2 ̆ 2 is very much with us. Still, although advocates maintain that reparations {{is the first step in}} recovering history and fashioning a more equitable collective future, critics describe a divisive and retrospective movement threatening to widen racial and ethnic fault lines running through the American body politic. Consequently, reparative justice is hotly contested on doctrinal, political, and practical grounds: opponents reject the notion of collective harm and responsibility for 2 ̆ 2 ancient wrongs, 2 ̆ 2 deny linkages between the relative socioeconomic status of aggrieved racial minority groups and past injustices, and cling to limiting doctrines that deny remedies for acts and omissions that were lawful centuries ago. Reparations thus fuels unresolvable debates over the nature of minority disenfranchisement, the adequacy of civil rights legislation, the constitutionality of group entitlements, the ideal racial distribution of socioeconomic power, and the appropriate channel to pilot between the pursuit of racial justice and the preservation of social peace. Moreover, because a successful reparations movement might awaken other dormant claims, reparations debates generate resistance and backlash. Nevertheless, even if it can be realized only at the price of social unrest and the painful reopening of old wounds, reparations may well be the appropriate remedy in the case of specific meta-wrongs, foremost among them slavery. A significant element in the slavery reparations claim is the lost value consequence of the unpaid labor extracted from slave ancestors and thus it is logical that, with few exceptions, proponents of slavery reparations equate the remedy with financial compensation. Although money cannot undo history, it can ameliorate the socioeonomic conditions of the descendants of former slaves, and money is the lodestar of most reparationists. However, justice is not a one-size-fits-all commodity, and the potential suitability of compensatory remedies to the harms absorbed by any particular group is not dispositive of, nor even instructive in regard to, the question of whether reparations is appropriate for other claimant groups. Slavery is not the sole, nor the first, nor even, arguably, the most egregious historical injustice for which the U. S. bears responsibility. Moreover, cash is not the primary, or even an important, objective of some aggrieved groups. Non-monetary modes of redress may be more effective in inducing the national government to accept moral responsibility, in restoring the dignity and autonomy of injured groups, and in healing, reconstituting, and relegitimizing the nation. In other words, the specific claims posed by each aggrieved group bear examination and evaluation on their unique merits. Although the interests of groups may converge on particular issues and proposals emerging in reparations debates, what suffices to make one group 2 ̆ 2 whole 2 ̆ 2 may be wholly inadequate for, or even harmful to, another. Prevailing theories of justice, even those drafted in good-faith with the intent that they be universally applicable or at least readily malleable in transit from one application to another, may in fact be so bounded by the cultures and worldviews in which they were incubated that they are unable to recognize, capture, and remedy all the injuries inflicted upon the aggrieved group. Without judging its value as a remedy in general, reparations, as well as other theories of justice sketched and pitched at a high level of abstraction but without a comprehensive analysis of the context and history of the claims of the particular group in question, may, when applied, be useless at best and damaging at worst. Just as all politics is local, so is all (in) justice. For the indigenous people who have inhabited, since time immemorial, the lands within the external borders of the U. S., remediation of historical injustice is a pressing issue. Despite this, reparations would fail to advance, and might even frustrate, important Indian objectives, primarily the reacquisition of the capacity to self-determine as autonomous political communities on ancestral lands. Because the immense injustice at the core of U. S. national history is neither broadly acknowledged nor deeply understood, Part I of this Article provide some historical foundation and briefly sketches the necessary factual predicate to the Indian <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redress.</b> Part II presents and evaluate several theories of justice with respect to this claim. Part III counters the shortcomings and omissions of these theories with an indigenist theory that propounds a program of land restoration and above all legislative reform intended to accord the full measure of relief to Indian claimants consistent with the requirements of justice for all individuals and groups...|$|E

40|$|The Polish Copyright Act {{provides}} {{for a number of}} <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> copyright protection, including pecumiary claims i. e. claims seeking money payment. There are two claims falling under this category in article 79 sections 1 and 2. The first of them is a claim to pay a multiple salary (double or, in cases of culpable violation, triple remuneration at the time of making the claim). The other one, payable to the Art Promotion Fund by the person who committed a violation within the business activity performed on his own or another person’s behalf, payable even to somebody else’s account in the amount of at least double the probable benefits incurred by the violating party {{as a result of the}} violation. The Act also mentions claims to return the benefits incurred and claims to redress injuries committed in a culpable act. These claims can have either a pecuniary or non-pecuniary character (return of benefits in kind or redressing injuries by restoration of the former state). Such interpretation of the character of these claims results from respective provisions of the Polish Civil Code concerning unjust enrichment (art. 405) and redressing injuries (art. 363), but this interpretation can also be applied to the currently binding Act, irrespective of the view concerning the relation between claims under the Act and claims under the Civil Code. In the doctrine there is a dispute whether the claim to return incurred benefit, which is secured by consecutive copyright acts can be considered an unjust enrichment claim as understood in the civil code or rather a separate claim different in nature. The civil code appears to emphasise the non-pecuniary character of the unjust enrichment <b>claim</b> and <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redressing</b> injuries, since it primarily quotes return in kind (art. 405) and redressing injuries by restoration of the former state (art. 363 § 1 sentence 1). It may appear, however, that in copyright cases <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> return of benefits incurred and <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redressing</b> injuries will never have a non-pecuniary form due to the intangible character of the protected good. This is not entirely the case, however. It has long been known that such a claim to return incurred benefits in kind is an adjudicative claim i. e. one that seeks an adjudication granting the copyright bearer the objects that were subject to violation. The preceding copyright acts mentioned only unlawfully produced copies of work but at present under art. 80 section 3 such a claim can be applied only to objects used for unlawful production of copies of work or any other objects other than copies of work that were used for the violation. However, this claim is presently classified by definition as a non-pecuniary claim to remove the results of the violation, despite the fact that there are no sufficient grounds <b>for</b> such a <b>claim</b> in the Act in the area o f economic rights. Although such grounds is sometimes seen in art. 80 section 5, this provision can also be treated as a procedural counterpart of adjudicative claim taken from the material law. Such an adjudicative claim, when interpreted as a claim to remove the results of the violation rather than, alternatively, a claim to return the benefits incurred, fails to have sufficient legal grounds in the Act. On the other hand, it may be argued that the category of a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redressing</b> injuries i. e. restitution claim includes a claim to render harmless, in particular to destroy the objects used for the purpose of unlawful production of copies of the protected work or any objects other than copies of the work that were used for the purpose of the violation. Also this claim seems to be a form of the by definition non-pecuniary claim to remove the results of the violation. Alternatively, it may also be seen as a (non-pecuniary) <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> desistence, clearly indicated in the Act among the claims available in cases of copyright violation (art. 79 section 1 in principio). It is therefore possible to include within the category of pecuniary claims only those <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> return of benefits or <b>for</b> <b>redressing</b> injuries that are based on a return of the benefit value and redressing injuries through payment, which will prove dominant in the case of copyright protection. With the above assumption the list of pecuniary claims resulting from the Copyright Act includes the following: • Claim to return benefits incurred, • Claim to pay multiple remuneration, • Claim to pay at least double probable benefit value; • <b>Claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>redressing</b> injuries. All the above claims can be accumulated except for the first two, which occur separately due to deeper historical reasons...|$|R

40|$|In 1995 Queen Elizabeth II went to New Zealand {{to sign a}} bill {{settling}} the restoration of land wrongfully taken from the Maori almost 150 years previously and to apologise solemnly for connected injustices. Possibly encouraged by this so-called Waikato-Raupatu Claims Settlement Bill, the Jamaican government demanded reparations from the British government in 2002 for damages incurred during the transatlantic slave trade in the nineteenth-century. This time, the demand was turned down by the British ad-ministration with the argument that governments today cannot take responsibility for what happened 150 years ago. Two diverging points of view both seem to make sense. On the one hand, the pas-sage of time does not lessen the cause for complaint.

40|$|In 1999 the Swedish Parliament {{decided to}} provide {{economic}} {{compensation to victims}} of involuntary sterilization, and in 2012 a similar law was enacted to redress neglect and abuse in foster homes and orphanages. This study explores the dilemmas that arise with reparations for past injustices, focusing on the process {{leading up to the}} reparation laws. Four themes are investigated: [1] state redress as the result of political action, [2] the identification and documentation of historical injustices, [3] how issues of responsibility were discussed and, [4] the juridification of redress. This study shows that it took approximately ten years for the first public <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>redress</b> to gain enough political momentum to yield results. In both cases governmental commissions were set up. However, the commissions used different methods and materials. Involuntary sterilizations were mainly investigated through re-interpretation of existing source material, whereas child abuse was primarily documented through interviews. The two commissions also differed in how they judged the past: the Inquiry on Sterilization employed a historicising approach, while the Inquiry on Child Abuse and Neglect in Institutions and Foster Homes employed a contemporary normative approach. In both cases the moral responsibility of the state to give redress was stressed, rather than any legal liability. Redress was granted ex gratia, i. e. as an act of grace, through temporary laws, rather than as an admis-sion of legally established wrongdoing. Deserving victims were to be identified through court-like procedures, which sparked a debate on how to uphold due process and what kind of evidence would be admissible and sufficient. Hence reparations for historical injustices carry many paradoxes {{that need to be addressed}} in future discussions on redress...|$|R
40|$|This article uses postcolonial {{theory to}} analyze the dynamic {{convergence}} of two significant international trends in Aotearoa New Zealand: the movement for reparations for historical colonial injustices, and the economic reform process known as ‘‘structural adjustment,’’ or Reaganomics in the United States, which was intended to produce a competitive nation of individual entrepreneurs. It argues that analysis of the interrelationships of law, ‘‘race,’’ gender, and nation in this convergence illuminates the reproduction and reshaping of colonial tropes, or historical racial configurations produced through colonization, in these current trends. In Aotearoa New Zealand, claims by indigenous Maori activists <b>for</b> self-determination and <b>redress</b> of historical injustices spurred the emergence of alternative imagined communities {{with the potential to}} transform the nation. These alternative visions for the nation were shaped and limited by the economic law and policy reform of structural adjustment, producing a new official nationalism of partnership, implemented in settlements of breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. These partnerships resulted in a new individual identity of Maori men as entrepreneurs in a competitive nation. It produced a symbolic alliance of men across race that silenced and erased Maori activists’ demands, and the leadership of Maori women, at the national level. The high profile partnerships, the erasure of Maori women, and relentless media attention to claims of sexism in Maori culture reproduced colonial tropes with images of the ‘‘progress’’ of the partnerships ‘‘saving’’ brown women from the sexism of brown men and ‘‘traditional’’ cultures. In this complex process the settlements were rational exercises of agency by the new Maori entrepreneurs with the goal of achieving economic autonomy, and worked to silence and erase the leadership of Maori women at the national level, even while women continued to be recognized as leaders at the local and regional levels. This analysis suggests that realization of the transformative potential of <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>redress</b> of historical racial injustices requires attention to the repetition of raced and gendered dynamics of imagined communities that shape and limit that potential...|$|R

Before the advent of colonialism, pastoral communities in Kenya governed their land through the communal land tenure system. The colonial government introduced the English property system replacing it with the communal land tenure system. The Maasai was one of the affected communities. They lost their land to the colonial government through the Anglo Maasai Agreement of 1904 and 1911. This study examines the Anglo Maasai Agreements of 1904 and 1911 during the colonial era {{and the manner in which}} it has disadvantaged the Maasai community as a result of land dispossession. It explores the Constitution of Kenya and other key legislations on past historical injustices. The methodology that was adopted was a review of the literature on land policies in Kenya in context of the historical injustices experienced by the Maasai community. The study makes proposals on how best to redress historical injustices by focusing on the National Land Commission that has been given the mandate to initiate investigations on historical injustices and recommend appropriate redress under Article 67 (2) (e) of the Constitution of Kenya. Despite there been legislation relating to the redress of historical land injustice, it is inadequate. This research seeks to give proposals and recommendations on how to improve the laws to cater for the protection of the Maasai land rights.
