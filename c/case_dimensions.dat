[...] Factory loads manufactured {{by any of the}} Sharps companies were mostly hand-loaded which made them expensive to produce. [...] This naturally invited competition. [...] Winchester offered the cartridge loaded [...]50/90/473 with paper patched bullets which may be how the cartridge came to be commonly known as the [...]50-90. [...] The [...]50-90 Sharps is similar to the [...]50-100 Sharps and [...]50-110 Sharps cartridges. [...] All three use the same [...] case, the latter two being loaded with more grains of black powder. All rifles made for the [...]50-90 Sharps should {{be able to use the}} [...]50-110 and [...]50-100 cartridges due to the <b>case</b> <b>dimensions</b> being nearly identical.|$|E

It's bullet and <b>case</b> <b>dimension</b> largely match the [...]45 Colt {{with the exception of}} its length. This is to accommodate a larger powder charge, essentially making it a magnum version of the [...]45 Colt.|$|R

5000|$|In 1912 Brenneke {{designed}} the commercially rather unsuccessful 8x64mm S cartridge. This cartridge {{is an example}} of a de novo rifle cartridge (the 8x64mm S has no other cartridge as parent case) intended as a ballistic upgrade option for the Mauser Gewehr 98 rifles that were then standard issue in the German military. The exteriour cartridge <b>case</b> <b>dimensions</b> like overall length and slightly larger case head diameter compared to the German 8×57mm IS military cartridge coupled with a moderate increase in maximum pressure were chosen with easy conversion of Gewehr 98 rifles for the 8x64mm S in mind. The German military chose however to stick to their 8×57mm IS rifle cartridge avoiding rechambering their service rifles for a cartridge that due to its more favourable bore area to case volume ratio ballistically would outperform the [...]30-06 Springfield cartridge of the United States Army.Brenneke’s engineering concept to enlarge exteriour cartridge <b>case</b> <b>dimensions</b> compared to the German 8×57mm IS military cartridge case coupled to an increase in maximum pressure to create new for those days very powerful cartridges was essentially sound and he persisted in the development of new cartridges along this line.|$|E

Since the [...]327 Federal Magnum still shares all <b>case</b> <b>dimensions,</b> excluding length, with the [...]32 S&W, [...]32 S&W Long, and [...]32 H&R Magnum, revolvers chambered for the [...]327 Federal Magnum can safely chamber and fire these shorter cartridges as well.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the two possible formulations of the F-functional calculus {{which are based}} on the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem in integral form and we introduce the pseudo F-resolvent equation.

50|$|Fire forming. This {{consists}} {{of taking the}} parent case, or a partially cold formed case, loading it with a light bullet and light load of powder, and firing it in the firearm {{it will be used}} in. Another technique uses a charge of fast burning powder topped with a case full of Cream of Wheat and a wad, to form a special blank cartridge that will expand the case. This technique is used for increasing <b>case</b> <b>dimensions,</b> such as pushing the neck forward, increasing the neck angle, or straightening the case walls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} as an improvement to the [...]50 BMG cartridge, a common machine gun and rifle cartridge. It is a wildcatted [...]50 BMG case, shortened to 3.27 in from its original length of 3.91 inches (99 mm) and necked down to accept a [...]416 caliber, 398 gr g projectile; however, the <b>case</b> <b>dimensions</b> are proprietary. Because the two cartridges, the [...]50 BMG and [...]416 Barrett, have identical base dimensions, {{all that is needed}} to convert a rifle to use one or the other cartridge is a relatively quick barrel swap.|$|E
