5|$|The {{two most}} popular Hannukah foods are potato pancakes, levivot, also known by the Yiddish latkes; and jelly doughnuts, known as sufganiyot in Hebrew, pontshkes (in Yiddish) or bimuelos (in Ladino), as these are deep-fried in oil. Hannukah pancakes are made {{from a variety of}} ingredients, from the {{traditional}} potato or <b>cheese,</b> <b>to</b> more modern innovations, among them corn, spinach, zucchini and sweet potato.|$|E
5|$|A further réchauffé, drawn principally from Mediterranean Food, Italian Food, French Provincial Cooking and An Omelette and a Glass of Wine. Sections are headed, Soups, Small dishes, Salads, Pasta, gnocchi & polenta, Rice, beans & lentils, Main dishes, Breads, and Desserts. Recipes {{range from}} aillade toulousaine (garlic and walnut sauce) and Angevin salad (lettuce and endive with Gruyère or Emmenthal <b>cheese)</b> <b>to</b> {{watercress}} and potato soup and zuppa pavese (bread and egg soup). The book was illustrated with photographs by Kristin Perers, {{and published by}} Quadrille.|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} {{are thought}} to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted the sausage in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did not specify the type of <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> be used.|$|E

5|$|The Wrington Vale line {{closed in}} 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic {{to the gas}} works ended, though there was some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not faring well either: the number of tickets sold along the line had {{decreased}} dramatically since the early 1900s, although {{there was still a}} significant flow of strawberries, milk and <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a private siding near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969.|$|E

25|$|A process {{similar to}} {{pasteurization}} is thermization, which uses lower temperatures to kill bacteria in milk. It allows a milk product, such as <b>cheese,</b> <b>to</b> retain {{more of the}} original taste, but thermized foods are not considered pasteurized by food regulators.|$|E

Charcuterie and {{chestnut}} flour are also produced in the commune. The mountains attract more and more visitors and tourism brings new resources to the people and creates jobs.|$|R
50|$|At the Edam cheese market, which unsurprisingly {{features}} Edam cheese, horse-drawn carriages {{and boats}} bring farmers' <b>cheeses</b> <b>to</b> the Jan van Nieuwenhuizen Square {{to be presented}} at the current weigh house, built in 1778.

25|$|O Monólogo do vaqueiro {{contains}} several elements clearly {{inspired by}} the Adoration of the Shepherds which takes place in accounts of Christ's birth. Its staging included offerings of simple and rustic gifts, such as <b>cheese,</b> <b>to</b> the future king, from whom great achievements were expected.|$|E
25|$|In {{the setting}} up of creameries the {{cooperative}} movement experienced its greatest success. Plunkett got farmers to join together to establish units to process and market their own butter, milk and <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> standards {{suitable for the}} profitable British market, rather than producing unhygienic, poor-quality output in their homes for local traders. This enabled farmers to deal directly with companies established by themselves, which guaranteed fair prices without middlemen absorbing the profits.|$|E
25|$|In 1754, the Dorfold Estate {{was sold}} to Nantwich lawyer James Tomkinson, {{originally}} from Bostock. The Chester to Nantwich branch of what later {{became known as the}} Shropshire Union Canal was completed in 1774, ending just north of the parish at Basin End; the Nantwich to Birmingham section was completed in 1835. The Tomkinson family objected to the route of the latter, leading to the construction of a half-mile embankment including an aqueduct to avoid the Dorfold Park. With the availability of canal and railway transport during the 18th and 19th centuries, the main produce of the area changed from <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> milk, and dairy became the major industry.|$|E

25|$|La Varenne is {{credited}} with bringing sauces out of the Middle ages with his publication and may well have invented hollandaise sauce. The French developed Isigny sauce, very similar to hollandaise, and named after the Norman town of Isigny-sur-Mer which produces the finest French butter. Isigny sauce is found in recipe books from the 19th century. However, the story that the sauce began to be called Hollandaise after WWI, when butter shortages forced imports from Holland, is clearly inaccurate. While the Norman butter helped the sauce reach a higher status, it actually dates back to when the Dutch sold butter and <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> Europe from cattle grazed on reclaimed sea land.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Walker had {{established}} the Kraft Walker Cheese Co. as {{a joint venture}} company with J.L. Kraft & Bros to market processed cheese and, following the failure of Parwill, in 1935 he used the success of Kraft Walker <b>Cheese</b> <b>to</b> promote Vegemite. In a two-year campaign to promote sales, Vegemite was given away free with Kraft Walker cheese products (with a coupon redemption) and {{this was followed by}} poetry competitions with imported American Pontiac cars being offered as prizes. Sales responded and in 1939 Vegemite was officially endorsed by the British Medical Association as a rich source of B vitamins. Rationed in Australia during World War II, Vegemite was included in Australian Army rations and by the late 1940s was used in nine out of ten Australian homes.|$|E
25|$|Harvest was in {{the late}} spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic Amorites from the {{northwest}} would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, {{they would have to}} pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.|$|E

5000|$|In late 2012 the Centre Party caused {{controversy}} in Norway when it emerged {{that the party}} had demanded higher import tariffs on meat and hard <b>cheeses</b> <b>to</b> protect Norwegian farmers from foreign competition. [...] This included increased duties of 429% on lamb, 344% on beef, and 277% on all but 14 exempted hard cheeses.|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} history of the {{philosophy}} of fondue since Aristotle so as to arrive at the formulation of the paradox of Swiss fondue. Either the wine and the <b>cheese</b> cease <b>to</b> exist (Buridan), but then the fondue is not really a mixture of wine and cheese. Or the wine and the <b>cheese</b> continue <b>to</b> exist. If they do, then either they continue to exist in different places (the chemists), but then a fondue can never be perfectly homogenous (it is a French fondue). Or the wine and the <b>cheese</b> continue <b>to</b> exist in the same place (the Stoïcs), but then wine and <b>cheese</b> have <b>to</b> be, oddly, penetrable and spatially expansible. Aristote attempted to solve this paradox by arguing that the cheese and wine continue to exist, but only potentially in the fondue. We sketch an alternative answer. The wine and the <b>cheese</b> continue <b>to</b> exist, but only non-spatially in the fondue. Wine and cheese, once mixed, become non-spatial constituents of the fondue, a bit like character traits are non-spatial constituents of persons. The wine and the cheese are in the fondue, but only the fondue is there in the fondue pot...|$|R
25|$|Bread {{products}} are consumed {{all around the}} country. The deeply rooted bread, pastry, and dessert-making tradition derives from blending the above nationalities' products. Bakeries sell not only a wide scope of breads, cookies, and cakes, but also pastries. The latter resembles a sort of roll pastry whose main dough ingredient is either butter or fat and which may be simple or stuffed with dulce de leche, milk, jam, crema pastelera, or quince or apple jelly, among other fillings. The most popular type of pastry {{is said to be}} that of medialunas, based upon French croissants. Furthermore, sandwiches de miga are another type of bread products; they are made only with thin layers of white bread (generally referred to as crustless bread) and stuffed with food items ranging from ham and <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> other more sophisticated combinations such as raw ham, tomatoes, olives, hard boiled eggs, tuna, lettuce, red pepper, and the like.|$|E

500|$|After {{taking a}} cheese making course at Washington State University, Dammeier decided {{he needed to}} hire someone {{to work with him}} as chief cheesemaker. He hired Brad Sinko, a microbiologist, who {{previously}} had managed his family cheese business of Bandon Cheese in Oregon, before it was acquired by the Tillamook County Creamery Association. According to Dammeier, the artisanal cheese market was underrepresented in Seattle and Washington, and he opened his business in part to encourage more cheese business to grow in the region. In 2000, Washington had nine licensed cheesemakers; this expanded to twenty-eight by 2007. Dammeier compared the growth he expects in artisan <b>cheese</b> <b>to</b> the United States' recent growth in sales of specialty beers: ...|$|E
