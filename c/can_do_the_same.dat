25|$|Hearthstone is a digital-only {{collectible}} {{card game}} that revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents (player vs. player or player vs. computer opponent) using pre-made decks of cards from their collection. In matches, players use their card deck, representing summonable minions, spells, and other actions, {{along with their}} selected Hero's unique power, to try to defeat their opponent by reducing their health to zero before the opponent <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to them. Players can choose {{from a number of}} game modes, with each offering a slightly different experience. Players start the free-to-play game with a limited collection of basic cards but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of cards through micropayments or as rewards from specific game modes. Blizzard has added new cards sets through Expansions and Adventures, roughly three times a year, to increase the pool of available cards. To help newer players remain competitive with experienced ones while also keeping the metagame dynamic, Blizzard has implemented two different styles of gameplay; Standard which uses only the basic set of cards plus those of the most recent expansions, and Wild, which allows any cards to be used.|$|E

Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|E

While former Norway international Jan Åge Fjørtoft was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: [...] "Comparing Ødegaard to Messi is nonsense from the media.

"Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and yet you call her a whore".

500|$|Critics adulated the {{character}} development of Rick Grimes, {{as well as}} the concluding scene of [...] "Nebraska".

She wrote: [...] "Mazzara wants to infuse some horror movie suspense back into the show and his intentions are evident in this scene. Even though I personally didn’t find it that tense, I appreciated the effort. It means that the show is trying to expand and become about something bigger." [...] Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre felt that Rick emulated Justified character Raylan Givens, and Halden commented that Rick was becoming [...] "something of a badass". Halden further praised the conclusion of the episode, calling it the series' best scenes. [...] "This {{is one of the best}} scenes I’ve seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past," [...] he opined. [...] "The tension builds naturally , the dialogue has actual subtext, and there’s a clear sense of risk here that never pauses to telegraph itself." [...] Meslow affirmed that the scene was an achievement for the writers. [...] "There are characters with new information ," [...] Meslow commented. [...] "There is dialogue with subtext [...] There is intriguing parallel plotting [...] And there's the surprisingly swift, violent dénouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for our hero, who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall appreciated James' performance, and opined that the scene was [...] "as suspenseful as any the show has ever done featuring actual monsters".|$|E

2500|$|This legend {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} ones in the history of drug testing, and is only partly true. [...] Consumption of vinegar will lower the pH (i.e. {{increasing}} the acidity) of the blood and urine, and drugs that contain amine groups (such as amphetamines) will be cleared out somewhat faster as their water solubility increases due to protonation. Also, the reduced pH can potentially throw off the pH-sensitive enzymes in a particular type of bioassay (EMIT) often (but not always) used as the initial screening test, even for non-amine-containing drugs such as THC. However, vinegar is not necessary to do so, as there are other things (such as high doses of vitamin C) that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, but without the almost inevitable diarrhea and vomiting that vinegar can produce after consuming large quantities. Saliva testing can be deterred with the use of vinegar—not to say drinking it, but merely washing out the mouth will throw off most saliva kits.|$|E

2500|$|As late as 1989, a team's ace {{reliever}} {{was called}} a fireman, coming to the rescue to [...] "put out the fire", baseball terminology for stopping an offensive rally with runners on base. They were occasionally referred to as short relievers, stoppers and closers. By the early 1990s, the top late-inning reliever {{was called a}} closer. The firemen came in whenever leads were in jeopardy, usually with men on base, and regardless of the inning and often pitching two or three innings while finishing the game. An {{example of this is}} that Goose Gossage had 17 games where he recorded at least 10 outs in his first season as a closer, including three games where he went seven innings. He pitched over 130 innings as a reliever in three different seasons. For their careers, Sutter and Gossage had more saves of at least two innings than saves where they pitched one inning or less. Fingers was the only pitcher who pitched at least three innings in more than 10 percent of his saves. The game evolved to where the best reliever was reserved for games where the team had a lead of three runs or less in the ninth inning. Mariano Rivera, considered one of the greatest closers of all time, earned only one save of seven-plus outs in his career, while Gossage logged 53. [...] "Don't tell me [...] the best relief pitcher of all-time until he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> job I did. He may be the best modern closer, but you have to compare apples to apples. Do what we did", said Gossage.|$|E

On 9 November 2008, Dacre gave {{a speech to the}} Society of Editors in which he was critical of the emerging pressures for privacy laws following the conclusion of the Max Mosley libel case against the News of the World and Mr Justice Eady's closing remarks. According to Dacre, Eady had [...] "effectively ruled that it was perfectly acceptable for" [...] Mosley [...] "to pay five women £2,500 to take part in acts of unimaginable sexual depravity with him" [...] which is [...] "the very abrogation of civilised behaviour of which the law {{is supposed to be the}} safeguard". Should the government want [...] "to force a privacy law", the bill would need to go through the parliamentary stages, [...] "withstand public scrutiny and win a series of votes", Dacre said. [...] "Now, thanks to the wretched Human Rights Act, one judge with a subjective and highly relativist moral sense <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> with a stroke of his pen". Referring to a case in 2006 where Eady had blocked the publication of a married man's account of his wife's seduction by a prominent figure involved in sport, Dacre said [...] "the judge - in an unashamed reversal of centuries of moral and social thinking - placed the rights of the adulterer above society’s age-old belief that adultery should be condemned".
