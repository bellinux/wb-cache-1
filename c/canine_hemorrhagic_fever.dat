40|$|Viral <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (VHFs) {{refer to}} a group of {{illnesses}} that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. In general, the term "viral hemorrhagic fever" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected). Characteristically, the overall vascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. These symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however, the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. While some types of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses, many of these viruses cause severe, life-threatening disease. The Special Pathogens Branch (SPB) primarily works with <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> viruses that are classified as biosafety level four (BSL- 4) pathogens.

Subjects were hospitalized pediatric patients with age ranging from one to 13 year old in pediatric ward at Pro£ Dr. R. D. Kandou Hospital, Manado, who had fever. Three milliliters of blood were taken from vein, and were divided for two tests which were routine blood analysis and thrombomodulin analysis.

Despite increasing knowledge about <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> viruses, {{little is known about}} the pathogenesis of Crimean-Congo <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever.</b> In this study, we measured serum adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase levels in Crimean-Congo <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> patients. METHODS: Serum adenosine deaminase levels were measured with a sensitive colorimetric method described by Giusti and xanthine oxidase levels by the method of Worthington in 30 consecutive hospitalized patients (mean age 42. 6 ± 21. 0). Laboratory tests confirmed their diagnoses of Crimean-Congo <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever.</b> Thirty-five subjects (mean age 42. 9 ± 19. 1) served as the control group. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase levels between cases and controls (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase levels were increased in patients with Crimean-Congo <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever.</b> Elevated serum xanthine oxidase activity in patients with Crimean-Congo <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> may be associated with reactive oxygen species generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system during inflammatory responses.
