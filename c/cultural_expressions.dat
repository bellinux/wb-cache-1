25|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> born in Sicily during the Bronze Age the cultures of Castelluccio (Ancient Bronze Age) and of Thapsos (Middle Bronze Age) are worth noting. Both originated in the southeastern part of the island. In these cultures, in particular in the Castelluccio phase, there are obvious influences from the Aegean Sea, where the Helladic civilization was flourishing.|$|E

Plays such as 'Pacha Mannu', which is about female infanticide/foeticide, has been produced by a women's theatre group in Tamil Nadu. This play was showing mostly in communities that practice female infanticide/foeticide and has led to a redefinition of a methodology of consciousness raising, opening up varied ways of understanding and subverting <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1985, at {{the first}} prehispanic {{societies}} meeting, {{in relation to the}} Chupícuaro culture it was noted, that Chupícuaro tradition ceramics manufacturing groups, should be considered part of Mesoamerican stratified societies, with a definite political and territorial structure and not as isolated village societies, lacking ceremonial centers and architecture. From that first impulse, subsequent social groups presented own <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions,</b> at regional level in the Mesoamerican context.|$|E

25|$|The Lebanese Renewal Party is ethnocentric, and {{believes}} that Lebanon is not an Arab country. It labored extensively to create or discover non-Arab <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions,</b> and {{went so far as}} to design a new alphabet for Lebanese Arabic, which it claims is a language in its own right. Accordingly, the party was staunchly opposed to Pan-Arabism, which was advocated by many in the left-wing Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and Palestinian movements.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Austrian times, {{when the}} size and amount of public parades or other <b>{{cultural}}</b> <b>expressions</b> corresponded to each cultural group's relative population, the Polish government emphasised the Polish nature {{of the city and}} limited public displays of Jewish and Ukrainian culture. Military parades and commemorations of battles at particular streets within the city, all celebrating the Polish forces who fought against the Ukrainians in 1918, became frequent, and in the 1930s a vast memorial monument and burial ground of Polish soldiers from that conflict was built in the city's Lychakiv Cemetery.|$|E
40|$|A 2007 PMLA article {{discussing}} the Walt Whitman Archive juxtaposed narrative and database as competing forms of <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> This article incited {{a flurry of}} responses which continued to use the database and narrative comparison. Dinin, in his article "Digital (In) Humanities," reassesses {{the terms of the}} digital archive debate, arguing that the terms "narrative" and "database" are both constricting and misleading. The juxtaposition shouldn't be database versus narrative to see which one becomes the dominant form of <b>cultural</b> <b>expression</b> because narrative, he argues, is a form of database. The more proper juxtaposition, as presented by the paper, is one that places "digital archive" alongside "narrative" because both are products of database and both are forms of <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> Dinin, in his article, then goes on to explore the potential of digital archives as a form of <b>cultural</b> <b>expression...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{search of}} a global vision on Indo culture and in a {{continued}} effort to resist assimilation Tjalie Robinson traveled to Latin America where he compared the Indo community with the racially mixed people of that continent.

He also sympathised with the philosophical writings of the Spanish essayist Jose Ortega y Gasset, an outspoken proponent of perspectivism and in 1961 even initiated the creation of an Indo enclave in Spain, named 'El Atabal'.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> {{were found}} in family gatherings and the church; both French and English {{cultures}} saw a long and early influence of ecclesiastical architecture, with Western European and American influences dominating rather than a particular vernacular sense. Poets produced the first important literary contributions in the province. Cousins Bliss Carman and Sir Charles G.D. Roberts found inspiration in the landscape, as would later writers as well. In painting, individual artists such as Anthony Flower worked in obscurity, either through design or neglect, while others such as Edward Mitchell Bannister left the province before ever developing a local influence.|$|E
25|$|As Erakat depicts {{in these}} anecdotes, the conflations and misconceptions of the west, {{that are a}} product of lack of {{representation}} {{of the reality of}} Arab women’s lives and experiences, as well as biased perspectives of what their <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> actually mean, lead to problematic conclusions for many westerners. It is easy to draw the conclusions that some of Erakat’s peers drew in these stories she tells, because they lack the insight into how the occupation of the Palestinian territories actually impacts the daily lives of women living in these areas. By assuming that their limited knowledge is sufficient, it leads to limited understanding of this extremely complex issue.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Latvia, like Estonia and Lithuania, was {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union. This occupation and the subsequent German invasion of 1941 ended all progress the Livonians had made in the preceding twenty years. All <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> were prohibited and just like twenty years before, {{the inhabitants of the}} Livonian Coast were driven from their homes. Most of them spent the war years in Riga or western Latvia, but some fled across the Baltic Sea to Gotland. The Curonian Peninsula was one of the areas where the Germans held out until the general capitulation of May 5, 1945, which meant there was not a house left standing when the Livonians returned home after the war.|$|E
25|$|As {{long ago}} as Biblical times, {{cultural}} and linguistic differences between Jewish communities, even within the area of Ancient Israel and Judea, are observed both within the Bible itself {{as well as from}} archeological remains. In more recent human history, an array of Jewish communities were established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another resulting in effective and often long-term isolation from each other. During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments; political, cultural, natural and populational. Today, manifestation of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture.|$|E
500|$|The late 20th century saw {{major changes}} to the {{politics}} of the United Kingdom with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales following pre-legislative referendums. Calls for greater autonomy for the four countries of the United Kingdom had existed since their original union with each other, but gathered pace in the 1960s and 1970s. Devolution has led to [...] "increasingly assertive Scottish, Welsh and Irish national identities", resulting in more diverse <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> of Britishness, or else its outright rejection: Gwynfor Evans, a Welsh nationalist politician active in the late 20th century, rebuffed Britishness as [...] "a political synonym for Englishness which extends English culture over the Scots, Welsh and the Irish".|$|E

500|$|One {{interpretation}} of the perspective of Rix {{is that she was}} an orientalist, in the sense used by academic Edward Said. However, Hoorn argues that she and her sister were to a significant extent counter-orientalist: they focussed on the common nature of human experience rather than <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> of difference and they sought to portray everyday life in Tangier as they found it, rather than presenting generalised views of the orient. Her works also reflected the modernist interest in the empirical: in using the bright light of north Africa to help bring out the structures and shapes that made up visual impressions. Stylistically, Rix's Moroccan paintings have been characterised as the [...] "most abstract, flat and post-impressionistic of her career". Whether this reflected the influence of Matisse is not known – despite the coincidences of their Tangier visits, it is not certain that they actually met. Rix {{was one of the first}} Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, represented by works such as Men in the Market Place, Tangier (1914) and View of Tangier (1914), produced at the time of a second visit to the city. Such works demonstrated the development of Rix's style at the time: loose brush strokes, a palette confined to a few low-keyed colours, and an emphasis on shadow and light, affecting both the overall impression made by the picture and the treatment of individual figures.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: IP Australia and the Office for the Arts (Cth) brochure, Finding the Way: a {{conversation}} with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People seeks feedback from Indigenous people to share stories and insights on future directions about Indigenous knowledge and intellectual property. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board (ATSIAB) of the Australia Council for the Arts promotes the recognition of Indigenous cultural and intellectual property {{and the importance of}} Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to control their cultural assets and knowledge. We are pleased to present this document with comments and suggestions to improve the current intellectual property law framework to better protect Indigenous knowledge and <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> Our submission will focus on the <b>cultural</b> <b>expression</b> and artistic applications of Indigenous Knowledge. Our paper discusses: 1. The rationale for future directions for greater recognition of Indigenous knowledge and <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> 2. The existing intellectual property framework in Australia. 3. Trade practices and misleading and deceptive conduct. 4. Contracts and enforceability. 5. Effectiveness of protocols – case study ATSIAB Art form protocols. 6. New law on the protection of Indigenous knowledge and <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> 7. The establishment of a National Indigenous Cultural Authority. There {{have been a number of}} significant reports that have canvassed this topic. See Appendix A for a list of main reviews and inquiries. Case studies on traditional knowledge and <b>cultural</b> <b>expression</b> and the IP framework are included at Appendix B...|$|R

2500|$|The {{confusion}} about the essential quality of archetypes can partly be attributed to Jung's own evolving ideas about them in his writings and his interchangeable {{use of the term}} [...] "archetype" [...] and [...] "primordial image".

2500|$|Adolescence (...) is a {{transitional}} stage {{of physical and}} psychological development that generally occurs {{during the period from}} puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority). Adolescence is usually associated with the teenage years, but its physical, psychological or <b>cultural</b> <b>expressions</b> may begin earlier and end later. For example, puberty now typically begins during preadolescence, particularly in females. Physical growth (particularly in males), and cognitive development can extend into the early twenties. Thus age provides only a rough marker of adolescence, and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence.|$|E
