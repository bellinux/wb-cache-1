25|$|Solazyme {{is one of}} {{a handful}} of {{companies}} which is supported by oil companies such as Chevron. Additionally, this company is also backed by Imperium Renewables, Blue Crest <b>Capital</b> <b>Finance,</b> and The Roda Group. Solazyme has developed a way to use up to 80% percent of dry algae as oil. This process requires the algae to grow in a dark fermentation vessel and be fed by carbon substrates within their growth media. The effect is the production of triglycerides that are almost identical to vegetable oil. Solazyme's production method is said to produce more oil than those algae cultivated photosynthetically or made to produce ethanol. Oil refineries can then take this algal oil and turn it into biodiesel, renewable diesel or jet fuels.|$|E
25|$|Determined to {{frustrate}} the capping order, Basildon {{announced at the}} end of February 1985 that it could evade it by setting up a limited company – Basildon Economic Development Corporation Ltd – through which the council would contract to pay grants of £140,000 to voluntary organisations. When it came to the budgeting meeting on 7 March 1985, a group of rebel Labour councillors pulled back from pressing the council to join the others in refusing to set a rate; instead the council set the rate at the limit allowed by the cap. The council leader Harry Tinworth claimed that the council had won the first round in a battle with the Government to preserve essential services. Later that month the council announced its plan to sell council mortgages to a merchant bank to raise <b>capital</b> <b>finance</b> to build sheltered homes for the elderly, also evading the cap.|$|E

Individual aspects of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> {{from the perspective}} of investors and also businesses are researched and evaluated in this work and formulated proposals for changes that may lead to the development of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> in the Czech Republic. This research is based on findings published in foreign scientific journals and own research. This dissertation has several scientific objectives. It is necessary to identify the evaluation criteria used by the investors to evaluate the proposed business plans. It is also important to research the nonfinancial added value and to determine the forms of support businesses receive from the investors. The final objective is to identify the limitations of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> in the Czech Republic. A list of recommendations that should improve the condi-tions of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> is formulated based on these identified limitations. Primary research was conducted with the help of questionnaires and interviews. Resulting qualitative data was evaluated with the help of Microsoft Excel. Thorough analysis of the qualitative data allowed the formulation of conclusions which {{can be found in the}} final part of this work.

2500|$|Its {{wholesale}} banking segment contains products sold to large- and middle-market commercial companies, {{as well as}} to consumers on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, treasury management, mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. One area that is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo <b>Capital</b> <b>Finance.</b> Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a [...] "real estate investment bank", but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States).|$|E
2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the national accounts system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful national accounts aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't tell them what they want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of <b>capital</b> <b>finance,</b> but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E

The data consist of primary and secondary data. The primary data are obtained through interviews with PMV (PT Sarana Aceh Ventura) and SMEs which are the PPU of the PMV.

The research shows that the distribution of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> in Banda Aceh is not effective as an alternative <b>capital</b> for SMEs. <b>Financing</b> provided by PMV in practice is equal to bank credit.

40|$|Venture {{capital is}} an {{important}} source of finance for small businesses although it is least understood. The VC financing market in Zimbabwe is inactive and mainly targets large companies instead of small to medium enterprises. The study sought to evaluate the role of venture capital as a source of finance for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Zimbabwe. The objectives of the study were to review the types of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> in Zimbabwe, identify the factors that drive the venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> and impact of venture capital on small business development. The study adopted a quantitative methodology in order to investigate the subject. Questionnaires were administered on respondents. The respondents were from the Zimbabwe Investment Authority, Ministry of Small to Medium Enterprises, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Small Enterprises Development Corporation and financial Institutions. An overall response rate of 89. 66 % was achieved. The study established that government was the main financier of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> in Zimbabwe. Further, stable economic environment, investor protection and corporate governance and well developed capital markets were found to be main determinants of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing.</b> The study also established that the role of venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> {{played an important role in}} the areas of employment creation, investment, export growth as well as innovation and creativity. Overall venture <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> is an alternative financing option for SMEs. However, the development of venture capital market is being constrained by the economic environment, lack of a vibrant capital market, no regulatory framework regards corporate governance and investor protection.
