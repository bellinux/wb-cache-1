5000|$|... 26 April 1923- 12 {{men died}} whilst {{travelling}} {{out of the}} mine {{the end of the}} day shift, when part of the journey of drams, in which they were riding suddenly careered back down the slope after a <b>connecting</b> <b>shackle</b> broke.|$|E
50|$|The {{corners of}} {{triangular}} sails are typically areas of high stress and consequently often have reinforced layers and tape radiating from, whether cross-cut or radial in construction. Their corners are always {{attached to a}} shackle, attached to a line or sparâ€”the halyard at the head, a shackle at the tack, and the outhaul at the clew. The <b>connecting</b> <b>shackle</b> runs through a grommet at each of these points. There are additional points where reinforcing and grommets may occur: at the cunningham, a downhaul used to flatten a mainsail (jibs may have a similar feature), and along {{the foot of a}} Genoa jib to allow a line to lift it out of the waves. The head of a triangular sail may have a rigid headboard riveted to it in order to transfer load from the sail to the halyard.|$|E
60|$|In broken {{water the}} boat would not carry all the chain; they must take it by fifteen-fathom lengths, and the <b>connecting</b> <b>shackles</b> had rusted fast. Kit thought nobody but Macallister could have knocked out the pins, but at length the cable was divided and they resumed their labour in the surf.|$|R
50|$|In {{a series}} of tests, {{successive}} scale model deployments of increasing sizes will be installed in increasingly challenging oceanic locations. According to Slat, The Ocean Cleanup performed controlled environment tests in 2015. A 100-metre segment went through a test in the North Sea, just {{off the coast of}} the Netherlands in the summer of 2016. After two months, the test was stopped, due to the failure of <b>shackles</b> <b>connecting</b> the boom to the mooring system.|$|R
500|$|A Lock Haven log boom, {{smaller than}} but {{otherwise}} {{similar to the}} Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport, was constructed in 1849. Large cribs of timbers weighted with tons of stone were arranged in the pool behind the Dunnstown Dam, named for a settlement on the shore opposite Lock Haven. The piers, about [...] from one another, stretched in {{a line from the}} dam to a point [...] upriver. <b>Connected</b> by timbers <b>shackled</b> together with iron yokes and rings, the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced floating logs. Workers called boom rats sorted the captured logs, branded like cattle, for delivery to sawmills and other owners. Lock Haven became the lumber center of Clinton County and the site of many businesses related to forest products.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{blackout}} was {{traced back to the}} Otahuhu sub-station, the city's main transmission switching station. A corroded <b>shackle</b> <b>connecting</b> the Otahuhu to Penrose 220 kV line's earth wire had dislodged in 90 km/h winds, letting the earth wire fall across the 220 kV line and the 110 kV busbar below it, tripping both the line and three sections of the busbar, disconnecting lines to Mount Roskill, Penrose and Pakuranga. The trip also disconnected Otahuhu B and Southdown power stations from the national grid. The trip left only one line, the now-dismantled Arapuni to Pakuranga 110 kV line, supplying Pakuranga, Penrose, and the central city. Eight seconds after the failure, this line tripped from overloading, leaving Penrose, Pakuranga, and central city substations without power, as well as parts of Otahuhu and Mount Roskill substations.|$|R
40|$|An {{emergency}} {{spin recovery}} parachute is presented that is housed within a centrally mounted housing on the aft {{end of an}} aircraft and connected to a ring fitting within the housing. Two selectively latching <b>shackles</b> <b>connected</b> to separate towlines are openly disposed adjacent the ring fitting. The towlines extend in opposite directions from the housing along the aircraft wing to attachment points adjacent the wing-tips where {{the other end of}} each towline is secured. Upon pilot command, one of the open shackles latches to the ring fitting to attach the towline connected thereto, and a second command signal deploys the parachute. Suitable break-away straps secure the towlines to the aircraft surface until the parachute is deployed and the resulting force on the towline attached to the parachute overcomes the straps and permits the towline to extend to the point of attachment to exert sufficient drag on the spinning aircraft to permit the pilot to regain control of the aircraft. To employ the parachute as a drag chute to reduce landing speeds, both shackles and their respective towlines are latched to the ring fitting...|$|R
