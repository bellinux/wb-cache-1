In Siam, the British recognised a French {{sphere of influence}} {{to the east of}} the River Menam's basin; in turn, the French recognised British influence over the territory {{to the west of the}} Menam basin. Both parties <b>disclaimed</b> any idea <b>of</b> annexing Siamese territory. The British withdrew their objection to the French introducing a tariff in Madagascar. The parties came to an agreement which would [...] "put an end to the difficulties arising from the lack <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over the natives of the New Hebrides".|$|R
50|$|De Veau had further {{argued that}} the passage in 1959 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) also preempted the interstate compact.

Passage of Title V of the LMRDA, Frankfurter wrote, shows just the opposite—that Congress did not find state restrictions {{on the right to}} hold union office incompatible with pre-1959 federal labor policies. Furthermore, Frunkfurter interpreted Section 504(a) and Section 603(a) of the LMRDA as specifically <b>disclaiming</b> <b>of</b> preemption of state laws regulating union officials (which only a few, limited, express exceptions).|$|R
40|$|When private {{international}} law lawyers discuss jurisdiction, focus is typically placed primarily on personal jurisdiction, and secondarily on subject matter jurisdiction. This article seeks to demonstrate {{that there is a}} third matter – what we can call scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> or perhaps scope <b>of</b> remedial <b>jurisdiction</b> – that needs to be considered. Scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> relates to the appropriate geographical scope of orders rendered by a court that has personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction. This question has gained far less attention to date. This article highlights why scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is <b>of</b> particular importance in today 2 ̆ 7 s society dominated by constant, substantial and fluid cross-border interaction online, and discusses whether scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is a separate issue or merely a sub-component of some other concept.

40|$|The 1968 Judgments Convention is a {{significant}} element in achieving an internal market within Europe, promoting as it does the ‘free movement of judgments’. By harmonizing the rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> it has been possible for the Convention to minimize the grounds for refusal to recognize a judgment. However {{the process by which}} the rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and recognition were formulated has certain weaknesses. In particular, the rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> are derived from national rules with a long history, dating back to times when patterns of commerce were entirely different. These rules have either been little used in international disputes (because more exorbitant rules exist as an alternative) or have been interpreted {{in such a way as}} to permit a wide exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> It is not self-evident that they will achieve an appropriate allocation <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> between Contracting States. Moreover the use of legal concepts as jurisdictional connecting factors gives rise to a lack of transparency which may cloak a ‘homeward trend’ in interpretation by national courts...|$|R
