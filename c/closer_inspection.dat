5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon <b>closer</b> <b>inspection,</b> it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E

25|$|Diagonal horn – This simple {{dual-mode}} horn superficially {{looks like}} a pyramidal horn with a square output aperture. On <b>closer</b> <b>inspection,</b> however, the square output aperture is seen to be rotated 45° relative to the waveguide. These horns are typically machined into split blocks and used at sub-mm wavelengths.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} as to {{the identity of the}} Younger Lady mummy. Upon finding the mummy, Victor Loret initially believed it be that of a young man as the mummy's head had been shaved. A <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> later made by Dr. Grafton Elliot Smith confirmed that the mummy was that of a female, although Loret's original interpretation persisted for many years.|$|E
25|$|For {{another two}} weeks, Sea Devil {{remained}} in the area, looking for and sinking naval mines. On 27August, she sighted a fishing vessel near a mine. <b>Closer</b> <b>inspection</b> showed that the fisherman was using the mine as a buoy and had secured his net to the mine horns. On 28August, the submarine was ordered to Guam, then diverted to Subic Bay, where she arrived on 3September.|$|E

25|$|About 20–25% of {{patients}} with Graves' disease will suffer from clinically obvious Graves' ophthalmopathy, and {{not just from the}} eye signs of hyperthyroidism. Only 3 to 5% will develop severe ophthalmopathy. However, when subjected to <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> (e.g. by magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits) many more patients have evidence of ophthalmopathy. It is estimated that for every 100,000 persons, 16 women and 3 men have Graves' ophthalmopathy every year.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{issue number}} 2 above one can {{consider}} so-called weave states. Ordinary measurements of geometric quantities are macroscopic, and planckian discreteness is smoothed out. The fabric of a T-shirt is analogous. At a distance it is a smooth curved two-dimensional surface. But a <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> {{we see that}} it is actually composed of thousands of one-dimensional linked threads. The image of space given in LQG is similar, consider a very large spin network formed by {{a very large number of}} nodes and links, each of Planck scale. But probed at a macroscopic scale, it appears as a three-dimensional continuous metric geometry.|$|E
25|$|On the {{simplest}} level, Hogarth portrays {{the inhabitants of}} Beer Street as happy and healthy, nourished by the native English ale, and {{those who live in}} Gin Lane as destroyed by their addiction to the foreign spirit of gin; but, as with so many of Hogarth's works, <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> uncovers other targets of his satire, and reveals that the poverty of Gin Lane and the prosperity of Beer Street are more intimately connected than they at first appear. Gin Lane shows shocking scenes of infanticide, starvation, madness, decay and suicide, while Beer Street depicts industry, health, bonhomie and thriving commerce.|$|E

25|$|A popular {{demonstration}} {{involves the}} bounce of multiple stacked balls. If {{a tennis ball}} is stacked {{on top of a}} basketball, {{and the two of them}} are dropped at the same time, the tennis ball will bounce much higher than it would have if dropped on its own, even exceeding its original release height. The result is surprising as it apparently violates conservation of energy. However, upon <b>closer</b> <b>inspection,</b> the basketball does not bounce as high as it would have if the tennis ball had not been on top of it, and transferred some of its energy into the tennis ball, propelling it to a greater height.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} arts that are {{native to the}} Nashi People, such as the rarely seen Nashi {{handmade}} embroidery, Dongba painting, Dongba wooden carving and so on. Much of the wood carving that characterizes Nashi houses are made by Bai craftsmen today. Absorbing architectural styles of the Han, Nashi houses are built in a standard Han style of one courtyard with one, two, three or four buildings around it, sometimes with linked adjoining courtyards. The mud brick and wood structures at first sight {{have been described as}} crude and simple in appearance, but a <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> reveals elaborate and delicate patterns on casements and doors, elegant pillars and pillar supports, and a very comfortable and airy living environment.|$|E
25|$|However {{ten minutes}} after taking off, {{two of the}} Puma {{helicopters}} were directed to return to Cassinga, as it was feared {{that some of the}} paratroopers might have been left behind. They spotted a group of people huddled together, but <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> revealed that they were the prisoners who had been left behind. The helicopters flew a total of four low passes looking for paratroopers, when one of the helicopter pilots spotted a Cuban tank appearing from the bushes. He warned the other Puma pilot, who was able to bank away just in time so that the tank round missed the aircraft. No paratroopers were found and the two Pumas returned to the HAA. The dismantling of the HAA continued {{throughout the rest of the}} day.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which on <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{bombing of}} the 13th-century Orthodox monastery Sveti Atanasij {{in the village of}} Lesok is {{considered}} a war-crime by some. However, no one has ever claimed responsibility for the attack and Albanian guerrilla officials have dismissed all responsibility and placed the blame on Macedonian special forces, saying it was another poor attempt to link the NLA to Islamic extremism. However, upon <b>closer</b> <b>inspection,</b> it was discovered that near the rubble that had once {{been one of the most}} revered religious sites for the Macedonian Orthodox Church, there lay a dead donkey, its bloated body daubed with red paint spelling out the letters UÇK, the Albanian abbreviation for the rebel National Liberation Army. This incident is disputed to this day and the monastery is now under-going reconstruction. On the other hand, the Macedonian forces themselves destroyed a mosque in the village of Neprosteno. The mosque was rebuilt in 2003 with funding from the EU.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline in}} per capita income growth {{at the end of}} the 18th century may appear as a counterargument against the modernity of the Dutch economy. However, at <b>closer</b> <b>inspection</b> this was {{actually}} a modern process of restructuring in the face of adverse circumstances, as may be seen in current modern economies, like the United States and European countries, that also undergo major structural upheavals. The 18th-century deindustrialization was in large part a consequence of a too-high real wage level, combined with protectionist policies of foreign governments, closing access to major markets. The agricultural depression was a general European phenomenon. The crisis in foreign trade was answered, and partly parried, with commercial innovations. The financial and fiscal crisis that proved the Republic's undoing was altogether modern in nature (unlike the comparable crises that regularly brought the Spanish Crown to its knees), but simply happened before the modern means of dealing with it (expansion of the tax base and/or monetary inflation) were at hand.|$|E
