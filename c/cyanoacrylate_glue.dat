50|$|If {{closure of}} a wound is decided upon {{a number of}} {{techniques}} can be used. These include bandages, a <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue,</b> staples, and sutures. Absorbable sutures have the benefit over non absorbable sutures of not requiring removal. They are often preferred in children. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes the injection less painful.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} implementations, starch and gypsum plaster fill the powder bed, the liquid [...] "binder" [...] being mostly water {{to activate the}} plaster. The binder also includes dyes (for color printing), and additives to adjust viscosity, surface tension, and boiling point to match print head specifications.

50|$|<b>Cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue</b> {{has a low}} {{shearing}} strength, {{which has}} led to its use as a temporary adhesive in cases where the piece needs to be sheared off later. Common examples include mounting a workpiece to a sacrificial glue block on a lathe, and tightening pins and bolts. It is also used in conjunction with another, slower, but more resilient adhesive as way of rapidly forming a joint, which then holds the pieces in the appropriate configuration until the second adhesive has set.|$|E

50|$|Patients with {{bleeding}} gastric varices {{can present}} with bloody vomiting (hematemesis), dark, tarry stools (melena), or rectal bleeding. The bleeding may be brisk, and patients may soon develop shock. Treatment of gastric varices can include injection of the varices with <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue,</b> or a radiological procedure {{to decrease the}} pressure in the portal vein, termed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or TIPS. Treatment with intravenous octreotide is also useful to shunt blood flow away from the stomach's circulation. More aggressive treatment including splenectomy (or surgical removal of the spleen) or liver transplantation may be required in some cases.|$|E
50|$|When {{added to}} baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue</b> forms a hard, {{lightweight}} adhesive filler (baking soda is first used {{to fill a}} gap then the adhesive is dropped onto the baking soda). This works well with porous materials that do not work well with the adhesive alone. This method is sometimes used by aircraft modelers to assemble or repair polystyrene foam parts. It is also used to repair small nicks in the leading edge of composite propeller blades on light aircraft. The reaction between cyanoacrylate and baking soda is very exothermic (heat-producing) and also produces noxious vapors. See Reaction with cotton and wool below.|$|E
50|$|Strain gauges are {{attached}} to the substrate with a special glue. The type of glue depends on the required lifetime of the measurement system. For short term measurements (up to some weeks) <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue</b> is appropriate, for long lasting installation epoxy glue is required. Usually epoxy glue requires high temperature curing (at about 80-100 °C). The preparation of the surface where the strain gauge is to be glued is of the utmost importance. The surface must be smoothed (e.g. with very fine sand paper), deoiled with solvents, the solvent traces must then be removed and the strain gauge must be glued immediately after this to avoid oxidation or pollution of the prepared area. If these steps are not followed the strain gauge binding to the surface may be unreliable and unpredictable measurement errors may be generated.|$|E
5000|$|Ethyl {{cyanoacrylate}} (ECA), a cyanoacrylate ester, is an {{ethyl ester}} of 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid. It is a colorless liquid with low viscosity and a faint sweet smell in pure form. It {{is the main}} component of <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glues</b> and can be encountered under many trade names. Super glue is believed to be ECA. The makers of Krazy Glue state on their website, [...] "The chemical name for Krazy Glue is ethyl cyanoacrylate." [...] Mercury Adhesives is an example of an American made ECA. [...] It is soluble in acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, nitromethane, and methylene chloride. ECA polymerizes rapidly in presence of moisture.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue's</b> {{ability to}} resist water {{has made it}} popular with marine {{aquarium}} hobbyists for fragging corals. The cut branches of hard corals such as Acropora can be glued {{to a piece of}} live rock (harvested reef coral) or Milliput (epoxy putty) to allow the new frag to grow out. It is safe to use directly in the tank, unlike silicone, which must be cured to be safe. However, as a class of adhesives, traditional cyanoacrylates are classified as having [...] "weak" [...] resistance to both moisture and heat although the inclusion of phthalic anhydride reportedly counteracts both of these characteristics.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} male patient who {{underwent}} bronchoscopic instillation of glue to control moderate hemoptysis which later {{led to the}} development of postobstructive pneumonia and extensive foreign body reaction in the bronchial wall and the lung distal to the glue application. He continued to have intermittent hemoptysis and underwent bronchial artery embolization. However, recurrent moderate hemoptysis eventually led to pneumonectomy, which showed severe foreign body reaction in bronchi- and post-obstructive changes in the lung parenchyma and the draining lymph nodes. This case highlights a serious complication of intrabronchial <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>gluing</b> to control bleeding in hemoptysis, which might warrant its very cautious use in moderate hemoptysis although surgical modality is considered the definitive treatment in life-threatening hemoptysis...|$|R
5000|$|Bleeding, {{also known}} as hemorrhaging or haemorrhaging, is blood {{escaping}} from the circulatory system. Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina or anus, or through {{a break in the}} skin.Hypovolemia is a massive decrease in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination. Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10-15% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison, blood donation typically takes 8-10% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and {{is an important part of}} both first aid and surgery.The use of <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue</b> to prevent bleeding and seal battle wound was designed and first used in the Vietnam War.

5000|$|Set Decorator Roger Christian {{found the}} handles for the Graflex Flash Gun in a {{photography}} shop in Great Marlborough Street, in London's West End. He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue.</b> Adding a few [...] "greebles" [...] (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. George Lucas {{decided he wanted}} to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where Star Wars filming began. It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of an open globe injuries may be determined by clinical examination and CT. However, full globe exploration with 360-degree removal of the conjunctiva (periotomy), separation of the rectus muscles, and subsequent examination of the sclera remains {{the most effective way}} to determine whether or not the globe has been injured. During exploratory surgery, foreign debris may be removed with microsurgical tools by inspection under the operating room microscope. Globe lacerations are typically repaired as far posteriorly as possible to prevent any further deficits in visual acuity. Lacerations posterior to the exposed area are not sutured; attempts to seal these injuries often results in the extrusion of intraocular components. Healing of these injuries occurs naturally by scarring of dorsal orbital fat to the sclera. If a clinically significant increase in intraocular pressure is detected with orbital compartment syndrome, the ophthalmologist may perform an emergency canthotomy on the lateral canthus. Canalicular injuries, as well as lid lacerations, are also commonly repaired in the military hospital setting. Suturing the laceration after the removal of foreign bodies depends on the location of global fissure: 10-0 nylon with <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue</b> is commonly used on the cornea, and processed human pericardium may be employed if it is surgically available. Globe closure of the limbus and sclera requires 9-0 and 8-0 nylon, respectively.|$|E

A series of cyanoacrylate monomers with a flexible ether linkage and varying side-chain lengths was synthesized and characterized for potential use as tissue adhesives. The effect of side-chain length on synthesis yield, physical and mechanical properties, formaldehyde generation, cytotoxicity in vitro and biocompatibility in vivo were examined. The incorporation of etheric oxygen allowed the production of flexible monomers with good adhesive strength. Monomers with longer side-chains were found to have less toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Polymerized hexoxyethyl cyanoacrylate was more elastic than its commercially available and widely used alkyl analog 2 -octyl cyanoacrylate, without compromising biocompatibility.

40|$|<b>Cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glues</b> {{have been}} used in various {{surgical}} specialties for primary wound closure or as a supplement to other methods. We assessed the overall results and safety of this technique following primary hip arthroplasty. Ninety-three patients undergoing primary total hip replacement were studied. The surgical wound had been closed with subcuticular vicryl followed by the application of topical dermabond adhesive, without any additional dressings. The mean follow-up was 7. 2 months. One patient suffered wound dehiscence on the third post opera-tive day. Two patients had serous oozing from the wound for the initial 3 - 4 days. This technique provides an immediate water tight seal in a sterile operative environment and provides a barrier to micro organisms. It has good tensile strength, aesthetic value and patient satisfaction...|$|R

5000|$|Cyanoacrylate (Crazy glue, Superglue, CA or CyA) is used {{mainly for}} small repairs, {{especially}} by woodturners. It bonds instantly, including to skin. Cured CA {{is essentially a}} plastic material. Versions are available {{that are able to}} wick into tight joints but bond with reduced strength (because much drips out and much soaks into the wood leaving very little on the surface for the bond), or thicker formulations (gel) which can fill very small gaps, do not flow out of the joint, and do not soak so quickly into wood. Thinner <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glue</b> does not bond more quickly nor form shorter polymer chains than the gel version when used on wood. The chemical nature of wood significantly delays polymerization of cyanoacrylate. When it finally polymerizes in a wood joint, enough gel remains for a better bond than with the thin version. When using the gel, too much glue will weaken the resulting bond. Likewise, applying too little of the thin super glue will result in almost no glue at all remaining in a wood joint, causing a weak bond or no bond at all. Versions are also available that are foam safe (regular CA dissolves most plastic foams) which are usually also marketed as low odor. Cyanoacrylate is stiff but has a low shear strength (brittle) thus normal wood bending can break the bond in some applications. Often, too much adhesive is applied which leads to a much weaker bond. CA has quickly become the dominant adhesive used by builders of balsa wood models, where its strength far exceeds the base materials.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Bleeding {{and wound}} {{infection}} {{are the most}} common complications of circumcision. <b>Cyanoacrylate</b> tissue <b>glue</b> has been claimed to have the advantage of being haemostatic, bacteriostatic and easy to use. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the feasibility of using the tissue glue in approximation of circumcision wound in children. METHODOLOGY: A prospective randomized trial was carried out on 86 boys consecutively admitted into the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital, Hong Kong. The results of wound approximation with <b>cyanoacrylate</b> tissue <b>glue</b> and suturing with interrupted 4 / 0 plain catgut were compared. The operations were carried out by the same surgeon using identical technique except for the wound approximation. The wound was assessed 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the rates of wound inflammation, infection, bleeding, dehiscence and cosmetic appearance, but the duration of operation was longer using tissue glue (19. 8 min vs 16. 5 min, P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that tissue glue approximation of circumcision wounds in children is a feasible alternative, but it offers no extra advantage when compared to suturing...|$|R

Three patients who underwent augmented trabeculectomy with mitomycin C with early bleb leak between January 2009 and June 2010 were reviewed. Case 1 and Case 2 exhibited bleb leak on postoperative Day 1 and Case 3 showed leak on follow-up at postoperative Day 7. Case 1 was successfully sealed with CATG at postoperative Day 3, after failed pressure padding and bandage contact lens. Case 2 was successfully sealed with CATG at postoperative Day 3, after failed pressure padding and conjunctiva flap resuturing. In Case 3, the leaking conjunctival flap was managed with combined techniques of resuturing and applying CATG at postoperative Day 9, after failed pressure padding. During leakage, the intraocular pressure was low (6 – 8 mmHg) {{in all three}} cases, with shallow anterior chamber depth and absence of other complications such as choroidal detachment, hypotony maculopathy, or endophthalmitis.

40|$|Background Cough-variant asthma (Corrao’s syndrome) {{is defined}} as the {{presence}} of chronic non-productive cough in patients with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and response to bronchodilator ther-apy. This variant of asthma may present a diagnostic problem in occupational medicine. Aims To describe additional evaluation of cough-variant asthma in a cyanoacrylate-exposed worker in whom standard diagnostic testing was negative. Methods A female beautician was evaluated for suspected occupational allergic rhinitis and asthma. A specific inhalation challenge test (SICT) was performed with <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>glues</b> used for applying artifi-cial eyelashes and nails. Spirometry and peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements were recorded hourly for 24 h; methacholine challenge testing was performed and nasal lavage (NL) samples were analysed for eosinophilia. Results After SICT, the patient developed sneezing, nasal airflow obstruction and cough. Declines in forced expiratory volume in 1 s and PEF were not observed. Eosinophil proportions in NL fluid increased markedly at 4 and 24 h after SICT. A significant increase in BHR also occurred 24 h after SICT. Conclusions Clinical symptoms, post-challenge BHR and increased NL eosinophil counts confirmed a positive response to SICT and validated the diagnosis of cough-variant occupational asthma. SICT may be useful in cases where history and clinical data suggest cough-variant asthma and spirometric indices are negative.
