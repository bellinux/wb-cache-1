5|$|While in Trujillo, <b>Cortés</b> {{received}} messengers from Papayeca, a large native town some seven leagues away, and Champagua (now {{known as}} Chapagua), another nearby town. Both of these settlements were inhabited by Nahuas. <b>Cortés</b> recorded {{the names of}} two Nahua rulers as Pizacura and Mazatl. Pizacura resisted Cortes' overtures and refused to swear fealty; <b>Cortés</b> sent Spanish cavalry and infantry, accompanied by {{a great number of}} Indian auxiliaries. They launched a night attack upon Pizacura's village in the Agalta valley, and captured the Nahua leader with a hundred of his people. The majority were enslaved, while Pizacura was held as a prisoner with two other nobles, and a young man whom <b>Cortés</b> suspected of being the true leader of his people. Pizacura claimed that his resistance was instigated by Mazatl, who opposed peace with the Spanish invaders. <b>Cortés</b> captured Mazatl and asked him to order his subjects to return to their abandoned villages. Mazatl refused, so <b>Cortés</b> hanged him in Trujillo.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cortés</b> {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} Aj Kan Ek', {{the king of the}} Itza, to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his departure from Nojpetén, <b>Cortés</b> left behind a cross and a lame horse. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén. From the lake, <b>Cortés</b> continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, <b>Cortés</b> turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cortés</b> {{arrived in}} Honduras in 1525, {{bringing}} livestock with him. <b>Cortés</b> claimed jurisdiction over Honduras, although its extent was still unknown. He rapidly imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. <b>Cortés</b> then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, and half of the Spanish settlers rapidly succumbed to disease. With the permission of <b>Cortés,</b> the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had securely established a Spanish presence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cortés</b> found {{affairs in}} Trujillo to be {{satisfactory}} since {{the departure of}} Moreno, and sent letters to Santo Domingo {{in an effort to}} obtain their recognition of his jurisdiction over the colony. He dispatched ships to Cuba and Jamaica to bring supplies, including domestic animals and plants for cultivation. <b>Cortés</b> sent his cousin Hernando de Saavedra inland, and he overcame local resistance to bring several well-populated districts under Spanish control. Indigenous leaders travelled from far and wide to pledge allegiance to <b>Cortés,</b> whom they considered to be more fair in his dealings than other Spanish captains. With the application of diplomacy, moderate treatment of the natives, and the judicious application of force, <b>Cortés</b> tightened the Spanish grip over Honduras.|$|E

Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which <b>Cortés</b> was able to communicate with the Aztecs.

5|$|Hernán <b>Cortés</b> only {{received}} sporadic {{reports of}} developing events in Honduras, and became impatient for its incorporation into his command.

En route, he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. During the arduous journey from Lake Petén Itzá to Lake Izabal, both now in Guatemala, <b>Cortés</b> lost many men and horses. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, where he found the near-starving remnants of González Dávila's colonists, who received him joyfully. <b>Cortés</b> waited there {{for the rest of}} his army to regroup over the next week, and explored the local area for supplies. By this time the remnants of Cortés' expedition were reduced to a few hundred. <b>Cortés</b> sent some of González Dávila's colonists south to the Naco Valley, which was swiftly pacified under the command of Gonzalo de Sandoval, one of Cortés' lieutenants. <b>Cortés</b> then abandoned attempts to colonise Nito, and sailed to Puerto de Caballos with his entire company.|$|E

5|$|The {{explorer}} Hernán <b>Cortés</b> and his {{men were}} familiar with the book; <b>Cortés</b> quoted it in 1524. As governor of Mexico he sent out an expedition of two ships, one guided by the famous pilot Fortún Ximénez who led a mutiny, killing the expedition's leader, Diego Becerra, and a number of sailors faithful to Becerra. After the mutiny, Ximénez continued sailing north by northwest and, in early 1534, landed at what is known today as La Paz, Baja California Sur. Ximénez, who reported pearls found, believed the land was a large island. He and his escort of sailors were killed by natives when they went ashore for water. The few remaining sailors brought the ship and its story back to <b>Cortés.</b> There is some dispute whether the land was named at this time—no record exists of Ximénez giving it a name. In 1535, <b>Cortés</b> led an expedition back to the land, arriving on May 1, 1535, a day known as Santa Cruz de Mayo, and in keeping with methods of contemporary discoverers, he named it Santa Cruz. It is not known who first named the area California but between 1550 and 1556, the name appears three times in reports about <b>Cortés</b> written by Giovanni Battista Ramusio. However, the name California also appears in a 1542 journal kept by explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who used it casually, as if it were already popular. In 1921, California historian Charles E. Chapman theorized that Ximénez named the new land California but the name was not accepted by <b>Cortés</b> because Ximénez was a mutineer who killed Becerra, a kinsman of <b>Cortés.</b> Despite this, the name became the one used popularly by Spaniards, the only name used by non-Spaniards, and by 1770, the entire Pacific coast controlled by Spain was officially known as California. The Spanish speaking people who lived there were called Californios.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{made its}} first {{landfall}} at Cozumel, and <b>Cortés</b> remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them.

Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Cortés' interpreter.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when {{he crossed}} {{a part of}} the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with an {{expedition}} headed by Hernán <b>Cortés,</b> that crossed from the Gulf of Mexico to Honduras. Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the Acala Ch'ol; he was unable to locate <b>Cortés,</b> and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan (modern Santa Eulalia in Guatemala), in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch'ol. The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent to summon the natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After failing to locate <b>Cortés,</b> the Alvarados returned to Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan {{fell to the}} Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán <b>Cortés</b> {{to declare}} their {{allegiance}} to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 <b>Cortés</b> sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the King of Spain. But Cortés' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were harassing Spain's allies in the region. <b>Cortés</b> despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.|$|E
