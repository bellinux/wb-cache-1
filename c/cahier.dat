40|$|This paper shows, {{from the}} {{consumer}} budget constraint, that the consumption spending {{and the different}} components of total wealth, i. e. financial, housing and human wealths, are cointegrated and that deviations from the common trend <b>cahy</b> is a proxy for the consumption-wealth ratio that should predict expected returns on financial assets and housing. Using U. S post-war data, we provide empirical evidence {{in favor of the}} existence of a cointegration relationship with a structural break in the mid-eighties. Moreover, we show that until the beginning of 2000, consumption spending and housing wealth were dominated by permanent shocks. The main variable that adjusts to restore the long-run trend when a deviation occurs is the financial wealth and therefore it presents the main transitory variations in total wealth. However, over the last period 2000 - 2009, most of transitory shocks in total wealth are associated to fluctuations in the housing component of wealth rather than financial wealth. Besides, we found that a small fraction of transitory changes in wealth is associated with movements in consumption. These conclusions are in line with our empirical results on the ability of the <b>cahy</b> to predict expected asset and housing returns. Indeed, until the beginning of 2000, the proxy of the consumption-wealth ratio predicts expected asset returns and fails to explain future fluctuations in housing returns.

25|$|The company's new <b>cahier</b> des charges (license) was liberal. It {{called for}} new French operas with spoken {{dialogue}} (opéra comique) or sung recitative, prose or verse librettos, and {{with or without}} ballets. No single composer could have more than six new acts presented in one season (acts were counted rather than works).

In addition, up to two translated foreign works were permitted, as well as French works ten years after their premiere, and any number of public domain works, so long as these did not exceed 33% of the number of new acts presented over a two-year period. The company had the right to revive any works it had already produced, to encourage the company to establish its own repertory. As the company did not receive any state subsidy before 1864, revivals of popular, established works were critical to its financial survival.|$|E
25|$|After Dunkirk the 1st Ox and Bucks {{was brought}} up to {{strength}} {{with large numbers of}} conscripts and later transferred to the 148th Independent Brigade Group serving in Northern Ireland. In 1941 the 1st Ox and Bucks commemorated the bicentenary of the 43rd Light Infantry which included a celebratory parade and evening concert. In June 1942, however, the battalion was again transferred, this time to the 71st Infantry Brigade, serving alongside the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment and 1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, part of the 42nd Armoured Division. In October 1943 the brigade became part of the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and started training for the invasion of North-Western Europe. The battalion would remain with the 53rd Division {{for the rest of the}} war. The 1st Ox and Bucks landed in Normandy on 24 June 1944 with the rest of the 53rd (Welsh) Division. On 25 June Operation Epsom began what was intended to take the town of Caen — a vital objective for the British and Canadians that proved to be a formidable town to capture — it was unsuccessful. However, it did divert significant numbers of Germans away from the American troops. The Germans counter-attacked, the 1st Ox and Bucks moved to positions around the Odon bridgehead where it suffered from heavy German artillery fire. The Allies launched further attempts to capture Caen, the first Allied troops entered the city during Operation Charnwood on 9 July; by then, much of it had been destroyed. After holding the line the 1st Battalion's first major engagement with the enemy during the battle for Caen was the successful attack to capture the village of <b>Cahier</b> and a nearby mill. Fighting around Caen continued for much of the month, with the battalion sustaining significant casualties. The battalion later fought in the Second Battle of the Odon. In August it took part in an advance towards Falaise, known as Operation Totalize. The Allies reached and captured it. The battalion also captured Pierrefitte during the operation to close the Falaise pocket, encircling two German field armies, the Fifth and 7th, the latter of which was effectively destroyed by the Allies. The victory at Falaise signified the end of the Battle for Normandy. The 1st Battalion, Ox and Bucks then took part in the advance east, eventually entering Belgium in early September.|$|E
500|$|The Société Nationale de Musique, {{founded in}} 1871 {{to promote the}} music of rising French composers, had been {{dominated}} since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy. Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president. The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle La chanson d'Ève, Debussy's piano suite D'un <b>cahier</b> d'esquisses, Zoltán Kodály's Six pièces pour piano, and the original piano duet version of Ravel's [...] Ma mère l'Oye. The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt, Ernest Bloch, Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel.

40|$|Adamantane is {{normally}} prepared by two-step synthesis from dicyclopentadiene. In {{the first step}} dicyclopentadiene is hydrogenated to tricyclodecane, which is then isomerized to adamantane using zeolite catalysts. Commercially available zeolites and zeolites modified by ion exchange were used for isomerization of tricyclodecane to adamantane. Zeolites were activated and influence of ion exchange and activation on crystalline structure was studied. Temperature of 270 C and pressure of 5, 5 Mpa were found as the optimal reaction conditions; cyclohexane was used as solvent. Zeolites Y, beta, mordenite and ZSM- 5 were used from the broad scale of structural types of zeolites. Zeolite ZSM- 5 {{was found to be}} completely inactive, the activity of the others zeolites increased in line mordenite < beta < Y. The selectivity greatly decreased by using the zeolites beta and mordenite, thus only zeolite Y is suitable for the mentioned reaction. The module of zeolite may influence catalytic properties. Experiments with zeolites having three different modules showed that by increasing module the selectivity of reactions decreases. It was found by using zeolites with different cations (Na+, NH 4 +, H+) that only zeolite HY shows enough activity. Also ion-exchanged zeolites were used in isomerization tricyclodecane to adamantane. Zeolites were modified by divalent ions of alkali metals and trivalent ions of rare eartht. By the comparison of zeolites HY - <b>CaHY</b> - LaHY {{it was found that the}} presence of calcium and lanthanum ions decreased the activity and increased the selectivity of reaction. All zeolites were activated in the static furnace, temperature of 550 C was found optimal with the speed of heating 10 C/min.

He goes; but with all Paris at his heels; which floods the outer courts, and copiously signs the <b>Cahier</b> even there, while the Doctor is giving account of himself within! The Parlement cannot too soon dismiss Guillotin, with compliments; to be borne home shoulder-high. (Deux Amis de la Liberte, i. 141.)

He was invariably dressed in a suit of the most spotless black, as if going to a dinner party; his white neckcloth was fresh from the laundress's hands, and his hat shining like a racer's coat. He advanced to the arm-chair prepared for him in the centre of the writing-table, laid his hat on the left-hand corner; his snuff-box was deposited on the same side beside the quire of paper placed in readiness for his use, and dipping the pen twice into the ink-bottle, then bringing it to within an inch of his nose, {{to make sure it was}} properly filled, he broke silence: [...] "We have said that the chord AB," [...] etc. For three quarters of an hour he continued his demonstration, making short notes as he went on, to guide the listener in repeating the problem alone; then, taking up another <b>cahier</b> which lay beside him, he went over the written repetition of the former lesson. He explained, corrected, or commented till the clock struck nine; then, with the little finger of the right hand brushing from his coat and waistcoat the shower of superfluous snuff which had fallen on them, he pocketed his snuff-box, and resuming his hat, he as silently as when he came in made his exit by the door which I rushed to open for him.' ...|$|E
