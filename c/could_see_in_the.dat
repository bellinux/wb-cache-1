5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Owls {{have very}} large eyes for their size, 2.2 {{times greater than}} the average for birds of the same weight, and {{positioned}} {{at the front of the}} head.

25|$|Meanwhile, Castor and Pollux {{had reached}} their destination. Castor climbed a tree {{to keep a}} watch as Pollux began to free the cattle. Far away, Idas and Lynceus approached. Lynceus, named for the lynx because he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, spied Castor hiding in the tree. Idas and Lynceus {{immediately}} understood what was happening. Idas, furious, ambushed Castor, fatally wounding him with a blow from his spear—but not before Castor called out to warn Pollux. In the ensuing brawl, Pollux killed Lynceus. As Idas was about to kill Pollux, Zeus, who had been watching from Mt. Olympus, hurled a thunderbolt, killing Idas and saving his son.|$|E

500|$|The 42 {{men of the}} 2nd Platoon, B Company, 23rd Infantry held outpost {{positions}} on seven hills covering a [...] front along the east bank of the Naktong north of Pugong-ni. Across the river in the rice paddies they <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of August 31, two large groups of North Korean soldiers. Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them. Just before dark, the platoon saw a column of North Koreans {{come out of the}} hills and proceed toward the river. They immediately reported to the battalion command post. The artillery forward observer, who estimated the column at 2,000 people, thought they were refugees. Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column, reducing its number. However the North Koreans continued their advance.|$|E
2500|$|Property {{damage was}} {{particularly}} severe: Allan Andreson, a CBC reporter, described that the [...] "marsh {{was just like}} one vast lake. All you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance {{sticking out of the}} water was the steeple of the Springdale Christian Reformed Church." [...] Highway 400, which bisects the marsh, was under five to ten feet [...] of water. The majority of the properties in the marsh were inundated with water, and homes and their contents were either seriously damaged or completely destroyed. Many of these houses were contaminated by the flood, or the rotting vegetables (the crop was recently harvested), and became unfit for habitation. A few homes were taken off their foundations by the waters and floated around the marsh; one, the DePeuter residence, which contained the parents, twelve children and a cat, spent the night floating on the marsh for [...] As a result of the flooding, 3000 people were left homeless as [...] of the marsh became a lake.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{location}} in New York, executive producer Stephanie Savage said [...] "We were quickly told {{it would be}} too expensive, too complicated" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} series. She told it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park but they eventually filmed the series in New York. Savage explained their choice to film there: [...] "There's no New York City on TV, or there wasn't when we started making the pilot, except what you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We've never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people." [...] Schwartz added: [...] "What's funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn't about them. And I think they've probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show." [...] Many scenes were filmed in the Empire Hotel on the Upper West Side.|$|E

2500|$|Despite hearing heavy gunfire {{from the}} north, {{including}} distinct volleys at 4:20pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Benteen's apparent reluctance to reach Custer prompted later criticism {{that he had}} failed to follow orders. Around 5:00pm, Capt. Thomas Weir and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer. They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the [...] "Last Stand Hill" [...] at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill. The destruction of Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by Crazy Horse, White Bull, Hump, Chief Gall and others. Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing native attacks around Weir Ridge forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.|$|E
