40|$|A 10 -year-old female {{neutered}} {{domestic shorthair}} (DSH) cat and a 6 -year-old female neutered Siamese cat were presented following a peracute onset of decerebellate rigidity and a cerebellar vestibular syndrome, respectively. In both cats, physical examination and routine blood tests were unremarkable, as was routine analysis of cerebrospinal fluid {{obtained from the}} DSH cat. Based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features - focal wedge-shaped lesion in the cerebellum characterised by hyperintensity in T 2 -weighted, T 2 (*) -gradient echo and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images - a presumptive diagnosis of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> was made in both cases. In the DSH cat, the post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> and additionally found acute renal infarcts and a pulmonary neoplasia.

40|$|Cerebrovasculer {{disease are}} the most {{frequent}} disease of the brain. <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> remains % 1. 5 - 4. 2 of these diseases. Etiological factors, lesion localization, symptoms and findings and relationship with prognosis of our patients with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> were investigated in our study. For this purpose, 32 patients were evaluated who were admitted to the Dicle University Medical School Department of Neurology in 1995 - 2001 hospitalized with the diagnosis of clinically and radiological confirmed cerebellar infarction. All of patients in the study group, 21 (% 65. 6) were male and 11 (% 34. 3) female. Age of overall patients ranged between 40 and 75 years {{with a mean of}} 57. 8 ± 10. 2 years. Atherothrombotic infarct was the most frequent reason at the etiologic clinical classification. The most frequently found localization was the posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct (% 50).

40|$|BACKGROUND: MRI is {{the imaging}} {{modality}} {{of choice for}} diagnosing brain infarction. Because of few or atypical clinical symptoms and a relatively low sensitivity of CT scans, many cerebellar infarctions may be detected only with MRI. With adequate recognition of cerebellar infarction on MRI and prompt initiation or optimisation of preventive therapeutic measures, more dramatic strokes may be avoided in selected cases. SUMMARY: We first briefly review the clinical presentation of cerebellar infarctions, followed by a short refresher on cerebellar anatomy and pathophysiological mechanisms of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> Then, we review the arterial cerebellar perfusion territories recently made visible with territorial arterial spin labeling (ASL), followed by a discussion and illustration of the MRI appearance of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in different stages. Similar to large <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> recent studies investigating volumetric MRI datasets have now shown that small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> occur in typical spatial patterns, knowledge of which may help in the diagnosis of even the smallest of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> on MRI. Key Messages: MRI is the modality of choice for diagnosing cerebellar infarction. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) -territories can be visualised with super-selective territorial ASL MRI. The PICA supplies at least the medial part of the posterior cerebellar surface. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery-infarcts can be mistaken for lateral PICA-infarcts. Small infarcts typically affect the cortex and often present as incidental cavities. Subacute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> may be missed on imaging due to a phenomenon called "fogging. ...|$|R

40|$|Cerebellovascular disease {{refers to}} a group of {{cerebellar}} conditions related to its blood supply. In part I, we assessed <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in relation to vascular territories. First, we critically appraised the existing classification system of small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> and propose to classify small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> according to anatomical location instead of presumed border zones in between perfusion territories. This is expected to improve clinicoradiological correlation and may allow for a more reliable and reproducible classification. Still, the holy grail in stroke medicine remains to link infarcts with the responsible diseased artery by direct imaging of involved perfusion territories. This brings us to our next objective, which was to develop an innovative imaging technique to visualise cerebellar arterial perfusion territories in vivo. In order to visualise the cerebellar PICA-perfusion territories, we studied 14 healthy subjects with super-selective ASL MRI. By labelling both vertebral arteries, we were able to distinguish the territories supplied by one vertebral artery (PICA) from those supplied by both vertebral arteries (AICA and SCA) and from the contralateral vertebral artery (contralateral PICA). We demonstrated the high variability in the extent of the PICA, but also showed that the medial posterior inferior cerebellar surfaces were invariably perfused by the PICA. Our next goal was to investigate the occurrence and topographical patterns of incidental <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in a cohort of 636 patients with arterial disease from the SMART-Medea study. Unlike <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> studied in the symptomatic stage, small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> proved to outnumber large <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> by a factor of almost 20. We also found that the overwhelming majority of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> comprised small infarct cavities within the cerebellar cortex. These cavities will be the subject of part II of this thesis, which begins with a radiological-pathological validation study. In 40 whole cerebella scanned with 7 T ex vivo MRI, we found that 20 out of 22 cerebellar cavities were located in the cortex, and these were therefore named <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities. All cavities retrieved on histopathological examination were compatible with an ischaemic origin. Additionally, we translated our findings towards lower field-strengths (1. 5 T) in vivo. This allowed us to study the epidaemiology of <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities in the 636 patients from the SMART-Medea study, and found a significant relationship with markers of atherosclerosis, imaging markers of atherothromboembolic cerebrovascular disease, and worse physical but not mental functioning. In our final study, we observed <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities ≤ 1. 5 cm in 16 of 46 patients with a recent vertebrobasilar TIA or stroke and a symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis ≥ 50 % from the Vertebral Artery Stenting Trial. Since only one of these 16 patients was known with a prior history of vertebrobasilar TIA or stroke, <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities should be added to the spectrum of common incidental brain infarcts detectible on routine MRI. Identification of <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities on MRI not only increases the visible burden of brain infarcts, but also adds insights to the temporal and spatial distribution of brain infarcts...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} clinical, topographical, and {{aetiological}} features of multiple <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> 18 patients (16. 5 % {{of patients with}} cerebellar infarction) were collected from a prospective acute stroke registry, using a standard investigation protocol including MRI and magnetic resonance angiography. Infarcts in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) +superior cerebellar artery (SCA) territory were most common (9 / 18; 50 %), followed by PICA+anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) +SCA territory infarcts (6 / 18; 33 %). One patient had bilat-eral AICA infarcts. No infarct involved the PICA+AICA combined territory. Other infarcts in the posterior circulation were present in half of the patients and the clini-cal presentation largely depended on them. Large artery disease was the main aeti-ology. Our findings emphasised the com-mon occurrence of very small multiple <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> (< 2 cm diameter). These very small multiple <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> may occur with (13 patients/ 18; 72 %) or without (3 / 18; 22 %) territorial <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> Unlike previous series, they could not all be considered junctional infarcts (between two main cerebellar artery territories: 51 / 91), but also small territorial infarcts (40 / 91). It is suggested that these very small territorial infarcts may be endzone inf-arcts, due to the involvement of small distal arterial branches. It {{is possible that some}} very small territorial infarcts may be due to a microembolic process, but this hypoth-esis needs pathological confirmation...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Cerebellar</b> {{cortical}} <b>infarct</b> cavities are a newly recognised entity {{associated with}} atherothromboembolic cerebrovascular disease and worse physical functioning. We aimed {{to investigate the}} relationship of <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities with symptomatic vertebrobasilar ischaemia and with vascular risk factors. METHODS: We evaluated the MR images of 46 patients with a recent vertebrobasilar TIA or stroke and a symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis ≥ 50 % from the Vertebral Artery Stenting Trial (VAST) {{for the presence of}} <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities ≤ 1. 5 cm. At inclusion in VAST, data were obtained on age, sex, history of vertebrobasilar TIA or stroke, and vascular risk factors. Adjusted risk ratios were calculated with Poisson regression analyses for the relation between <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Sixteen out of 46 (35 %) patients showed <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities on the initial MRI, and only one of these 16 patients was known with a previous vertebrobasilar TIA or stroke. In patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar ischaemia, risk factor profiles of patients with <b>cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities were not different from patients without these cavities. CONCLUSION: <b>Cerebellar</b> cortical <b>infarct</b> cavities are seen on MRI in as much as one third of patients with recently symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis.

40|$|Background: <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} with very nonspecific clinical features. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the full spectrum of the clinical characteristics, neuroimaging findings and neurofunctional analyses of cerebellar infarction, and the relationship between them. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from 59 patients admitted to our department during an 8 -year period. We retrospectively analyzed the relationship between demographic characteristics, clinical symptomatology, etiological factors, functional condition, vascular distribution, frequency of subcortical white matter lesions (WMLs), and concomitant lesion outside the cerebellum in patients with acute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> (ACI) at time of admission. Results: The mean age in our series was 65. 2 years, with most being male (57. 6 %). The posterior inferior cerebellar (PICA) artery was the most commonly affected territory at 62. 7 %. There was concomitant lesion outside the cerebellum in 45. 7 %. The main etiology in PICA was cardioembolism. While mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission was 2. 08 ± 1. 67 in study group, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) on admission was detected to be mRS 1 (n: 44, 74. 5 %) and mRS 2 (n: 12, 20. 3 %) most frequently. Fourteen (35 %) patients were detected to be in Fazekas stage 0; 11 (27. 5 %) patients in Fazekas stage 1; 6 (15 %) patients in Fazekas stage 2; and 9 (22. 5 %) patients in Fazekas stage 3. Conclusion: <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> is very heterogeneous. The other cerebral area infarcts which accompany ACI negatively affect neurologic functional scores. Although it is difficult to detect the relationship between WMLs and neurologic functional severity, timely detection of risk factors and their modulation may be associated with prevention and treatability of WMLs, and this may be one of the important points for prevention of stroke-related disability...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Correlation of MRI {{findings}} with atherosclerotic vascular lesions {{has rarely been}} attempted in patients with cerebellar infarction. The {{aim of this study}} was to correlate the MRI lesions with the vascular lesions seen on conventional cerebral angiography in cerebellar infarction. Methods—The subjects included 31 patients with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> who underwent both MRI and conventional cerebral angiography. We analyzed the risk factors, clinical findings, imaging study, and angiography results. We attempted to correlate MRI lesions with the vascular lesions shown in the angiograms. Results—The vascular lesions seen on angiograms were subdivided into 3 groups: large-artery disease (n 522), in situ branch artery disease (n 56), and no angiographic disease with hypertension (n 53). The proximal segment (V 1) lesions of vertebral artery were the most common angiographic features in patients with large-artery disease in which stroke most commonly involved the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) cerebellum. The V 1 lesions with coexistent occlusive lesions of the intracranial vertebral and basilar arteries were correlated with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> which had no predilection for certain cerebellar territory. The intracranial occlusive disease without V 1 lesion was usually correlated with small cerebellar lesions in PICA and superior cerebellar artery (SCA) cerebellum.

40|$|The most {{frequent}} type of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> involves the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and superior cerebellar artery territories. Bilateral symettrical <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> are extremely rare. The etiology of this infarct pattern {{has not been}} shown clearly. It is postulated that bilateral PICA infarcts are caused by the stenosis of PICA which emerges from the left vertebral artery that supplies the blood for both cerebellar hemispheres. A 42 -year old male patient came with complaints of headache, loss of balance, vertigo, nausea-vomiting and diplopia. On his neurological examination, there was nistagmus and diplopia on both horizontal gaze directions. His cerebellar tests were minimal deficient {{on the left side}} and the patient had an ataxia to the left side. His cranial MR revealed bilateral PICA infarct, and his digital substraction angipgraphy (DSA) showed that his vertebral artery was stenosed from its point of origin. The etiological cause was thought to be intracranial vertebral artery occlusion with a baseline insitu atherosclerosis, in the presence of branches having their origin from one side and going to both PICA territories. The bilateral PICA infarct case,which is a rare clinical presentation, was evaluated {{with the help of the}} literature and probable pathogenesis was hypothesized...|$|R

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 88 pathologically proven <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts,</b> {{examining the}} entire thoracocervical arterial system (including the spinal {{part of the}} vertebral artery, the intracranial arteries, and the heart) in all cases. For 50 infarcts, we found an arterial occlusion. The intracranial part of the vertebral artery was involved in 38 infarcts (76 %), the basilar artery in 20 infarcts (40 %), and a cerebellar artery in 12 infarcts (24 %). Eight infarcts were due to bilateral distal vertebral artery occlusions. For the 50 infarcts, {{the cause of the}} occlusion was atherosclerosis in 28 (56 %) and a cardiac embolism in 12 (24 %). For the remaining 38 infarcts, we found no arterial occlusions on postmortem examination. Of these 38 infarcts, 26 (68 %) were associated with a cardiac source of emboli. For the entire group of 88 infarcts, atherosclerosis was the cause in 31 (35 %), while a cardiac embolism was proven or presumed in 38 (43 %). Dissecting aneurysms, atherosclerotic artery-to-artery embolism, or hemodynamic mechanisms could have been responsible for a few infarcts. We conclude that <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> often arise from cardiogenic embolism. (Stroke 1990; 21 : 1299 - 1305) Data on the mechanisms of cerebellar infarc-tion are scarce.

40|$|Introduction: Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) infections can have various presentations {{including}} Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) which may go unrecognized as {{a presentation of}} infection. We describe three cases of different CNS infections complicated by CVA. Presentation: Case 1 describes a 27 -year-old man, presenting with symptoms consistent with a transient ischemic attack found to have racemose neurocysticercosis. Case 2 describes a 55 -year-old man with low grade fevers for 4 weeks accompanied by visual and gait disturbances and delayed speech diagnosed with multiple small left thalamocapsular and superior <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> secondary to cryptococcal meningitis. The third case describes a man with pneumococcal meningitis complicated by <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> Discussion: CNS vascular compromise secondary to infections {{may be due to}} vasculitis, an immune-mediated parainfectious process causing vasospasm or thrombosis, or a hypercoagulable state with endothelial dysfunction. Patients with CVAs are at risk for aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections (especially catheter related) and other nosocomial infections and their clinical presentation may be very similar to CNS infections. Conclusion: The cases described demonstrate that CNS infections need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of CVAs presenting with fevers. The signs and symptoms of non-CNS infections associated with CVAs may be clinically indistinguishable from those of CNS infections. The outcomes of untreated CNS infections are extremely poor. It is thus imperative to have a high index of suspicion for CNS infection when evaluating CVAs with fevers or other signs of infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in evaluating posterior circulation infarcts {{compared with that}} of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains unknown. In a hospital-based population, the authors studied SPECT, CT, and MRI in 35 consecutive patients presenting with acute infarction clinically localized in the thalamus (7), posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory (15), brainstem (19), and cerebellum (3). Multiple infarcts were noted in 8 patients. Overall, the SPECT sensitivity was lower than that of MRI (21 % vs 93 %, p = 0. 004) and CT (42 % vs 65 %, p = 0. 046). The SPECT and CT sensitivities were not significantly different (67 % vs 73 %) for PCA infarcts. Performed within 24 hours, SPECT showed a relevant hypoperfusion in all PCA infarcts. For brainstem infarcts, CT (33 %, p = 0. 074) and MRI (91 %, p = 0. 004) were more sensitive than SPECT, which showed no hemispheric hypoperfusion.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether a combined statistical analysis method is more effective in assessing movement training effects in a patient with cerebellar stroke. Design. A crossover single-case research design was conducted. Methods. The patient was a 69 -year-old man with a chronic <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarct</b> who received two 5 -week phases of finger tracking training at different movement rates. Changes were measured with the Box and Block Test, the Jebsen-Taylor test, the finger extension force test, and the corticospinal excitability test. Both visual analysis and statistical tests (including split-middle line method, t test, confidence interval, and effect size) were used to assess potential intervention effects. Results. The results of the t tests were highly consistent with the confidence interval tests, but less consistent with the split-middle line method. Most results produced medium to large effect sizes. Limitations. The possibility of an incomplete washout effect was a confounding factor in the current analyses. Conclusions. The combined statistical analysis method may assist researchers in assessing intervention effects in single-case stroke rehabilitation studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo present initial {{experience}} with a new modular transfemoral multibranched stent graft for treating aortic arch aneurysms. MethodsSix patients, considered high risk for open surgery, were treated with custom made branched stent grafts. All patients had a staged left carotid subclavian bypass before the endovascular procedure. Each branched graft had a 12 mm side branch for the innominate artery and an 8  mm side branch for the left common carotid artery. ResultsFour patients out of six had uneventful placement of the prostheses, with successful exclusion of their aneurysms. One patient developed a type I endoleak that was managed successfully with coiling and gluing of the aneurysm sac. In one patient, cannulation of the innominate branch was unsuccessful and an extra-anatomic bypass was necessary to perfuse the right carotid and vertebral arteries. This patient developed a stroke, while one more suffered a right <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarct.</b> ConclusionWe have demonstrated the technical feasibility of a modular transfemoral branched stent graft for treatment of aortic arch aneurysms. The method is relatively safe based on initial experience. More cases and long-term follow up are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new device...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} regional and remote diaschisis of inferior brain stem or <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in 25 patients presenting with relatively limited lesions. Patients pre sented with medullary, pontine or cerebellar infarction. Methods: Lesions were evaluated on MRI (0. 5 T). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed by means of SPECT, after injection of 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) and, when possible, inhalation of 133 Xein the same session. For each method, asymmetry indices (Als), comparing contralateral to ipsilateral rCBF values, were calculated in four areas of each cerebral hemisphere and in the cerebellum and later compared with values obtained in healthy subjects (P = 0. 05). Results: Higher rCBF values were observed in the contralateral cerebel lum in 2 of 7 patients with selective lateral medullary lesions, and cerebellar Als were significantly increased. When a cerebella...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Cerebellar {{vascular}} {{diseases are}} focal cerebrovascular diseases in posterior circulation - vertebrobasilar system. The cerebellum is supplied by three main arteries {{arising from the}} vertebrobasilar system: arteria cerebelli inferior posterior, arteria cerebelli inferior anterior and arteria cerebelli superior. Cerebelar infarctions are rare but unpredictable disorders. The {{aim of this study}} was determination of main risk factors, clinical presentation and prognosis of the cerebellar infarctions in distal vascular territory of the arteria cerebelli superior. Material and methods. We evaluated 60 patients hospitalized after acute cerebellar infarction among other hospitalized patients in five year period. In 18 patients computerized tomography demonstrated infarction in distal vascular territory of the arteria cerebelli superior. All patients underwent clinical and other diagnostic investigations (computerized tomography, electrocardyography and standard blood tests) and were questioned by phone after finishing hospital treatment. Results. <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts</b> in distal vascular territory of arteria cerebeli superior was 30 % of all <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarcts.</b> The most frequent risk factor was hypertension (66. 7 %). Symptomatology and clinical signs were heterogenous but the most frequent were instability (77. 8 %), vertigo (72. 2 %) and vomiting (55. 6 %) followed by ataxia of the limbs (77. 8 %) and the body (61. 1 %), nystagmus (55. 6 %) and disarthria (33. 3 %) in clinical presentation. All patients had good recovery in hospital and one year afterwards. Discussion. Infarctions in distribution of arteria cerebelli superior are rare and have multiple risk factors and various clinical features in majority of other studies as in this one. Mass effects are present in several studies but none in this one which reflects contraversions present in other published investigations. Conclusion. Cerebellar infarctions in vascular territory of arteria cerebelli superior have multiple risk factors, mostly heterogenous clinical presentations with predominance of instability, vertigo and vomiting with ataxia of the limbs and the body as well as nystagmus and disarthria in clinical presentation. The outcome and prognosis of disease is good despite the large amount of arteria cerebelli superior vascullar territory...|$|R
