40|$|PERSPECTIVES AND OVERVIEW Two {{species of}} cattle grubs (Diptera: Oestridae) affect cattle in the Northern Hemisphere: Hypoderma iineatum, the <b>common</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> or lesser cattle warble fly, and Hypoderma bovis, the {{northern}} cattle grub or larger cattle warble fly. The word warble is Anglo-Saxon for boil. Adults {{of the cattle}} grub {{are commonly known as}} heel flies, warble flies, bomb flies, or gad flies. This parasite has been observed and recorded for centuries (159), and Bracy Clark (50) cited and discussed references from Biblical times to Shakespeare. Scientific observations on the biology were first recorded in the 1700 s by Vallisnieri (cited in 224) in Italy, followed by an extensive review and taxonomic description by Brauer (34) in Austria in the mid 19 th century. Major contributions followed in England by Ormerod (157) and Imms (93); in the United States by Riley (179), Osborn (158), Bishopp et al (24), and Mote (132); and in Canada by Hadwen (85). Other reviews completed before the widespread use of systemic insecticides for cattle-grub control include work by James (94) and Scharff (185) in the United States, Gansser in Austria (69), Gebauer in Germany (70), Grunin in Russia (81), Natvig in Norway (141), MacDougall in Scotland (124), and Bevan 2 ̆ 6 Edwards (22) in England. The quality of these reviews makes it unnecessary to repeat detailed information about the stage descriptions and life cycles for these two important species. Rather, I attempt to summarize these contributions, emphasizing additions to our knowledge since the 1950 s...|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} <b>cattle</b> <b>grubs</b> is {{discussed}} here, as are possible insecticide reactions, warnings and restrictions. <b>Cattle</b> <b>grubs</b> are the immature or larval stages of heel or warble flies. Losses from this insect {{begin with the}} fly stage in the insect 2 ̆ 7 s life history. As flies seek animals on which to deposit eggs, cattle become frightened and run. The running animal has its tail in the air, bent over the back. This behavior is termed 2 ̆ 2 gadding. 2 ̆ 2 Cattle fail to graze normally during the warble fly season because of gadding. They seek shade or stand in water to avoid the flies. The failure to graze normally results in decreased milk production and subnormal weight gains. Further losses occur when cattle, {{in their efforts to}} escape the flies, run through fences or into other objects. Slaughter losses result when grubby areas must be trimmed from the carcass and from the decreased value of hides containing grub holes...|$|R

40|$|Gonotrophic {{development}} in Hypoderma lineatum (Villers) and Hypoderma bovis (L.) {{is characterized by}} initiation and complete growth in larval and pupal stages. Developing oocytes through six stages to the definitive egg are described. Polytrophic ovarian development is modified; only primary and secondary complements of eggs survive and develop simultaneously. The female emerges from the puparium with its life-long complement of eggs fully developed. Capability to mate and immediately oviposit on host cattle is well suited to the short life span of the nonfeeding fly. Mean reproductive capacity of H. lineatum is 516 ± 54 (SD) eggs, {{significantly higher than the}} 478 ± 70 (SD) eggs of H. bovis.

PCR products were digested with three restriction enzymes, namely BfaI, HinfI and TaqI, providing informative profiles. H. bovis and H. lineatum sequences revealed an inter-specific variation rate of 8. 5 %, and an intra-specific variation rate of 0. 87 and 0. 29 %, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first documented case of <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> (hypodermosis) in Northern Serbia (Vojvodina). Subcutaneous warbles were determined in a si x year old Simmental cow, at nine places along the spine. After the extirpation of larvae, {{based on the}} morphological characterisation, larvae of the third stage of Hypoderma bovis were diagnosed. The cow was administered therapeutic treatment, which had a favorable outcome, with no signs of recurrence. To the authors’ best knowledge, the case described in this paper is the first documented case of hypodermosis in cattle in Northern Serbia (Vojvodina). As the climate changed {{in the past few}} decades, it is important to pursue detailed investigations of the prevalence of this parasitic myiasis, as there are few such literature data for the Southern region of Serbia. One should also not ignore the fact that species of the genus Hypoderma can cause myiasis in humans as well...|$|R

60|$|The first brief {{published}} {{notice of}} this race was by Azara, between the years 1783-96; but Don F. Muniz, of Luxan, who has kindly collected information for me, states that about 1760 these cattle were kept as curiosities near Buenos Ayres. Their origin is not positively known, {{but they must}} have originated subsequently to the year 1552, when cattle were first introduced. Senor Muniz informs me that the breed {{is believed to have}} originated with the Indians southward of the Plata. Even to this day those reared near the Plata show their less civilised nature in being fiercer than <b>common</b> <b>cattle,</b> and in the cow, if visited too often, easily deserting her first calf. The breed is very true, and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves. The breed has already lasted at least a century. A niata bull crossed with a common cow, and the reverse cross, yield offspring having an intermediate character, but with the niata character strongly displayed. According to Senor Muniz, there is the clearest evidence, contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in analogous cases, that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull transmits her peculiarities more strongly than does the niata bull when crossed with a common cow. When the pasture is tolerably long, these cattle feed as well as <b>common</b> <b>cattle</b> with their tongue and palate; but during the great droughts, when so many animals perish on the Pampas, the niata breed lies under a great disadvantage, and would, if not attended to, become extinct; for the <b>common</b> <b>cattle,</b> like horses, are able to keep alive by browsing with their lips on the twigs of trees and on reeds: this the niatas cannot so well do, as their lips do not join, and hence they are found to perish before the <b>common</b> <b>cattle.</b> This strikes me as a good illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of an animal, on what circumstances, occurring only at long intervals of time, its rarity or extinction may depend. It shows us, also, how natural selection would have determined the rejection of the niata modification had it arisen in a state of nature.|$|R

40|$|The {{profitability}} of livestock {{activities can be}} diminished significantly by the effects of parasites. Economic losses caused by cattle parasites in Brazil were estimated on an annual basis, considering {{the total number of}} animals at risk and the potential detrimental effects of parasitism on cattle productivity. Estimates in U. S. dollars (USD) were based on reported yield losses among untreated animals and reflected some of the effects of parasitic diseases. Relevant parasites that affect cattle productivity in Brazil, and their economic impact in USD billions include: gastrointestinal nematodes - $ 7. 11; cattle tick (Rhipicephalus(Boophilus) microplus) - $ 3. 24; horn fly (Haematobia irritans) - $ 2. 56; <b>cattle</b> <b>grub</b> (Dermatobia hominis) - $ 0. 38; New World screwworm fly (Cochliomyia hominivorax) - $ 0. 34; and stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) - $ 0. 34. The combined annual economic loss due to internal and external parasites of cattle in Brazil considered here was estimated to be at least USD 13. 96 billion. These findings are discussed in the context of methodologies and research that are required in order to improve the accuracy of these economic impact assessments. This information needs to be taken into consideration when developing sustainable policies for mitigating the impact of parasitism on the {{profitability of}} Brazilian cattle producers...|$|R
