5000|$|In 1915, Moline Plow {{purchased}} the Universal Tractor Company of Columbus, Ohio, manufacturer of the Universal Tractor. Moline added their name, and from about 1916 until 1923, the company sold the Moline Universal Tractor, {{which was an}} early attempt to serve unmet market demand for a small, light, affordable, general-purpose tractor. It was a two-wheel tractor whose trailing implement provided the rear wheels to form a four-wheel articulated unit. Its nimble design was more suitable for cultivating row crops than were most contemporary tractors. In various advertisements the name was sometimes hyphenated as [...] "Moline-Universal". An overview of Moline Universal design and operation, written by the company as a contributing <b>corporate</b> <b>author</b> to a 1920 how-to guide for farmers, is available in Harry W. Adams' 1920 book Adams' Common Sense Instruction On Gas Tractor Operation. Moline Plow considered the Allis-Chalmers Model 6-12, a very similar tractor, to be a patent-infringing copy.|$|E

5000|$|They are {{different}} in that the “Nancy style” represents guidelines - that is general principles agreed upon by {{a small group of}} experts, to be followed as an indication or outline of policy or conduct -, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a proper standard, developed by the Standards Committees of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO), subject to rigorous control and approval process including peer review. This is why also the structure of the two documents is different since the standard may repeat concepts in different sections which may be used separately, while the Guidelines are intended as an easy to read document giving the general idea for recommended items. The Guidelines, different from standards, do not give full details on format and style. Moreover, the “Nancy style” represents international guidelines developed by a <b>corporate</b> <b>author</b> (GLISC), which worked on the draft proposed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, and signed approval of this best practice on behalf of their respective organizations, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a national standard approved by the American National Standards Institute through a number of Voting Members. *Paper vs digital document medium ...|$|E

By theorizing a corporate poetics that allows us to understand what it means for a corporation to engage in authorship, I correct for a diffuse version of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s literary history that belies the colony 2 ̆ 7 s archive in order to more thoroughly understand how non-human actors contributed to and shaped the literature of early America. ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{sentence}} {{case and}} there is title case. Sentence case: References (placed {{at the end of}} the paper) are written in sentence case. Title case: The title your paper, i. e., the thing that goes on page 1, is written in title case.

On the occasions that you need to use the title of an information source in a citation (because there is not a named or <b>corporate</b> <b>author),</b> that title also is written in title case. What is meant by title case is not one hundred percent universal, so the guidelines presented here should only be considered as applying to American Psychological Association (APA) style.

40|$|Cited Reference (CR=). In SCISEARCH, all {{references}} {{cited in}} the bibliography of a source document are indexed in the Cited Reference field. If an important article on a particular research topic is known, {{it is possible to}} find later articles that cite this work. These references can usually be expected to deal with the same topic and to report the results of later research on this subject. Cited reference searching can be a very effective method of tracking research in a given field and of finding highly relevant references to the topic of interest. The cited reference functions as a very specific author-defined descriptor. Every item cited in a source document is indexed regardless of type or format, including journal articles, books, reports, patents, and including both authored and anonymous materials. There are two general types of cited references in this file: authored – citations having an individual or <b>corporate</b> <b>author,</b> and anonymous. You may search cited: authors, editors, inventors, journal papers, books, patents, conferences, government reports, corporate research reports, theses and dissertations, unpublished works, anonymous works, private communications. The CR field contains all the citations as provided by the author in his/her bibliography or list of references. Some title words may be abbreviated. The format of the entries in the CR field varies dependin...|$|E
