5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
25|$|Teaching is undervalued and underpaid as a {{profession}} and this was not helped by the selection procedure. Prior to 2010, students with lower achievement at grade 10 <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Teacher Training Institute (TTI) or a College of Teacher's Education (CTE) for a certificate or diploma. If students passed the EHEEE, education faculties took students with lower GPAs than other faculties. Teaching is hard work with high mean pupil/teacher ratios in primary schools and many operating a double shift. Many teachers lack motivation and 60% would move to another job if given the opportunity.|$|E

The trouble was I ended up with five garages full with 25,000 books, so I started buying more selectively, and dealing in rare and {{antiquarian}} titles." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic system}} {{woke up with}} a {{calendar}} display. It could look like a day planner view or a month calendar. The user <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> address book which was designed <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> screen-based metaphor for a paper address book. Current could dial phone calls from your address book if you had <b>a</b> modem attached <b>to</b> the system. There were screens for tracking expenses, (which could {{be associated with a}} project, naturally). There were also to-do lists which might, or might not, relate to other tasks or projects at the users whim.|$|R
500|$|This airship that {{lifted a}} rider {{consisted}} of a cigar-shaped hydrogen balloon that looked like an inverted boat wrapped in netting. It had a velocipede seat and steering bar for a rider. A cloth screw propeller was operated by the rider through a cog wheel and ratchet attachment operated by the rider pedaling. He first called the hybrid invention an [...] "air bicycle", that navigated through the air like driving a bicycle. He later named it a [...] "gas kite", an [...] "aerial velocipede", an [...] "aerial bicycle", [...] and ultimately a [...] "sky-cycle." [...] The propeller acted like a screw of a boat and propelled the airship forward and up with the backward air current generated. It <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> thousand feet, be maneuvered, and brought back at will by the rider. Myers' wife was an expert in sky-cycling.|$|E

UCLA {{finished second in the}} AAWU tied with Oregon State at 4–1–1, ranked 10th in the Coaches' poll.|$|E
2500|$|The other Israelite tribes were grieved at {{the near}} {{loss of the}} tribe of Benjamin. They decided to allow these 600 men {{to carry on the}} tribe of Benjamin but no one was willing to give their {{daughter}} in marriage to them because they had vowed not to. To get around this, they provided wives for the men by killing the men from the tribe of Machir who had not shown concern for the almost lost tribe of Benjamin as they did not come to grieve with the rest of Israel. 400 virgin women from the tribe of Machir were found and given in marriage to the Benjaminite men. There were still 200 men remaining who were without a wife so it was agreed that they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Israelite festival and hide in the vineyards, and wait for the young unmarried women to come out and dance. They then grabbed a wife each and took her back to their land and rebuilt their houses (...) [...]|$|E

2500|$|There {{are three}} ways that an {{individual}} could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nursing university {{for four years and}} earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years. [...] Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of become a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan. [...] They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students {{to be able to make}} critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.|$|E

Besides, suppose that when you get to Liverpool, for some reason or other, your father should not be there. Then, having plenty of money, you <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hotel and stay there till your father comes. Or you could ask some one of the {{passengers}} who is going to London to let you go with him, and you could tell him that you had plenty of money to pay the expenses." ...|$|E

6000|$|The price {{agreed upon}} would seem very small {{in these days}} of millionaire authors, but to me the terms of Flower's {{commission}} were nobly generous. They set me free.

6000|$|... "By {{the time}} that you {{discovered}} me upon the moor I had a complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jury. Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.|$|E

He {{had been}} a sailor in his time--and that's a trade which teaches a man (if he's good for anything) to think, and act on his thought, at one and the same moment. He had taken a peep at the blackguards in front of the house, and had {{recognized}} the shortest of the two as a native of the place, perfectly well aware that one of the features attached to the cottage was a boathouse. 'That chap is not such a fool as he looks,' says the gardener. 'If he mentions the boat-house, the other fellow from London may have his suspicions. I thought I would post my son on the pier--that quiet young man there with the gun--to keep a lookout. If he sees another boat (there are half a dozen {{on this side of the}} lake) putting off after us, he has orders to fire, on the chance of our hearing him. A little notion of mine, sir, to prevent our being surprised in the fog. Do you see any objection to it?' Objection! In the days when diplomacy was something more than a solemn pretense, what a member of Congress that gardener would have made! Well, we shipped our oars, and away we went. Not quite haphazard--for we had a compass with us. Our course was as straight as we <b>could</b> <b>go,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> village on the opposite side of the lake, called Brightfold. Nothing happened for the first quarter of an hour--and then, by the living Jingo (excuse my vulgarity), we heard the gun!" ...|$|E
