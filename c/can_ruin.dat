5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
25|$|Basil {{suffers from}} several plant {{pathogens}} that <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> the crop and reduce yield. Fusarium wilt is a soil-borne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants. Seedlings may {{be killed by}} Pythium damping off.|$|E

25|$|The wives, if {{suspected}} of {{speaking about the}} unit's existence, can cause their husbands to be expelled and returned to regular Army service. Colonel Ryan has stated, time and again, that this <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> a soldier's career, {{as well as his}} marriage, and has also stated that he will not hesitate to destroy families to preserve the unit's security. He has also threatened the wives with closing the unit down, and restarting it somewhere else under another cover—forcing the uprooting of all families involved.|$|E
25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is {{not usually}} done in a milling machine for several reasons. Firstly, most milling machines have only one spindle, so changing the tool more than four to six times can increase cycle times significantly. Secondly, most workpieces that require this process are made on horizontal machining centers (HMC), which reduces float-ability due to gravity. Thirdly, the lubrication may not be sufficient, {{which can lead to}} material build-up between diamonds, diminishing the tool's effectiveness. Finally, if any chips remain from previous operations they <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> the tool.|$|E
25|$|The DAC {{report is}} as {{critical}} to the livelihood of a professional truck driver as the credit report is to a consumer. When a trucking company reports negative information about a truck driver, it <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> the driver’s career by preventing him or her from finding a truck driving job for several years or more. It is widely known that trucking companies often abuse this power by willfully and maliciously reporting false information on truckers’ DAC reports, either in retaliation for seeking better paying trucking jobs elsewhere or {{for any number of}} other fraudulent, anti-competitive reasons. As long as truck drivers can be threatened with a false DAC report for standing up to management or leaving their company for a better job elsewhere, working conditions at truck driver jobs will not improve.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television sources and critics. Steve Heisler of The A.V.

[...] Another complaint of the episode were the Back to the Future references and the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Review did {{note that}} the [...] "Top 40" [...] songs do not always make for {{challenging}} songs, as many featured simple chord repetition throughout the song or simply following pre-programmed electronic keyboard or drum beats. However, most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that {{would be fun to}} play. Reviews also noted that the censoring of songs in order to affirm a family-friendly rating is awkward, such as censoring the word [...] "whiskey" [...] from Don McLean's [...] "American Pie" [...] (8 times), and <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> the enjoyment of some songs. Greg Miller of IGN further noted that these censoring are at odds with the straight-up inclusion of other songs such as [...] "Gasoline" [...] by The Airborne Toxic Event which, Miller claims, is about sex.|$|E

2500|$|Cargo ships {{entering}} a port must be loaded and unloaded quickly, because delay <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> perishable cargo and/or lead to heavy financial losses. Prior {{to the development}} of container ships, this work was done largely by hand by longshoremen. A single longhshoreman can refuse to unload cargo, but can easily be replaced by another worker. [...] However, when longshoremen are unionized, the longshoremen's union can obtain great leverage over shippers. Labor racketeers can essentially extort wages, benefits, and featherbed jobs from employers; engage in extensive cargo theft; solicit and receive bribes; and extort payments from longshoremen in order to obtain union jobs.|$|E

[...] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing [...] "an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done," [...] concluding [...] "If you're an idealist like me, that <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> your whole decade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most of the}} Bordeaux wine region, the Sauternes {{region has}} a {{maritime}} climate which brings the viticultural hazards of autumn frost, hail and rains that <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> an entire vintage. The Sauternes region is located [...] southeast {{of the city of}} Bordeaux along the Garonne river and its tributary, the Ciron. The source of the Ciron is a spring which has cooler waters than the Garonne. In the autumn, when the climate is warm and dry, the different temperatures from the two rivers meet to produce mist that descends upon the vineyards from evening to late morning. This condition promotes the development of the Botrytis cinerea fungus. By mid day, the warm sun will help dissipate the mist and dry the grapes to keep them from developing less favorable rot.|$|E

2500|$|The {{texture of}} the thick double-coat is {{important}} in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is {{difficult to get a}} Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3–4 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat. [...] The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another.

2500|$|Kudzu {{can be used}} by grazing animals, as it is high {{in quality}} as a forage and {{palatable}} to livestock. [...] It can be grazed until frost and even slightly after. [...] Kudzu had been used in the southern United States specifically to feed goats on land that had limited resources. [...] Kudzu hay typically has a 15–18% crude protein content and over 60% total digestible nutrient value. [...] The quality of the leaves decreases, however, as vine content increases relative to the leaf content. [...] Kudzu also has low forage yields despite its rate of growth, yielding around two to four tons of dry matter per acre annually. [...] It is also difficult to bale due to its vining growth and its slowness in shedding water. [...] This makes it necessary to place kudzu hay under sheltered protection after being baled. [...] Kudzu is readily consumed by all types of grazing animals, yet frequent grazing over three to four years <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> stands. [...] Thus, kudzu only serves well as a grazing crop on a temporary basis.|$|E
2500|$|Fredersen {{takes the}} maps to the {{inventor}} Rotwang {{to learn their}} meaning. Rotwang had {{been in love with}} a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to [...] "resurrect" [...] Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes that he could fill the role and declares his love for Maria. Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria's likeness to the robot so that it <b>can</b> <b>ruin</b> her reputation among the worker to prevent any rebellion. Unaware that Rotwang plans to use the robot to kill Freder and take over Metropolis. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, transfers her likeness to the robot and sends her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing it is the real Maria, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria unleashes chaos throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent amongst the workers.|$|E
