40|$|AbstractViolation of {{intellectual}} property rights as a social phenomenon poses {{a serious threat to}} the survival and development of each county. The experiences speak of the fact that no country or region remains beyond the reach of this phenomenon, nor it is immune to this danger, which indicates that this is a problem of global proportions. As a result, each country builds national strategies and develops different forms and mechanisms to effectively combat this problem. Unlike countries with a traditional system of Parliamentary democracy faced with the need to build and upgrade the already established strategy, developing countries such as Macedonia, have to start building such a strategy simultaneously with the implementation of the overall development processes and the establishment of the overall laws of the state. Thanks to the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Republic of Macedonia on the country's borders and the knowledge of international trade flows, it provides a substantial role in the protection of the Macedonian economy from goods that infringe on the intellectual property rights. The <b>Customs</b> <b>measures</b> for protection of the intellectual property rights represent one of the non tariff (non fiscal) measures applied during the regular customs procedures, pursuant to the Law on Customs Administration and the Customs Law. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that although the trade with falsified and pirated goods, as a derivative form of the international trade, exists as long as the trade itself exists, nonetheless, in the Customs system of the Republic of Macedonia the <b>Customs</b> <b>measures</b> to combat this sort of trade have been put into effect only recently. The <b>customs</b> <b>measures</b> to protect intellectual property rights were defined in 2005 for the first time by passing the Law on <b>Customs</b> <b>Measures</b> for Protection of Intellectual Property Rights...|$|E

The main {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate and provide an insight for monitoring and controlling the trade supply chain within and among different countries by using technological advancement (i. e. an electronic tracking system, etc.); furthermore, facilitate the local and intra-regional trade among countries through reviewing the recent trends and practical implementation of an electronic transit traffic and cargo that related to <b>customs</b> <b>measures</b> by introducing and supporting some case studies of several international and landlocked transit trade countries. The research methodology employed in this study was described as qualitative by conducting few interviews with managers, transit truck drivers, and traders and reviewing the related literature to collect qualitative data from secondary sources such as statistical reports, previous studies, etc. The results in this study show that Jordan and other countries around the globe that used an electronic tracking system for monitoring transit trade has led to a significant reduction in cost, effort and time in physical movement of goods internally and crossing through other countries. Therefore, there is no need to escort transit trucks by customs staff; hence, the rate of escort transit trucks is reduced by more than ninety percent, except the bulky and high duty goods. Electronic transit traffic has been increased; the average transit time journey has been reduced by more than seventy percent and has led to decrease in rates of smuggling up to fifty percent. The researcher recommends considering Jordan as regional and international office for tracking electronically and monitoring the transit trade for many considerations...|$|E

40|$|A new AFM {{instrument}} {{dedicated to}} protein crystal imaging in solution is here successfully introduced, as proven by its testing {{on both the}} crystals and the Langmuir-Blodgett films of two proteins having quite different molecular weight, namely chicken egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin. The AFM consists of a <b>custom</b> <b>measuring</b> head with a flexible SPM controller in house produced which effectively drives the head for contact, non-contact and spectroscopy modes. By providing the user with full control and monitoring of signals at the front panel we have achieved an high degree of customisation optimal for the protein crystal measurements here described. This approach allows to study the crystal periodicity and morphology in their mother liquid. In this way, protein crystal structure is not destroyed, {{as in the case}} of drying, and one can thereby investigate its periodic structure in its “natural aqueous” environment. Comfortingly it appears to distinguish the protein crystals from the salt crystals, which under the optical microscope are frequently quite similar and often their difference is revealed only during X-ray analysis. Finally the AFM estimates of the given single proteins packing, order and morphology appear quite similar in the LB thin film and in the crystals, thereby allowing routine crystal measurements at high resolution reproducing previous report on membrane protein bovine cytochrome P 450 scc similarly studied in LB films and crystals. Our intention for the future is to attempt the exploitation of the use of optical tweezers for both AFM and microGISAXS studies of protein crystal growth, considering the recent proven ability to utilize the birefringence of lysozyme crystals to control their orientation and to monitor their growth in optical tweezers...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{registration}} of histological whole slide images {{is an important}} prerequisite for modern histological image analysis. A partial reconstruction of the original volume allows e. g. colocalization analysis of tissue parameters or high-detail reconstructions of anatomical structures in 3 D. Methods: In this paper, we present an automatic staining-invariant registration method, {{and as part of}} that, introduce a novel vessel-based rigid registration algorithm using a <b>custom</b> similarity <b>measure.</b> The method is based on an iterative best-fit matching of prominent vessel structures. Results: We evaluated our method on a sophisticated synthetic dataset as well as on real histological whole slide images. Based on labeled vessel structures we compared the relative differences for corresponding structures. The average positional error was close to 0, the median for the size change factor was 1, and the median overlap was 0. 77. Conclusion: The results show that our approach is very robust and creates high quality reconstructions. The key element for the resulting quality is our novel rigid registration algorithm...|$|R
