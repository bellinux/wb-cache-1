While green communications and networks have been widely studied in recent years, the rise of gaming based on wireless clouds introduces many specific aspects allowing important savings and improvements. We try to minimize the power consumption {{of this type of}} networks in a hybrid WiFi/LTE radio access network (RAN) by proposing a novel Wireless Cloud Scheduler (WCS) mechanism and applying different power utility functions. We find {{that it is possible to}} reduce the power consumption, increase the maximum attainable capacity of the network in terms of number of served UEs and minimize the costs of cloud resources usage, while maintaining a good level of QoS...|$|R

5000|$|Gaikai (lit. [...] "open sea", i.e. an {{expansive}} outdoor space) {{is a company}} which provides technology for the streaming of high-end video games. Founded in 2008, it was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2012. Its technology has multiple applications, including in-home streaming over a local wired or wireless network (as in Remote Play between the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita), as well as <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming</b> where video games are rendered on remote servers and delivered to end users via internet streaming (such as the PlayStation Now game streaming service.) As a startup, before its acquisition by Sony, the company announced many partners using the technology from 2010 through 2012 including game publishers, web portals, retailers and consumer electronics manufacturers. On July 2, 2012, Sony announced that a formal agreement had been reached to acquire the company for $380 million USD with plans of establishing their own new <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming</b> service, as well as integrating streaming technology built by Gaikai into PlayStation products, resulting in PlayStation Now and Remote Play.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{a feature}} called Cross-Play (or Cross-Platform Play) {{covering}} any PlayStation Vita software title that can interact with a PlayStation 3 or a PlayStation 4 software title. Different software titles use Cross-Play in different ways. For example, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a title supporting the Cross-Play feature, and the PS3 version of the game can be controlled using the PS Vita system. In addition, PS Vita users may play some PS3 games using the PlayStation Now <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming</b> service.|$|E

50|$|All PlayStation 3 {{consoles}} {{are able}} to play original PlayStation games (PSone discs and downloadable classics). However, not all PlayStation 3 models are backwards compatible with the PlayStation 2 games. In summary, early PS3 consoles such as the 60GB and 20GB launch PS3 consoles were backwards compatible with PS2 games because they had PS2 chips in them. Some later models, most notably the 80GB Metal Gear Solid PS3 consoles are also backwards compatible, through partial software emulation in this case since they {{no longer had the}} PS2 CPU in them, although they do have the PS2 GPU in them, allowing for reduced backward compatibility through hardware-assisted software emulation. All other later models, such as the PS3 Slim are not PS2 backwards compatible, though users can still enjoy PS3 and PSone games on them. According to Sony, when they removed backwards compatibility from the PS3 they had already been at a point where they were three years into its lifecycle; by that time the vast majority of consumers that were purchasing the PS3 cite PS3 games as a primary reason, meaning that the PS2 compatibility was no longer necessary. Nevertheless, PS2 Classics which are playable on the PS3 have officially been introduced to the PlayStation Network for purchase afterwards, although they are only a selection of PS2 games republished in digital format and unlike PS3 games they lack of Trophy support. Later when the PlayStation 4 console was released, it was not backward compatible with either PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 2 games, although limited PS2 backward compatibility was later introduced, and PS4 owners might play a selected group of PS3 games by streaming them over the Internet using the PlayStation Now <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming</b> service.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} render {{hundreds}} or thousands of views for multi-user games on a <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming</b> at interactive rates, we need a solution which is both scalable and efficient. We present a new <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming</b> service system which supports multiple viewpoint rendering for visualizing a 3 D game scene dataset at the same time for the multi-user games. Our multi-view rendering algorithm maps well to the current graphics processing units (GPUs) and we have evaluated its performance on two different GPUs with different rendering resolution. The experimental results demonstrate the multi-view rendering method can be successfully applied to the multi-user games.

40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world where}} mobile {{computing}} systems are increasingly integrated with our day-to-day activities. People use mobile applications virtually everywhere they go, executing them on mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart watches. People commonly interact with mobile applications while performing other primary tasks such as walking and driving (e. g., using turn-by-turn directions while driving a car). Unfortunately, as an application becomes more mobile, it can experience resource scarcity (e. g., poor wireless connectivity) that is atypical in a traditional desktop environment. When critical resources become scarce, the usability of the mobile application deteriorates significantly. In this dissertation, I create system support that enables users to interact smoothly with mobile applications when wireless network connectivity is poor and when the user’s attention is limited. First, I show that speculative execution can mitigate user-perceived delays in application responsiveness caused by high-latency wireless network connectivity. I focus on <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming,</b> because the smooth usability of such application is highly dependent on low latency. User studies have shown that players are sensitive to as little as 60 ms of additional latency and are aggravated at latencies in excess of 100 ms. For <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming,</b> which relies on powerful servers to generate high-graphics quality gaming content, a slow network frustrates the user, who must wait a long time to see input actions reflected in the game. I show that by predicting the user’s future gaming inputs and by performing visual misprediction compensation at the client, <b>cloud-based</b> <b>gaming</b> can maintain good usability even with 120 ms of network latency. Next, I show that the usability of mobile applications in an attention-limited environment (i. e., driving a vehicle) can be improved by automatically checking whether interfaces meet best-practice guidelines and by adding attention-aware scheduling of application interactions. When a user is driving, any application that demands too much attention is an unsafe distraction. I first develop a model checker that systematically explores all reachable screens for an application and determines whether the application conforms to best-practice vehicular UI guidelines. I find that even well- known vehicular applications (e. g., Google Maps and TomTom) can often demand too much of the driver’s attention. Next, I consider the case where applications run in the background and initiate interactions with the driver. I show that by quantifying the driver’s available attention and the attention demand of an interaction, real-time scheduling can be used to prevent attention overload in varying driving conditions...|$|E
