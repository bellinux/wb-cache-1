5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die <b>casting,</b> {{also known}} as direct-injection die <b>casting</b> or runnerless die <b>casting,</b> is a zinc die <b>casting</b> process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E

5|$|The <b>casting</b> {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die <b>casting</b> is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die <b>casting</b> produces more castings than any other <b>casting</b> process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by <b>casting</b> standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to die <b>casting</b> is {{the very}} high capital cost. Both the <b>casting</b> equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other <b>casting</b> processes. Therefore, to make die <b>casting</b> an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and <b>casting</b> weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die <b>casting</b> process the final <b>casting</b> will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die <b>casting</b> is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a die <b>casting</b> process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die <b>casting</b> process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze <b>casting</b> (explained below).|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s the {{introduction}} of new <b>cast</b> lining has meant that fiberglass <b>casts</b> with this liner are completely waterproof, allowing patients to bathe, shower, and swim while wearing a <b>cast.</b> The waterproof <b>cast</b> liner however adds approximately 2 to 3 more minutes to the application time of the <b>cast</b> and increases the cost of the <b>cast.</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a reliable and}} rapid method for detecting and removing a color <b>cast</b> (i. e. a superimposed dominant color) in a digital image without any a priori knowledge of its semantic content.

If an evident or ambiguous <b>cast</b> is found, a <b>cast</b> remover step, {{a modified version of}} the white balance algorithm, is then applied in the two cases of evident or ambiguous <b>casts.</b> The method we propose has been tuned and tested with positive results on a data set of over 650 images...|$|R
5|$|The Acurad {{system was}} the first die <b>casting</b> process that could {{successfully}} cast low-iron aluminum alloys, such as A356 and A357.

5|$|The <b>casting</b> {{approach}} for CarnivÃ le {{was to find}} the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. CarnivÃ les <b>casting</b> directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in <b>casting</b> freaks from previous projects. They attended theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly to find people with unique and distinct looks, which was trying as Los Angeles is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions for established actors such as Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie).|$|E
5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished <b>casting</b> will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the <b>casting</b> will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the <b>casting</b> out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the <b>casting</b> is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the <b>casting</b> to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the <b>casting</b> is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
