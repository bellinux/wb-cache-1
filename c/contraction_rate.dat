In order to help negotiators at the UNFCCC negotiations internationally share this emissions contraction-budget {{in a way that}} is less arbitrary and chaotic than it was under 'Kyoto', the C&C model will calculate any rate of linear convergence of all Parties to the global per capita average arising under the chosen <b>contraction</b> <b>rate.</b> This can be on year anywhere between immediate and 'end-of-term' with or without a population base-year as desired. As Prof Ross Garnaut has observed in his 'Review' for the Australian Government, [...] "this rate-of-convergence is the main equity lever" [...] in the negotiations. Practically it means that the sooner the convergence occurs, the faster the gap between under-consumers and over consumers is closed but within the agreed contraction budget.

Our focus is on obtaining quantitative finite sample bounds ensuring sufficient posterior probability assigned in neighborhoods of the true regression coefficient vector, β^ 0, with high probability. We assume that β^ 0 is approximately S-sparse and obtain universal bounds, which provide insight into the role of the prior in controlling concentration of the posterior. Based on these finite sample bounds, we examine the implied asymptotic <b>contraction</b> <b>rates</b> for several examples showing that sparsely-structured and heavy-tail shrinkage priors exhibit rapid <b>contraction</b> <b>rates.</b> We also demonstrate that a stronger result holds for the Uniform-Gaussian[A binary vector of indicators (γ) is drawn from the uniform distribution on the set of binary sequences with exactly S ones, and then each β_i∼N(0,V^ 2) if γ_i= 1 and β_i= 0 if γ_i= 0. ] prior.

To quantify estimation uncertainty, we construct credible sets for these two quantities that have high coverage probabilities with optimal sizes. If one is allowed to collect data sequentially, we further propose a Bayesian two-stage estimation procedure, where a second stage posterior is built based on samples collected within a credible set arising from a first stage posterior.

40|$|The {{contraction}} of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which {{is produced by}} the sliding of myosin II along actin filaments, drives important cellular activities such as cytokinesis and cell migration. To explain the contraction velocities observed in such physiological processes, we have studied the {{contraction of}} intact cytoskeletons of Dictyostelium discoideum cells after removing the plasma membrane using Triton X- 100. The technique developed in this work allows for the quantitative measurement of contraction rates of individual cytoskeletons. The relationship of the contraction rates with forces was analyzed using three different myosins with different in vitro sliding velocities. The cytoskeletons containing these myosins were always contractile and the <b>contraction</b> <b>rate</b> was correlated with the sliding velocity of the myosins. However, {{the values of the}} <b>contraction</b> <b>rate</b> were two to three orders of magnitude slower than expected from the in vitro sliding velocities of the myosins, presumably due to internal and external resistive forces. The contraction process also depended on actin cross-linking proteins. The lack of α-actinin increased the <b>contraction</b> <b>rate</b> 2 -fold and reduced the capacity of the cytoskeleton to retain internal materials, while the lack of filamin resulted in the ATP-dependent disruption of the cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the myosin-dependent <b>contraction</b> <b>rate</b> of intact contractile rings is also reportedly much slower than the in vitro sliding velocity of myosin, and is similar to the contraction rates of cytoskeletons (different by only 2 – 3 fold), suggesting that the contraction of intact cells and cytoskeletons is limited by common mechanisms...|$|E
