Gumbu is on {{the edge}} of the Sahel, where {{sedentary}} farming peoples actively par-ticipated in trade and conflicts within this transition zone. Fighting first broke out between Gumbu and rival, neighboring, even related political formations. Alliances and conflicts were not based on ethnie groups. Through these wars, people gloried in their group and asserted their families' political ambition; the social wounds these wars inflicted on various parties have left lasting memories. The nature of this warfare changed as more powerful states (Segu, Masina <b>or</b> <b>Dina)</b> brought pressure to bear. These states, developing thanks to the Atlantic slave trade, came to arbitrate conflicts in this region. Their intervention—some- times at the request of one of the parties to a conflict, sometimes on their own—broke the warrior spirit of emulation and ended by placing valor in the service of El Haj Umar's military interests.

40|$|Com o objetivo de levantar dados sobre sua mineralogia, geologia e atualizar informações sobre suas propriedades cerâmicas, as argilas da região da Bacia do Alto Tietê foram estudadas através de análises granulométricas, análises químicas, análises térmicas diferenciais, difração de raios X e ensaios cerâmicos. A partir dos dados obtidos, pode-se concluir que os sedimentos são constituídos por argilomineral do grupo da caolinita, micas, quartzo e gibbsita. A gibbsita parece ser mineral autigênico, pois não aparece nas litologias adjacentes, além de ocorrer intimamente misturado ao mineral caolinita nas frações abaixo de 0, 002 mm. As amostras mais ricas no mineral gibbsita localizam-se numa das maiores várzeas da bacia. As amostras mais pobres no mineral gibbsita estão localizadas nas bordas da bacia, área de pequenas várzeas. A morfoscopia dos grãos da fração areia, angulosos e pouco arredondados, constituída principalmente por quartzo e micas, a ausência de estratificação e de estruturas sedimentares, sugerem a ocorrência de apenas um ciclo deposicional para os sedimentos estudados, que litologicamente se caracterizam como argilas sílticas ou arenosas. Do ponto de vista cerâmico, os materiais podem ser classificados como argilas refratárias. As mais aluminosas são indicadas para a fabricação de chamotas para refratários sílico-aluminosos, e ocorrem preferencialmente na região de grandes várzeas. Dois horizontes classificados como äreia-siltico-argilosa,̈ por beneficiamento em peneiras U. S. S. 325 (abertura 0, 044 mm) produziram materiais cujo comportamento frente aos ensaios cerâmicos, permite indicá-los como fonte alternativa de argilominerais para a indústria de cerâmica branca, ou como ligantes para chamota refratária. The clays {{from the}} High Tietê River Basin were studied {{by means of}} grain size analysis, {{chemical}} analysis differential thermal analysis, X ray diffraction analysis and ceramic tests. This study was carried out aiming at the collection of data about their mineralogical and geological characteristics {{and in order to}} bring up-to-date information about their ceramic properties. The data showed that the sediments consist of clay minerals of the kaolinite group, mica, quartz and gibbsite. The latter one seems to be an authigenic mineral as it does not occur in the adjacent lithology. Besides, it is intimately aggregated to kaolinite in fractions under 0. 002 mm. The richest samples of gibbsite {{can be found in the}} larger meadow areas of the basin. The poorest samples occur in the basin edges, in smaller meadow areas. The morphoscopy of the sand fraction grains - consisting mainly of quartz and mica - which shows angular and not always rounded grains, and the lack of stratification and sedimentary structures suggest the occurrence of just one deposition cycle for the studied sediments. These sediments are lithologically considered as silty clays or sandy clays. Under a ceramic point of view, the studied materials can be classified as refractory clays. The ones with a higher alumina content are used in the making of chamotte for silica-aluminous refractories and occur preferably in the larger meadow areas. The ones with less alumina content can be used as a bonding agent in <b>chamotte</b> <b>or</b> as a component of white-ware batches. They occur in the smaller meadow areas. Two samples classified as s̈ilty-clay-sands,̈ after passing through U. S.

40|$|Killing of Escherichia coli by {{hydrogen}} peroxide proceeds by two modes. Mode one killing {{appears to be}} due to DNA damage, has a maximum near 1 to 3 mM H 2 O 2, and requires active metabolism during exposure. Mode two killing is due to uncharacterized damage, occurs in the absence of metabolism, and exhibits a classical multiple-order dose-response curve up to at least 50 mM H 2 O 2 (J. A. Imlay and S. Linn, J. Bacteriol. 166 : 519 - 527, 1986). H 2 O 2 induces the SOS response in proportion to the degree of killing by the mode one pathway, i. e., induction is maximal after exposure to 1 to 3 mM H 2 O 2. Mutant strains that cannot induce the SOS regulon are hypersensitive to peroxide. Analysis of the sensitivities of mutants that are deficient in individual SOS-regulated functions suggested that the SOS-mediated protection is due to the enhanced synthesis of recA protein, which is rate limiting for recombinational DNA repair. Specifically, strains wholly blocked in both SOS induction and DNA recombination were no more sensitive than mutants that are blocked in only one of these two functions, and strains carrying mutations in uvrA, -B, -C, or -D, sfiA, umuC or -D, ssb, <b>or</b> <b>dinA,</b> -B, -D, -F, -G, -H, -I, or -J were not abnormally sensitive to killing by H 2 O 2. After exposure to H 2 O 2, mutagenesis and filamentation also occurred with the dose response characteristic of SOS induction and mode one killing, but these responses were not dependent on the lexA-regulated umuC mutagenesis or sfiA filamentation functions, respectively. Exposure of E. coli to H 2 O 2 also resulted in the induction of functions under control of the oxyR regulon that enhance the scavenging of active oxygen species, thereby reducing the sensitivity to H 2 O 2. Catalase levels increased 10 -fold during this induction, and katE katG mutants, which totally lack catalase, while not abnormally sensitive to killing by H 2 O 2 in the naive state, did not exhibit the induced protective response. Protection equal to that observed during oxyR induction could be achieved by the addition of catalase to cultures of naive cells in an amount equivalent to that induced by the oxyR response. Thus, the induction of catalase is necessary and sufficient for the observed oxyR-directed resistance to killing by H 2 O 2. Although superoxide dismutase appeared to be uninvolved in this enhanced protective response, sodA sodB mutants, which totally lack superoxide dismutase, were especially sensitive to mode one killing by H 2 O 2 in the naive state. gshB mutants, which lack glutathione, were not abnormally sensitive to killing by H 2 O 2...|$|R

40|$|This thesis project {{investigates the}} methods of {{implementing}} ceramics in glassblowing processes. Many practitioners regard ceramics and glass as incompatible materials in glassblowing process, due to difficulty of bringing them together. Main reason behind this incompatibility is the difference in expansion and contraction rates of ceramics and glass, along with thermal shock resistance and durability requirements of this process. Due to nature of this process, this project implemented empirical material research methods in ceramics and developed experimental production processes in glass, while following practice-led design research methodologies. The material research in ceramics involved with testing and analysing existing clay bodies such as earthenware, porcelain <b>or</b> <b>chamotte</b> mixtures for creating reference data on how ceramics behave in glassblowing process. Utilizing this data, numerous specialized clay bodies developed and experimented in glassblowing process. Two clay body types, which are durable and effective in glassblowing process, developed {{as a result of}} this research. Process in glass studio initiated with testing compatibility and thermal capabilities of the ceramics in glassblowing process. Following the development of durable clay bodies, glass studio activities focussed on design and production of prototypes and artworks with this material combination. Objects designed and produced during this project aimed to combine ceramics and glass together in a juxtaposition. In my opinion, this combination starts a dialogue among materials, and through this dialogue, each material expresses their individual character in their form and textures, yet compromise their materiality to accommodate the other. This research is an attempt to bring a new perspective and approach to ceramics and glass design, through material research and process development. Outcomes of this research presents a method for developing clay bodies suitable for utilizing in glassblowing process, along with a collection of objects and artworks displaying the aesthetic and functional possibilities of this material combination...|$|R
