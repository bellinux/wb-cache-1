Different characteristics of batteries from various manufacturers have been studied in several battery testing experiments. Among the investigated properties are the relations of capacity, state of charge (SOC) and end-of-charge voltage as well as different charge-discharge durations. Differences between the capacities specified by manufacturers and the ones actually reached in experiments are reported.

The centralized controller allocates EV <b>charging</b> <b>durations</b> considering network constraints. The decentralized controller adjusts EV and HP loads based on consumer satisfaction, network constraints, and electricity prices. Normal probability distribution and median filter were used to predict aggregated power of EVs, HPs, and PV arrays on a half-hourly basis over a year. Because of an expected surplus of PV power generation, a considerable demand reduction followed by a sharp demand increase will occur with these residential DER units during summer days in 2035. A low voltage section of test network was used to study the impact of uncontrolled EV charging loads on a three-phase four-wire system. Different combinations of EVs, HPs, and PV arrays were used to investigate their uncertainties in a low voltage section of real network. Real-world trials were used to generate the individual power of residential customers and DER units. Results of unbalanced power flow indicated that network constraints exceeded their limits with a high number of these low carbon technologies.
