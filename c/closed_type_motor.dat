50|$|A {{pneumatic}} motor (Air motor) or compressed air engine is a <b>type</b> of <b>motor</b> which does mechanical work by expanding compressed air. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveA {{retrospective}} assessment {{of differences in}} congenital cholesteatoma CT findings {{with a focus on}} type of cholesteatoma mass. Materials and methodsThe medical records and CT images of 14 patients with congenital cholesteatomas in the middle ear who underwent surgery at our institution between January 2009 and July 2014 were reviewed. Cholesteatomas were classified as <b>closed</b> <b>type,</b> open type, or mixed type based on intraoperative findings. The CT findings including cholesteatoma size, location, and shape were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsEight patients had <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholesteatomas, four had mixed type, and two had open type. The mean size of all cholesteatomas was 5. 1 mm. None of the cholesteatoma types indicated a tendency towards a certain location. The round shape was observed more frequently in <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholesteatomas than in other types (closed: 5 / 8; mixed: 1 / 4; open: 0 / 2). Two large <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholseteatomas and two mixed type cholesteatomas exhibited a constricted shape. Both of the open type cholesteatomas displayed an irregular shape. ConclusionSmall <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> congenital cholesteatomas were typically observed as round shaped lesions, but large <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholesteatomas and other type cholesteatomas tended to display shapes other than round...|$|R
