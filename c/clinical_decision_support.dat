25|$|Pharmacy {{professionals}} have extensively studied {{the causes of}} errors in the prescribing, preparation, dispensing and administration of medications. As {{far back as the}} 1930s, pharmacists worked with physicians to select, from many options, the safest and most effective drugs available for use in hospitals. The process is known as the Formulary System and the list of drugs is known as the Formulary. In the 1960s, hospitals implemented unit dose packaging and unit dose drug distribution systems {{to reduce the risk of}} wrong drug and wrong dose errors in hospitalized patients; centralized sterile admixture services were shown to decrease the risks of contaminated and infected intravenous medications; and pharmacists provided drug information and <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> directly to physicians to improve the safe and effective use of medications. Pharmacists are recognized experts in medication safety and have made many contributions that reduce error and improve patient care over the last 50 years. More recently, governments have attempted to address issues like patient-pharmacists communication and consumer knowledge through measures like the Australian Government's Quality Use of Medicines policy.|$|E
500|$|In healthcare, Watson's natural language, {{hypothesis}} generation, and evidence-based learning {{capabilities are}} being investigated {{to see how}} Watson may contribute to <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> systems for use by medical professionals. To aid physicians {{in the treatment of}} their patients, once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors, Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information; then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patient's medical and hereditary history; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses; and finally provides a list of individualized, confidence-scored recommendations. The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data, notes from physicians and nurses, research materials, clinical studies, journal articles, and patient information. Despite being developed and marketed as a [...] "diagnosis and treatment advisor", Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process, only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed.|$|E

2500|$|ICD-11 invokes a more {{sophisticated}} architecture than historical versions, consistent with its generation as a digital resource. [...] The core content of the system, called the Foundation Component, is a semantic network of words and terms, where any given term can {{have more than one}} parent. [...] To address the requirement that statistical classifications exhibit mutual exclusiveness (so events are not counted more than once) and exhaustiveness (so there is a place to tally all events), ICD11 supports the serialization of the Foundation Component into an arbitrary number of linearizations, optimized for use cases. [...] The main linearization, presently called the Joint Linearization for Morbidity and Mortality Statistics, is the tabular format with which most traditional users will become familiar. However, other linearizations, for primary care, multiple sub-specialty derivatives, or applications such as <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> are possible. [...] Finally, preliminary work in partnership with the IHTSDO is underway to ensure that the ICD-11 Foundation Component is semantically coherent through development of the Common Ontology, a subset of SNOMED CT which will anchor the Foundation Component to terms defined through description logic.|$|E
2500|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and knowledge engineering {{are central to}} AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of [...] "what exists" [...] is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language. The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations are suitable for content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> <b>support,</b> knowledge discovery via automated reasoning (inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge), etc. Video events are often represented as SWRL rules, which can be used, among others, to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos.|$|E

This thesis reviews the relevance and effect of <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> making <b>support</b> tools on pregnancy outcomes. Relevance of three <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> making <b>support</b> tools available to frontline providers of care in the Greater Accra region is discussed. These are routine maternal health service delivery data population based reproductive data and clinical care guidelines. First, the quality of routine health system data, determined by the completeness and accuracy of transfer of routine antenatal and delivery service data in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana is assessed and found to be good and reliable for use for decision making. Secondly, predictors of skilled attendance at delivery were identified amongst women who attend antenatal clinic at least once during their pregnancy in Ghana, using the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data. These predictors were wealth status class, rural or urban residency, previous delivery complication and health insurance coverage. Finally, adherence to first antenatal care guidelines was assessed. Overall, complete adherence to guidelines was low and providers were more likely to completely adhere to guidelines when caring for women 20 years or older, employed and married women. Also, public health facility resource availability in relation to provider adherence to first antenatal visit guidelines was explored. It was evident that although antenatal workload varies across different facility types in the Greater Accra region, other health facility resources that support implementation of first antenatal care guidelines are equally available in all the facilities. Thus, availability of these resources do not adequately account for the low and varying proportions of complete adherence to guidelines across facility types. Regarding effect, two <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> making <b>support</b> tools (first antenatal care guidelines and mobile health) on pregnancy outcomes were examined. Complete adherence to first antenatal care guidelines decreased risk of any neonatal complication and delivery complication. A systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting health care workers to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was conducted. From this review, mHealth interventions were used as communication, data collection, or educational tool by health care providers in the provision of antenatal, delivery and postnatal care. None of the studies directly assessed effect of mHealth on maternal and neonatal mortality. We conclude that there is a gap in the knowledge of whether mHealth interventions directly affect maternal and neonatal outcomes and future research should address this gap. In conclusion I discuss the importance of reducing subjectivity of provider judgement by encouraging them to use available <b>clinical</b> <b>decision</b> making <b>support</b> tools. I also emphasize the need for them to be supported by the health system to be able to incorporate these tools in their daily practice to enhance the quality of care for mothers and improve pregnancy outcomes...|$|R

Nonetheless, few systems have so far been successful in entering routine use. On the one hand, primarily due to methodological difficulties and with very few exceptions, developers have failed to show that pertinent systems are effective in improving patient care. On the other hand, support systems have not been sufficiently well integrated into the routine information processing activity of the clinical users. As a consequence, their clinical utility is disputed and constructive assessmenist further hindered.

Clinical evidence from both long-term and short-term trials has been reported by some researchers. Such systems appear to be effective not only in reducing the levels of HbA 1 c but also in stabilizing glucose control. However, most notably, evidence for the cost-effectiveness of such a system should be demonstrated before it can be propagated out to the general population in actual clinical practice.
