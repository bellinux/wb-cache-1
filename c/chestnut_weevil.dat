5000|$|The <b>{{chestnut}}</b> <b>weevil</b> (Curculio elephas) {{most often}} damages the fruits. In Hungary, it swarms in chestnut orchards around August 20, particularly strongly around noon and in sunny weather. The eggs are laid into the cupules {{or around the}} peduncle joints. The larvae feed on the nuts and leave only nutchips and excrement within. While the chestnuts ripen, the larvae retreat into the ground after having chewed {{their way out of}} the nuts. The following July, they turn into pupae. The larvae of the <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil</b> can only chew their way out of a fallen nut, so breeding occurs mostly where chestnuts lie on the ground for a sufficient length of time, or where the trees produce many small fruits which remain behind at the harvest. Timing the harvests to pick up the chestnuts as soon as they fall reduces the numbers of the overwintering larvae. Regular soil work is also unfavourable to its life habits. Small grafts are sprayed with chemicals. A warm aerosol-based protection has been developed for older trees, by Sifter and Bürgés in 1971.It is not recommended to plant chestnut orchards beside Turkey oak forests, because both trees are susceptible to the <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil</b> (which also uses the Turkey oak acorn to develop), and the Turkey oak trees can pass it on to the chestnut trees.|$|E
5000|$|In Hungary, {{the most}} common moth {{threatening}} chestnut trees is the acorn moth (Laspeyreisa splendana) and its subspecies. Its grayish-yellow larvae cause similar damage {{to that of the}} <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil,</b> but they spin characteristic webs among the nutchips and larval excrement. This moth causes about 5-41% of the damage that occurs in western Hungary's plantations. Plantations need regular protection against these moths, the occurrence of which does not decrease.|$|E

Curculio elephas (Gyll.) and Curculio propinquus (Desbr.) are the insect key pests of chestnut in Monti Cimini area (Viterbo, Italy). The second {{one is the}} most dangerous. The active ingredients (a. i.) used are the Rotenone and Lambda-cyalothrine.

40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>{{chestnut}}</b> <b>weevils</b> [Curculio propinquus (Desbr.) and Curculio elephas (Gyll.) ] are key insects in chestnut cultivation in many Italian regions. Although they have shown great variability through the years, pests can sometimes be very extensive affecting up to 60 - 70 % of the crop. For this reason our research team has carried {{out a series of}} studies on the setting up of sampling, control and post har- vest treatment methods. This paper briefly describes the biology of Curculio propinquus Desb. which is a serious pest in chestnut orchards in the province of Viterbo (Italy).

Chestnut trees were once a dominant sight across the deciduous forest of the eastern and central United States, but following a devastating blight in the early 1900 's much of the native range for this tree species has been lost. As interest in the restoration of the American chestnut tree increases, and as commercial production of chestnut fruit is being developed using blight resistant cultivars from Asia, a large quantity of both native and hybridized trees are coming into maturity and nut production across the United States. The two weevil species in the United States, the greater <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil</b> (Curculio caryatrypes, Boheman) and the lesser <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil</b> (Curculio sayi, Gyllenhal) attack ripening chestnut fruit, and they can devastate a chestnut operation. Of these two species, the lesser <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil</b> (C. sayi) has long been reported as the most common and most damaging chestnut pest insect species. Our study shows a bimodal emergence pattern for C. sayi, a finding not previously documented for this species of <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil.</b> Emergence patterns were consistent over the three years of this study, with the largest numbers of adults appearing in May and September each year. Underground study results indicate a minimum of 15 months in larval diapause prior to adult development for C. sayi. Most of the larvae emerged as adults in the second year, though some may hold over to emerge the third year. The flight ability of C. sayi allows them to travel up to 3 kilometers in a single flight, though average distances per flight were closer to 500 meters. There were no major differences in flight ability between the genders. This study lays the basic biological and ecological ground work required for continued research into C. sayi, and for the establishment of educated pest management...|$|E

40|$|Employing a {{reliable}} and effective method to seek cultigens or house pest insects in Jomon, "impression method", recent paleoethnobotanical studies have been progressing in Japanese archipelago or neighboring countries in East Asia. One of the amazing discoveries by "impression method" is the weevil Sitophilus sp. impression in Jomon pottery. It is believed that these insects might be a substantial synanthropic insects and an indicator to demonstrate presence of anthropogenic storing facilities for plant foods in prehistoric villages. Although as a stored product insect infesting stored acorns or <b>chestnuts</b> Jomon <b>weevils</b> have been recognized well {{it is not clear}} why the insects were put into the paste of pottery yet. To solve the problem, especially when these insects put into the paste in the process of pottery making we examine the positions and focus on the directions (ventral, dorsal, or side) of weevil impressions from Miyanosako Site where the most impressions of Sitophilus sp. weevil were discovered in Japan and from other samples in all of Japan. As a result maize weevil might not been impressed on the surface of potsherds when the insects were crawling on them but been put into the paste of pottery when the paste was preparing except a few examples...|$|R

40|$|Many phytophagus are {{reported}} to cause damage to chestnut trees (Paparatti et al. 1998, Pollini 1998, Cinti et al. 1995). However a recent survey carried out in Central Italy has identified <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil</b> (Curculio elephas Gyll.; Coleoptera, Curculionidae) and tortrix moths (Pammene fasciana L., Cydia fagiglandana (Zell.) and Cydia splendana Hb.; Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) as the most damaging pests of chestnut fruits (Speranza, 1999). During the last years {{the damage caused by}} the over cited insects increased remarkably. In order to have an idea of the flight activity of these pests, it has been decided to investigate the presence of adults of the 3 species of tortrix moths in 3 chestnut orchards {{in the area of the}} Monti Cimini, Viterbo (IT).

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} in chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) cultivation {{has increased in}} Central Italy. Government Research Departments have been requested to address issues concerning plant health in chestnut orchards. The most pressing problem {{is linked to the}} presence of phytophages, which directly affect production. Chestnut quality represents is the most important features of saleable production. The main phytophagi affecting this crop have already been identified by researchers as: Curculio elephas Gyll. (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), Pammene fasciana L., Cydia fagiglandana (Zell.), Cydia splendana L. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae), among which the Curculionidae are the key pests. In Central Italy there are areas (Vallerano, Viterbo) where C. elephas may attack as much as 90 % of production, compromising the whole yield. The presence of tortrix moths also affects saleable production, but infestation levels are always lower than <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil</b> levels.

40|$|International audienceMany plants, insects, and {{crustaceans}} show within-population {{variability in}} dormancy length. The {{question of whether}} such variability corresponds to a genetic polymorphism of pure strategies or a mixed bet-hedging strategy, and how the level of phenotypic variability can evolve remain unknown for most species. Using an eco-genetic model rooted in a 25 -year ecological field study of a <b>Chestnut</b> <b>weevil,</b> Curculio elephas, we show that its diapause-duration variability {{is more likely to}} have evolved by the spread of a bet-hedging strategy than by the establishment of a genetic polymorphism. Investigating further the adaptive dynamics of diapause-duration variability, we find two unanticipated patterns of general interest. First, there is a trade-off between the ability of bet-hedging strategies to persist on an ecological time scale and their ability to invade. The optimal strategy (in terms of persistence) cannot invade, whereas suboptimal bet-hedgers are good invaders. Second, we describe an original evolutionary dynamics where each bet-hedging strategy (defined by its rate of prolonged diapause) resists invasion by all others, so that the first type of bet-hedger to appear persists on an evolutionary time scale. Such "evolutionary priority effect" could drive the evolution of maladapted levels of diapause-duration variability...|$|E

40|$|Here we {{investigated}} the bacterial endosymbionts of weevils {{of the genus}} Curculio. From all four species of Curculio weevils examined, a novel group of bacterial gene sequences were consistently identified. Molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the sequences formed a distinct clade in the Gammaproteobacteria, which {{was not related to}} previously known groups of weevil endosymbionts such as Nardonella spp. and Sodalis-allied symbionts. In situ hybridization revealed that the bacterium was intracellularly harbored in a bacteriome associated with larval midgut. In adult females, the bacterium was localized in the germalia at the tip of each overiole, suggesting vertical transmission via ovarial passage. Diagnostic PCR surveys detected high prevalence of the bacterial infection in natural host populations. Electron microscopy identified the reduced cell wall of the bacterial cells, and the bacterial genes exhibited AT-biased nucleotide composition and accelerated molecular evolution, which are suggestive of a long-lasting endosymbiotic association. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the novel endocellular bacteria represent the primary symbiont of Curculio weevils and proposed the designation “Candidatus Curculioniphilus buchneri. ” In addition to “Ca. Curcu-lioniphilus, ” we identified Sodalis-allied gammaproteobacterial endosymbionts from the <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cur-culio sikkimensis, which exhibited partial infection frequencies in host insect populations and neither AT-biased nucleotide composition nor accelerated molecular evolution.

40|$|Black rot, {{induced by}} Rachodiella castaneae Pyr. [teleomorph: Sclerotinia pseudotuberosa Rehm.; syn.

Symptoms of black rot are frequent in nuts infested by C. propinquus, and hence an association between the fungus and the insect has been hypothesised. To verify this hypothesis, clusters of immature burrs from three trees in a chestnut area in Central Italy were covered with a net and treated as follow: (i) infested with C. propinquus adults that had been artificially contaminated with R. castaneae; (ii) infested with C. propinquus uncontaminated adults; (iii) uninfested negative control. At harvest time, the nets were re- moved and the adults of the insects and chestnut fruits were col- lected. Due to the inefficacy of traditional diagnostic methods, the detection R. castaneae in C. propinquus and in chestnut fruits was performed by PCR. Two sequences specific for R. castaneae were identified in the ITS region of rDNA, and two species-spe- cific primers (RAC 1 and RAC 2) were designed. R. castaneae was detected in more than 90 % of the chestnut weevils analysed, re- gardless the treatment, and in 77, 73, and 92 % of nuts following the treatments (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively. These findings sug- gest an endophytic habitus of R. castaneae in chestnut fruits and that C. propinquus is a potential vector of the pathogen...|$|E

"May 2011 "The most abundant volatile organic compounds (VOC) from chestnut reproductive plant tissue (catkin, nut and bur) were identified with gas chromatography and mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Two-choice behavioral bioassays were conducted with a Y-tube olfactometer using chestnut plant tissues (leaf, catkin, nut and bur) and individual VOC to assess the response of adult lesser <b>chestnut</b> <b>weevil,</b> Curculio sayi. Additionally, the electrophysiological response of the antennae of C. sayi adults towards both plant tissue and individual VOC from chestnut was examined using an electroantennogram (EAG). The behavioral bioassay and EAG data associated with chestnut plant tissue demonstrated that the insect does not respond directly to the sites of oviposition (nut tissue), but rather more strongly to the spiked bur encasing the nuts, the leaves, and the spring florescence (catkins). There were several differences between male and female responses to plant tissue and individual VOC, as well as significant differences between those insects collected in the spring compared to those from the fall season.
