40|$|MOTIVATION: The arbor morphologies {{of brain}} {{microglia}} are important indicators of cell activation. This paper fills {{the need for}} accurate, robust, adaptive, and scalable methods for reconstructing 3 -D microglial arbors & quantitatively mapping microglia activation states over extended brain tissue regions. RESULTS: Thick rat brain sections (100 - 300 mum) were multiplex immunolabeled for IBA 1 and Hoechst, and imaged by step-and-repeat confocal microscopy with automated 3 -D image mosaicing, producing seamless images of extended brain regions (e. g., 5, 903 x 9, 874 x 229 voxels). An over-complete dictionary based model was learned for the image-specific local structure of microglial processes. The microglial arbors were reconstructed seamlessly using an automated and scalable algorithm that exploits microglia-specific constraints. This method detected 80. 1 % and 92. 8 % more <b>centered</b> <b>arbor</b> points, and 53. 5 % and 55. 5 % fewer spurious points than existing vesselness and LoG based methods, respectively, and the traces were 13. 1 % and 15. 5 % more accurate based on the DIADEM metric. The arbor morphologies were quantified using Scorcioni's L-measure. Coifman's harmonic co-clustering revealed four morphologically distinct classes that concord with known microglia activation patterns. This enabled us to map spatial distributions of microglial activation and cell abundances.
