2500|$|The island {{lies about}} [...] {{east of the}} nearest point on {{southern}} Negros, [...] southeast of Cebu, [...] southwest of Bohol, and [...] north of Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao. It is predominantly hilly and in many places the hills reach the sea, producing precipitous cliffs. [...] At the <b>center,</b> <b>Mount</b> Malabahoc (locally known as Mount Bandilaan) reaches about [...] in elevation, the highest point on the island. Three marine terraces can be roughly traced especially {{in the vicinity of}} Tagibo on the southwestern part of the island, a barrio of San Juan municipality from the seacoast up into the central part.|$|E
2500|$|On July 19, 1874, an {{eruption}} of gases and ashes killed all the livestock on the island. From November 12–15, 1878, ashes ejected by the volcano covered the entire island. Another eruption {{took place in}} 1904 {{as a result of}} which a new outlet was formed in the southeastern wall of the principal crater. The last eruption from the Main Crater was in 1911 which obliterated the crater floor creating the present lake. In 1965, a huge explosion sliced off a huge part of the island, moving activity to a new eruption <b>center,</b> <b>Mount</b> Tabaro. Eruptions have also been recorded in 1634, 1635, 1641, 1645, 1790, 1825, 1842, 1873, 1885, 1903, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1976 and 1977.

2500|$|Great changes {{took place}} in the crater after the eruption. Before 1911, the crater floor was higher than Taal lake and had several {{separate}} openings in which were lakes of different colors. There was a green lake, a yellow lake, a red lake and some holes filled with hot water from which steam issued. Many places were covered with a shaky crust of volcanic material, full of crevices, which was always hot and on which it was rather dangerous to walk. Immediately after the explosion, the vari-colored lakes had disappeared and in their place was one large lake, about ten feet below the level of the lake surrounding the island. The crater lake gradually rose until it is on a level with the water in Taal Lake. Opinions after the creation of the lake that the presence of the water in the crater has a tendency to cool off the material below and thus lessen the chances of an explosion or make the volcano extinct, but the preponderance of expert opinion was otherwise.(The subsequent eruption in 1965 and succeeding activities came from a new eruptive <b>center,</b> <b>Mount</b> Tabaro.) ...|$|E
