Leeds avoided relegation in 1958–59, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division's worst defensive record.

5|$|Despite {{suffering}} a significant setback at the outset, when {{part of their}} small invasion force had its landing craft destroyed by Allied aircraft as they attempted {{to land on the}} coast behind the Australian defenders, the Japanese quickly pushed inland and began their advance towards the airfields. Heavy fighting followed as they encountered the Australian Militia troops that formed the first line of defence. These troops were steadily pushed back, but the Australians brought forward veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units that the Japanese had not expected. Allied air superiority helped tip the balance, providing close support to troops in combat and targeting Japanese logistics. Finding themselves heavily outnumbered, lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese withdrew their forces, with fighting <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> on 7 September 1942.|$|E
5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage was <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He {{also found that the}} well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E

Once in the village limits, the highway intersected Putnam Road (CR71) in an area of Cassadaga known as Burnhams. NY424 continued on into the heart of the village, passing by homes and the southern end of Lower Lake before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> at an intersection with NY60.|$|E

5|$|With the {{departure}} of Moore, Lynott decided to expand the line-up with two guitarists, and recruited two new members to complete a tour of Germany in May 1974. These were ex-Atomic Rooster and Hard Stuff guitarist John Cann, and Berlin-born Andy Gee, who had played with Peter Bardens and Ellis. It soon emerged that this lineup would be a temporary one, as Lynott and Cann did not get on well personally, and Gee was under contract to another record label. The tour was ended early when a disillusioned Downey quit the band {{and had to be}} begged to reconsider, at a time when Thin Lizzy's contract with Decca was <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E

Heskey's pass to Owen put him clear of the Bayern defence and one-on-one with Oliver Kahn. Owen attempted to chip the ball over Kahn, however the Bayern goalkeeper was able to save the shot. Immediately afterwards Bayern were on the attack. Bayern defender Willy Sagnol held off Riise and the crossed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, the cross was met by Giovane Élber whose header went wide of the Liverpool goal.

5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Ward's DSIR {{fellowship}} was <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b> Pryce {{had become}} a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Ward's colleagues P. T. Matthews and Abdus Salam were visiting members there in the 1950–1951 academic year. Through them, {{he was able to}} secure a $3,000 membership for the 1951–1952 academic year. It was at Princeton that he was introduced to the Ising Model, and met Mark Kac from Cornell University, with whom he would collaborate on an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method. His joint work with Kac on the Ising Model gave rise to what is now being called the Kac-Ward operator. When his membership ended he worked for the Bell Laboratories in 1952 and 1953. He then accepted an offer of a lectureship at the University of Adelaide from Bert Green, where he worked for a year before taking up another membership at the Institute for Advanced Study.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the age of fusion–evaporation reactions to produce superheavy elements is <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> due to the increasingly short half-lives to spontaneous fission and the looming proton drip line, so that new techniques such as nuclear transfer reactions (for example, firing uranium nuclei at each other and letting them exchange protons, potentially producing products with around 120 protons) would be required to reach the superactinides. On the other hand, many changes in techniques have been needed to synthesise transuranium elements, from neutron capture (until Z = 100) to light-ion bombardment (until Z = 110) to cold fusion (until Z = 113) and now hot fusion with 48Ca (until Z = 118), not to mention the essential difference before and after uranium between finding the elements chemically or spectroscopically in nature and synthesising them. In spite of this, the rate of discovery of new elements has remained at one every {{two and a half years}} on average for the past two and a half centuries.|$|E
5|$|Milošević's term {{in office}} in Yugoslavia was <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> and the {{elections}} that came on September 24, 2000, were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all {{came to a head}} on October 5 in the so-called Bulldozer Revolution. Milošević resigned on October 7. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December. Milošević was taken into custody on April 1, 2001, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide. Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević's trial in December 2003. He testified on issues ranging from the Srebrenica massacre to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career. Some anti-war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton (along with several others) as war criminals for NATO's entire bombing campaign, saying the entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter.|$|E
