This preservative contains additives such as propiconazole (0.6  %) and 3 -iodo- 2 -propynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC, 0.3  %), with modified linseed oil as a binder and water as a solvent. The second preservative was a commercially produced pine <b>tar</b> <b>mixed</b> in boiled linseed oil with turpentine (Claessons Trätjära AB, Göteborg, Sweden) for thinning the oil-based preservatives {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 4 : 2, respectively.

50|$|The Hotchkiss H35 {{was a small}} vehicle, 4.22 metres long, 1.95 m {{wide and}} 2.133 m tall and {{weighing}} 10.6-11.37 tonnes. The hull consisted of six cast armour sections, bolted together: the engine deck, the fighting compartment, {{the front of the}} hull, the back of the hull and two longitudinal sections left and right forming the bottom. The hull was made water-tight by cementing these sections together with Aslic, a product based on <b>tar</b> <b>mixed</b> with lime. The casting allowed for sloped armour, avoiding shot traps, to optimise the chance of deflection but the protection levels did not satisfy the Infantry. Maximum armour thickness was not the specified 40 mm but 34 mm. There were persistent quality problems, worsened by the fact that many subcontractors had to be used: at first the armour was made much too soft; when hardness was increased it became brittle and full of bubbles and hence weak spots.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational allergy among florists {{and people}} who work in cut flower {{production}} of Alstroemeria cultivars (Peruvian lily or Inca lily) has been previously reported. The allergen involved in sensitization is tulipalin A (alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone). CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 65 -year-old woman who developed severe dermatitis on her right thumb, index and middle fingers and less severe dermatitis on her left palm and front of forearm with occasional itching of the neck and face after taking up home gardening activities, including cutting flowers such as Alstroemeria. METHODS: The patient and three healthy individuals were submitted to epicutaneous tests with the European standard series, the plant series, and stem portions of three suspected ornamental plants (Alstroemeria, Lilium and Zantedeschia), garlic, and onion. RESULTS: Patch tests performed in our patient, revealed an extreme reaction (+ + +) to Alstroemeria and alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone, a strong reaction (+ +) to propolis and wood <b>tar</b> <b>mix,</b> a weak reaction (+) to balsam of Peru, an irritant reaction to garlic and negative results to diallyl disulfide and the other components investigated. Patch tests performed in the healthy individuals revealed negative. CONCLUSIONS: We stress the importance of Alstroemeria as a cause of allergic contact dermatitis not only in workers involved in the flower trade, but also in other people that come into contact with this plant in their leisure activities...|$|R
40|$|The report {{enclosed}} herewith relates the construction history and interim performance of an experimental pavement in which coal tar (RT- 12) was substituted for asphalt cement (PAC- 5) ··all other design features were basically similar to asphaltic concrete paving projects abutting {{each end of}} the experimental section. The resulting tar mixtures were in general conformity with Mixes 4 T {base) and 7 T (surface) of ASTM D 1753 - 67. Although the Marshall stability was 3000 pounds at I 00 °F, the tar surface course has thinned in the wheel tracks and thickened outside the wheel paths. <b>Tar</b> <b>mixes</b> have insufficient strength to withstand testing at 140 °F. The greater. sensitivity of the tar to summer temperatures [...] together with very heavy wheel loads �- suffice to explain the greater rutting occurring in the tar surface than in the asphalt sections. Only the heavy wheel loads were unanticipated. Deflection measurements indicate that the tar concrete pavement is otherwise comparable to the two asphaltic concrete pavements abutting thereto. Leveling of the existing surface, together with an insulating overlay of asphaltic concrete, should restore the pavement to normal service capabilities. Whereas the report indicates that 4. 5 inches would be needed to restore the pavement to the original 20 -year design, I would recommend a 2. 5 -inch overlay (plus. 5 -inch allowance for leveling) at this time [...] thereby deferring the remaining 2 inches until a mor...|$|R
50|$|Sidestream {{tobacco smoke}} {{is made up}} of many components, {{including}} <b>carbon</b> monoxide, <b>tar,</b> nicotine, ammonia, benzene, cadmium and 4-aminobiphenyl. Some of the other compounds found in sidestream smoke are: vinylchloride, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, acrolein, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, catechol, cresol, hydroquinone, lead, methyl ethyl ketone, nitric oxide, phenol, styrene, toluene, and butane. Exposure to sidestream smoke yields higher concentrations of these compounds as well as increased concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine in the blood. When comparing sidestream and mainstream condensate, side stream has 2-6 times more condensate per gram than mainstream smoke. Due to the incomplete combustion process responsible for the creation of sidestream smoke, there may be exposure to higher concentrations of carcinogens than are typically inhaled directly.|$|R

However, {{in spite of its}} potential, the use of bagasse as a source of energy is not so common. Bagasse, in fact, is considered a difficult fuel due to its fibrous nature, low bulk density and high moisture content, and the use of conventional stoker-fired combustors does not clearly show the economic feasibility of the process. Moreover, the high efficiency fluidized-bed technology cannot be directly applied to bagasse due to the difficulties associated with its fluidization. In this work, a two-stage gasification reactor is proposed for bagasse gasification. Bench scale gasification tests indicate that this reactor allows a complete gasification of biomass avoiding the formation of <b>carbon</b> and <b>tar.</b> Moreover, the use of a nickel catalyst makes the composition of outgoing syngas close to that predicted at the equilibrium conditions.
