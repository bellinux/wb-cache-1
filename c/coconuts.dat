5|$|At equilibrium, {{the demand}} for <b>coconuts</b> will equal the supply of <b>coconuts</b> and {{the demand for}} labour will equal the supply of labour.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between <b>coconuts</b> and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade <b>coconuts</b> for fish is different from the rate at which <b>coconuts</b> can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E
5|$|Key Biscayne {{was first}} {{developed}} for coconut cultivation. The earliest mention of <b>coconuts</b> on Key Biscayne is a Spanish account from 1568, although the reference {{may be to}} cocoplums rather than <b>coconuts.</b> Mature coconut trees were on Cape Florida by the 1830s, likely grown from <b>coconuts</b> sent from Mexico by Henry Perrine to the first lighthouse keeper, John Dubose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coconut</b> milk is {{distinguished}} from <b>coconut</b> water by its thicker consistency and milkier appearance. Unlike <b>coconut</b> water, {{which is the}} liquid found directly inside a <b>coconut,</b> <b>coconut</b> milk {{is the result of}} combining <b>coconut</b> water with <b>coconut</b> meat.|$|R
50|$|Coconut/Coco - Probably {{the most}} common dessert ingredient. Many delectable desserts are made with its milk (leche de coco), {{including}} <b>coconut</b> flan, <b>coconut</b> cream desserts, crunchy <b>coconut</b> squares, <b>coconut</b> meringue, candied <b>coconut</b> rice, and <b>coconut</b> bread pudding (boudin de pasas con coco).|$|R
50|$|Creamed <b>coconut</b> (also {{known as}} <b>coconut</b> cream {{concentrate}} or <b>coconut</b> butter) is a <b>coconut</b> product. It is the unsweetened dehydrated fresh meat of a mature <b>coconut,</b> {{ground to a}} semi-solid white creamy paste. It is sold {{in the form of}} a hard white block which can be stored at room temperature. The block is generally packaged in a sealed plastic pouch and some separation of the pure fat and the <b>coconut</b> flesh can be seen. In cookery, it is chopped into pieces or grated before it is added to dishes. By adding warm water it can be made into <b>coconut</b> milk or <b>coconut</b> cream. Adding water to creamed <b>coconut</b> in the ratio 5:2 gives <b>coconut</b> cream, 5:1 <b>coconut</b> milk.|$|R

5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey {{started an}} {{enterprise}} {{to develop the}} Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, and planting <b>coconuts.</b> Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked <b>coconuts</b> from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the <b>coconuts</b> on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E
5|$|The income {{generating}} {{activity in}} this case is gathering <b>coconuts.</b> As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering <b>coconuts,</b> the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.|$|E

The {{following}} data [31] for <b>coconut</b> cultivation are {{applied for the}} development of the sub-modules: sand bed preparation, <b>coconut</b> seedling, <b>coconut</b> plantation, irrigation, and fertilizing. Crude <b>coconut</b> oil and palm residues are the co-product and by-product, respectively, in the <b>coconut</b> shell production process.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>coconut</b> pie and tarts, <b>coconut</b> crust (the grated <b>coconut</b> is {{sweetened}} {{with sugar}} and baked in a flour crust folded over like a patty), tablata, which is the grated <b>coconut</b> meat mixed with thin ginger slices, sugar and water, baked and cut into squares; {{there is also the}} version called cut-o-brute, which is made of chunks of <b>coconut</b> instead of the grated pieces; and then there is trifle, made with half green grated <b>coconut,</b> milk, flour, sugar, eggs, lemon essence, margarine and baking powder (similar to <b>coconut</b> cake); <b>coconut</b> fudge; and <b>coconut</b> ice cream.|$|R
50|$|The {{various parts}} of the <b>coconut</b> have a number of culinary uses. The seed {{provides}} oil for frying, cooking, and making margarine. The white, fleshy part of the seed, the <b>coconut</b> meat, is used fresh or dried in cooking, especially in confections and desserts such as macaroons. Desiccated <b>coconut</b> or <b>coconut</b> milk made from it is frequently added to curries and other savory dishes. <b>Coconut</b> flour has also been developed for use in baking, to combat malnutrition. <b>Coconut</b> chips have been sold in the tourist regions of Hawaii and the Caribbean. <b>Coconut</b> butter is often used to describe solidified <b>coconut</b> oil, but has also been adopted as a name by certain specialty products made of <b>coconut</b> milk solids or puréed <b>coconut</b> meat and oil. Dried <b>coconut</b> is also used as the filling for many chocolate bars. Some dried <b>coconut</b> is purely <b>coconut,</b> but others are manufactured with other ingredients, such as sugar, propylene glycol, salt, and sodium metabisulfite. Shredded or flaked <b>coconut</b> is used as a garnish on some foods. Some countries in Southeast Asia use special <b>coconut</b> mutant called Kopyor <b>coconut</b> (Kopyor in Indonesia) or macapuno (in the Philippines) as dessert drinks.|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} function is concave in two dimensions and quasi-convex in three dimensions. This {{means that the}} longer Robinson works, the more <b>coconuts</b> {{he will be able}} to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of <b>coconuts</b> he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} intercept of the iso-profit line {{measures the}} level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, {{has the ability to}} purchase Π dollars worth of <b>coconuts.</b> Since PriceCoconuts is $1.00, Π number of <b>coconuts</b> can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a dividend of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.|$|E
5|$|This {{means that}} for every pound of <b>coconuts</b> Friday gives up, he can produce 2 more pounds of fish.|$|E
50|$|The cuisine of Tuvalu, {{is based}} on the staple of <b>coconut</b> which is used in {{different}} forms with <b>coconut</b> water, <b>coconut</b> milk and the flesh of the <b>coconut</b> being used to flavour dishes. Various desserts made on the islands include <b>coconut</b> and <b>coconut</b> milk, instead of the animal milk. Apart from its food value <b>coconut</b> palm leaves and wood have traditional uses as building materials.|$|R

5|$|The joint {{production}} possibilities {{set at the}} extreme right shows {{the total amount of}} both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers. If both of them work to gather <b>coconuts</b> only, the economy will have 144 <b>coconuts</b> in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.|$|E
5|$|Popular dishes include lechón, adobo, sinigang, kare-kare, tapa, crispy pata, pancit, lumpia, and halo-halo. Some common local {{ingredients}} used {{in cooking}} are calamansi, <b>coconuts,</b> saba (a kind of short wide plantain), mangoes, ube, milkfish, and fish sauce. Filipino taste buds {{tend to favor}} robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} <b>coconuts.</b> In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open <b>coconuts</b> in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
50|$|In India, <b>coconut</b> rice (Tamil: தேங்காய் சாதம்) {{is famous}} in the {{southern}} regions. In India <b>coconut</b> rice usually made from basmati rice with mild <b>coconut</b> flavours acquired from <b>coconut</b> milk, and commonly served with curries. It is made with <b>coconut</b> flakes (or grated or desiccated/dry <b>coconut).</b> One way to make this dish {{is to make the}} rice separately (preferably using a rice variety which is light and fluffy when cooked) and then mixing it with the <b>coconut</b> mixture (<b>coconut</b> flakes toasted in sesame/coconut oil and spiced with paprika, nuts, curry powder/leaves and other spices).|$|R
50|$|In Puerto Rico <b>coconut</b> rice {{is usually}} served with fish and sweet plantains. The rice is sautéed with <b>coconut</b> oil and salt, {{shredded}} <b>coconut</b> and <b>coconut</b> milk are then added with {{the option of}} garlic, onions, cilantro, raisins, and kumquats. The rice is then coved with a banana leaf during the cooking prosses. Another popular <b>coconut</b> rice dish is arroz con dulce (<b>coconut</b> rice pudding) a dessert made with milk, <b>coconut</b> milk, <b>coconut</b> cream, raisins, vanilla, rum, sugar, ginger, and spice. Puerto Rican rice pudding is popular in Colombia, Cuba, and Venezuela.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coconut</b> {{cream is}} very similar to <b>coconut</b> milk but {{contains}} less water. The difference is mainly consistency. It has a thicker, more paste-like consistency, while <b>coconut</b> milk is generally a liquid. <b>Coconut</b> cream is used as an ingredient in cooking, having a mild non-sweet taste.Coconut cream can be made by simmering 1 part shredded <b>coconut</b> with 1 part water or milk until frothy, then straining the mixture through a cheesecloth, squeezing out as much liquid as possible; this is <b>coconut</b> milk. The <b>coconut</b> milk is refrigerated and allowed to set. <b>Coconut</b> cream is the thick non-liquid part that separates and rises {{to the top of the}} <b>coconut</b> milk.|$|R

5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade. Available crops included millet, African rice, cocoyam, <b>coconuts,</b> bananas, citrus fruits, pomegranates, figs, sugar cane, cotton, and various vegetables, while the principal livestock was likely cattle. Sheep, goats, and chickens {{played an important role}} as well.|$|E
5|$|India is {{the largest}} {{producer}} {{in the world of}} milk, cashew nuts, <b>coconuts,</b> tea, ginger, turmeric and black pepper.

5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and <b>coconuts,</b> of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|Note that labour {{is assumed}} to be a 'bad', i.e., a {{commodity}} that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives. On the other hand, <b>coconuts</b> are goods. This is why the indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L'. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L*) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{the island}} was {{considered}} an arid location, where <b>coconuts</b> were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. In {{what has become a}} tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious {{to attract the attention of}} the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.|$|E
