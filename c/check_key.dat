The significant fluctuations in NdFeB magnet prices has encouraged designers to optimise magnet utilisation and to look at alternative magnet materials for wind turbine electrical generators. In this paper an analytical design model is developed for 6 MW offshore direct-drive wind turbine generators using different magnet materials (one with surface mounted NdFeB and another with flux concentrating ferrite magnet). Finite element method models are used to <b>check</b> <b>key</b> dependent variables calculated by the analytical models. The generator designs are optimised using a hybrid optimisation method incorporating a Genetic Algorithm and Pattern Search approaches. This is applied for four different objective functions, the first two which concentrate on maximising rated torque per unit magnet mass or unit of generator active material cost. They are simple and quick to execute but prioritise cost reduction and ignore lower efficiencies leading to lower turbine energy yields and hence poor cost of energy. A third objective function which seeks to minimise the sum of the generator active material cost and the costs of lost revenue over a finite number of operational years. This gives similar results to a fourth objective function which is an explicit turbine cost of energy calculation. The cost of NdFeB magnets affect the cost of energy of the surface mounted generator which tested with different cost € 40 /kg, € 60 /kg and € 80 /kg.

The privacy, authenticity, and integrity of the information transmitted or stored on networked computers must be maintained at every point of the transaction. Fortunately, cryptography provides algotrithms and techniques for keeping information secret, for determining that the contents of a transaction have not been tampered with, for determining who has really authorized the transaction, and for binding the involved parties with the contents of the transaction. Since we need security on every piece of digital equipment that helps conduct transactions over the internet in the near future, space and time performances of cryptographic algorithms will always remain to be among the most critical aspects of implementing cryptographic functions. A major class of cryptographic algorithms comprises public-key schemes which enable to realize the message integrity and authenticity <b>check,</b> <b>key</b> distribution, digital signature functions etc. An important category of public-key algorithms is that of elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC). One of the major advantages of elliptic curve cryptosystems is that they utilize much shorter key lengths in comparison to other well known algorithms such as RSA cryptosystems. However, as do the other public-key cryptosystems ECC also requires computationally intensive operations. Although the speed remains to be always the primary concern, other design constraints such as memory might be of significant importance for certain constrained platforms. In this thesis, we are interested in developing space- and time-efficient hardware and software implementations of the elliptic curve cryptosystems. The main focus of this work is to improve and devise algorithms and hardware architectures for arithmetic operations of finite fields used in elliptic curve cryptosystems...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: Private equity firms' average {{portfolio}} company holding periods {{have significantly}} lengthened {{over the last}} years, especially after the financial crisis of 2008. Recent studies on private equity exits have mainly focused on exit strategies and exit route decisions, and shed only {{some light on the}} exit timing decisions. I focus on the determinants of the private equity holding periods and provide evidence on the potential reasons behind the foregoing change. To my best knowledge, this study is the first one to address the lack of understanding behind the determinants of the prolonged private equity holding periods. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The sample used in this thesis is collected from VentureXpert, Zephyr and Orbis and covers the years from 2000 to 2015. I obtain data on 2, 328 European private equity buyout deals of which 1, 585 (68 %) are identified as deals with a known exit date and 743 (32 %) as current holdings. Univariate analysis is used to study the length of the private equity holding periods. To analyze the potential determinants of the prolonged private equity holding periods, I utilize a logistic regression model and Cox's proportional hazard model which is able to handle time-varying covariates. Multinomial logistic regressions and OLS are used as a robustness <b>check.</b> <b>KEY</b> FINDINGS: I find strong evidence that the private equity holding periods have significantly lengthened from the pre-crisis average of 4. 7 years to 5. 8 years after the financial crisis, despite the exit route. Additionally, only 42 % of the post-crisis exits were made in less than five years, compared to 61 % for the pre-crisis period. I find a time-varying combination of the operational development, private equity firm's experience and capital market conditions to be the main determinants of the exit timing decisions. Strong revenue growth increases the likelihood of an exit within five years from the initial investment. Holding periods are likely to be longer when more new buyout funds are raised, and new buyout market entrants have on average around 3 to 6 months longer holding periods. Furthermore, a one standard deviation tightening in the availability of credit decreases the likelihood of an exit within five years by 7. 5 % to 12. 6 %, and a 100 bps increase in BAA yield spread post-crisis results to a 7 to 10 months longer holding period on average. When IPO markets turn from "cold" to "hot" the likelihood of an exit within five years from the initial investment increases by around 31. 5 percentage points, translating to around 5 to 10 months shorter holding periods on average...|$|E

On {{using the}} known {{equivalence}} between {{the presence of}} a position-dependent mass (PDM) in the Schrödinger equation and a deformation of the canonical commutation relations, a method based on deformed shape invariance has recently been devised for generating pairs of potential and PDM for which the Schrödinger equation is exactly solvable. This approach has provided the bound-state energy spectrum, as well as the ground-state and the first few excited-state wavefunctions. The general wavefunctions have however remained unknown in explicit form because for their determination one would need the solutions of a rather tricky differential-difference equation. Here we show that solving this equation may be avoided by combining the deformed shape invariance technique with the point canonical transformation method in a novel way. It consists in employing our previous knowledge of the PDM problem energy spectrum to construct a constant-mass Schrödinger equation with similar characteristics and in deducing the PDM wavefunctions from the known constantmass ones. Finally, the equivalence of the wavefunctions coming from both approaches is <b>checked.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Schrödinger equation; position-dependent mass; shape invariance; point canonical transformation...|$|R

On the other hand, the boundedness plus the fact that models are linear structures make the problem suitable for a reduction to SAT- the satisfiability problem for propositional logic.
