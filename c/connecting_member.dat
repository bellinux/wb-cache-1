In a leg structure 110 of the robot apparatus, connecting bars 113, 114 and pivots 112a to 112d constitute a four-point link mechanism. A rod 117 is inserted into an opening formed in the distal end of a leg part 116. A coil spring 118 as an elastic member is provided between {{one end of the}} rod 117 and the distal end of the leg part 116. A bar member 120 is connected and secured to a preset point of a <b>connecting</b> <b>member</b> 115 as a knee joint. The coil spring 118 is extended/contracted by the stretching/contraction of the <b>connecting</b> <b>member</b> 115. By the operation of the four-point link mechanism, the trajectory of the distal end of the leg part is linear. The coil spring 118 is mounted at a position such that the distance between a driving shaft 101 and the distal end of the bar member 120 has a substantially linear relationship with respect to the force virtually operating between a driving shaft 101 and the distal end of the bar member 120.Co-inventors: Takashi Yamamoto, Martin de Lasa, Shervin Talebinejad, Darrin Jewell, Robert Playter ...|$|E

When the first mode displacement is adopted as the displacement in free vibration state, interconnected strcture system is become a two-degrees-of-freedom (TDOF) system with two masses and three springs cnnected in series. The maximizing method of damping performance of the above TDOF system {{can be used for}} maximizing the damping performance of the structures interconnected.

40|$|The {{procedure}} {{of improving the}} structural damping performance was proposed by interconnecting three structures with two connecting members consisting of a spring and a damper.

And the tuning method of a connecting element in the above 3 DOF system to maximize the damping performance of the system was proposed. The approximate tuning method of the <b>connecting</b> <b>member</b> for maximizing the damping performance of the structures was proposed, using the tuning method of the connecting element in the 3 DOF system.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{collapse}} of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, MN in 2007 prompted {{an investigation into the}} design and inspection of the steel truss bridges. Further investigation into the collapse revealed that a gusset plate experienced sway buckling, causing the bridge failure. This bridge failure motivated research into the analysis and design of gusset plates. Another major motivation for the current research is the effect of the connecting member's stiffness on the capacity of the gusset plate, which is not considered in the current design methods. The research presented in this thesis discusses a nonlinear finite-element analysis approach using OpenSees for load rating gusset plates in steel structures. Using OpenSees to analyze and design gusset plates is a new approach and therefore validation of the model was required. Simple tension, bending, shear, h-refinement, element type, patch, and elastic range tests were conducted to validate the model. The major parameters studied in this research include: element size, material properties, <b>connecting</b> <b>member</b> stiffness, plate geometry, out-of-plane shape, and magnitude of out-of-plane imperfection at the loaded members in the gusset plate. The displacement at the centroid of the loaded members was monitored as well as out-of-plane displacement and stress contours in the gusset plate. The results showed a strong correlation to other finite-element analysis program predictions and experimental results from sway buckling experiments. This research affirmed recent findings that the <b>connecting</b> <b>member</b> stiffness has a significant effect on the load capacity of a gusset plate connection. The results and comparisons also show that the new method using OpenSees is conservative in predicting sway buckling in gusset plates with connecting members. The predicted failure load for both single and double gusset plate connections was found to be conservative as well. The current research has shown great promise in its ability to accurately and conservatively predict failure of gusset plates, which will assist in the design of gusset plates in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand to improve focusing accuracy and to accommodate higher frequencies in space communications and radio astronomy has created significant challenges {{for improving the}} capability of the constituent systems in radio antennas and telescopes. One important system is the radio antenna/telescope backup structure connections. The backup structure {{is a key element}} in providing a stable, precise and rigid support for the reflective surface. The ideal connection for these types of structures is rigid and concentric resulting in minimal deformation with stress/strain curves that are linear, repeatable and exhibiting no hysteresis over the entire service load range. Conceivably such a connection could be designed so that the stress/strain curve mimics the stress/strain characteristics of the <b>connecting</b> <b>member</b> in both tension and compression. When this is achieved then such joints can be said to be 'invisible' in the global behavior of the backup structure. At that point, overall reflector deflection becomes more linear and highly predictable. In conjunction with this advantage, optimized backup structure geometries, adaptive reflectors and compensating algorithms can best be applied in producing an instrument of unparalleled performance. This paper introduces Co-Axial Joint (CAJ) technology as the practical and economical means to produce an invisible connection...|$|E
