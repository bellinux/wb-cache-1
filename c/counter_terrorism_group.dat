40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is to examine Israel's <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> methods and their {{consequences}} and to debate the effectiveness of Israel's <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> policy. By stimulating a debate on these issues {{it is possible to}} identify a more effective <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> policy. In order to examine Israel's <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> methods, their consequences and effectiveness, it is necessary to first explore the overall concepts of <b>terrorism</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Then, because <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> policy is hard to evaluate if one does not look at the context which surrounds it, this thesis will therefore explore some aspects of Israeli security history which has and continues to influence its <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> policy. Furthermore, this thesis will provide an introduction to the general development of Palestinian resistance movements which will include a scrutiny of Hamas. This thesis has selected some of Israel's <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> methods, and will be examining the width and depth of these methods as well as their consequences on the Palestinian society in general and on Hamas in particular. In seeking to answer the more general question about the effectiveness of Israel's <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> policy the thesis will evaluate this aspect by relying on qualitative and quantitative indicators. This thesis will show that Israeli <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> methods do reduce the capacity of Hamas and as such has prevented certain attacks or incapacitated Hamas' military wing for a limited time; they have, however, had a limited effect in the long run. It will be shown that these methods have consequences far beyond reducing the terrorist organisation capacity, which deepen the root causes for terrorism and increase the motivation to continue the resistance...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{evaluates the}} nature of <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{cooperation}} between the EU and Israel in recent years. <b>Counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> policy and cooperation comprise a spectrum of activities ranging from declaratory statements, through intelligence exchange and police operations, to micro interventions and finally the large scale {{use of military force}} (Lassse 2002 : 43 - 50). Both in Israel and the EU there are various intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies dealing with <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism,</b> which affect the extent and quality of operational cooperation. Almost a decade after the events of 9 / 11, EU member states are still more focused on the internal dimension of <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism,</b> thus the cooperation in the field of <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> between Israel and the EU is characterized more by bilateral cooperation on a national level than by multinational cooperation on the European level. The cooperation between Israel and the EU on <b>counter</b> <b>terrorism</b> needs to be further enhanced, especially on the operational level and in information exchange between intelligence and law enforcement agencies...|$|R
