The <b>cumulative</b> <b>multiplier</b> amounts to 0. 7 and 1. 0 in the baseline, but increases to 1. 3 with a reasonably calibrated financial accelerator and a crisis-related increase of the share of liquidity constrained households. In the latter scenario, fiscal consolidation would be {{largely responsible for the}} decline in the output gap from 2011 - 2013.

30|$|The output {{response}} to a government consumption shock (Figure  2 A) resembles the output response profile to a government purchases shock, but it is slightly less persistent. The impact response of output is 0.29 p.p. of GDP and the cumulative response reaches 1.68 p.p of GDP {{two years after the}} shock. In the pre-EAP period the output response profile followed a hump-shaped pattern having a negative impact response. The response of unemployment is slightly more pronounced compared to a government purchases shock in the first 1 – 2  years after the shock but then it declines at a much faster pace (Figures  2 B- 2 C). The pre-EAP unemployment response is smaller on impact, but more pronounced until the 6 - 7 th quarter. Thereafter, it decays more rapidly. However, when considering only 2012 weights to construct the whole sample unemployment rate response we find an impact multiplier of - 0.34, with the response rising to - 0.49 p.p. of GDP one year after the shock (see Tables  1 and 2).

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{degree of}} financial-macro linkages in advanced economies {{as demonstrated by}} the recent Great Recession in the United States and Europe raises new challenges for fiscal policy making, in that it expands the potential impact of both tax and expenditure reforms through uncharted channels. In addition, we are faced with an increasingly globalized world, with substantial spillovers of economic policy between states and countries being driven not only by shifts in the demand for goods and services (as understood in the classic international trade literature), but also by movement of labor and highly mobile capital flows. This interdependence conditions the efficiency of domestic fiscal policy in unprecedented ways not captured by most standard closed economy macroeconomic models or traditional optimal tax theory. This dissertation is motivated by the combination of these two forces and investigates the reform of the financial sector and countercyclical new Keynesian fiscal stimuli as policy responses {{in the aftermath of the}} latest financial crisis and recession. The first chapter analyzes the effect of the introduction of financial transaction taxes in equity markets in France and Italy in 2012 and 2013, respectively, on asset returns, trading volume and market volatility. Using two natural experiments in a difference-in-differences design, I identify bounds on elasticity estimates for three categories of avoidance channels: real substitution away from taxed assets, retiming (anticipation of transaction realizations and portfolio lock-in), and tax arbitrage (cross-platform and financial instrument shifting). I find large responses on all margins, that account for significantly lower revenues than projected. By far the strongest behavioral response comes from high-frequency trading lock-in on regulated exchanges, with a high tax elasticity of this type of turnover in the order of - 9. The results shed light on features of optimal FTT design, suggesting they may be poor instruments for both revenue-raising and Pigouvian objectives. The second chapter complements the empirical analysis of the first chapter by analyzing the welfare implications of a linear financial transactions tax in a multi-period portfolio selection model with heterogeneous agents. Under certain conditions over the redistribution of government revenues, with no Pigouvian motives, I find such a tax may induce first-order losses due to the distortion of idiosyncratic risk-sharing (an implication which differs importantly from other literature on the role of taxation under uncertainty). A transaction tax induces both a contemporaneous inaction region and intertemporal shifting of transaction realizations. Given a segmented market over multiple trading platforms and the choice of at least two different tax instruments, I develop sufficient statistic formulas that differ from standard optimal commodity tax theory in that they account for untaxed capital accumulation, market structure rents, and uncertain returns. Furthermore, I explicitly consider retiming responses in transaction realizations and tax arbitrage in the form of shifting across trading platforms by allowing investors to choose trading in two different markets, and am able to match such parameters to empirically measured elasticities from my the first chapter, thus informing optimal FTT policy rates. In the case of a linear tax with a single market, the simplest model in this chapter suggests a cash equity transaction tax of 0. 67 % on the notional value of transactions purely to maximize revenue. A transaction tax induces both a contemporaneous inaction region and intertemporal shifting of transaction realizations. The third and final chapter deals with more aggregate effects of fiscal policy. It primarily contributes to the open economy local fiscal multiplier literature by estimating regional output and employment responses to federal expenditure shocks in the European Union. Specifically, I use a novel methodology and dataset on fiscal transfers from the European Commission to subnational regions. Mimicking the literature on foreign aid and growth, I use shocks to the supply of federal transfers (European Commission commitments) of structural fund spending by subnational region as instruments for annual realized expenditure in a panel from 2000 - 2013. By correctly isolating these fiscal shocks, I find significantly larger fiscal multipliers than the existing literature - a large, contemporaneous multiplier of 1. 7, which translates into a <b>cumulative</b> <b>multiplier</b> of 4 three years after the shock. Furthermore, using a novel dataset on bilateral trade between EU regions, I find evidence of demand-driven spillovers up to three years after a shock. In addition to direct implications for federal public finance management globally, these results represent an important step in our understanding of the effect of fiscal stimulus and austerity measures in countries undergoing financial and sovereign debt crises. Overall, this dissertation aims at answering key questions brought about by the increasing complexity and dynamism of financial and economic interdependence of agents across states and countries. The implications of the results presented here are broad, including the development of comprehensive global financial regulation, the characterization of banking and fiscal unions in the Eurozone, and the incorporation of financial markets into new macroeconomic policy making...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} by omitting {{uncertainty}} when estimating {{the effects of}} a government spending shock on GDP could lead to biased estimates. The fiscal multiplier is how much an increase in government spending increases gross domestic product (GDP). There are two main theoretical views of looking at the economy: the neoclassical and the new Keynesian view. Neoclassical models predict multipliers that can be positive and negative depending on, among other things, the taxation system, because consumers determine their consumption based on their lifetime budget constraint. In Keynesian models the size of the multiplier depend on the consumer’s the marginal propensity to consume and these models predict positive multipliers. The model used in this paper is a structural vector autoregression model (SVAR), this is a system of simultaneous equations. To estimate the effect of fiscal policy shock one must identify the system of equations. There are different ways to do this and there is wide disagreement among economist which approach is the best one. The first approach, and also the one used in this paper, is the approach introduced by Blanchard and Perotti in 2002, they use institutional information about the government to make the assumption that it takes more than one quarter for policymakers to react to changes in GDP. Then they use the Cholesky decomposition of matrices to identify the equation system and order government expenditure before output. This approach yields a positive multiplier, and finds that consumption rises in response to a government expenditure shock. This is in line with the New Keynesian view. Ramey and Shapiro (1998) use another approach, they use dates that are associated with large increases in military spending and see these as exogenous {{to the rest of the}} state of the economy to identify the equation system. Consumption actually falls in response to a government spending shock in this approach due to the negative effect taxes has on wealth. This is in line with the neoclassical view. There are some challenges to these identification approaches; one of them is fiscal foresight. If a consumer foresees a change or a change in fiscal policy is announced consumers can alter their behavior before the change is implemented and the whole effect of a change in in consumption in response to a fiscal policy shock might not be captured. Blanchard and Perotti (2002) find that the response of output to a government spending shock was larger once they took account of the anticipation effects. Another problem is simultaneity bias created if a change in GDP affects expenditure. This will lead to inconsistent estimates. Other factors that influence the size of the multiplier is the composition and persistence of the shock, how monetary policy is conducted, the size of the automatic stabilizers, exchange rate system, the development level of the country, debt and the openness of the economy. In some rare cases a fiscal contraction has actually had expansionary effects, this is known as the “Austerity myth”. Sutherland (1997) uses a model and shows that a fiscal expansion will have Keynesian effects at lower levels of debt, but at high levels of debt, on the other hand, a fiscal expansion can have contractorary effects. This is because the consumers have finite lives and high levels of debt makes it very likely that a fiscal consolidation will take place in their lifetime. Keynes introduces the term “Animal spirits” to explain how changes in economic agents sentiment can lead to downturns and Bloom (2009) shows that uncertainty often jumps after large shocks like oil-price shocks and terrorist attacks. This leads to a drop in aggregate demand and employment in the short run, since firms’ pause/postpone their investment decisions. Higher uncertainty can cause consumers to increase their saving in order to prepare for a more uncertain future, this is known as “precautionary saving” (Carroll 1992). Also investment decisions are affected by higher uncertainty because it makes firms more cautious and therefore makes firms less responsive to stimulative policies (Bloom 2009). The structural VAR used in this paper is based on the model in Caldara and Kamps (2008) and the Cholesky decomposition is used to identify the system of equations. As mentioned the identification approach used in this paper is the same one used in Blanchard and Perotti (2002), which turns the structural VAR into a recursive VAR. I have used MATLAB and performed the misspecification tests using the econometrics toolbox. The MATLAB code was obtained from the MATLAB file exchange, but minor changes have been made to the code. For the US I obtain a positive multiplier on impact and a negative <b>cumulative</b> <b>multiplier</b> for both models. In this case the multiplier is less negative when the volatility index measuring uncertainty is included in the model, which implies a that uncertainty has a negative bias on the effect a expenditure shock has on GDP. For the data from the United Kingdom I estimate a negative multiplier both on impact and cumulatively for both the models. However the multiplier is more negative when uncertainty is included in the model, by looking at the correlation between the volatility index and government expenditure I find a slightly negative correlation which means that uncertainty has a negative bias on the effect a expenditure shock has on GDP. In the case of Japan I estimate a positive multiplier in both of the models on impact and for the longer horizon. The multiplier is larger when uncertainty is included in the model, which implies that uncertainty has a negative bias on the effect a expenditure shock has on GDP. Norway is the only case where I find that uncertainty has a positive bias on the effect a expenditure shock has on GDP, but the multipliers are negative in both the models. The results of the estimation show that uncertainty does lead to biased estimates. In the case of Norway I obtain an overvaluation of the multiplier due to uncertainty. But this is most likely because the measurement used to measure uncertainty is like the Norwegian economy correlated with the price of oil, which will be posititve for the Norwegian economy, but more of a disadvantage to the other countries in the sample. For the United States, United Kingdom and Japan uncertainty has a negative bias on the estimated multiplier, this makes the estimate undervalued. Woodford (2010) shows how important monetary policy and the central bank’s response to changes in inflation is to determine the fiscal multiplier. Christiano et al. (2009) find that the fiscal policy has greater effect when the interest rate is low,this could explain the larger multiplier estimated for Japan because their Long-term interest rates have been very low compared to the interest rate in the other countries in the sample. In this paper the omission of uncertainty led to negatively biased estimates for the multiplier in Japan, the UK and the US. I used the identification approach used by Blanchard and Perotti (2002). The identification approach used by Ramey and Shapiro (1998) estimates lower multipliers than Blanchard and Perotti (2002) but one might argue that during war uncertainty is probably also high. As far as I know they have not taken account of uncertainty in their model and this might be one of the causes for the lower multiplier. This would be consistent with my findings for Japan, the United States and United Kingdom, but not for Norway. Even though I obtain a negative bias for Japan, the US and the UK it is important to note that the effect of government expenditure is small also when uncertainty is controlled for...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{short-term}} macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy in Colombia in a structural vector autoregression context.

The <b>cumulative</b> output <b>multiplier</b> fluctuates between 1. 12 and 1. 19 from the first to third year after the spending innovation. Shocks to direct taxation seem to be less efficient, because they mainly affect private investment, whereas shocks to indirect taxation do not seem to affect real activities significantly. From a policy perspective, our results support the smoothing role of fiscal policy on output fluctuations, which implies its capacity to restore real activity effectively in critical times like the ones currently being forecast.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} `Keynesian' fiscal stimuli when government deficits and debt rollovers are (possibly partially) financed by balance sheet constrained financial intermediaries. Because financial intermediaries operate under a leverage constraint, deficit financing of fiscal stimulus packages will cause interest rates to rise as private loans are crowded out by government debt in the credit provision channel. This lowers investment and (future) capital stocks, which affects output negatively for a prolonged period. Anticipations of these future consequences cause the price of capital and bonds to drop immediately when the policy is announced, inflicting capital losses on banks which leads to further tightening of leverage constraints and credit market conditions. This balance sheet effect triggers a negative amplification cycle further lowe ring the fiscal multiplier. Longer maturity debt leads to larger capital losses and lower Keynesian multipliers. When in addition sovereign default risk is introduced, additional capital losses may occur and outcomes deteriorate further after a deficit financed stimulus package, eventually implying a <b>cumulative</b> Keynesian <b>multiplier</b> close to zero or even negative. We do not argue that multipliers are always negative; but financial fragility and sovereign risk problems may severely lower them, possibly {{to the point of}} becoming negative...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{short-term}} macroeconomic effects of the fiscal policy in Colombia for the 1980 - 2007 period using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. Design/methodology/approach – The authors' benchmark is a five-variable SVAR model which includes government spending, output, tax revenues, inflation and short-term interest rates. In addition, the authors specified six-variable VAR models, adding in turn private consumption, private investment, the unemployment rate and the real minimum wage to the last set of variables. Two alternative identification techniques are used in the VARs to check the robustness of the results. Findings – The following effects of a positive government spending shock are found. First, the GDP responds positively and significantly during the first six quarters. The <b>cumulative</b> output <b>multiplier</b> fluctuates between 1. 12 and 1. 19. Second, both inflation and nominal interest rates respond positively and significantly. Third, the authors find a significant positive response by both private consumption and private investment. Finally, the unemployment rate reacts negatively and significantly. Research limitations/implications – The most surprising result comes from the response of output to a positive shock in taxes. Nonetheless, the positive respond of the GDP is short lived and has little significance. Practical implications – The authors' results support the smoothing role of fiscal policy on output fluctuations, which implies its capacity to restore real activity effectively in critical times like the ones currently being forecast. Originality/value – The negligible results found previously for Colombia could be related to the fiscal data used, which are not keep coherence with national accounting. To solve these obstacles, a quarterly fiscal database is assembled on an approximately accrual basis for the general government.

40|$|Transpiration-use {{efficiency}} coefficient (Kc) {{describes the}} amount of biomass produced per unit transpiration at a given vapor pressure deficit. A series of greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the Kc values of seven weed species and to measure how Kc values were affected by fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) level and plant growth stage. Experiments were conducted using a factorial design with 4 levels of water stress (0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 7, and 1. 0 FTSW) and two harvest times (first bloom and seed maturity). After plants attained a predetermined size, each plant was sealed at the base using a polyethylene bag. Pots were weighed daily and maintained the required weight by watering through an inserted syringe. Pre-bagging transpiration was back-calculated from 0 d to the first 20 d of measured daily transpiration. One set of plants was harvested at first bloom and another set was harvested at seed maturity. Kc was calculated as the ratio of total biomass to the <b>cumulative</b> transpiration <b>multiplied</b> by the average daytime vapor pressure deficit. FTSW level {{did not affect the}} Kc of henbit (vegetative growth) or shepherd’s purse. Kc values increased as FTSW levels declined for common lambsquarters, pinnate tansymustard, henbit (complete lifecycle) and field pennycress (vegetative growth). Kc values decreased as FTSW declined for dandelion, Carolina foxtail, and field pennycress (complete lifecycle) suggesting that these species were relatively sensitive to water stress. Plant growth stage did not affect Kc for pinnate tansymustard and dandelion. Kc values decreased between the first bloom and seed maturity for field pennycress, common lambsquarters, shepherd’s-purse and henbit. The decline in Kc may be attributed to high oil content in the seed of field pennycress, shepherd’s-purse and henbit, and the highprotein content of common lambsquarters. Carolina foxtail Kc values did not respond consistently to FTSW across harvest times – Kc values increased from first bloom to seed maturity at FTSW levels 0. 3 and 0. 4, but remained same at the 0. 7 FTSW level.

40|$|Background: The erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) {{epoetin alfa}} (EA) and darbepoetin alfa (DA) have {{comparable}} efficacy in treating chemotherapy-induced anaemia (CIA). Therapy choice depends on many factors, including cost. Previous estimates of ESA cost differences have been derived from claims data. These data lack clinical variables, such as baseline haemoglobin (Hb) level, which {{are likely to}} influence choice of ESA, dosing and costs. We estimated cost differences between DA and EA in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, using a propensity-score matched analysis of baseline patient characteristics with and without Hb values to assess {{the effect of this}} clinical variable on ESA cost estimates. Methods: Data were extracted from electronic medical records in two US databases between January 2004 and December 2006. The study sample included 6743 patients receiving chemotherapy, with one or more visits during the study period, who received an ESA during a chemotherapy episode. Episodes of chemotherapy care were constructed using a 90 -day gap in administration to identify the start and end. Patients receiving both DA and EA during their initial chemotherapy episode or with missing data were excluded, representing 42 % of patients with CIA receiving an ESA. Drug costs were calculated from the <b>cumulative</b> dose <b>multiplied</b> by 106 % of the average sales price (ASP) for DA or EA. Two propensity-score matches were conducted: first using variables available in administrative billing claims systems, then adding the baseline Hb test result. Regression-adjusted cost differences were estimated with and without baseline Hb, using generalized linear models. Results: Using baseline Hb levels resulted in a better match of the baseline characteristics for the EA and DA treatment groups than the original sample or the matched sample without Hb variables. Mean ESA costs (year 2007 values) for the original sample were $US 4171 for EA and $US 3811 for DA (mean difference $US 360; p[*]<[*] 0. 001, standard error [SE] $US 99). With propensity-score matching without Hb variables, mean estimated costs were $US 3836 for EA and $US 3599 for DA (mean difference $US 237; p[*]-[*] 0. 053, SE $US 123). With propensity-score match including Hb variables, mean costs were $US 3965 for EA and $US 3536 for DA (mean difference $US 429; p[*]-[*] 0. 001, SE $US 125). Cost differences in sensitivity analyses ranged between $US 102 (p[*]-[*] 0. 201) and $US 261 (p[*]-[*] 0. 003). Conclusions: Addition of baseline Hb level as a variable in propensity score and ESA cost models affects ESA treatment cost estimates in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Cost comparisons based on observational data should use analytical methods that account for differences in clinical variables between treatment groups. ...|$|R
40|$|In an {{influential}} paper from 1995, "International R&D spillovers", David Coe and Elhanan Helpman use data {{on trade and}} R&D expenditures for 22 countries to estimate {{the effects of a}} country's own R&D effort and the R&D effort of its trade partners on the country's TFP. They use a model of endogenous, innovation-driven growth as basis for the empirical equations. The main idea is that a country benefits from the cumulative R&D stock of its trade partners as well as its own R&D stock, through spillover effects from trade in intermediate inputs. The intermediate inputs can be horizontally differentiated, which means that a new input is equally good as an old, and investment in R&D increases the number of available varieties. The inputs can also be vertically differentiated, so that {{the development of a new}} input will replace an old one because of its increased quality. In the endogenous growth framework, R&D investments are made by firms seeking monopoly profits in imperfectly competetive markets. This R&D effort generates a product or process than can be patented and give rise to a profit for the firm, as well as a non-appropriable product that will increase the country's stock of knowledge. This non-appropriable part is what generates the spillover effect. In the case of horizontally differentiated inputs, the investments in R&D increase the stock of knowledge through an increase in the number of available inputs, which in turn decreases future R&D costs. With vertically differentiated inputs, the development of a higher quality input will enable future entrepreneurs to build on a higher quality foundation. In both cases, the stock of knowledge increases and there are spillovers from current to future R&D activities. Coe and Helpman (1995) argue that since intermediate inputs are traded internationally, a country's productivity depends on its own R&D stock as well as the R&D stock of its trade partners. The domestic R&D stock is constructed as the sum of the country's <b>cumulative</b> R&D expenditures, <b>multiplied</b> by a constant depreciation factor. In the basic specification used in Coe and Helpman (1995), the foreign R&D stock variable is constructed as a weighted sum of the R&D stocks of the country's trade partners, where the weight is the imports from one country as share of the total imports. They find a positive and significant effect of both R&D stocks on the country's TFP, and interpret this as evidence that there are significant international R&D spillovers from trade. Norway is one of the countries used in the paper. I use panel data on Norwegian firms to see whether this effect of imported R&D spillovers can be found on the firm level in Norway. The data set consists of data from the accounting and manufacturing statistics, as well as data on trade and R&D expenditures for Norwegian firms. This is combined with data on R&D expenditures on the sector level for 22 member countries of the OECD. The variables are constructed on the basis of the variables used in Coe and Helpman (1995) with some adjustments to fit the data set at hand. I estimate the basic specification from Coe and Helpman (1995) using the fixed effects estimator. The software used for the estimations is Stata 11. I find a positive and significant effect of the firm's own R&D stock. However, the foreign R&D stock appears to have no significant impact on the productivity of the firms. This indicates that any spillover effects that Norway might get from foreign R&D, are not transmitted through each firm's imported intermediate inputs. I also estimate several extensions of the original specification. In the first extension, I substitute the firm's own R&D stock with the lagged R&D expenditure, because of the nonstationarity of the R&D stock variable. In the second, the weights are changed to reflect the fact that a firm can purchase intermediate inputs domestically as well as internationally. The foreign R&D stock variable is then constructed using the imports from one country as share of total purchase of intermediate inputs as weights. The third extension is aggregating the foreign R&D stock variable to the sector level, to see if I can detect any intra-industry spillovers that are transmitted through trade in intermediate inputs. The positive and significant effect of the firm's own R&D stock is stable in the various specifications. The foreign R&D stock variable is however not statistically significant at any of the conventional levels. This confirms the indication that any spillover effects do not emanate from each firm's imports of intermediate inputs, and it also indicates that any spillover effects have to appear at a more aggregated level...|$|R
