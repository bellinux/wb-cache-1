In the present study, we used an electrometric method for measurement of <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> in the plasma and whole brain of three indigenous wild birds commonly found in northern Iraq. The birds used were apparently healthy adults of both sexes (8 birds/species, comprising 3 – 5 from each sex) of quail (Coturnix coturnix), collard dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and rock dove (Columba livia gaddi), which were captured in Mosul, Iraq. The mean respective <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> (Δ pH/ 30 minutes) in the plasma and whole brain of the birds were as follows: quail (0. 96 and 0. 29), collard dove (0. 97 and 0. 82) and rock dove (1. 44 and 1. 42). We examined the potential susceptibility of the plasma or whole brain cholinesterases to inhibition by selected insecticides. The technique of in vitro cholinesterase inhibition for 10 minutes by the organophosphate insecticides dichlorvos, malathion and monocrotophos (0. 5 and 1. 0 µM) and the carbamate insecticide carbaryl (5 and 10 µM) in the enzyme reaction mixtures showed significant inhibition of plasma and whole brain <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> to various extents.

40|$|Objective: To examine <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> in {{children}} from three towns in Yucatan, Mexico {{and their relationship}} with anthropometry. Methods: Plasma and erythrocyte <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> were measured in 104 children from Ticul, Merida and Progreso. Differences between gender, sampling sites and body mass index (BMI) group were evaluated. Weight, height, BMI, hip and waist circumferences were correlated with <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities.</b> Results: Significant differences in the waist circumference and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity were found among sites. Children from Ticul presented higher BChE activity compared to children from the other towns. Children from Progreso had a smaller hip circumference compared with children from the other two locations. There was a high prevalence of overweight and obese children (40. 3 %). The results indicated that obese children had higher BChE activity respect to healthy weight children. As expected, there were also significant waist and hip circumference differences for BMI groups. The results demonstrated a positive significant correlation between BChE activity and weight, waist and hip circumference.

A control group received drinking tap water. All experiments were conducted onthe chicks at the age of 15 days after exposure to H 2 O 2. The acute (24 h) oral LD 50 values of dichlorvosand diazinon in the insecticidal preparations as determined by the up-and-down method in the controlchicks were 9. 4 and 15. 6 mg/kg, respectively. Results: The poisoned chicks manifested signs ofcholinergic toxicosis within one hour after the dosing including salivation, lacrimation, gasping, frequentdefecation, drooping of wings, tremors, convulsions and recumbency. The acute (24 h) oral LD 50 valuesof dichlorvos and diazinon in chicks provided with H 2 O 2 were reduced to 3. 5 and 6. 5 mg/kg, by 63 and 58 %, respectively when compared to respective control LD 50 values. The intoxicated chicks also showedcholinergic signs of toxicosis as described above. Plasma, brain and liver <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> of thechicks exposed to H 2 O 2 were significantly lower than their respective control (H 2 O) values by 25, 28 and 27 %, respectively. Oral dosing of chicks with dichlorvos at 3 mg/kg significantly inhibited cholinesteraseactivities in the plasma, brain and liver of both control (42 - 67 %) and H 2 O 2 -treated (15 - 59 %) chicks. Diazinon at 5 mg/kg, orally also inhibited <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> in the plasma, brain and liver of bothcontrol (36 - 66 %) and H 2 O 2 -treated (15 - 30 %) chicks.

Conclusion: The data suggest that H 2 O 2 may potentiate the toxicity of organophosphate insecticidesirrespective of the extent of cholinesterase inhibition, and further studies are needed to examine the roleof oxidative stress in this potential toxicity outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{red-billed quelea}} bird Quelea quelea {{is one of}} sub-Saharan Africa’s most {{damaging}} pests, attacking small-grain crops throughout semi-arid zones. It is routinely controlled by spraying its breeding colonies and roosts with organophosphate pesticides, actions often associated with detrimental effects on non-target organisms. Attributions of mortality and morbidity of non-targets to the sprays are difficult to confirm unequivocally but {{can be achieved by}} assessing depressions in <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> since these are reduced by exposure to organophosphates. Here we report on surveys of birds caught before and after sprays that were examined for their blood <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> to assess {{the extent to which these}} became depressed.

50|$|Another {{method to}} assess {{chlorfenvinphos}} exposure is {{to measure the}} activity of cholinesterases in the blood. Two pools of cholinesterases exist in the blood: acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes and pseudocholinesterase in plasma.

The function of plasma pseudocholinesterase is unknown, but its activity {{is considered to be a}} more sensitive biomarker for organophosphate exposure than erythrocyte <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activity.</b> The inhibition of the individual cholinesterases or the inhibition of their combined activity can be used as a marker of exposure. However, cholinesterase inhibition is caused by all anticholinesterase compounds and is therefore not a specific biomarker for chlorfenvinphos. In addition, the activity of cholinesterases in the blood varies in populations and there are no studies which have measured a correlation between chlorfenvinphos exposure and cholinesterase inhibition. There have been suggestions that chlorfenvinphos or its metabolites would be a better biomarker of exposure than its <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activity</b> inhibition.|$|E
50|$|The {{toxicity}} of chlorfenvinphos is primarily caused by its inhibition of <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activity.</b> Chlorfenvinphos reacts with the acetylcholine binding sites of enzymes that hydrolyze acetylcholine, thereby preventing their catalysis of this reaction. The reaction {{itself is a}} phosphorylation, which is reversible. The phosphorylated enzymes can undergo conformational changes and additional reactions however, which prevent the dephosporylation. This “aging” results in irreversible inhibition of the cholinesterase.|$|E

Two freshwater bivalves, Anodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834), a non-indigenous species, and Anodonta sp. (Linnaeus, 1758), a indigenous species of Italian waters were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity to OP insecticides by measuring <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> (ChEs) in digestive gland, foot, gonads, adductor muscle and gill tissues. The invasive species (A. woodiana) showed significantly greater ChE vs ASCh activity than the endemic species and this activity was more widely distributed in tissues involved in movement (adductor muscle and foot), respiration, feeding (gills) and reproduction (gonads). Moreover, only A. woodiana showed detectable ChE activity in gill tissue. No substrate specificity was observed in any tissue of either species...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of investigations performed between December 1978 and September 1982 into the cholinesterase status of 795 Caucasian patients has revealed an E 1 aE 1 j genotype in three (0. 4 %) and an E 1 aE 1 k genotype in 22 (2. 8 %). Both groups of patients are {{at increased risk}} of sensitivity to suxamethonium. Inhibitor numbers characteristic of these genotypes are reported which it is hoped will assist other workers to identify them more easily. While the J allele is probably rare among the general population it is suggested that as many as one person in 76 could be a KK homozygote. Our findings provide a possible explanation of the low <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>activities</b> seen in some patients {{for which there is no}} other obvious cause...|$|R
