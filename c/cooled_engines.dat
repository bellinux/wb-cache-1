2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{termination}} of the Tornado project, Sydney Camm and his design team transferred the alternative engine proposals for the Tornado to the more advanced Tempest. Thus, it was designed from the outset to use the Bristol Centaurus 18 cylinder radial engine {{as an alternative to the}} liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> which were also proposed. A pair of Centaurus-powered Tempest Mk II prototypes were completed. Apart from the new engine and cowling, the Tempest II prototypes were similar to early series Tempest Vs. The Centaurus engine was closely cowled and the exhaust stacks grouped behind and to either side of the engine: to the rear were air outlets with automatic sliding [...] "gills". The carburettor air intakes were in the inner leading edges of both wings, an oil cooler and air intake were present in the inner starboard wing. The engine installation owed much to examinations of a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and was clean and effective.|$|E
50|$|Most {{aviation}} {{piston engines}} are air-cooled. Air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> are lighter than their major alternative - water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines,</b> because the lower weight of air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> in aircraft design being {{a more important}} factor than the lower drag of water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines.</b> While water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were widely used {{from the early days}} of flight, air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were the dominant choice in aircraft. Following the Second World War, turbojets and jet turbine powered aircraft have come to dominate flight regimes where water cooled piston engines offered a drag advantage. Thus today, piston engines are mostly used in slower general aviation aircraft where low weight is an advantage. Therefore, most aero engines produced today are of the air cooled variety. Today, most of the engines currently (2005) manufactured by Lycoming and Continental and used by major manufacturers of light aircraft Cirrus, Cessna and so on.|$|E

The baseline design parameters for this engine are tabulated. Mass properties are also summarized for several other engine configurations i. e., a hinge nozzle using a Techroll seal, a gimbaled duct <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> and a regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> using liquid injection {{thrust vector control}} (LITVC). Detailed engine analysis and design trade studies leading to {{the selection of a}} regeneratively <b>cooled</b> gimbaled <b>engine</b> and pertaining to the selection of the baseline design configuration are also given...|$|R
50|$|The Xodiac, a new VTVL rocket, was {{introduced}} in 2016. It features pressure-fed LOX/IPA propellant, and a regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Power was {{provided}} by a [...] Liberty L-12 water <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> turning a four bladed fixed wooden propeller in a pusher configuration.|$|R
50|$|By cutting {{straight}} hydrazine, hydrazine's inconveniently high {{freezing point}} of 2°C is lowered through freezing point depression. In addition, UDMH {{is a more}} stable molecule; this reduces the chances of straight hydrazine decomposing unexpectedly, increasing safety and allowing the blend {{to be used as}} a coolant in regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Between 1918 and 1939, {{aircraft}} technology developed very rapidly. By 1939 military biplanes were in {{the process}} of being replaced with metal framed monoplanes, often with stressed skins and liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>engines.</b> Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled (and oxygen masks become commonplace); ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of reusable thrust chambers {{for the space}} shuttle orbit maneuvering engine was conducted. Tests were conducted using subscale injector hot-fire procedures for the injector configurations designed for a regenerative <b>cooled</b> <b>engine.</b> The effect of operating conditions and fuel temperature on combustion chamber performance was determined. Specific objectives of the evaluation were to examine the optimum like-doublet element geometry for operation at conditions consistent with a fuel regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> (hot fuel, 200 to 250 F) and {{the sensitivity of the}} triplet injector element to hot fuels...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} will cruise, {{maintaining the}} flap setting. Again: two reasons. It reduces the stall speed, {{but it also}} allows a slightly less nose-up attitude. Meaning: a <b>cooler</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|In July 2007, Bajaj {{began selling}} the Bajaj Pulsar 220 DTS-Fi and Pulsar 180 DTS-i, the former {{featuring}} fuel injection and oil <b>cooled</b> <b>engines,</b> a digital dash, and modern styling. This bike has some features which are totally {{new to the}} Indian market, like the fuel injection itself, rear disc brake and clip-on handlebars (the first two only available in the 220 model).|$|E
50|$|Even if this {{aircraft}} {{was used for}} many tasks and by many units, the modest speed of the S.81 soon led to it being replaced by the SM.79 for many applications. One of the later SM.81 models developed had two Isotta Fraschini Asso inline liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> with 626 kW (840 hp). But its performance was quite disappointing, including 330 km/h (210 mph) maximum speed, so the modifications were not successful.|$|E
5000|$|The first Generation of KX500's were air cooled, {{and remembered}} for their {{suspension}} more than overall performance. The air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were poorly reviewed in publications at the time, with Dirt Bike magazine most famously calling the bike [...] "unridable" [...] in their June of '83 issue. Kawasaki responded by lower compression ratios {{to make the}} bike more manageable and reliable, but would ultimately design a new engine {{from the ground up}} for the '85 model year.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, BMW {{introduced}} {{a completely new}} R1200RT a partial water <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> with 125 hp (92 kW) at 7,750 rpm, 92 lb/ft (125 Nm) torque at 6,500 rpm, and a wet clutch.|$|R
50|$|A model {{appearing}} in 1984 was the Katana 750SE with a pop-up headlight, still using an air-oil <b>cooled</b> <b>engine.</b> These were very popular {{even when their}} performance was easily out done by other competitors at the time.|$|R
50|$|The Steel Swallow was a {{two-seater}} runabout {{produced by}} the Steel Swallow Auto Co of Jackson, MI, from 1907-08. It was powered by a 2-cylinder air <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> with a friction transmission and a 7 ft wheelbase. The vehicle cost $700.|$|R
50|$|During and {{immediately}} after World War II, alcohols (primarily ethanol, occasionally methanol) were the most common fuels for large liquid-fueled rockets. Their high heat of vaporization kept regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> from melting, especially considering that alcohols would typically contain several percent water. However, it was recognized that hydrocarbon fuels would increase engine efficiency, due to a slightly higher density, {{the lack of an}} oxygen atom in the fuel molecule, and negligible water content. Whatever hydrocarbon was chosen, though, would have to replicate alcohol's coolant ability.|$|E
50|$|In 1903 Adam Lindsey Ronaldson {{had been}} taken into {{partnership}} by his brother, David Ronaldson, who had recently established a machinery manufacturing company on Creswick Road, Ballarat, which produced chaff cutters and grain crushers. It 1905, John Tippett joined the company and it became Ronaldson Brothers & Tippett Pty. Ltd., which made internal combustion engines and water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines.</b> The company built a wide size range of oil engines which it sold across Australia and promoted under the Austral brand. The company was still operating up until 1969 when it closed due to cheaper imported engines becoming available on the market.|$|E
50|$|Zappata had, meanwhile, {{continued}} {{the development of}} a considerably changed version, the Z.1007bis, to resolve the problems with the original aircraft. While the new version was of similar layout, it was a new design. Three Piaggio P.XI RC.40 radial engines (a derivative of the French Gnome-Rhône 14K) of 736 kW (986 hp) takeoff power replaced the less powerful and unreliable liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> of the original version. The bis was longer with wings of greater span and area, while the aircraft was considerably heavier, weighing 580 kg (1,280 lb) more unladen, with a maximum takeoff weight 888 kg (1,960 lb) greater. It carried heavier offensive and defensive armament.|$|E
50|$|The Sharp cyclecar was {{manufactured}} by the Sharp Engineering & Manufacturing Co in Detroit, Michigan from 1914-15. It produced two-seater cyclecar priced at $295. It was built with a 800cc, 2-cylinder air <b>cooled</b> <b>engine.</b> It had a 2-speed gearbox and shaft drive.|$|R
5000|$|... 2015 saw an {{electric}} conversion and re-style of an MBC VW-based kit car. The air <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> and fuel tank {{were replaced by}} a larger AC induction motor and Lithium battery pack resulting in {{a top speed of}} 80 mph on track.|$|R
50|$|Tempo {{also made}} motorcycles. The {{smallest}} one {{was actually a}} Corvette with a full effect version of the fan <b>cooled</b> 49 cc <b>engine</b> producing 4,3 hp. Sold as the Comet, this small motorcycle had a longer seat allowing two persons to ride. Similar versions of the Panter was sold asTrigger and Sprint, sporting a 5,2 hp full effect version of the wind <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> and somewhat different styling.|$|R
5000|$|Development of the company's first design, the W.A.R. Focke-Wulf 190, {{commenced}} in 1973, {{with the}} first flight following in 1974. The aircraft are all half-scale World War II fighter aircraft replicas, based on a common design, consisting of a wooden fuselage box shape and wooden spar wing. Polyurethane foam was then used to create the different aircraft shapes and details. The foam was then covered in a high-strength laminating fabric and epoxy-resin. The series all share a common conventional landing gear design that is electrically retractable. The aircraft were initially powered by 1600 cc Volkswagen air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> of [...] using Lloyd Patner's gear reduction units driving 3-blade Fahlin props, but later Continental O-200 and Lycoming O-235s were used along with the Rotec R2800 radial engine.|$|E
5000|$|... in 2014 a Partnership between Daimler and the Ministry of Defence for the {{manufacture}} of trucks and armored cars will produce 17,000 Mercedes units annually in accordance with international quality standards applied by Mercedes at its plants around the world, {{while the rest of}} the quota will be owned by the German companies specialized in mechanical industries (Man and Ferrostaa). The same standards will be applied in both Tiaret, which will produce 10.000 G-Class SUVs and utility wagons of average size annually, while the production site of engines in Constantine will produce 26,000 water <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> by licenses production for the Marks Meto - Deutz - Daimler respectively, to prepare the cars and industrial machinery, agricultural machines, and machines of public works, as the production will be launched in 2014.|$|E

50|$|A {{charge air}} cooler is used to <b>cool</b> <b>engine</b> air after it has passed through a turbocharger, but before it enters the engine. The idea is to return the air to a lower temperature, for the optimum power for the {{combustion}} process within the engine.|$|R
50|$|The Strouse was a {{two-seater}} roadster {{built by the}} Stouse, Ranney and Knight company of Detroit MI, from 1915-16. The roadster was powered by a 4-cylinder, water <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> with a friction transmission and a single chain drive. It was priced between $300 to $325.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857 Carl Wilhelm Siemens {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} regenerative cooling. [...] On 10 May 1898, James Dewar used regenerative cooling {{to become the first}} to statically liquefy hydrogen.The concept of regenerative cooling was also mentioned in 1903 in an article by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Robert Goddard built the first regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> in 1923, but rejected the scheme as too complex. [...] A regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engine</b> was built by the Italian researcher, Gaetano Arturo Crocco in 1930. The first Soviet engines to employ the technique were Fridrikh Tsander's OR-2 tested in March 1933 and the ORM-50, bench tested in November 1933 by Valentin Glushko. The first German engine of this type was also tested in March 1933 by Klaus Riedel in the VfR. The Austrian scientist Eugen Sänger was particularly famous for experiments with <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> starting in 1933; however, most of his experimental engines were water-cooled or cooled by an extra circuit of propellant.|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} and cooling effect {{plays a major}} role in deciding the performance factors in Engines. In liquid <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> there is a option for controlled cooling by controlling the circulation of coolant around the cylinder. But in the air cooled engines,there is no such option on cooling and which is operated always in open air. During cold condition when the engine starts it looses heat even when before it reached the optimal temperature. This delay results in higher fuel consumption and lower thermal efficiency. In this paper attempt was made to review the effect of adopting Controlled cooling method for Air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> by maintaining optimal temperature of an engine always with a option to cool it only when the engine overheats beyond the optimal temperature limit...|$|E
40|$|Air <b>Cooled</b> <b>Engines</b> {{have been}} used in a variety of applications, ranging from {{airplanes}} to motorbikes and even stationary or portable engines. Since modern automobiles and airplanes use engines delivering more power, they have to be cooled more efficiently due to which a more complex water cooling system is used for cooling engines with large displacements. Hence air cooling is becoming a thing of the past, especially in the aviation sector due to the advent of more efficient gas turbine engines. However air cooled internal combustion engines are still being used {{in a wide variety of}} two-wheelers ranging from small single cylinder engines to heavy duty liter class V-twins and Inline fours, due to the non-practicalities associated with the installment of a bulky water cooling system in two-wheelers. So one can ascertain that there is a scope for improving the efficiency of air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> even further. The objective of this paper is to analyze currently existing fin design employed in most of the air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> and improve it by changing the cross-section to a streamlined one and also making the fins in a helical orientation as opposed to the regular circular fins employed. Our analysis comprises of a computational fluid dynamics study of both the fin models with identical dimensions and simulated in the same environment using ANSYS FLUENT 15 software and we attempt to compare their performance using the temperature and heat transfer coefficient distribution plots obtained...|$|E
50|$|The {{basic design}} of the {{original}} Vanguard upper stages, featuring a pressure-fed nitric acid/UDMH, regeneratively <b>cooled</b> <b>engine,</b> was kept in place, but with an improved AJ10-118 engine.
