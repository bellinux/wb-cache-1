40|$|Six chordomas, nine <b>chondrosarcomas,</b> {{and three}} myxopapillary ependymomas of the filum terminale were {{evaluated}} immunohistochemically for {{the expression of}} intermediate filament proteins by the use of monospecific antibodies against intermediate filament proteins of keratin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) type. All chordomas were positive for keratin but negative for GFAP, whereas <b>chondrosarcomas</b> and ependymomas were negative for keratin. <b>Chondrosarcomas</b> showed strong vimentin positivity, whereas ependymomas were positive for GFAP. Chordomas showed desmosomelike junctions by electron microscopy, whereas <b>chondrosarcomas</b> of different types showed no junctions or only primitive ones. By electron microscopy chordomas often showed prominent intermediate filaments also associated with desmosomes, and poorly differentiated <b>chondrosarcomas</b> also showed prominent intermediate filaments. Keratin positivity of chordomas suggests their epithelial nature, while vimentin positivity of <b>chondrosarcomas</b> is in line with their mesenchymal derivation. The results also show that antibodies against different intermediate filament proteins can be applied as diagnostic aids in making the distinction between chordomas, chondroid tumors, and ependymal tumors...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chondrosarcomas</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of bone neoplasms {{of which the}} basic neoplastic tissue is cartilaginous.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} find other parameters that can be of help in the proper diagnosing and grading of these neoplasms. To this end, we attempted to correlate the chromosomal pattern of <b>chondrosarcomas</b> to their histologic subtypes and grades.

Polysomy of chromosome 13 (Polysomy 13) is significant in the development of prostate cancer and is often caused by centric fusions. Since canine chromosome 13 is similar to human chromosome 8q, research could provide insight to treatment for prostate cancer in humans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Studies for {{patients}} with pelvic <b>chondrosarcomas</b> are limited. This study determines the outcome of patients with pelvic <b>chondrosarcomas,</b> and whether there is any association with tumors' grade, type, stage, margins and pelvic location. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 215 patients with pelvic <b>chondrosarcomas.</b> All patients had biopsy and histological diagnosis of their tumors followed by limb salvage or amputation. We staged patients using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society system. We performed a univariate and multivariate analysis of the survival to death, local recurrence and metastasis with respect to grade, type (central vs. peripheral), stage, margins, and pelvic location, and the survival to death of patients with and without local recurrence. RESULTS: Grade {{was the most important}} univariate and multivariate predictor of the survival of the patients. Dedifferentiation was associated with significantly lower overall survival. Peripheral <b>chondrosarcomas</b> predicted survival only in the univariate analysis. Surgical margins predicted local recurrence only in the multivariate analysis. Periacetabular location was associated with lower survival to death and local recurrence. The occurrence of local recurrence compromises the overall survival. CONCLUSION: Grade was the most important predictor of the overall survival of patients with <b>chondrosarcomas</b> of the pelvis...|$|R
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} affected bones are the proximal humerus, the distal radius, the distal femur, and the tibia, following the basic premise [...] "far from the elbow, {{close to the}} knee". Other sites include the ribs, the mandible, the spine, and the pelvis. [...] Rarely, osteosarcoma may arise from soft tissues (extraskeletal osteosarcoma). Metastasis of tumors involving the limb bones is very common, usually to the lungs. The tumor causes {{a great deal of}} pain, and can even lead to fracture of the affected bone. As with human osteosarcoma, bone biopsy is the definitive method to reach a final diagnosis. Osteosarcoma should be differentiated from other bone tumours and a range of other lesions, such as osteomyelitis. Differential diagnosis of the osteosarcoma of the skull in particular includes, among others, <b>chondrosarcoma</b> and the multilobular tumour of bone.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chondrosarcomas</b> are {{malignant}} bone tumors {{with pure}} hyaline cartilage differentiation; myxoid changes, calcification, or ossification may be present. Several subtypes of <b>chondrosarcomas</b> exist. Behavior patterns vary, ranging from slow-growing nonmetastasizing lesions to aggressive metastasizing sarcomas. Symptoms are usually mild, with duration ranging from {{several months to}} years, and usually consist of persistent, dull, aching pain or palpable masses. Radiographic findings include bone expansion with cortical thickening, radiolucent areas with variably distributed punctate or ring-like matrix calcifications, cortical erosion or destruction, endosteal scalloping, and scant or absent periosteal reaction; extension into the soft tissue may be present. Histological differential diagnosis from benign cartilaginous lesions {{can be achieved by}} increased cellularity, enlarged plump nuclei, binucleated cells, hyperchromatic nuclear pleomorphism, and permeation of cortical or medullary bone. Atypia is usually mild to moderate; necrosis and mitoses can be seen, particularly in high-grade lesions. Adequate surgery is the mainstay of treatment. High-grade and pelvic <b>chondrosarcomas</b> are best managed with wide resection. Because of the low metastatic potential and low local recurrence rate noted with intralesional surgery, low-grade <b>chondrosarcomas</b> can be treated with curettage (with or without treatment of the defect cavity) with a local adjuvant, such as phenol or cryotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for mesenchymal and dedifferentiated <b>chondrosarcomas.</b> Radiation therapy can be considered after incomplete resection or if resection is not feasible or would cause unacceptable morbidity...|$|R

40|$|Ollier {{disease and}} Maffucci {{syndrome}} are rare, nonhereditary skeletal disorders {{characterized by the}} presence of multiple enchondromas with (Maffucci) or without (Ollier) co-existing multiple hemangiomas of soft tissue. Enchondromas can progress toward central <b>chondrosarcomas.</b> PTHIR mutations are found in a small subset of Ollier patients. The genetic deficit in Maffucci syndrome is unknown. Here, we report the first genome-wide analysis using Affymetrix SNP 6. 0 array on Maffucci enchondromas (n = 4) and <b>chondrosarcomas</b> (n = 2) from four cases. Results were compared to a previously studied cohort of Ollier patients (n = 37). We found no loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or common copy number alterations shared by all enchondromas, with the exception of some copy number variations. As expected, <b>chondrosarcomas</b> were found to have multiple genomic imbalances. This is similar to conventional solitary and Ollier-related enchondromas and <b>chondrosarcomas</b> and supports the multistep genetic progression model. Expression profiling using Illumina BeadArray-v 3 chip revealed that cartilaginous tumors in Maffucci patients are more similar to such tumors in Ollier patients than to sporadic cartilage tumors. Point mutations in a single gene or other copy number neutral genomic changes might play a role in enchondromagenesis. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chondrosarcomas</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of malignant bone tumors that {{are characterized by}} the production of cartilaginous extracellular matrix. They are the second most frequently occurring type of bone malignancy. Surgical resection remains the primary mode of treatment for <b>chondrosarcomas,</b> since conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy are largely ineffective. Treatment of patients with high-grade <b>chondrosarcomas</b> is particularly challenging, owing {{to the lack of}} effective adjuvant therapies. Integrins are cell surface adhesion molecules that regulate a variety of cellular functions. They have been implicated in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of solid tumors. Deregulation of integrin expression and/or signaling has been identified in many <b>chondrosarcomas.</b> Therefore, the development of new drugs that can selectively target regulators of integrin gene expression and ligand-integrin signaling might hold great promise for the treatment of these cancers. In this review, we provide an overview of the current understanding of how growth factors, chemokines/cytokines, and other inflammation-related molecules can control the expression of specific integrins to promote cell migration. We also review the roles of specific subtypes of integrins and their signaling mechanisms, and discuss how these might be involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Finally, novel therapeutic strategies for targeting these molecules will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Our {{goal was}} to {{describe}} a total cricoidectomy, a laryngeal-preserving procedure {{for the treatment of}} low-grade <b>chondrosarcomas</b> of the larynx. These extremely rare cartilaginous tumors arise in the cricoid cartilage in most cases. Although these are slow-growing and rarely metastasizing tumors, large <b>chondrosarcomas</b> of cricoid cartilage are generally treated with total laryngectomy. An oncologically radical but function-preserving approach would therefore be preferable. Study Design: Case series. Methods: Three consecutive patients with low-grade <b>chondrosarcomas</b> of the larynx underwent total cricoidectomy from 1996 to 2004. An end-to-end anastomosis between the remaining larynx and the trachea was performed to restore the continuity of airways. In all cases the laryngeal lumen was stented using a Montgomery T-tube. Oncologic and functional results were observed during at least 6 years of follow-up. Results: No evidence of tumor recurrence was detected during follow-up. One month after surgery, all patients were able to tolerate a soft diet and to speak satisfactorily. One patient was ultimately decannulated, and two patients still have a tracheostomy. However, even nondecannulated patients were able to keep the tracheostoma closed for most of the time, maintaining good phonatory and swallowing functions.
