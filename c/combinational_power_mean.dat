Mirko Czentovic was a peasant prodigy possessing no obvious redeeming qualities besides his gift for chess.

40|$|The {{computational}} {{complexity of}} a probability-based <b>combinational</b> <b>power</b> metric {{lies in the}} creation of a BDD for each node in the circuit. In this paper, we formalize the problem of finding intermediate support-set which controls the size of BDD. We propose an exact algorithm to solve it. We also propose an heuristic solution, PowerDrive, for estimating power of large circuits. Apart from being more accurate and several times faster than [2, 7], PowerDrive possess the unique quality of being canonical and of constant complexity, a very desirable quality for a power metric guiding a synthesis tool. Finally, the proposed power metric was able to guide the synthesis tool [11] to optimize large circuits which could not be synthesized by POSE [6], thus proving the effectiveness of our power metric. ...|$|R

40|$|Weighted <b>power</b> <b>means</b> are a {{flexible}} and powerful family of aggregation functions. The simplest {{member of this}} family, the weighted arithmetic mean, previously has been adapted for interval type- 2 fuzzy scores and weights. This operator has been termed a “linguistic weighted average,” {{and has been a}} primary instantiation of a “perceptual computer” in recent literature. We present an algorithm for computing weighted <b>power</b> <b>means</b> of arbitrary <b>power</b> for type- 1 or interval type- 2 fuzzy inputs and weights, which we call “linguistic weighted <b>power</b> <b>means.</b> ” We compare the linguistic weighted <b>power</b> <b>mean</b> and the linguistic weighted average on an “investment judgment advisor” example.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that if P_t denotes a set of <b>power</b> <b>means</b> then the mapping R∋ t P_t(v) ∈ (v, v) is both 1 - 1 and onto for any non-constant {{sequence}} v = (v_ 1, [...] ., v_n) of positive numbers. Shortly: the family of <b>power</b> <b>means</b> is a scale. If I is an interval and f I →R is a continuous, strictly monotone function then f^- 1 (1 n∑ f(v_i)) is a natural generalization of <b>power</b> <b>means,</b> so called quasi-arithmetic mean generated by f. A famous folk theorem says that the only homogeneous, quasi-arithmetic <b>means</b> are <b>power</b> <b>means.</b> We prove that, upon replacing the homogeneity requirement by an invariant-type axiom, one gets a family of quasi-arithmetic means building up a scale, too.

Fifteen physically active female university athletes performed a 45 s cycle ergometer test at resistances of 0. 075, 0. 085, and 0. 095 kp/kg bw, as well as a 45 s and a 3 repetition isokinetic flexion and extension test at velocities of 60, 180, and 300 $ sp circ$/s. Results revealed that peak <b>power,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (W and W/kg), and fatigue (W/kg) were highest at the 0. 095 kp/kg bw resistance and lowest at the 0. 075 kp/kg bw resistance.
