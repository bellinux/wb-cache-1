40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the possible roles of neutrinos in cosmology, {{from the first}} three minutes onward. The fact that primordial neutrinos are about as numerous as the photons of the <b>cosmological</b> <b>background</b> <b>radiation</b> means that neutrino (or "hot") dark matter can {{have a significant impact}} upon how matter is distributed in the universe. Over the past two decades, the liklihood of this has risen and fallen as more and more data has become available from laboratory experiments and the latest telescopes. Hot dark matter models were studied in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, and there was considerable interest in cold plus hot dark matter models for a few years in the mid- 1990 s. We now know from Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory data that neutrinos have mass, and that the total neutrino contribution to the cosmological density must be at least as large as Ω_ν∼ 0. 001, a little less than that of the visible stars in the universe. But the upper limit on the hot dark matter cosmological density is Ω_ν < 0. 1; correspondingly, the sum of the masses of all three active neutrino species is not more than about 5 eV.

40|$|Summary. Abstract We {{show that}} the {{stochastic}} background of gravitational waves, produced in the early cosmological epochs, strictly depends on the assumed theory of gravity.

In quantum chaos one is interested in the properties of quantum mechanical systems whose classical counterparts display chaotic behaviour.

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} the {{approach}} leading to cosmic polarization rotation observation and present {{the current status}} with an outlook. In {{the study of the}} relations among equivalence principles, we found that long-range pseudoscalar-photon interaction is allowed. Pseudoscalar-photon interaction would induce a rotation of linear polarization of electromagnetic wave propagating with cosmological/astrophysical distance. In 2002, DASI successfully observed the polarization of the <b>cosmological</b> microwave <b>background</b> <b>radiation.</b> In 2003, WMAP observed the correlation of polarization with temperature anisotropy at more than 10 sigma in the <b>cosmological</b> microwave <b>background.</b> From this high polarization-temperature correlation in WMAP observation, we put a limit of 0. 1 rad on the rotation of linear polarization of <b>cosmological</b> microwave <b>background</b> (CMB) propagation. Pseudoscalar-photon interaction is proportional to the gradient of the pseudoscalar field. From phenomenological point of view, this gradient could be neutrino number asymmetry current, other density current, or a constant vector. In these situations, Lorentz invariance or CPT may or may not effectively be violated. In this paper, we review and compile various results. Better accuracy in CMB polarization observation is expected from PLANCK mission to be launched next year. A dedicated CMB polarization observer in the future would probe this fundamental issue more deeply.

40|$|Gravitational waves {{affect the}} {{observed}} direction {{of light from}} distant sources. At telescopes, this change in direction appears as periodic variations in the apparent positions of these sources on the sky; that is, as proper motion. A wave of a given phase, traveling in a given direction, produces a characteristic pattern of proper motions over the sky. Comparison of observed proper motions with this pattern serves to test {{for the presence of}} gravitational waves. A stochastic background of waves induces apparent proper motions with specific statistical properties, and so, may also be sought.

40|$|ABSTRACT. It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{suggested that a}} <b>background</b> <b>radiation</b> can be explained as a combination of weak background sources. We provide a mathematical {{argument in favor of}} a cosmological origin of the background. Namely, the <b>background</b> <b>radiation</b> is well described by Planck's law. As for possible sources (stars, etc), for their spectra the black-body formula is a very crude approximation, because the individual differences between the stars with the same temperature T are very big. However, these differences are truly individual, they go in different directions for different stars. So, it makes sense to assume that for the total spectra of many sources, these differences more or less cancel each other, and the resulting total spectrum is close to the sum of the approximate blackbody expressions. We prove that Planck's spectrum cannot be represented as a sum of black-body spectra. Of course, we can always explain the Planck spectrum as a result of some process that &quot;thermalizes &quot; the initially non-Planck one. But if we exclude this rather ad hoc explanation, then, in the above- described approximation, cosmological interpretation is the only one possible. Since we are dealing with approximations to real spectra, our result is not an ultimate proof of <b>cosmological</b> nature of <b>background</b> <b>radiation,</b> but we believe that it is a strong argument in favor of this hypothesis. Key Words: microwave <b>background,</b> <b>cosmological</b> origin A physical problem. Is 3 K <b>background</b> really of <b>cosmological</b> origin, as it is traditionally assumed in astrophysics, or it is a mixture of radiations of small celestial bodies?
