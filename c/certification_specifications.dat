50|$|Airworthiness Standards and <b>Certification</b> <b>Specifications</b> (§ 23.149 and § 25.149) {{require the}} {{manufacturer}} {{to determine a}} minimum control speed at which the airplane is controllable after failure of the critical engine and publish this speed in the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual. The published Minimum Control Speeds (VMC's) of the aircraft are measured while the critical engine fails or is inoperative, hence, {{the effect of the}} failure of the critical engine is included in the published VMC's. When any one of the other engines fails or is inoperative, the actual VMC that the pilot experiences in-flight will be a bit lower, which is safer, but this decrement is not documented. The critical engine {{is just one of the}} factors that influences the VMC's of the aircraft. The published VMC's are therefore safe, whatever engine fails or is inoperative. Hence, (airline) pilots should not have to know about the criticality of an engine. The critical engine is defined in Aviation Regulations for use by airplane tail design engineers for sizing the tail, and by experimental test pilots for measuring VMC's in-flight. Other factors, like bank angle and thrust, have a much greater effect on VMC's than the difference of a critical and a non-critical engine.

However, even well trained and experienced pilots make errors. Accident investigations have identified that pilots’ performance is influenced significantly by the design of the flight deck interface. This research applies Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and utilizes the – Human Error Template (HET) taxonomy - to collect error data from pilots during flight operations when performing a go-around in a large commercial transport aircraft. HET was originally developed in response to a requirement for formal methods to assess compliance with the new human factors certification rule for large civil aircraft introduced to reduce the incidence of design induced error on the flight deck (EASA <b>Certification</b> <b>Specification</b> 25. 1302).

40|$|A leak {{detection}} and quantification demonstration using perflurocarbon tracer (PFT) technology was successfully {{performed at the}} NASA Marshall Space Flight Center on January 25, 1991. The real-time Dual Trap Analyzer (DTA) at one-half hour {{after the start of}} the first run gave an estimated leak rate of 0. 7 mL/min. This has since been refined to be 1. 15 (+ or -) 0. 09 mL/min. The leak rates in the next three runs were determined to be 9. 8 (+ or -) 0. 7, - 0. 4 (+ or -) 0. 3, and 76 (+ or -) 6 mL/min, respectively. The theory on leak quantification in the steady-state and time-dependent modes for a single zone test facility was developed and applied to the above determinations. The laboratory PFT analysis system gave a limit-of-detection (LOD) of 0. 05 fL for ocPDCH. This is the tracer of choice and is about 100 -fold better than that for the DTA. Applied to leak certification, the LOD is about 0. 00002 mL/s (0. 000075 L/h), a 5 order-of-magnitude improvement over the original leak <b>certification</b> <b>specification.</b> Furthermore, this limit can be attained in a measurement period of 3 to 4 hours instead of days, weeks, or months.

HET {{has been developed}} specifically for the aerospace industry in response to <b>Certification</b> <b>Specification</b> (CS) 25. 1302. In particular, it is intended as an aid for the early identification of design-induced errors, and as a formal method to demonstrate the inclusion of human factors issues {{in the design and}} certification process of aircraft flight decks, including supplemental type certification. The template-based approach was chosen because it appeared to be quick to learn and easy to use. HET uses a hierarchical task analysis as its starting point. A checklist of twelve (12) external error modes is used to determine which might lead to credible errors for each task step. For each credible error a description is given and the outcome described. If the likelihood of the error and the consequences are both high then that task step is rated as a ‘Fail’. The error mode taxonomy developed comprises: fail to execute a task, task execution incomplete, in the wrong direction, wrong task executed, task repeated, on the wrong interface element, too early, too late, too much, too little, misread information, and other. HET was then compared to SHERPA, HAZOP and HEIST. Thirty seven (37) analysts were employed in this study based on a landing scenario. HET showed significantly better Sensitivity Index scores {{than any of the other}} methods, and the greatest number of correct error predictions (hits). The results from the HET validation study demonstrate that HET meets all the criteria set.

The first step was the numerical analysis of a simplified, but realistic, square flat windshield model subjected to impact by a 1. 8 kg bird model at 155 m/s with an impact angle of 90 ◦. The FE-SPH coupled approach was used to simulate the birdstrike by using the explicit finite element solver code LS-Dyna. The second step was the execution of a parametric analysis on the square model to estimate the influence of the target geometry, the impact angle, and the plate curvature on the impact response of the windshield structure. The goal of these numerical simulations was the evaluation of the windshield capability to absorb the impact energy, involving during a birdstrike event, in a safe and efficient way without any damage.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the conceptual {{design of a}} Maneuver Load Control system {{taking into account the}} airframe flexibility. The system, when switched on, is able to minimize the bending moment augmentation at a wing station near the wing root during an unsteady longitudinal maneuver. The reduction of the incremental wing bending moment due to maneuvers can lead to benefits such as improved pay-loads/gross weight capabilities and/or extended structural fatigue life. The maneuver is performed by following a desired vertical load factor law with elevators deflections, starting from the trim equilibrium in level flight. The system observes load factor and structural bending through accelerometers and calibrated strain sensors and then sends signals to a computer that symmetrically actuates ailerons for reducing the structural bending and elevators for compensating the perturbation to the longitudinal equilibrium. The major limit of this kind of systems appears when it has to be installed on commercial transport aircraft for reduced OEW or augmented wing aspect-ratio. In this case extensive RAMS analyses and high redundancy of the MLC related sub-systems are required by the Certification Authority. Otherwise the structural design must be performed at system off. Thus the unique actual benefit to be gained from the adoption of a MLC system on a commercial transport is the fatigue life extension. An application to a business aircraft responding to the EASA <b>Certification</b> <b>Specifications,</b> Part 25, has been performed. The aircraft used for the numerical application is considered only as a test case-study. Most of design and analysis considerations are applicable also to other aircraft, such as unmanned or military ones, although some design requirements can be clearly different. The estimation of the fatigue life extension of a structural joint (wing lower skin-stringer), located close to the wing root, has been estimated by showing the expected benefit to be gained from the adoption of such a maneuvering load control system...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the landing gear {{is one of the}} prime aspects of {{aircraft}} design. Literature describes the design process thoroughly, however the integration of these design methods within an automated design framework has had little focus in literature. Landing gear design includes different engineering disciplines including structures, weights, kinematics, economics and runway design. Interaction between these different disciplines makes the landing gear a complex system. Automating the design process has shown to have the advantage of increased productivity, better support for design decisions and can provide the capability of collaborative and distributed design. The automation tools improve performance of current designs and simplify the development of new aircraft configurations. In this thesis a systematic and automated landing gear design procedure is proposed. Positioning the landing gear on the aircraft is limited by several requirements. Requirements include take-off stability, touchdown stability, wing-tip and engine clearance, ground handling and stability while taxiing. Evaluation of all these limits results in a feasible design space from which the shortest possible landing gear is found. From the resulting landing gear position, loads on the landing gear struts are calculated. Tyres and wheels are selected and brakes and shock absorbers are designed. The assembly of landing gear components can then be used to make an analytical weight estimation. This analytical weight estimation is based on maximum stresses occurring within the structure due to extreme load cases prescribed in <b>certification</b> <b>specifications.</b> Preventing yielding and buckling within the structure then results in required component thicknesses. A multi-body model is then made, where structural parts are seen as rigid bodies. The multi-body model evaluates and visualises the system dynamics. The oleo-pneumatic shock absorber forces and motion are modelled using an analytical relation. An empirical tyre model models tyre motion and forces at the contact point. These two models can accurately describe forces within the tyres and shocks due to externally applied forces, which then allows for the evaluation of extreme landing load cases. This is done to verify empirically estimated dynamic landing loads used in the weight estimation. And this is done to identify loading peaks that could occur during a landing. In addition to the landing simulation a simulation of the landing gear retraction mechanism is done to check the kinematic feasibility and compliance to certification requirements. Verification of results of the implemented landing gear with reference aircraft shows that landing gear positions closely match with actual landing gear positions. The analytical weight estimation of the landing gear assembly estimates the total gear weight with an error of 15 percent. This is comparable to the result of an empirical weight estimation that has an error of 17 percent. Multi-body simulation results show that dynamic loads during an extreme landing are similar to empirically estimated dynamic loads. For landing gears with multiple rows of tyres it is especially important to look at landing loads, since a hard landing then creates peaks at high frequency in the shock loads. These peaks originate from the interaction between front and rear axle tyres hitting the ground at different times. A kinematic simulation of retraction and extension then verifies the kinematic feasibility. This simulation also shows that the retraction and locking mechanisms work and that it can be stowed within the available space. The resulting landing gear design and analysis tools complete the existing aircraft design tools, which then forms the basis for the future improvement of automated transport aircraft design.

40|$|A flight {{dynamics}} evaluation {{was performed in}} order to analyse {{the ability to use}} the outer flap for roll control as well. Based on the A 350 flap system architecture, where the outer flap can be deployed independently from the inner flap by using an active differential gear box, two different concepts were identified as potentially benefitial for the desired purpose. In both concepts the inner ailerons were removed in order to save weight and system complexity and the outer flap performs (all speed) roll control together with the outer (low speed) aileron. Concept 1 comprises the usual flap geometry and the outer aileron, whereas concept 2 comprises an outer flap, which is extended in spanwise direction by the length of the inner aileron. The flight dynamic evaluation revealed that {{for the use of the}} outer flaps for regular roll control flap dynamics are necessary of at least 16 °/s flap deflection rate in order to fulfill requirements from <b>certification</b> <b>specification</b> CS- 25 and handling quality criteria. A system analysis showed that the existing active differential gear box from A 350 is unfortunately only able to deflect the flap with a maximum rate of 0. 43 °/s, or with slight modifications of the existing active differential gear box a maximum deflection rate of 1. 4 °/s could be feasible. These values showed to be insufficient for regular roll control. Nevertheless, in case of dual loss of hydraulic power the only available roll control could be performed by one remaining pair of ailerons, which are driven by an electrical back-up hydraulic actuator at the A 350. In order to still enable roll control, if these electrical back-up hydraulic actuators fail additionally, it was analysed whether the outer flap could be used as emergency roll control with the aforementioned feasible flap dynamics. The results showed that the handling qualities with this flap system ensuring roll control are barely controllable. However, it appears feasible to reach degraded but acceptable handling qualities if the system dynamics could be slightly increased...|$|R

These recorded data can be used both directly and indirectly to allocate emissions to specific episodes of time during the emissions processing of inventories for air quality modeling analyses. This paper describes {{the development of a}} set of calendar year 2002 hourly emission files and associated temporal allocation factors used in the VISTAS Phase II model performance evaluation specifically for modeling ozone and PM precursor power sector (EGU) emission inventories for national, annual episodes...|$|R
