50|$|It is a herbaceous, stoloniferous {{perennial}} plant {{growing to}} 50 cm tall. It has both prostrate running stems, which produce roots and new plants at the nodes, and {{more or less}} erect flowering stems. The basal leaves are compound, borne on a 4-20 cm long petiole and divided into three broad leaflets 1.5-8 cm long, shallowly to deeply lobed, {{each of which is}} stalked. The leaves higher on the stems are smaller, with narrower leaflets and may be simple and lanceolate. Both the stems and the leaves are finely hairy. The flowers are golden yellow, glossy, and 2-3 cm diameter, usually with five petals, and the flower stem is finely grooved. The gloss is caused by the smooth upper surface of the petal that acts like a mirror; the gloss aids in attracting pollinating insects and thermoregulation of the flower's reproductive organs. The fruit is a cluster of achenes 2.5-4 mm long. <b>Creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> has three-lobed dark green, white-spotted leaves that grow out of the node.

40|$|Abstract A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} on an organic dairy farm in Manawatu, New Zealand, to determine how well perennial weeds are controlled during pasture renewal. Changes in weed populations were monitored following three different non-chemical methods of regrassing. Regrassing by planting pasture 4 weeks after ploughing the old pasture (“grass-to-grass”) was compared for spring and autumn cultivation. The third method involved ploughing in spring, growing turnips over summer then regrassing in autumn. All three techniques caused signiicant increases in broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius) and <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus repens) populations. Although both these species regrew from vegetative organs, it was the establishment of new seedlings following cultivation that appeared to increase populations most. This build-up of dock seedlings occurred more when using a crop than just grass-to-grass systems. A 2 -week fallow after ploughing gave better control of perennial weeds than having no fallow, but a 4 -week fallow gave little further improvement...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to try and establish a similar field method for estimating the age of grasslands based on the accumulation of macro-somatic mutations. Methods A countrywide survey was carried out by the British public to investigate the relationship between grassland age and the number of <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> plants Ranunculus repens with extra petals. In addition the relationship between grassland age and R. repens pollen viability was also investigated. Key Results Each plant with flowers with additional petals in a sample of 100 was found to equate to approximately seven years. A higher significant correlation was observed between pollen viability and population age, however, this is not amenable to providing field estimates. Conclusions: The age of British grasslands can be easily and reliably estimated in the field by counting the number flowers with additional petals in R. repens in meadows up to 200 years old. An attempt to estimate the heritability of extra petals suggests that the phenotype results from the slow accumulation of somatic mutations in a species which primarily reproduces vegetatively.

40|$|Fuller's rose weevil, Naupactus cervinus (Boheman) (Curculionidae: Entiminae), is an {{important}} quarantine pest of New Zealand kiwifruit exported to Asian markets. Both adults and larvae {{are considered to be}} polyphagous. In this study, the survival of larval N. cervinus was estimated on common groundcover species of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) in the Bay of Plenty, the main region in New Zealand where kiwifruit is grown. The botanical composition of groundcover in commercial kiwifruit orchards, characterised by survey, was dominated by ryegrass (Lolium perenne), with white clover (Trifolium repens), <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus repens), wild strawberry (Duchesnea indica) and broadleaf dock (Rumex obtusifolius) in lower abundance. Survival to mature larvae or adult was relatively low (· 11 %) for N. cervinus introduced as neonates to field plots or potted ryegrass, white clover and broadleaf dock. White clover was a more favourable host for survival to adults than ryegrass. This study suggests that increased survival of N. cervinus larvae may occur where white clover and large dock plants are abundant, but that survival is likely to be highly variable because of the heterogeneous availability of preferred host plants and host plant quality. These data suggest that larval polyphagy is a strategy that enables N. cervinus to persist at low densities in kiwifruit orchards despite variation in the quality and diversity of groundcover...|$|E
40|$|My book chapter 'Soft Estate' is a {{contribution}} to In the Company of Ghosts: The Poetics of the Motorway, of which I am also a co-editor {{and author of the}} foreword. In the Company of Ghosts explores the poetics of a motorway system where romance and squalor, the personal and the political, private interests and public space collide. The poetics of the motorway are bound up with our sense of the decline of 'the modern' as it reflects back the fallibility of our plans and dreams. This book brings together artists, poets, writers and thinkers who have responded in diverse ways to the motorway and its environs. Interspersing poetry, analysis, commentary and fiction, it reflects the contradictory nature of a motorway system that gives us an unintended self-portrait of a carbon-driven society. My chapter unpacks some of the subliminal ways in which 18 th-century values of land ownership, enclosure and the subsequent aestheticizing of land both within and outside these confines still informs our high speed consumption of horizons and the contested nature of these borderlands seen through the car window at speed. The book invites readers to 'Stop, Look and Listen' to the unnoticed worlds in this territory. The book was launched as part of the London Literature Festival at the Poetry Library on London's South Bank in July 2012 and followed by a related symposium at Beaconsfield involving Will Alsop, David Lawrence, performance poet Jennifer Cooke and myself, chaired by Naomi Siderfin and recorded with a live audience and placed online.

40|$|Summary 	Organic farming means {{a chance}} for plants to reveal their abilities. We offer better {{conditions}} to the associated plants for their growth and reproduction by no use of chemical herbicides and by using alternative growing methods. 	Organic agrophytocoenoses are significant by higher species richness and cover. There can be found some of endangered species among the weeds, which may be more successful in organic system, therfore the organic type of farming may serve for their protection. The most successful weed species endanger cultural crops on both organic and conventional fields. They become more dangerous {{without the possibility of}} herbicide application. Thanks to this, the strategy of each plant species is more important. That is why the question of weed suppression in organic farming is highly important and frequently asked. 	The aim of this thesis is to analyse weed flora on organic cereals fields and to point out possible factors influencing them. Braun-Blanquet scale of dominance and abundance has been used for the assessment of weed communities. Several different localities were investigated in Benešov district. Influence of winter cereals, spring cereals, previous crop and the tillage system have been assessed. 	Some of the most important weed species were: annual winter weed species in winter cereals, perennials and few annual spring species in spring cereals. Annual weeds were typical for spring cereals sown two years on a one plot, perennials were associated with spring cereals sown after fodder crops. -There were not found any evident differences in weed spectrum in winter cereals based on previous crop. Agrophytocoenosis on fields with conventional and reduced tillage differed. Wider spectrum of perennial species was typical for fields where reduced tillage was applied, differences in annual weed spectrum were also found. Typical species for conventional tillage were for example: marsh woundwort, common couch-grass and common poppy, while, creeping thistle, <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup,</b> perennial sow-thistle, mugwort, corn chamomile, loose silky-bent and some others were often found on fields where reduced tillage were used. 	The results of the analysis in this thesis mostly lead to the same description of weeds as in literature, but few of the results are different. Thanks to statistically decisive results, it is apparent, how a farmer can affect the plant associations over a long period. Key words: organic farming, weeds, agrophytocoenosis, cereals, weed control, features(characteristic) of weeds...|$|E
40|$|V prvem delu raziskave je bil namen ugotoviti sestavo zeli in njihovo neto energijsko vrednost za laktacijo (NEL) glede na staranje. Na trajnem nižinskem travinju v Blatni Brezovici in Murskih Črncih smo zbrali vzorce sedmih vrst zeli: navadni rman (Achillea millefolium L.), ozkolistni trpotec (Plantago lanceolata L), navadna lakota (Gallium mollugo L.), plazeča zlatica (Ranunculus repens L.), gomoljasta zlatica (Ranunculus bulbosus L), navadni regrat (Taraxacum officinale F. Weber) in topolistna kislica (Rumex obtusifolus L.). Ugotovili smo, da pufrska sposobnost pri navadnem rmanu in ozkolistnem trpotcu narašča s staranjem rastlin ob vseh treh oziroma štirih košnjah. Vsebnost vodotopnih ogljikovih hidratov (VOH) se je ob prvi košnji najmanj spreminjala pri navadnem rmanu (+ 12 g VOH kg- 1 suhe snovi (SS) dnevno v Murskih Črncih) in ozkolistnem trpotcu (– 0, 11 g kg- 1 SS dnevno v Murskih Črncih). Največje zmanjševanje VOH s staranjem smo ugotovili pri topolistni kislici (– 3, 40 g VOH kg- 1 SS dnevno). Vsebnost surovih maščob (SM) se je ob prvi košnji najhitreje zmanjševala pri navadnem regratu (– 0, 54 oziroma – 0, 75 g SM kg- 1 SS dnevno). Najmanj surovih beljakovin (SB) smo ugotovili v rastlinah iz družine zlatičnic (88 do 162 g SB kg- 1 SS). Surova vlaknina (SVl) je najhitreje naraščala pri gomoljasti zlatici (4, 31 g SVl kg- 1 SS dnevno), najpočasneje pa pri navadnem regratu (0, 29 oziroma 0, 50 g SVl kg- 1 SS dnevno). Največjo vsebnost NEL ob prvi košnji smo določili v plazeči zlatici (6, 73 – 7, 38 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS), najmanjšo maja pri navadnem rmanu (4, 36 – 6, 29 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS) in topolistni kislici (4, 50 – 5, 41 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS). Vsebnost NEL se je najhitreje zmanjševala pri navadnem rmanu in gomoljasti zlatici (– 0, 05 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS dnevno), najpočasneje pa pri ozkolistnem trpotcu in plazeči zlatici (– 0, 01 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS dnevno). V drugem delu raziskave nas je zanimala silirna sposobnost navadnega rmana in ozkolistnega trpotca v primerjavi z mnogocvetno ljuljko (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in travniško bilnico (Festuca pratensis L.), pa tudi vpliv 10 in 30 % deleža omenjenih zeli v mešanici na kakovost fermentacije omenjenih silaž. Hkrati smo proučevali vpliv venenja na kakovost fermentacije in na vsebnost β-karotena v silažah. S podaljševanjem časa venenja in omejeno fermentacijo se je pH-vrednost zelo uvelih silaž razen mnogocvetne ljuljke zmanjšala manj kakor pH-vrednost neuvelih ali uvelih silaž (p < 0, 05). Neuvele in uvele silaže mnogocvetne ljuljke so bile slabše kakovosti od silaž travniške bilnice, navadnega rmana, ozkolistnega trpotca ali mešanice travniške bilnice z 10 - ali 30 -odstotnim deležem zeli. Povezave med vsebnostjo β-karotena in drugimi produkti fermentacije so razen povezave s pH-vrednostjo in BK šibke, vendar statistično značilne (p < 0, 05). Ugotavljamo, da rastlinska vrsta in venenje (p < 0, 001), pa tudi njun interakcija (p < 0, 01) vplivajo na vsebnost β-karotena v silaži. Mnogocvetna ljuljka in travniška bilnica vsebujeta v sveži snovi in tudi v silažah več β-karotena v primerjavi z ozkolistnim trpotcem ali navadnim rmanom. Največje izgube β-karotena smo ugotovili v zelo uvelih silažah navadnega rmana (– 56, 7 %) in ozkolistnega trpotca (51, 1 %), precej manjše pa v silaži mnogocvetne ljuljke (48, 4 %) in travniške bilnice (37, 0 %). Primerjava izgub β-karotena med venenjem in siliranjem trav in zeli kaže, da so izgube med venenjem večje kakor med siliranjem. Rezultati kažejo, da se, razen pri travniški bilnici, največ β-karotena izgubi v prvih 24 urah venenja. The aim of {{the first}} part of the study was to {{determine}} the composition and net energy value for lactation (NEL) of selected forbs in dependence of ageing. On a permanent lowland grasslands in Blatna Brezovica and Murski Črnci we have collected seven forb species: common yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata L), Italian ryegrass (Gallium mollugo L.), <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus repens L.), bulbous buttercup (Ranunculus bulbosus L), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F. Weber) and broad leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolus L.). The results show, that the buffering capacity (BK) in common yarrow and ribwort plantain increased with the aging of plants during all harvests. The concentration of water soluble carbohydrates (VOH) at the first cut changed the least in common yarrow (+ 12 g VOH kg- 1 of dry matter (DM) per day in Murski Črnci) and ribwort plantain (- 0. 11 g VOH kg- 1 of DM per day in Murski Črnci). The largest reduction of VOH with aging was found in broad leaved dock (- 3. 40 g VOH kg- 1 of DM per day). Crude fat (SM) content at the first cut declined the most rapidly in common dandelion (- 0. 54 and - 0. 75 g SM kg- 1 of DM per day). A minimum crude protein (CP) content was found in plants from the buttercup family (88 to 162 g SB kg- 1 of DM). Crude fiber (CF) content has increased the most rapidly in the bulbous buttercup (4. 31 g CF kg- 1 of DM per day) and the slowest in the common dandelion (0. 29 and 0. 50 g CF kg- 1 of DM per day). The highest content of NEL at the first cut was determined in <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> (6. 73 to 7. 38 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM), while the lowest content of NEL was found in common yarrow (4. 36 – 6, 29 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM) and broad leaved dock (4. 50 – 5, 41 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM). The NEL value declined the fastest in common yarrow and bulbous buttercup (- 0. 05 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM per day, respectively) and the slowest in ribwort plantain and <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> (- 0. 01 MJ NEL kg- 1 DM per day). In the second experiment we have studied the ensiling capacity and the quality of silages from common yarrow and ribwort plantain in comparison to Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis L.), as well as the influence of 10 and 30 % addition of the above mentioned herbs on the quality of the silage fermentation. We also studied the influence of wilting on the fermentation quality and the content of β-carotene in silages. With increasing time of wilting and reduced fermentation activity, the pH value in highly-wilted silages, with the exception of Italian ryegrass, decreased to a lesser extent than the pH value in un-wilted or wilted silages (P< 0. 05). The un-wilted and wilted silages of Italian ryegrass were of lower quality than silages made of meadow fescue, common yarrow, ribwort plantain or silages from a mixture of meadow fescue with addition of 10 or 30 % of forbs. The correlations between the content of β-carotene and other fermentation products, with the exception of the correlation of pH value with the BK, were relatively weak but statistically significant (P < 0. 05). We have noted that the plant species and wilting (P < 0. 001), as well as their interaction (P < 0. 01), influenced the content of β-carotene in the silage. Italian ryegrass and meadow fescue contained more β-carotene in the fresh material as well as in silages, in comparison to the ribwort plantain and common yarrow. The largest loss of β-carotene was observed in a highly-wilted silages of common yarrow (- 56. 7 %) and ribwort plantain (- 51. 1 %), whereas the losses were considerably lower in the silage of Italian ryegrass (- 48. 4 %) and meadow fescue (- 37. 0 %). Comparison of losses of β-carotene as a consequence of wilting and ensiling of grasses and herbs shows, that the loss of β-carotene due to wilting is greater than the one caused by ensiling. The results show that, with the exception of meadow fescue, the β-carotene losses are largest during the first 24 hours of wilting...|$|E
40|$|Ruminal biohydrogenation and {{transfer}} of fatty acids (FA) to milk were determined for 4 silages with different botanical compositions using 4 multiparous Norwegian Red dairy cows [(mean ± SD) 118 ± 40. 9 d in milk, 22. 5 ± 2. 72 kg of milk/d, 631 ± 3. 3 kg of body weight, 3. 3 ± 0. 40 points on {{body condition score}} {{at the start of}} the experiment] fitted with rumen cannulas. Treatments consisted of 4 experimental silages: a mix of the first and third cut of organically managed short-term grassland with timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.; 2 yr old; ORG-SG); organically managed long-term grassland with a high proportion of unsown species (6 yr old; ORG-LG); conventionally managed ley with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.; CON-PR); and conventionally managed ley with timothy (CON-TI). The herbages were cut, wilted, and preserved with additive in round bales and fed at 0. 90 of ad libitum intake. A barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) concentrate constituted 300 g/kg of dry matter of the total feed offered. A Latin square design (4 × 4) with 3 -wk periods and the last week in each period used for sampling was implemented. Omasal flows of FA were measured using Yb acetate, Cr-EDTA, and the indigestible neutral detergent fiber fraction as indigestible markers. The composition of FA was analyzed in feed, omasal digesta, and milk. Compared with ORG-LG, ORG-SG had a higher herbage proportion of red clover (0. 36 vs. 0. 01) and lower proportions of timothy (0. 42 vs. 0. 18), smooth meadowgrass (Poa pratensis L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), dandelion (Taraxacum spp.), and <b>creeping</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus repens L.). The silages were well preserved. The concentration of neutral detergent fiber was higher and the concentration of Kjeldahl-N was lower for CON-TI than for the other silages. Silage type had no effect on dry matter intake, but milk yield was lower for CON-TI than for the other silages. Apparent biohydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was lower for ORG-SG (932 g/kg) than for ORG-LG (956 g/kg), CON-PR (959 g/kg), and CON-TI (958 g/kg). Compared with the grass-based silages, ORG-SG and ORG-LG resulted in higher omasal flows of C 18 : 1 trans FA and higher milk fat proportions of C 18 : 1 trans FA and C 18 : 2 cis- 9,trans- 11. Apparent recovery of C 18 : 3 n- 3 in milk was higher for ORG-SG (61 g/kg) than for ORG-LG (33 g/kg), CON-PR (34 g/kg), and CON-TI (38 g/kg), and milk fat proportion of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was higher for ORG-SG than for CON-TI. Milk fat proportions of C 16 : 0 were lower for ORG-SG and ORG-LG compared with those for CON-PR and CON-TI. It was concluded that high proportions of red clover and other dicotyledons in the silages affected ruminal biohydrogenation and increased milk fat proportions of beneficial FA...|$|E
