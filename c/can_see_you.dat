2500|$|Oppewall {{obtained}} her master's {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1969 {{and moved to}} Los Angeles, California. At age 22, she was given a job answering phones at the Venice studio of Charles Eames. According to some sources, Paul Schrader arranged an interview between Oppewall and Eames when he was writing a magazine article about the Eameses. Oppewall, however, has claimed she got the job while visiting the Charles Eames office as a guest and, upon leaving, casually asked a secretary whether there were any jobs available. Upon taking the job, Charles Eames told Oppewall, [...] "I can {{teach you how to}} draw, I cannot teach you how to think or see. If you can think and you <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>you</b> can stay." [...] Oppewall worked with him for eight years, during which time Eames, in Oppewall's words, [...] "saw something in me I didn't know was there." [...] By the end of her time with Eames, she was helping design and organize Eames museum exhibits. Eames made more than 100 small personal and educational films in that time and, {{as a result of her}} exposure to them, Oppewall said she got into the film business [...] "by accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stay Alive shows a {{different}} side of Nina, consisting mostly of original songs, and covers {{a wide range}} of genres from piano-driven ballads, midtempo pop blues, and house/synthpop to contemporary R The album showcases her passion for dance music, relying on more upbeat, catchy tunes. Nina expressed that the album's direction to a new sound reflects to her new improved self, saying [...] "I have changed a lot. From the time I came out with the Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have now when I started gaining awards but not too much that it went to my head. It's confidence in my singing and performing and letting people know that I'm a singer." [...] She stated that the album will be a studio album with two covers, and that its sound is going to be [...] "sexy-soul," [...] which she defined as [...] "singing from the soul but having a degree of sexiness to it." [...] Stay Alive is heavily considered as Nina's comeback in the recording scene, being described as a mixture of pop, club and R songs which is very different from her previous sound. She admitted the idea of wanting to try something new, saying [...] "I want to try {{a different}} genre that’s why we decided {{to come up with a}} dance album," [...] recalling her dance performances onstage during concerts and how it will be some sort of experiment for her.

In preparation, she decided to maintain physical fitness by working out, playing tennis, and practicing boxing everyday. She expressed hard work and exercise to improve her natural physique, proudly stating [...] "I want to be a role model when it comes to body.
