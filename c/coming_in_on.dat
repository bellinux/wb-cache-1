The route continued as U.S. Route 22 until the completion of the bypass around Phillipsburg, which US 22 was transferred to the bypass. The former alignment became U.S. Route 22 Alternate, lasting through the 1953 state highway renumbering. The route continued to run from the Phillipsburg-Easton Bridge to US 22, until 1993, when US 22 Alternate was decommissioned and replaced by NJ 122 and County Route 678.|$|E

While Edwin & Monica were marked for elimination for <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> last <b>on</b> the first leg, Henry & Terri were stripped {{of all their}} money and will begin the next leg with no money after <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> last <b>on</b> the seventh leg. Racers were not told that the original non-elimination penalty was still applicable. This twist led to an argument between Henry and host Allan Wu at the Seoul finish mat, when the former was unwilling {{to give up his}} team's money. In the following leg, the penalty reverted to the 'marked for elimination' penalty after Terri & Henry finished last consecutively.|$|R

25|$|While {{teaching}} and directing at the university, Harvey {{broke into the}} film business as an actor {{in some of the}} movies being made by Centron Corporation of Lawrence, an independent industrial and educational film production company. Founded in 1947 in Lawrence by Arthur H. Wolf and Russell A. Mosser, Centron would come to the forefront of the industrial and educational film companies in the United States. Harvey joined the staff in 1952 and went on to work for Centron as a film director, writer, and producer for over three decades, making a variety of short industrial, educational, documentary, and government films. Centron competed with large companies on both coasts {{to become one of the}} top producers of industrial and educational films. Harvey was known for his high quality films, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> time and under budget. Harvey and his film crews were dispatched to far-flung locations around the globe to bring back images for geography and travel films. Harvey also worked with many well-known professional actors and entertainers in Centron films, such as Walter Pidgeon, Rowan and Martin, Dennis Day, Louis Nye, George Gobel, Billy Barty, Anita Bryant, Eddie Albert, Ed Ames, Jesse White, and Ricardo Montalban. The director won many national and international awards for his work, including the highest honors from the American Film Festival, C.I.N.E., and the Columbus Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|Meade {{was forced}} to send 20,000 reinforcements: the entire V Corps, Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell's {{division}} of the II Corps, most of the XII Corps, and portions of the newly arrived VI Corps. Hood's division moved more to the east than intended, losing its alignment with the Emmitsburg Road, attacking Devil's Den and Little Round Top. McLaws, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Hood's left, drove multiple attacks into the thinly stretched III Corps in the Wheatfield and overwhelmed them in Sherfy's Peach Orchard. McLaws's attack eventually reached Plum Run Valley (the [...] "Valley of Death") before being beaten back by the Pennsylvania Reserves division of the V Corps, moving down from Little Round Top. The III Corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle, and Sickles's leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball. Caldwell's division was destroyed piecemeal in the Wheatfield. Anderson's division, coming from McLaws's left and starting forward around 6 p.m., reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge, but could not hold the position {{in the face of}} counterattacks from the II Corps, including an almost suicidal bayonet charge by the [...] 1st Minnesota regiment against a Confederate brigade, ordered in desperation by Hancock to buy time for reinforcements to arrive.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the results}} were <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Wednesday morning, it {{appeared}} that Chamberlain would win, but Hampton had taken a very narrow lead by Thursday. Hampton claimed victory with slightly more than an 1100-vote margin statewide. Chamberlain and the Republicans disputed the victory, based on widespread fraud and intimidation by Democrats. In Aiken County, where the Hamburg Massacre had occurred, Republican votes dropped to less than 100, but [...] "Democratic votes quadrupled." [...] The total vote in Edgefield exceeded the total voting age population by more than 2,000 and Republican votes were suppressed.

2500|$|Carl is Kirsty's ex-boyfriend, and Coonan {{explained}} {{that they were in}} a relationship [...] before he went to prison. Carl was in his early 20s and Kirsty was 16 when they met and he became obsessive of her. Their relationship was based on hedonism and excess, rather than tenderness. When he went to prison, Kirsty promised to wait for him to be released, but she realised their relationship was toxic and ceased all contact. She then went on to marry Max. Carl is still in love with Kirsty, believing her to be [...] "the only woman for him" [...] and his second mission in Walford is to get her back. Coonan said this would cause problems between Carl and Max. He later said that [...] "In Carl's head, he's <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a white horse to save Kirsty from a bad marriage", and {{explained that}} while Carl was in prison he focussed on Kirsty, and she [...] "become an object of this freedom he was dreaming about. [...] Now he sees she's poodling after Max and that he isn't treating her right." [...] However, he thought that Kirsty may not want to reunite with Carl because [...] "he's not the type of guy who's just going to change overnight" [...] and he is probably not [...] "the knight in shining armour" [...] he thinks he is. Coonan {{went on to say that}} Carl would treat Kirsty [...] "like a goddess" [...] but would probably have a problem with her independence, and he would want to provide for her, being [...] "old-fashioned and a bit misguided", and they would have a [...] "fiery" [...] relationship because they are both [...] "strong-willed". Kierston Wareing, who plays Kirsty, opined that her character is more suited to Carl than to Max, and hoped they could be a [...] "manipulative, power couple".|$|E
