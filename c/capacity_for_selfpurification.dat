Some theorists maintain that the <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> altruism is independent of any <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> mindreading; others maintain that the <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> altruism depends on fairly sophis-ticated mindreading skills. I argue that none of the prevailing accounts is adequate. Rather, I argue that altruistic motivation depends on a basic affective system, a ‘Concern Mechanism’, which requires only a minimal <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> mindreading. 1...|$|R

Word count: 12, 996 (without footnotes); 14, 774 (with footnotes) Throughout the last century, philosophers and psychologists have tried to explain features of our moral psychology by appealing to features of our <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> understanding other minds, or ‘mindreading’. Perhaps the most widely known treatment goes back to Piaget’s early work in developmental moral psychology (Piaget, 1932). Piaget and his followers placed enormous weight on the ability for perspective taking, that is, imagining oneself to have the mental state...|$|R

We establish a set of inequalities that give an ordering to the capacities of two-qubit unitary operations.

40|$|Imprinting theory {{suggests}} that founding conditions are ‘stamped' on organizations, and these imprinted routines often resist change. In contrast, strategic choice {{theory suggests}} that the firm can overcome organizational inertia and deliberately choose its future. Both theories offer dramatically different explanations behind an organization's <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> change. IPO firms provide a unique context for exploring how imprinting forces interact with strategic choice factors to address organizational <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> change as a firm moves from private to public firm status. Juxtaposing imprinting and strategic choice perspectives, we employ fuzzy set to examine the multi-level determinants of organizational <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> change. Our cross-national data reveals three effective configurations of organizational <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> change within IPOs, and two ineffective configurations.
