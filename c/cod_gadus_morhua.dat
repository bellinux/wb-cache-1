25|$|In one {{laboratory}} study, Atlantic <b>cod</b> (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> given {{access to}} an operant feeding machine learned to pull a string to get food. However, the researchers had also tagged the fish by threading a bead {{in front of their}} dorsal fin. Some fish snagged the string with their bead, resulting in food delivery. These fish eventually learned to swim in a particular way to repeatedly make the bead snag the string and get food. Because the fish used an object external to their body in a goal-oriented way, this satisfies some definitions of tool use.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a cascade in a complex, open-ocean {{ecosystem}} occurred in the northwest Atlantic during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of <b>cod</b> (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> and other ground fishes by sustained overfishing resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground fishes, particularly smaller forage fishes and invertebrates such as the northern snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of zooplankton that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an indirect effect.|$|E

The sampling was carried out from July 1978 to January 1981 in Norwegian coastal waters between 62 ° and 66 ° North. The presence of larval cod worm was recorded in 64 % of the examined fishes, and the average infestation in all 704 fishes was 8. 5 cod-worms per fish. However, the infestation decreased significantly with increasing distances from the haul out sites of grey seals and common seals, Phoca vitulina. The heaviest infestations were recorded in cod from the outern part of in shore waters, and slightly decreasing towards the fjords, fitting well to the observed distribution of seals. A substantial decrease was also recorded with increasing distance (and depth) off shore from the mentioned grey seal haul out site...|$|R

40|$|About 1500 ovaries of Baltic cod were {{prepared}} for estimating the potential absolute and relative individual fecundity. The female cod were sampled in the Belt Sea, ICES Subdivision (SD) 22, in the Arkona Sea, SD 24, and in the Bornholm Sea, SD 25. The investigations started in 1992 and until 1999 cruises were carried out to catch female cod in the different sub-divisions every year. The results shows that the potential fecundity is not a stable biological parameter, and that significant changes are possible within a relative short period. It was demonstrated that the developments of the potential individual fecundity of the western (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> morhua) and eastern Baltic <b>cod</b> stocks (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> callarias) were different. In contrast to the stable individual fecundity of the western cod the absolute and relative fecundity of the eastern repeat spawners increased from 1993 to 1999, significantly.

40|$|The {{identification}} of developmental stages in fish eggs from plankton samples is often complicated by deformation of the embryos due to mechanical stress during the sampling procedure and by dehydration during formaldehyde fixation. The effects of formaldehyde fixation and mechanical stress on Baltic <b>cod</b> eggs (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> callarias L.) were examined separately by visually comparing the morphological features of treated vs. live eggs of identical ontogenetic age. Microphotographs were made concurrently for documentation. In stage IA eggs, mechanical treatment resulted in scattered blastodiscs surrounded by single cells, while in further advanced stages the yolk membrane collapsed entirely, the yolk coagulated and the embryo extending over the yolk shrank. Formaldehyde fixation caused the yolk and the blastodisc or embryo to darken, {{and in some}} cases crystalline enclosures occurred. Eggs mechanically deformed during handling were clearly distinguishable from those that died prior to catching; however, staging was generally less accurate for formaldehyde-preserved eggs when compared with living specimens...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method {{to estimate the}} probabilities of maturing at age {{as a function of}} size; these probabilities can often be interpreted as probabilistic reaction norms for age and size at maturation. Such estimations are useful for describing maturation process independently from the processes of growth and mortality, and they can also help to disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary changes in maturation. The estimation method can be used when mature and immature individuals are representatively sampled over two consecutive seasons, even when maturing individuals are not distinguished. Confidence intervals are derived for the reaction norm parameters using a bootstrap approach. Using simulated data, the method is shown to be asymptotically unbiased and robust to moderate violations of the main simplifying assumptions. However, it is relatively sensitive to small sample sizes: the method is not robust when fewer than about 100 individuals (mature and immature) are sampled from a cohort at a certain age. The method is illustrated by an application to Georges Bank <b>cod</b> stock (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> but can be used for any type of organism...|$|R

50|$|Canadian Atlantic <b>Cod</b> or <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua,</b> {{are cold}} water fish, which weigh 2 to 3 kg {{in the wild}} 6. Atlantic Cod were {{originally}} found in the Atlantic Ocean, along the borders of both Canada and England {{and all the way}} down to the southern United States. Heavy fishing in these areas, in the late 1800s and early 1900s led to a massive decline in Cod population.7 Today, they are grown in onshore temperature controlled, seawater tanks as eggs and eventually taken to sea cages when more developed.2 The majority of these artificial environments found in Canada, are located in British Columbia, New Brunswick and as well as Newfoundland and Labrador. It takes about 6 months for the fish to hatch followed by a 2 to 3-year period for them to reach their maximize selling size, therefore taking an average of 3 years for a fish to reach market which is 3 to 5 kg.2 According to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2014) in 2013 1 kg of Cod was being sold for on average $7.12 fish.4 Overall, Atlantic Cod are a relatively recent farmed fish, however are gaining popularity due to price, nutrition and feed to growth ratio.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{possibility}} of enhancing and studying recruitment of commercially important marine fish stocks {{is discussed in}} general, and for North-east Atlantic <b>cod</b> stocks, <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> L., in particular. Current knowledge concerning {{the relative importance of}} different physical and biological factors influencing survival of early stages is addressed in relation to cost-benefit of release programmes. The cost of producing large juveniles is relatively high compared with the expected yield per recruit. Because large juveniles also eventually become too expensive to release, emphasis should he put into releasing the offspring as early as possible. Special attention is given to evaluation of the optimal time for survival of larvae and juveniles and thus the possibility to enhance recruitment by releasing the offspring when environmental factors are favourable. The prey energy available for larval and juvenile fish varies during ontogeny. The period at the onset of exogenous feeding and the early juvenile period are hypothesized to be critical windows in relation to recruitment. Experimental designs in closed and open enclosures for further investigations of the importance of food availability, predation and cannibalism are outlined, with use of genetic and otolith marking for identification of different cohorts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study how a {{stochastic}} {{model can be}} used to determine optimal levels of exploitation of the North-East Arctic <b>Cod</b> (NEAC, <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua).</b> A noncritical depensation growth model is developed for this species in order to examine both deterministic and stochastic cases. Estimation of the biological and the noise term parameters in the stochastic biomass dynamics is based on simulation and use of empirical NEAC data sets for the years 1985 - 2001. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion based method is used to estimate both drift and diffusion parameters simultaneously. The estimates turn out to be reasonable and the model is able to capture the salient features of the NEAC dynamics. The model is used to derive optimal levels of exploitation with different diffusion functions in the stochastic case and various discount rates in the deterministic case. Optimal catches are compared to the historical catch records. A striking feature of our modeling results is that these records fit surprisingly well to the infinite discounting tracks, i. e., the bliss solution. Our general results indicate that over fishing has resulted from lack of long term planning as well as inadequate response to uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of discard sampling programmes is to estimate annual total discards of fish species whose stocks are routinely assessed from catch data. The Scottish discard programme {{is based on}} a stratified random design, and a ratio estimator is used to estimate total discards independently in each stratum. Total discards are then estimated by summing across strata. However, the small number of trips that can be sampled by scientific observers from fisheries institutes creates problems with this estimator. Here, a simulated population of fishing trips is used to investigate alternative estimators of total discards for the main fish species (haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, whiting - Merlangius merlangus, and <b>cod</b> - <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> targeted by Scottish demersal vessels in the North Sea and the West of Scotland. The results show that when the sample size in each stratum is very small, the current methodology - independent ratio estimation in each stratum - can be very biased and imprecise.

40|$|Phaeobacter gallaeciensis can antagonize fish-pathogenic {{bacteria}} in vitro, {{and the purpose}} of this study was to evaluate the organism as a probiont for marine fish larvae and their feed cultures. An in vivo mechanism of action of the antagonistic probiotic bacterium is suggested using a non-antagonistic mutant. P. gallaeciensis was readily established in axenic cultures of the two microalgae Tetraselmis suecica and Nannochloropsis oculata, and of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. P. gallaeciensis reached densities of 10 (7) cfu/ml and did not adversely affect growth of algae or rotifers. Vibrio anguillarum was significantly reduced by wild-type P. gallaeciensis, when introduced into these cultures. A P. gallaeciensis mutant that did not produce the antibacterial compound tropodithietic acid (TDA) did not reduce V. anguillarum numbers, suggesting that production of the antibacterial compound is important for the antagonistic properties of P. gallaeciensis. The ability of P. gallaeciensis to protect fish larvae from vibriosis was determined in a bath challenge experiment using a multidish system with 1 larva per well. Unchallenged larvae reached 40 % accumulated mortality which increased to 100 % when infected with V. anguillarum. P. gallaeciensis reduced the mortality of challenged <b>cod</b> larvae (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> to 10 %, significantly below the levels of both the challenged and the unchallenged larvae. The TDA mutant reduced mortality of the cod larvae in some of the replicates, although to a much lesser extent than the wild type.
