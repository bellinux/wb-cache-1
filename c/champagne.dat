5|$|A strong {{influence}} on <b>Champagne</b> wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of <b>Champagne</b> and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only <b>Champagne</b> wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink <b>Champagne</b> with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to <b>Champagne</b> and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|Alice's brother-in-law, Erard of Ramerupt, renounced his wife's {{claim to}} <b>Champagne</b> {{in return for}} compensation, even {{promising}} to support Theobald IV against Alice in 1218. This led Alice to send envoys to <b>Champagne,</b> against which Blanche of Navarre protested at the Holy See on 23 June 1219.|$|E
5|$|Before his {{departure}} for the Holy Land, Henry of <b>Champagne</b> had bequeathed the Counties of <b>Champagne</b> and Brie to his brother, Theobald, should he die without issue. Although Alice {{and her younger}} sister, Philippa, survived their father, Philip II of France invested their uncle, Theobald III, with <b>Champagne</b> and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving <b>Champagne</b> and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge a posthumous son's right to rule the counties.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de <b>Champagne</b> (CIVC) {{was formed}} {{with the purpose}} of {{protecting}} Champagne's reputation and marketing forces as well as setting up and monitoring regulations for vineyard production and vinification methods. <b>Champagne</b> is the only region that is permitted to exclude AOC or Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée from their labels.|$|E
5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the <b>Champagne</b> region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to {{the reputation of the}} wines that came from this area. The Counts of <b>Champagne</b> ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count of <b>Champagne</b> assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region became part of the Crown territories.|$|E

5|$|While {{some critics}} have feared the {{revision}} of the <b>Champagne</b> region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and <b>Champagne</b> expert Tom Stevenson {{has pointed out that}} the proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion.

5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, sparkling <b>Champagne</b> {{is not the}} only product that is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de <b>Champagne.</b> Since the profit of making sparkling <b>Champagne</b> from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small.|$|E

5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and <b>Champagne.</b> On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several <b>Champagne</b> wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling <b>Champagne.</b> As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage <b>Champagne,</b> 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage <b>champagne</b> must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier <b>Champagne</b> houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage <b>Champagne</b> must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the <b>Champagne</b> houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
