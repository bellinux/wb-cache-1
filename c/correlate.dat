40|$|In many {{industrial}} processes, {{the correlations}} of multiple variables are complicated. Some variables are <b>correlated</b> {{and some are}} weakly <b>correlated</b> with others, which {{should be considered in}} process modelling and fault detection. This paper proposes a <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> fault detection approach, which is mainly based on variable division and independent component analysis (ICA). A few variables are weakly <b>correlated</b> with others and fault detection should be implemented separately for <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> subspaces. Firstly, variable division based on weighted proximity measure is presented to obtain <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> variables. Then, ICA is used for fault detection in <b>correlated</b> subspace and weakly <b>correlated</b> subspace, which needs not kernel mapping or kernel parameter setting. Finally, comprehensive statistics are built based on different subspaces. The proposed method considers the <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> characteristics of variables and the advantages of ICA in handling weakly <b>correlated</b> variables. The monitoring results of the numerical system and Tennessee Eastman (TE) process have been used to demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach...|$|R

In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not <b>correlate</b> with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast).

An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{low-power}} adiabatic sequences {{are demonstrated}} for in vivo localized two-dimensional <b>correlated</b> MR spectroscopy, such as <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy and total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy. The design {{is based on}} three new elements for in vivo two-dimensional MRS: the use of gradient modulated constant adiabaticity GOIA-W(16, 4) pulses for - (i) localization (<b>correlated</b> spectroscopy and total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy) and - (ii) mixing (total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy), and - (iii) the use of longitudinal mixing (z-filter) for magnetization transfer during total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy. GOIA-W(16, 4) provides accurate signal localization, and more importantly, lowers the SAR for both total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy mixing and localization. Longitudinal mixing improves considerably (fivefolds) the efficiency of total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy transfer. These are markedly different from previous 1 D editing total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy sequences using spatially nonselective pulses and transverse mixing. Fully adiabatic (adiabatic mixing with adiabatic localization) and semiadiabatic (adiabatic mixing with nonadiabatic localization) methods for two-dimensional total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy are compared.

40|$|Privacy {{preserving}} on {{data mining}} and data release has attracted an increasing research interest {{over a number}} of decades. Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as <b>correlated</b> information and the data set is defined as <b>correlated</b> data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a <b>correlated</b> data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the <b>correlated</b> data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in <b>correlated</b> data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective <b>correlated</b> differential privacy solution by defining the <b>correlated</b> sensitivity and designing a <b>correlated</b> data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the <b>correlated</b> levels between records, the proposed <b>correlated</b> sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The <b>correlated</b> data releasing mechanism <b>correlated</b> iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed <b>correlated</b> differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a <b>correlated</b> data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the <b>correlated</b> differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy...|$|R

A direct coalition-proof <b>correlated</b> equilibrium is a canonical device such that the obedient strategy is a coalition-proof Nash equilibrium of the canonical extended game. The "revelation principle" does not hold. Even in case of two-person games, there exists coalition-proof <b>correlated</b> equilibrium for which the corresponding induced distribution is not a direct coalition-proof <b>correlated</b> equilibrium. The set of direct coalition-proof <b>correlated</b> equilibria is not convex unlike the set of <b>correlated</b> equilibria.
