40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} of the direct methanol fuel cell with gas fuel is developed. Simulation of the cell with <b>current</b> <b>collectors</b> of conventional geometry reveal the formation of fuel-depleted, "shaded" regions in the cathode and anode catalyst layers. These regions are positioned in front of <b>current</b> <b>collectors,</b> farther from the gas channel windows. Another disadvantage of the conventional geometry is the concentration of electron current {{at the edges of}} <b>current</b> <b>collectors.</b> Based on the simulation results, a new design of <b>current</b> <b>collectors</b> is suggested. It is beneficial to position <b>current</b> <b>collectors</b> inside the backing and catalyst layers, parallel to the flow of the fuel. These embedded collectors do not produce shaded regions in the catalyst layers. Two plausible geometries of such collectors are considered: of rectangular and circular shape. Simulations show that depending on the transport properties of the backing and catalyst layers the embedded <b>current</b> <b>collectors</b> may significantly improve the performance of the fuel cell.

25|$|The GDL {{electrically}} {{connects the}} catalyst and <b>current</b> <b>collector.</b> It must be porous, electrically conductive, and thin. The reactants {{must be able}} to reach the catalyst, but conductivity and porosity can act as opposing forces. Optimally, the GDL should be composed of about one third Nafion or 15% PTFE. The carbon particles used in the GDL can be larger than those employed in the catalyst because surface area is not the most important variable in this layer. GDL should be around 15-35µm thick to balance needed porosity with mechanical strength. Often, an intermediate porous layer is added between the GDL and catalyst layer to ease the transitions between the large pores in the GDL and small porosity in the catalyst layer. Since a primary function of the GDL is to help remove water, a product, flooding can occur when water effectively blocks the GDL. This limits the reactants ability to access the catalyst and significantly decreases performance. Teflon can be coated onto the GDL to limit the possibility of flooding. Several microscopic variables are analyzed in the GDLS such as: porosity, tortuosity and permeability. These variables have incidence over the behavior of the fuel cells. Two major GDL substrates, carbon cloth and paper, were compared, indicative of different cell performances.|$|E

40|$|Sizing {{electrodes}} is {{an important}} step during Lithium-ion battery manufacturing processes since poor cut edge affects battery performance significantly and sometime leads to fire hazard. Mechanical cutting could result in a poor cut quality with defects. The cutting quality can be improved by using a laser, due to its high energy concentration, fast processing time, small heat-affected zone, and high precision. The cutting quality is highly influenced by operating parameters such as laser power and scanning speed. Thus, we studied a numerical simulation to provide a guideline for achieving clear edge quality. In order to simulate electrodes laser cutting for Lithium-Ion batteries, understanding the behavior of <b>current</b> <b>collectors</b> is crucial.
