50|$|There was no {{turntable}} on the line, and engines ran <b>chimney</b> <b>first</b> towards Waterhouses, despite initial concerns (usually engines on a gradient run {{the other}} way, {{to keep the}} water over the firebox crown) about the steeper down section (1 in 40) out of Waterhouses. In latter years E.R. Calthrop returned from repairs in Crewe facing the other way, {{as can be seen}} in later photographs.|$|E
50|$|The {{vertical}} interval—205 feet—and {{the topography}} in general {{made the connection}} awkward, and a tortuous route was built, running in nearly a full circle. The Lodge Hill cutting through rock {{was one of the}} deepest in the county. The ruling gradient was 1 in 40 and the sharpest curve 8 chains (160m). Because of the steep gradient, locomotives worked <b>chimney</b> <b>first</b> to Liskeard, to ensure that the firebox crown remained covered with water. The line terminated in a south facing bay platform at Liskeard. The connection between the branch line there and the main line was a sharply curved siding.|$|E
50|$|In Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, these {{locomotives}} normally worked <b>chimney</b> <b>first</b> {{with the}} water tank at the rear. Since the Rhodesian bush war was still ongoing in 1979, the locomotives were equipped with armour plating around the cab. Since this obscured the number plates, the engine numbers were then usually stencilled on the cabsides. The Class GMAM was similar in size with a similar coal capacity to the Rhodesia Railways 20th class 4-8-2+2-8-4 Garratt, {{but it had a}} voracious appetite for coal and frequently ran low on fuel with the result that trains often had to be dumped. In an attempt to solve this problem, RR extended the height of the Class GMAM's coal bunker by a foot to increase the capacity.|$|E

5000|$|From , {{the station}} {{was the site of}} the sole {{turntable}} on the network. It was purchased from the West Clare Railway in Ireland, after that company had been unable to accept delivery from the manufacturers Ransomes & Rapier Ltd of Ipswich. It was used to turn carriages to equalise weathering and wheel wear and tear. Use for turning of locomotives was not documented, and they usually ran [...] "bunker first" [...] towards Douglas. In the earliest years of the railway locomotives were turned to be <b>chimney</b> <b>first</b> towards Douglas if outstationed at Peel, Port Erin or Ramsey, but this practice was abandoned {{in the early years of}} the twentieth century. The turntable was removed in 1961 and stored at Douglas with the intention of using it to turn the recently acquired diesel railcars. This scheme never came to fruition and the turntable was moved to Ballasalla Station in 1974 and scrapped shortly thereafter. When the Marquess of Ailsa took over the line in 1967 a display of disused locomotives was created at the station. After services ceased in 1968 the carriage shed was used to store surplus rolling stock which was moved back to Douglas for use on the south line as required. In 1975 there were two disastrous fires in the shed, and much historic stock was lost. After this the site was used for storing rails as the track was dismantled, and cleared by the late 1970s to become a car park. There was a gravel siding at one time at the eastern end of the station beyond the Foxdale line overbridge, which used temporary Jubilee rail and operated on 2' 0" [...] gauge independently of the railway, although a siding to access this was installed.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{these are}} used in power plants where the harmful gases {{coming out of the}} <b>chimneys</b> are <b>first</b> treated using {{electrostatic}} separator. Here the two electrodes are oppositely charged, with a negative electrode the positive ions gets attracted and thus results in a reddish flame whereas the positive electrode is used to treat the negatively charged ions resulting in a bluish white flame that is visible at nights.|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>chimney</b> was {{square in}} section. It was {{replaced}} {{when the second}} engine house was built. The new chimney, round in section is of red brick, 200 feet (61m) high with a stone oversailer. It served four Lancashire boilers.|$|R
5000|$|Hall-houses predated the {{invention}} of chimneys, and a wattle-and-daub smoke hood was used until the <b>first</b> <b>chimney</b> {{was added to the}} central bay in around 1600. [...] This {{has been described as a}} [...] "fine example of a late Tudor chimney".|$|R
60|$|The <b>chimney</b> was the <b>first</b> to {{disappear}} from the calculation. Looking up it, Rupert {{saw that it was}} crossed by a dozen iron bars, the height too was very great, and even when at the top the height was immense to descend to the fosse.|$|R
50|$|Simonds Tavern is an {{historic}} tavern building on 331 Bedford Street in Lexington, Massachusetts. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, eight bays wide, with two front entrances and asymmetrically placed <b>chimneys.</b> The <b>first</b> {{portion of the}} building was built c. 1794 by Joshua Simonds, who also ran a tavern near Fiske Hill. He began operating a tavern at this site in 1802, and enlarged the building 1810 after Bedford Street was cut through the area. The building's interior has well-preserved Federal details.|$|R
60|$|As {{they stood}} there, speechless, there {{came from the}} other side of the <b>chimney,</b> softly at <b>first,</b> then swelling, the sound of a child's voice, raised in a {{tentative}} wail.

50|$|The Robert W Scherer Power Plant (also {{known as}} Plant Scherer) is a {{coal-fired}} power plant in Juliette, Georgia, just north of Macon, Georgia, in the United States. The plant has four units, each producing 880 megawatts. The plant is named after the former {{chairman and chief executive}} officer of Georgia Power. It has two 1001 ft <b>chimneys,</b> the <b>first</b> built in 1982 and the second in 1986. Plant Scherer is the seventh largest electric generating plant in the United States, and is the #1 emitter of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S., at over 20 million tons per year.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} {{noted for its}} American looks - the running-plates were {{positioned}} {{at a high level}} and a gap left ahead of the cylinders. Because of this many locomotive enthusiasts considered it to be the ugliest British locomotive produced, especially those locomotives outshopped with double <b>chimneys</b> (the <b>first</b> 50 engines); however, these gave poor performance and were quickly replaced with single chimneys. The locomotives also incorporated new mechanical features intended to reduce maintenance costs. The utilitarian appearance was a deliberate design decision as there are sketches which show the locomotive with conventional curved running plates.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower stage}} is entirely vaulted in stone. In the kitchen, the {{vaulting}} {{is supported by}} a single pillar in the centre, as was usual. One of the towers contains a spiral staircase. The two floors each include French-style ceilings and chimneys. The two <b>chimneys</b> on the <b>first</b> floor were partly modified in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Corrugated (also called pleated) {{paper was}} {{patented}} in England in 1856, {{and used as}} a liner for tall hats, but corrugated boxboard was not patented and used as a shipping material until 20 December 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City for single-sided (single-face) corrugated board. Jones used the corrugated board for wrapping bottles and glass lantern <b>chimneys.</b> The <b>first</b> machine for producing large quantities of corrugated board was built in 1874 by G. Smyth, {{and in the same}} year Oliver Long improved upon Jones's design by inventing corrugated board with liner sheets on both sides. This was corrugated cardboard as we know it today.|$|R
50|$|Among other characteristics, First Period {{houses have}} a steeply pitched roof; a {{slightly}} asymmetrical plan; and a central <b>chimney.</b> The <b>first</b> period house is distinguished from later houses by its exposed (often decorated or chamfered) frame in the interior. Some early windows in modest houses {{may have had}} no glazing, but the standard first period window, until at least 1700, was the diamond-paned casement. No example {{of this type of}} window survives in situ; all current examples date to (at the very earliest) the late 19th century. Multiple-light, sliding sash windows started to appear around 1700, and by about 1750 had supplanted the earlier type.|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> {{industrial}} <b>chimneys</b> {{were built}} in the mid-17th century when it was first understood how they could improve the combustion of a furnace by increasing the draft of air into the combustion zone. As such, they played an important part in the development of reverberatory furnaces and a coal-based metallurgical industry, one of the key sectors of the early Industrial Revolution. Most 18th-century industrial chimneys (now commonly referred to as flue gas stacks) {{were built in}}to the walls of the furnace much like a domestic <b>chimney.</b> The <b>first</b> free-standing industrial <b>chimneys</b> were probably those erected {{at the end of the}} long condensing flues associated with smelting lead.|$|R

25|$|Steam power came to {{the mill}} in three major {{building}} phases. In 1865 a beam engine house was built, together with a boiler house and the <b>first</b> <b>chimney</b> on the site.

50|$|For a {{long time}} the Otago tower was blind but in the 1930s Thomas Sidey, a local {{politician}} {{and a member of}} the university council, paid for a clock to be installed. In the 1950s the Ministry of Works recommended demolishing the building as an earthquake risk. Instead the university council strengthened it, with visible tie-rods, in the early 1960s.

40|$|The Division {{has been}} aware, for many years, {{of many of}} the {{difficulties}} presented by domestic chimneys. Not only must a chimney operate satisfactorily as a gas venting device, for which purpose it must produce draft, but it must also provide protection against the ignition of materials adjacent to it.

2500|$|The {{emphasis}} was on the simple, rustic, and the less impressive aspects of Tudor architecture, imitating in this way medieval cottages or country houses. [...] Although the style follows these more modest characteristics, items such as steeply pitched-roofs, half-timbering often infilled with herringbone brickwork, tall mullioned windows, high <b>chimneys,</b> jettied (overhanging) <b>first</b> floors above pillared porches, dormer windows supported by consoles, and even at times thatched roofs, gave Tudor revival its more striking effects. It is also quite expensive.|$|R
50|$|On 26 April 1922 {{the worst}} {{earthquake}} (6.8) in decades struck Tokyo.

50|$|Prior to the 18th {{century in}} Europe, people cooked over open fires fueled by wood. In the Middle Ages, waist-high brick-and-mortar hearths and the <b>first</b> <b>chimneys</b> appeared, so that cooks {{no longer had}} to kneel or sit to tend to foods on the fire. The fire was built on top of the construction; the cooking done mainly in cauldrons hung above the fire or placed on trivets.

5000|$|The {{fireplace}} is a three-sided incombustible box {{containing a}} grate that allows an updraught and a controlled flue. It is most suited to burning sea-cole. Sea-cole or coal {{as it is}} now called was quarried from outcrops around England and transported to London as early as 1253. [...] In larger houses, fireplaces and <b>chimneys</b> were <b>first</b> used as supplementary heating in the parlour, before eventually suppressing the open hearth. In smaller hall houses, where heat efficiency and cooking were the prime concern, fireplaces became the principal source of heat earlier. The design of the coal grate was important and the open fire became more sophisticated and enclosed leading in later centuries to the coal burning kitchen range with its hob, oven and water boiler, and the Triplex type kitchen range with a back boiler and the 1922 AGA cooker.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} novel {{indication}} {{for the use}} of chimney grafts to preserve flow to the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for aortobi-iliac aneurysms with coexistent bilateral occlusion of the internal iliac arteries (IIA). Technique: Via a cutdown over the left axillary artery, a 5 -F vertebral catheter was delivered over a conventional 0. 035 -inch hydrophilic guidewire to selectively catheterize the IMA via a 7 -F shuttle sheath, which was then advanced at least 2 cm into the target vessel. The <b>first</b> <b>chimney</b> graft was advanced into the sheath, and a standard EVAR procedure followed. The chimney graft was deployed at least 2 cm in the IMA; a second chimney graft was advanced and deployed with at least 2 cm overlapping with the <b>first</b> <b>chimney</b> stent parallel and outside of the main abdominal endograft and below the lowest renal artery. The chimney grafts were lined with additional bare nitinol stents. The technique is demonstrated in two male patients who suffered from symptomatic aortobi-iliac aneurysm with patent IMAs and bilateral IIA occlusion. The procedure was completed successfully in both cases without bowel ischemia. At 12 and 6 months, respectively, the chimney grafts remained paten...|$|R
