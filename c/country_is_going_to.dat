500|$|A {{significant}} difference between the European and U.S. banking systems was the absence of a central bank in the United States. European states were able to extend the supply of money during periods of low cash reserves. The belief that the U.S. economy was vulnerable without a central bank was not new. Early in 1907, banker Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. warned {{in a speech to the}} New York Chamber of Commerce that [...] "unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, this <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history".|$|E

500|$|In 1893, {{bimetallism}} {{had been}} {{just one of many}} proposals by Populists and others. [...] As the economic downturn continued, free silver advocates blamed its continuation on the repeal of the silver purchase act, and the issue of silver became more prominent. [...] Free silver especially resonated among farmers in the South and West, as well as miners. [...] June 1894 marked the publication of William H. Harvey's Coin's Financial School. [...] The book, composed of accounts of (fictitious) lectures on the silver issue given by an adolescent named Coin to Chicago audiences, became an immense bestseller. [...] The book included (as foils to the title character) many of Chicago's most prominent men of business; some, such as banker and future Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage, issued denials that they had participated in any such lectures. [...] This popular treatment of the currency issue was highly influential. [...] A Missourian, Ezra Peters, wrote to Illinois Senator John M. Palmer, [...] "Coins [...] Financial School is raising h— in this neck of the woods. [...] If those in favor of honest money don't do something to offset its influence the <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the dogs." [...] A Minnesota correspondent wrote in Outlook magazine: [...] "high school boys are about equally divided between silver and baseball, with a decided leaning toward the former".|$|E
500|$|Most {{radicals}} {{were confident}} that Johnson would be convicted and removed from office. [...] Stevens, however, was never {{certain of the}} result as Chief Justice Chase (the former Treasury Secretary) made rulings that favored the defense, {{and he had no}} great confidence Republicans would stick together. On May 11, the Senate met in secret session, and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote. [...] All Democrats were opposed, but an unexpectedly large number of Republicans also favored acquittal on {{some or all of the}} articles. [...] Counting votes, managers realized their best chance of gaining the required two-thirds for conviction was on the Stevens-inspired ArticleXI, and when the Senate assembled to give its verdict, they scheduled it to be voted upon first. The suspense was broken when Kansas Senator Edmund Ross, whose position was uncertain, voted for acquittal. [...] This meant that, with the votes of those who remained, the President would not be convicted on that article. [...] The article failed, 35 in favor to 19 against. In the hope that delay would bring a different result, Republicans adjourned the Senate for ten days. [...] Stevens was carried from the Senate in his chair—one observer described him as [...] "black with rage and disappointment"—and when those outside clamored for the result, Stevens shouted, [...] "The <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the devil!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The group's founder, M. Zuhdi Jasser, {{a former}} Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy, said that Muslims need to {{recognize}} Israel as a state, to stand against radical Islamist groups by name, not by theory, tactic, or condemning terrorism, but by name—Hamas, Al Qaeda and other groups. Jasser calls political Islamism [...] "the root cause of Islamist terrorism" [...] and a matter on which it is [...] "time to take sides." [...] An outspoken supporter of Israel, Jasser warned against {{what he sees as}} the increasing threats of Radical Islam to the West: [...] "Israel has always been a canary in the coal mine, dealing with the threat of radical Islam.
