Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs {{to be taken into account}} by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable.

25|$|Stability is a {{major concern}} in RF and {{microwave}} amplifiers. The degree of an amplifier's stability <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantified</b> by a so-called stability factor.

25|$|Solubility {{may also}} {{strongly}} {{depend on the}} presence of other species dissolved in the solvent, for example, complex-forming anions (ligands) in liquids. Solubility will also depend on the excess or deficiency of a common ion in the solution, a phenomenon known as the common-ion effect.

Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to epidemiological surveys, MSF also uses population surveys {{to determine the}} rates of violence in various regions. By estimating the scopes of , and determining the rate of kidnappings, rapes, and killings, psychosocial programmes can be implemented to lower the suicide rate and increase the sense of security in a population. Large-scale forced migrations, excessive civilian casualties and massacres <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantified</b> using surveys, and MSF can use the results {{to put pressure on}} governments to provide help, or even expose genocide. MSF conducted the first comprehensive mortality survey in Darfur in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of second-order arithmetic is two-sorted. The first sort of terms {{and in particular}} variables, usually denoted by lower case letters, consists of individuals, whose intended interpretation is as natural numbers. The other sort of variables, variously called “set variables,” “class variables,” or even “predicates” are usually denoted by upper-case letters. They refer to classes/predicates/properties of individuals, and so {{can be thought of}} as sets of natural numbers. Both individuals and set variables <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantified</b> universally or existentially. A formula with no bound set variables (that is, no quantifiers over set variables) is called arithmetical. An arithmetical formula may have free set variables and bound individual variables.|$|E

Where objective measurement is desired, light levels <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantified</b> by field measurement or mathematical modeling, with results typically displayed as an isophote map or light contour map. Authorities have also taken a variety of measures for dealing with light pollution, depending on the interests, beliefs and understandings of the society involved. Measures range from doing nothing at all, to implementing strict laws and regulations about how lights may be installed and used.|$|E

25|$|Cytopathology (examination under a microscope) {{of either}} a {{tracheal}} wash or a BAL sample can determine whether EIPH has occurred. The number of {{red blood cells}} present <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantified</b> using a hemocytometer. A normal lung wash sample contains fewer than 10 red blood cells/μl of fluid. In the case of EIPH, the numbers will be several magnitudes or more higher. The presence of high numbers of hemosiderophages indicate that hemorrhage {{has occurred in the}} lung at some time in the past. Hemosiderophages are alveolar macrophages that have ingested and digested red blood cells from previous episodes of EIPH. The end product of the digestion of the red blood cells is an iron-storage complex known as hemosiderin.|$|E
25|$|However, if {{the subject}} company is privately owned, its value must be {{adjusted}} for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction {{in the value of}} the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantified</b> by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.|$|E
25|$|The {{vesicular}} transport assay detects the translocation {{of molecules}} by ABC transporters. Membranes prepared under suitable conditions contain inside-out oriented vesicles with the ATP binding site and substrate binding {{site of the}} transporter facing the buffer outside. Substrates of the transporter are taken up into the vesicles in an ATP dependent manner. Rapid filtration using glass fiber filters or nitrocellulose membranes are used to separate the vesicles from the incubation solution and the test compound trapped inside the vesicles is retained on the filter. The quantity of the transported unlabelled molecules is determined by HPLC, LC/MS, LC/MS/MS. Alternatively, the compounds are radiolabeled, fluorescent or have a fluorescent tag so that the radioactivity or fluorescence retained on the filter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantified.</b>|$|E
