The current experiments sought to characterize the specific field-capture channels that confer this sensitivity using a task in which the participant is required to detect {{the location of a}} small patch of one type of grayscale scramble in an extended background of another type. Analysis of the results supports the existence of four field-capture channels: (1) the (previously characterized) “blackshot” channel, sharply tuned to the blackest grayscales; (2) a (previously unknown) “gray-tuned” field-capture <b>channel</b> whose <b>sensitivity</b> is zero for black rising sharply to maximum sensitivity for grayscales slightly darker than mid-gray then decreasing to half-height for brighter grayscales; (3) an “up-ramped” <b>channel</b> whose <b>sensitivity</b> is zero for black, increases linearly with increasing grayscale reaching a maximum near white; (4) a (complementary) “down-ramped” <b>channel</b> whose <b>sensitivity</b> is maximal for black, decreases linearly reaching a minimum near white.

40|$|ATP-sensitive {{potassium}} (KATP) {{channels are}} regulated {{by a variety}} of cytosolic factors (adenine nucleotides, Mg 2 +, phospholipids, and pH). We previously reported that KATP channels are also regulated by endogenous membrane-bound SNARE protein syntaxin- 1 A (Syn- 1 A), which binds both nucleotide-binding folds of sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1 and 2 A, causing inhibition of KATP channel activity in pancreatic islet β-cells and cardiac myocytes, respectively. In this study, we show that ATP dose-dependently inhibits Syn- 1 A binding to SUR 1 at physiological concentrations, with the addition of Mg 2 + causing a decrease in the ATP-induced inhibitory effect. This ATP disruption of Syn- 1 A binding to SUR 1 was confirmed by FRET analysis in living HEK 293 cells. Electrophysiological studies in pancreatic β-cells demonstrated that reduced ATP concentrations increased KATP <b>channel</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to Syn- 1 A inhibition.

SP exerts excitatory effects in the central nervous system, but peripheral SP actions are still poorly understood; therefore, here, we aimed at investigating these peripheral mechanisms. Results: SP acutely inhibited T-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels in nociceptors. The effect was mediated by neurokinin 1 (NK 1) receptor-induced stimulation of intracellular release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), {{as it can be}} prevented or reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol and mimicked by exogenous or endogenous ROS. This redox-mediated T-type Ca 2 + channel inhibition operated through the modulation of CaV 3. 2 <b>channel</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to ambient zinc, as it can be prevented or reversed by zinc chelation and mimicked by exogenous zinc. Elimination of the zinc-binding site in CaV 3. 2 rendered the channel insensitive to SP-mediated inhibition. Importantly, peripherally applied SP significantly reduced bradykinin-induced nociception in rats in vivo; knock-down of CaV 3. 2 significantly reduced this anti-nociceptive effect. This atypical signaling cascade shared the initial steps with the SP-mediated augmentation of M-type K+ channels described earlier. Innovation: Our study established a mechanism underlying the peripheral anti-nociceptive effect of SP whereby this neuropeptide produces ROS-dependent inhibition of pro-algesic T-type Ca 2 + current and concurrent enhancement of anti-algesic M-type K+ current. These findings will lead {{to a better understanding of}} mechanisms of endogenous analgesia.

DETA/NO stimulated the calcium currents and slightly increased the <b>channel</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to depolarizing voltages. The effect of DETA/NO on the calcium current was blocked by either depleting the NO in DETA/NO or by pretreating the neurons with NEM, a thiol-specific alkylating agent, suggesting an involvement of S-nitrosylation in the current response to NO. In addition, activation of the cGMP pathway by 8 -Br-cGMP inhibited the calcium current in the neurons. Also, inhibition of guanylyl cyclase by 1 H-[1, 2, 4] oxadiazolo [4, 3 -a] quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) increased the current response to DETA/NO.

40|$|The LHC {{sensitivity}} to an anomalous Higgs coupling {{to the top}} quark in the Higgs-top associated production is analyzed. Thanks to the strong destructive interference in the t-channel for standard model couplings, this process can be very sensitive to both the magnitude and {{the sign of a}} nonstandard top-Higgs coupling. We analyze cross sections and the main irreducible backgrounds for the H →γγ decay <b>channel.</b> <b>Sensitivities</b> to an anomalous sign for the top Yukawa coupling are found to be large. In particular, at √(s) = 14 TeV, assuming a universal rescaling in the Yukawa sector, a parton-level analysis with realistic selection cuts gives a signal-to-background ratio S/B 5, for - 1. 5 < Y_t/Y_t^SM < 0. A number of events S 10 (with corresponding significances 3 σ) are expected for 60 fb^- 1, to be compared with the standard-model expectation S 0. 3.

40|$|International {{audience}} The {{effective control}} of insect pests {{is based on}} the rational use of the most efficient and safe insecticide treatments. To increase the effects of classical insecticides and to avoid the ability of certain pest insects to develop resistance, it is essential to propose novel strategies. Previous studies have shown that calcium-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is now considered as a new cellular mechanism for increasing the target sensitivity to insecticides. Because it is known that virus entry is correlated with intracellular calcium concentration rise, this report attempts to present the most important data relevant to the feasibility of combining an insect virus such as baculovirus or densovirus with an insecticide. In this case, the insect virus is not used as a bioinsecticide but acts as a synergistic agent able to trigger calcium rise and to activate calcium-dependent intracellular signaling pathways involved in the increase of the membrane receptors and/or ion <b>channels</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to insecticides. This virus-insecticide mixture represents a promising alternative to optimize the efficacy of insecticides against insect pests, while reducing the doses. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} whether ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) {{channels are}} present on presynaptic terminals {{of the rat}} motor cortex, {{an area of the}} CNS exhibiting a high density of sulphonylurea binding. A novel fused nerve terminal preparation was developed which produced structures amenable to patch clamp methods. In inside-out recordings a K+ channel was observed which possessed all the major features of the Type 1 KATP <b>channel,</b> including <b>sensitivity</b> to ATP and the antidiabetic sulphonylureas...|$|R
