40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis was inspired {{by one of the}} most fascinating classes of naturally occurring molecules: bipedal motor proteins from the kinesin, dynein and myosin superfamilies walk along cellular tracks, carrying out essential tasks, such as vesicle transport, muscle contraction or force generation. Although a few synthetic mimicks based on DNA have been described, small-molecule analogues that exhibit the most important characteristics of the biological walkers were still missing until recently. In this thesis, the design, synthesis and operation of several small-molecule walker-track systems is described. All presented systems share a similar molecular architecture, featuring disulfide and hydrazone walker-track linkages, yet deviate fundamentally in the mechanism and energy input that is required for directional walker transport. Chapter I includes an overview of the biological walker proteins, as well as a comprehensive review of the DNA-based mimicks published to date. A set of fundamental walker characteristics is identified and special emphasis is given to the underlying physical mechanisms. Chapter II describes a series of experiments, which lay the groundwork for all smallmolecule walker systems {{presented in}} the following Chapters of this thesis. The mutually exclusive nature of disulfide and hydrazone exchange under basic and acidic reaction conditions, was demonstrated using an unprecedented type of macrocycle. The first small-molecule walker-track system is described in Chapter III. Due to the passive nature of both the track and the walker unit, an oscillation of acidic and basic reaction conditions led to a directionally un-biased, intramolecular ‘diffusion’ of the walker unit along the track. Using an irreversible redox-reaction for one of the foot-track exchange reactions conferred a certain degree of directionality to the walking sequence, with the oxidant iodine providing the chemical fuel for the underlying Brownian information ratchet mechanism. Chapter IV contains a comprehensive investigation of the dynamic properties of a series of walker-track conjugates derived from the walker-track conjugate presented in Chapter III. The most significant observation was that ring strain appears to be a requirement for the emergence of directional bias, a phenomenon that has also been found in biological walkers. In Chapter V a different type of walker-track conjugate is described, in which the track plays an active role and light is used as the fuel required for directional walker transport. The key for achieving directionality was the presence of a stilbene unit as part of the molecular track, through which ring strain could be induced in the isomer where the walker unit bridges the E-stilbene linkage. Significantly, the underlying Brownian energy ratchet mechanism allowed walker transport in either direction of the molecular track. Chapters II to V are presented in the form of articles that have recently been published or will be published in due course in peer-reviewed journals. No attempt has been made to re-write this work out of context, other than to avoid repetition, insert crossreferences to other Chapters (where appropriate) and to ensure <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>presentation</b> throughout this thesis. Chapters II, III, IV and V are reproduced in the Appendix, in their published formats. The Outlook contains closing remarks about the scope and significance of the presented work as well as ideas for the design and operation of a next generation of small-molecule walkers, some of which are well under way in the laboratory.

40|$|This Thesis {{explores the}} topic of large {{amplitude}} motion within molecular machines and the different mechanisms and molecular architectures that are exploited {{in order to achieve}} control over the relative positions of submolecular components with respect to one another. Chapter One provides a thorough survey of a vast range of molecular switches and machines that have been developed during the last two decades. The focus is on interlocked and non-interlocked systems that display highly controlled large amplitude motion and the principles that govern their operation. Initially, simple molecular switches and shuttles are described with the chapter finally arriving at complex molecular machines such as motors, ratchets and walking molecules. The importance of understanding the different mechanisms that dictate the operation of switchable molecular machines and their fundamental differences are highlighted throughout the chapter. Chapters Two to Four are devoted to reporting the author’s contributions to novel switchable molecular systems. Chapter Two describes the serendipitous discovery of an ion-pair template which has been exploited in rotaxane formation and the operation of an orthogonal interaction anion-switchable molecular shuttle. The macrocycle moves back and forth along the thread between a cationic pyridinium station and a metal coordinating triazole motif when chloride anions are bound and removed respectively from a palladium centre which is located inside the cavity of the macrocycle. Excellent positional integrity (> 98 %) of the ring at both stations is achieved due to the orthogonal binding modes in the two states of the shuttle. Chapter Three presents a non-interlocked molecular switch that operates through the manipulation of dynamic covalent chemistry. The switch is comprised of a “two legged”, small organic molecule (a “walking unit”), anchored to a three foothold track via one disulfide and one hydrazone bond. The acid promoted hydrazone exchange allows a specific ratio of the two positional isomers to be achieved at equilibrium. However, the system is also arranged in such a manner that the ratio can be biased towards one positional isomer when the hydrazone exchange is carried out alongside the photoisomerisation (Z  E) of a stilbene motif which is incorporated in the track. The isomerisation alters the relative free energies of the products by increasing the ring strain of one positional isomer with respect to the other, hence introducing bias into the system. The final chapter reports the logical progression of the work presented in Chapter Three and describes the pursuit of a four-station dynamic covalent energy ratchet, of which the net position of the walker unit can be driven away from a steady state, minimum energy distribution by orthogonal disulfide and hydrazone exchange and concomitant stilbene isomerisation. The endeavour towards the successful synthesis of this rather complex molecule is described alongside the principles for its proposed operation. Chapter Two is presented {{in the form of an}} article that has already been published in a peer-reviewed journal. No attempt has been made to rewrite this work other than a slight alteration in the order of figures in the text to allow for easier reading and re-formatting to ensure <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>presentation</b> throughout this thesis.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new integrated color coding and a contrast-based monochromatic fusion process. The fusion process is aimed for on board real time application {{and it is}} based on practical and computationally efficient image processing components. We developed two methods for color coding that utilize the monochrome fused image. Each of the color coding methods provides <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> color <b>presentation</b> as a function of daytime, background variability and illumination conditions. The new monochrome fusion process maximizes the information content in the combined image, while retaining visual clues that are essential for navigation/piloting tasks. The method is a multi scale fusion process that provides a combination of pixel selection from a single image and a weighting of the two/multiple images. The spectral region is divided into spatial sub bands of different scales, and within each scale a combination rule for the corresponding pixels taken from the two components is applied. Even when the combination rule is a binary selection the combined fused image may have a combination of pixel values taken from the two components at various scales since it is taken at each scale. We also applied a combination rule that takes a weighted sum of the two pixel values. The fusion concept was demonstrated against imagery from image intensifiers and forward looking infrared sensors currently used by the U. S. Navy for navigation and targeting.

The present study examined the reproducibility and validity of a continuous pain rating procedure. Methods Twenty-eight healthy volunteers participated. Pain was induced using constant current delivered to the non-dominant forearm using bipolar electrodes. Pain was rated continuously on an electronic VAS monitored by a computer.
