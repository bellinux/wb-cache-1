5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E

The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E

The Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town, South Africa, was built in 1666, and its entrance was made of the small yellow bricks called ijselstene (IJssel stones).

5|$|Deep-fried {{butter is}} a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> a batter or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it}} is served worldwide. It has a significant buttery flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
