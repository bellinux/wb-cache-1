2500|$|The 68000 comparison, arithmetic, {{and logic}} {{operations}} set bit flags in a status register {{to record their}} results for use by later conditional jumps. The bit flags are [...] "zero" [...] (Z), [...] "carry" [...] (C), [...] "overflow" [...] (V), [...] "extend" [...] (X), and [...] "negative" [...] (N). The [...] "extend" [...] (X) flag deserves special mention, because it is separate from the <b>carry</b> <b>flag.</b> This permits the extra bit from arithmetic, logic, and shift operations {{to be separated from}} the carry for flow-of-control and linkage.|$|E
50|$|While the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> is {{well-defined}} for addition, {{there are}} two ways in common use to use the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> for subtraction operations.|$|E
50|$|Rotate through carry {{is similar}} to the rotate no carry operation, but the two ends of the {{register}} are separated by the <b>carry</b> <b>flag.</b> The bit that is shifted in (on either end) is the old value of the <b>carry</b> <b>flag,</b> and the bit that is shifted out (on the other end) becomes the new value of the <b>carry</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E

50|$|Then, if {{the most}} {{significant}} nibble of the result is 10 or higher, or if the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> is set, then the processor adds 96 (6 times 16) to the result and sets the <b>carry</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E
5000|$|C <b>Carry</b> <b>flag.</b> This is a borrow flag on subtracts. [...] Unlike other CPUs, <b>Carry</b> <b>flag</b> is not {{affected}} by INC/DEC instructions: 101. In other words, for AVR, DEC Rd is not same as SUBI Rd, 1.|$|E
5000|$|A single rotate through carry can {{simulate}} a logical or arithmetic shift of one position {{by setting up}} the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> beforehand. For example, if the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> contains 0, then [...] is a logical right-shift, and if the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> contains {{a copy of the}} sign bit, then [...] is an arithmetic right-shift. For this reason, some microcontrollers such as low end PICs just have rotate and rotate through carry, and don't bother with arithmetic or logical shift instructions.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the 8080, the Z80 {{can jump}} to a {{relative}} address using a signed 8-bit displacement. Only the Zero and <b>Carry</b> <b>flags</b> {{can be tested}} for these new two-byte JR instructions.|$|R

5|$|Polish flags {{were also}} used by anti-government demonstrators under the Communist rule. During the bloody riots of 1956 in Pozna≈Ñ and 1970 in Gdynia, protesters <b>carried</b> <b>flags</b> that were blood-stained on the white stripe.|$|R
50|$|South Africa's Olympic Committee chose Du Toit to <b>carry</b> their <b>flag</b> at the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, {{making her}} the first athlete to <b>carry</b> a <b>flag</b> in both Olympics and Paralympics in a single year.|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} processors the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> (usually indicated as the C flag) is {{a single}} bit in a system status (flag) register used to indicate when an arithmetic carry or borrow has been generated out {{of the most significant}} ALU bit position. The <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> enables numbers larger than a single ALU width to be added/subtracted by carrying (adding) a binary digit from a partial addition/subtraction to the least significant bit position of a more significant word. It is also used to extend bit shifts and rotates in a similar manner on many processors (sometimes done via a dedicated X flag). For subtractive operations, two (opposite) conventions are employed as most machines set the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> on borrow while some machines (such as the 6502 and the PIC) instead reset the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> on borrow (and vice versa).|$|E
50|$|The <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> is {{also often}} used {{following}} comparison instructions, which are typically implemented by subtractive operations, {{to allow a}} decision to be made about {{which of the two}} compared values is lower than (or greater or equal to) the other. Branch instructions which examine the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> are often represented by mnemonics such as BCC and BCS to branch if the carry is clear, or branch if the carry is set respectively. When used in this way the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> provides a mechanism for comparing the values as unsigned integers. This is in contrast to the overflow flag which provides a mechanism for comparing the values as signed integer values.|$|E
50|$|Another example {{may be an}} 8-bit {{register}} with the bit pattern 0101_0101 and the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> set; if we execute a rotate left through carry instruction, {{the result would be}} 1010_1011 with the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> cleared because the most significant bit (bit 7) was rotated into the carry while the carry was rotated into the least significant bit (bit 0).|$|E

50|$|The early {{microprocessors}} Intel 4004 and Intel 8008 had {{specific instructions}} to set {{as well as}} reset the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> explicitly. However, the later Intel 8080 (and Z80) did not include an explicit reset carry opcode as this could be done equally fast via one of the bitwise AND, OR or XOR instructions (which do not use the <b>carry</b> <b>flag).</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{not very}} precise, the {{overflow}} flag {{could be considered}} a two's complement form of a <b>carry</b> <b>flag,</b> but the typical usage is quite different.|$|E
50|$|The <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> is {{affected}} by the result of most arithmetic (and typically several bit wise) instructions and is also used as an input to many of them. Several of these instructions have two forms which either read or ignore the carry. In assembly languages these instructions are represented by mnemonics such as ADD/SUB, ADC/SBC (ADD/SUB including carry), SHL/SHR (bit shifts), ROL/ROR (bit rotates), RCR/RCL (rotate through carry), and so on. The use of the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> in this manner enables multi-word add, subtract, shift, and rotate operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{processor}} {{will have}} set the adjust flag if a borrow occurred in the least significant nibble, and the <b>carry</b> <b>flag</b> if a borrow occurred in the most significant nibble.|$|E
