5|$|At first, Prester John was {{imagined}} {{to reside}} in India; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle's subcontinental travels as documented in works like the Acts of Thomas probably provided the first seeds of the legend.

5|$|Choughs {{breed in}} mountains, from Morocco and Spain eastwards through {{southern}} Europe and the Alps, across <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> the Himalayas to western China. The Alpine chough {{is also found}} in Corsica and Crete, and the red-billed chough has populations in Ireland, the UK, the Isle of Man, and two areas of the Ethiopian Highlands. Both species are non-migratory residents throughout their range, only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countries.|$|E

5|$|The Alpine Chough breeds in {{mountains}} from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and the Alps across <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> the Himalayas {{to western}} China. There are also populations in Morocco, Corsica and Crete.

5|$|The Alpine chough , or yellow-billed chough, (Pyrrhocorax graculus) is {{a bird in}} {{the crow}} family, {{one of only two}} species in the genus Pyrrhocorax. Its two {{subspecies}} breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} widely {{recognised}} subspecies of the Egyptian vulture, {{although there is}} considerable gradation due to movement and intermixing of the populations. The nominate subspecies, N. p. percnopterus, has the largest range, occurring in southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, <b>Central</b> <b>Asia,</b> <b>and</b> the north-west of India. Populations breeding in the temperate zone migrate south during winter. It has a dark grey bill.|$|E
5|$|Two of the {{subspecies}} {{listed above}} (Falco peregrinus pelegrinoides and F. p. babylonicus) are often instead treated {{together as a}} distinct species, Falco pelegrinoides (the Barbary falcon), although they were included within F. peregrinus in the 1994 Handbook of the Birds of the World.

5|$|A rising China {{has been}} {{increasingly}} interested in <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> the Eurasian Economic Union. Analysts see the union {{as a potential}} way China could facilitate its investments in the region. Historically, China held close economic ties with many countries throughout Eurasia. Under the Han Dynasty, its trade routes extended to the Roman Empire. The Economy of the Han Dynasty and other subsequent dynasties exchanged numerous goods with countries throughout Europe and Asia. Both China and the union have stated they would benefit from recreating trade routes modelled on the historic Silk Road.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in the age}} of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD), {{the ancient}} Romans, {{including}} authors such as Pliny the Elder, mentioned contacts with the Seres, who they identified as the producers of silk from distant East Asia and could have been the Chinese or even any number of middlemen of various ethnic backgrounds along the Silk Road of <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> Northwest China. The Eastern-Han era Chinese general Ban Chao, Protector General of the Western Regions, explored <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> in 97 AD dispatched his envoys Gan Ying to Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). Gan was dissuaded by Parthian authorities to venture further than the Persian Gulf, although he wrote a detailed report about the Roman Empire, its cities, postal network, and consular system of government, and presented this to the Han court. Subsequently, there were a series of Roman embassies in China lasting from the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, as recorded in Chinese sources. In 166 AD the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD), claiming they represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Andun 安敦) (r. 161–180 AD). Historian Rafe de Crespigny speculates that they were Roman merchants instead of official diplomats.|$|E
5|$|China's {{rail system}} had long {{linked to the}} Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990 China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its {{uninterrupted}} rail link between {{the port city of}} Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E

He had three legions at his {{disposal}} (III Gallica and VI Ferrata from Syria and IV Scythica), to which were added {{a large number of}} auxiliaries and allied contingents from Eastern client kings like Aristobulus of Lesser Armenia and Polemon II of Pontus. The situation was furthermore favorable to the Romans: Vologases faced a serious revolt by the Hyrcanians in the region of the Caspian Sea as well as incursions of Dahae and Sacae nomads from <b>Central</b> <b>Asia,</b> <b>and</b> was unable to support his brother.|$|E

The following year Cho went to Moscow and tried to enroll at the Moscow Literature University, only to find himself arrested on the spot for breaking the law confining Koreans to Central Asia. He then {{returned to}} the Institute in Kzyl-Orda and worked there until 1941. In the late 1930s, Cho married Kim Hae-sŏn. The two had a son, Yurii Cho, born in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Horses occur {{naturally}} on the steppes of <b>Central</b> <b>Asia,</b> <b>and</b> their domestication, around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region, {{was originally}} {{as a source}} of meat; use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild ass was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the Bactrian camel in Mongolia and the Arabian camel becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.|$|E
