40|$|According to {{the space}} charge concept, oxygen {{vacancies}} are depleted in the grain boundary space <b>charge</b> <b>layers</b> of acceptor-doped ZrO 2; whereas electrons are expected to accumulate in the space <b>charge</b> <b>layers</b> if present, leading to {{significant changes in the}} grain boundary electrical properties.

50|$|The first {{theory that}} {{predicted}} the correct direction of rectification of the metal-semiconductor junction {{was given by}} Nevill Mott in 1939. He found the solution for both the diffusion and drift currents of the majority carriers through the semiconductor surface space <b>charge</b> <b>layer</b> which has been known since about 1948 as the Mott barrier. Walter H. Schottky and Spenke extended Mott's theory by including a donor ion whose density is spatially constant through the semiconductor surface layer. This changed the constant electric field assumed by Mott to a linearly decaying electric field. This semiconductor space-charge layer under the metal {{is known as the}} Schottky barrier. A similar theory was also proposed by Davydov in 1939. Although it gives the correct direction of rectification, it has also been proven that the Mott theory and its Schottky-Davydov extension gives the wrong current limiting mechanism and wrong current-voltage formulae in silicon metal/semiconductor diode rectifiers. The correct theory was developed by Hans Bethe and reported by him in a M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory Report dated November 23, 1942. In Bethe's theory, the current is limited by thermionic emission of electrons over the metal-semiconductor potential barrier. Thus, the appropriate name for the metal-semiconductor diode should be the Bethe diode, instead of the Schottky diode, since the Schottky theory does not predict the modern metal-semiconductor diode characteristics correctly.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{studies on}} the nanoscale transport dynamics of carriers in strained AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells: an electron-hole bilayer charge system with large difference in transport properties between the two <b>charge</b> <b>layers.</b> From electronic band diagram analysis, the presence of spatially separated two-dimensional electron and hole <b>charge</b> <b>layers</b> is predicted at opposite interfaces. Since these <b>charge</b> <b>layers</b> exhibit distinct spectral signatures at terahertz frequencies, a combination of terahertz and far-infrared spectroscopy enables us to extract (a) individual contributions to the total conductivity, as well as (b) effective scattering rates for charge-carriers in each layer. Furthermore, by comparing direct-current and terahertz extracted conductivity levels, {{we are able to}} determine the extent to which structural defects affect charge transport. Our results evidence that (i) a non-unity Hall-factor and (ii) the considerable contribution of holes to the overall conductivity, lead to a lower apparent mobility in Hall-effect measurements. Overall, our work demonstrates that terahertz spectroscopy is a suitable technique for the study of bilayer charge systems with large differences in transport properties between layers, such as quantum wells in III-Nitride semiconductors.
