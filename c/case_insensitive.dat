40|$|In Sanderson and Scherbov (2005) we {{introduced}} a new forward- definition of age called "prospective age" and argued that its use, along with the traditional backward-looking concept of age, provides a more informative basis upon which to discuss population aging.

Everyone with the same prospective age has the same expected remaining years of life. In this paper, we first explore the concept of prospective age in detail and show, using an analytic formulation, historical data, and forecasts, that prospective age is, in most <b>cases,</b> <b>insensitive</b> to whether it is measured using period or cohort life tables.

40|$|The Regret {{theory of}} Loomes and Sugden (1982) predicts choice {{anomalies}} implied by other alternatives to expected utility (e. g., {{violations of the}} independence axiom). It also makes unique and controversial predictions regarding the rational violation of stochastic dominance and invariance. All these predictions depend critically on assumptions regarding the statistical independence or dependence of the available alternatives. None of the predictions depend on the framing or representation of the alternatives. Leland (1994) shows that a model of choice based on similarity judgments predicts choices implied by Regret theory. In contrast to Regret theory, however, these predictions depend critically {{on the way the}} choices are framed and not on the dependence or independence of the alternatives. This paper presents experimental results indicating that the frequencies with which violations of independence, dominance, and invariance occur are, in most <b>cases,</b> <b>insensitive</b> to the statistical dependence or independence of the alternatives but sensitive to the way the choices are presented.

40|$|NMR is an {{insensitive}} spectroscopy, {{which often}} requires numerous accumulations, especially for 2 D high-resolution methods (MQMAS and STMAS) for quadrupolar nuclei in solids. This {{may be a}} very important limitation for the <b>case</b> of <b>insensitive</b> nuclei, where a 1 D spectrum with better resolution than the central-transition is then highly desirable. This problem has been addressed for the case of spin- 5 / 2 nuclei by the Double-Quantum Filtered Satellite Transition Spectroscopy: DQF-SATRAS-ST 1. We extend this concept to the spin- 9 / 2 nuclei with the SATRAS-ST 2 method. This method allows the observation of 1 D spectra with a much better resolution than that observed in the isotropic projection of 2 D MQ/ST 1 -MAS spectra. This enhanced resolution results from the much smaller homogeneous broadening that occurs on the SATRAS-ST 2 method as compared to MQ/ST 1 -MAS spectra.

40|$|Gauge {{invariant}} quintessence perturbations in the quintessence {{and cold}} dark matter (QCDM) model are investigated. For three cases of constant equation-of-state (EOS) parameter, linear scalar field potential, and supergravity scalar field potential, their perturbation evolutions have a similar dependence on EOS parameter and scale, but they have different sensitivity to the initial conditions due to the different shapes of the quintessence potential. They have a minor effect on primary CMB anisotropies, but change the secondary CMB effect in different ways. The first <b>case</b> is <b>insensitive</b> to initial quintessence perturbations and only modifies the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect within a factor of 2. The other two cases are sensitive to initial conditions at large scales and could affect the secondary CMB anisotropies drastically depending on how smooth the initial perturbations are.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between measured tropospheric ozone (O 3) and carbon monoxide (CO) {{has been used}} extensively in tropospheric chemistry studies to explore the photochemical characteristics of different regions and to evaluate the ability of models to capture these characteristics. Here, we present the first study that uses multi-year, global, vertically resolved, simultaneous and collocated O 3 and CO satellite (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer) measurements, to determine this correlation in the middle/lower free troposphere for two different seasons, and to evaluate two chemistry-climate models. We find results that are fairly robust across different years, altitudes and timescales considered, which indicates that the correlation maps presented here {{could be used as}} benchmarks in future studies. The highest positive correlations (around 0. 8) are found in the Northern Pacific during summer, which is a common feature in the observations and the G-PUCCINI model. We make quantitative comparisons between the models using a single-figure metric (C), which we define as the correlation coefficient between the modeled and the observed O 3 -CO correlations for different regions of the globe. On a global scale, the G-PUCCINI model shows a good performance in the summer (C = 0. 71) and a satisfactory performance in the winter (C = 0. 52). It captures midlatitude features very well, especially in the summer, whereas the performance in regions like South America or Central Africa is weaker. The UKCA model (C = 0. 46 / 0. 15 for July–August/December–January on a global scale) performs better in certain regions, such as the tropics in winter, and it captures some of the broad characteristics of summer extratropical correlations, but it systematically underestimates the O 3 -CO correlations over much of the globe. It is noteworthy that the correlations look very different in the two models, even though the ozone distributions are similar. This demonstrates that this technique provides a powerful global constraint for understanding modeled tropospheric chemical processes. We investigated the sources of the correlations by performing a series of sensitivity experiments. In these, the sign of the correlation is, in most <b>cases,</b> <b>insensitive</b> to removing different individual emissions, but its magnitude changes downwind of emission regions when applying such perturbations. Interestingly, we find that the O 3 -CO correlation does not solely reflect the strength of O 3 photochemical production, as often assumed by earlier studies, but is more complicated and reflects a mixture of different processes such as transport...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the effect of the direction of the incident light on the quantum efficiency of homogeneous HgCdTe photodiodes suitable for sensing infrared radiation in the 8 - 12 microns atmospheric window is presented. The probability of an excess minority carrier to reach the junction is derived as a function of its distance {{from the edge of the}} depletion region. Accordingly, the quantum efficiency of photodiodes is presented for two geometries. In the first, the light is introduced directly to the area in which it is absorbed (opaque region), while in the second, the light passes through a transparent region before it reaches the opaque region. Finally, the performance of the two types of diodes is analyzed with the objective of finding the optimal width of the absorption area. The quantum efficiency depends strongly on the way in which the light is introduced. The structure in which the radiation is absorbed following its crossing the transparent region is associated with both higher quantum efficiency and homogeneity. In addition, for absorption region widths higher than a certain minimum, the quantum efficiency in this <b>case</b> is <b>insensitive</b> to the width of the absorption region...|$|R

40|$|The data {{reported}} are fully {{consistent with the}} well-known observation that exogenous cytochrome c (cyto-c) molecules do not permeate through the outer membrane of mitochondria (MOM) incubated in isotonic medium (250 mM sucrose). Cyto-c is unable to accept electrons from the sulWte/cyto-c oxido-reductase (Sox) present in the intermembrane space, unless mitochondria are solubilized. Mitochondria incubated in a very high hypotonic medium (25 mM sucrose), in contrast to any expectation, continue to be not permeable to added cyto-c even if Sox and adenylate kinase are released into the medium. The succinate/exogenous cyto-c reductase activity, very low in isotonic medium, is greatly increased decreasing the osmolarity of the medium but in both <b>cases</b> remains <b>insensitive</b> to proteolysis by added trypsin.

40|$|Mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter is {{the primary}} influx pathway for Ca 2 + into respiring mitochondria, and hence {{plays a key role}} in {{mitochondrial}} Ca 2 + homeostasis. Though the mechanism of extra-matrix Ca 2 + dependency of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake has been well characterized both experimentally and mathematically, the mechanism of membrane potential (DY) dependency of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake has not been completely characterized. In this paper, we perform a quantitative reevaluation of a previous biophysical model of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter that characterized the possible mechanism of DY dependency of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake. Based on a model simulation analysis, we show that model predictions with a variant assumption (Case 2 : external and internal Ca 2 + binding constants for the uniporter are distinct), that provides the best possible description of the DY dependency, are highly sensitive to variation in matrix [Ca 2 +], indicating limitations in the variant assumption (Case 2) in providing physiologically plausible description of the observed DY dependency. This sensitivity is attributed to negative estimate of a biophysical parameter that characterizes binding of internal Ca 2 + to the uniporter. Reparameterization of the model with additional nonnengativity constraints on the biophysical parameters showed that the two variant assumptions (Case 1 and Case 2) are indistinguishable, indicating that the external and internal Ca 2 + binding constants for the uniporter may be equal (Case 1).

40|$|We {{critically}} {{examine the}} gauge, and field-parametrization dependence of renormalization group flows {{in the vicinity}} of non-Gaußian fixed points in quantum gravity. While physical observables are independent of such calculational specifications, the construction of quantum gravity field theories typically relies on off-shell quantities such as β functions and generating functionals and thus face potential stability issues with regard to such generalized parametrizations. We analyze a two-parameter class of covariant gauge conditions, the role of momentum-dependent field rescalings and a class of field parametrizations. Using the product of Newton and cosmological constant as an indicator, the principle of minimum sensitivity identifies stationary points in this parametrization space which show a remarkable insensitivity to the parametrization. In the most <b>insensitive</b> <b>cases,</b> the quantized gravity system exhibits a non-Gaußian UV stable fixed point, lending further support to asymptotically free quantum gravity. One of the stationary points facilitates an analytical determination of the quantum gravity phase diagram and features ultraviolet and infrared complete RG trajectories with a classical regime.
