[...] The driver {{under the law}} is defined as [...] "any person who uses a vehicle {{in connection with a}} transportation network company’s online-enabled application or platform to connect with passengers." [...] The stated minimum insurance requirement ranges from US$50,000 to $100,000 for death and injuries per individual or incident, and stipulates US$30,000 for property damage.

The weather was so fine, the season of the year so nearly the same, and most of the other circumstances so very much like those under which we had made the enchanting passage along the head of the Leman four years before, that we yielded to the desire to renew the pleasures of such a transit, and turned our faces towards Vévey.|$|E

We stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to take in-fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast of Coromandel. We were, indeed, informed that a French man-of-war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone for the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France, I had some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way, and we heard no more of them.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought this}} was but a {{reasonable}} request on their part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I considered that to carry this whole company to the East Indies would not only be an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I thought it no breach of <b>charter-party,</b> but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were to blame; for the laws of God and nature would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of people in such a distressed condition; {{and the nature of}} the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance. So I consented that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit: and if not, I would carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies.|$|E

60|$|We left Frankfort at eleven, declining the {{services}} of a celebrated voiturier, called le petit Savoyard, whom François introduced, with a warm recommendation of fidelity and zeal. These men are extensively known, and carry their soubriquets, as ships do their names. The little Savoyard had just discharged a cargo of miladies, bound to England, after having had them on his <b>charter-party</b> eighteen months, and was now on the look-out for a return freight. As his whole equipments were four horses, the harness, and a long whip, he was very desirous of the honour of dragging my carriage a hundred leagues or so, towards any part of the earth whither it might suit my pleasure to proceed. But it is to be presumed that miladies were of full weight, for even François, who comes of a family of voituriers, and has a fellow-feeling for the craft, is obliged to admit that the cattle of le petit appear to have been overworked. This negotiation occupied an hour, and it ended by sending the passport to the post.|$|E
60|$|I {{therefore}} {{told the}} French captain {{that we had}} taken them up in their distress, it was true; {{but that it was}} our duty to do so, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity; that we had done nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us if we had been in their case and they in ours; but that we took them up to serve them, not to plunder them; {{and that it would be}} a most barbarous thing, to take that little from them which they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore and leave them; that this would be first to save them from death and then kill them ourselves; save them from drowning and then abandon them to starving; and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from them: as to setting them on shore, I told them indeed that was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the East Indies; and though we were driven out of our course to the westward a very great way, which perhaps was directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on this particular account; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under <b>charter-party</b> to pursue his voyage by the way of Brasil; and all I knew he could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships homeward-bound from the West Indies, and get them passage, if possible, to England or France.|$|E
6000|$|I promised {{faithfully}} to {{stay for}} two trips at least, {{and it was in}} those circumstances that what was to be my last connection with a ship began. And after all there was not even one single trip. It may be that it was simply the fulfilment of a fate, of that written word on my forehead which apparently forbade me, through all my sea wanderings, ever to achieve the crossing of the Western Ocean--using the words in that special sense in which sailors speak of Western Ocean trade, of Western Ocean packets, of Western Ocean hard cases. The new life attended closely upon the old and the nine chapters of [...] "Almayer's Folly" [...] went with me to the Victoria Dock, whence in a few days we started for Rouen. I won't go so far as saying that the engaging of a man fated never to cross the Western Ocean was the absolute cause of the Franco-Canadian Transport Company's failure to achieve even a single passage. It might have been that of course; but the obvious, gross obstacle was clearly the want of money. Four hundred and sixty bunks for emigrants were put together in the 'tween decks by industrious carpenters while we lay in the Victoria Dock, but never an emigrant turned up in Rouen--of which, being a humane person, I confess I was glad. Some gentlemen from Paris--I think there were three of them, and one was said to be the Chairman--turned up indeed and went from end to end of the ship, knocking their silk hats cruelly against the deck-beams. I attended them personally, and I can vouch for it that the interest they took in things was intelligent enough, though, obviously, they had never seen anything of the sort before. Their faces as they went ashore wore a cheerfully inconclusive expression. Notwithstanding that this inspecting ceremony {{was supposed to be a}} preliminary to immediate sailing, it was then, as they filed down our gangway, that I received the inward monition that no sailing within the meaning of our <b>charter-party</b> would ever take place.|$|E
50|$|In {{commercial}} ship chartering, demurrage is an ancillary {{cost that}} represents liquidated damages for delays. It {{occurs when the}} vessel is prevented from loading or discharging cargo within the stipulated laytime (see Affreightment: under <b>Charter-parties).</b> In the oil industry, {{it refers to the}} excess time taken to discharge or load What the case may be in excess of the allowed laytime. Laytime is the term used to quantify the time allowed within which an operation is allowed to be made. Demurrage is laytime consumed less laytime allocated (if any). The master of the ship must give a Notice of Readiness (NOR) to the charterer when the ship has arrived at the port of loading or discharge. The NOR informs the charterer that the ship is ready to load or discharge. The date and time of the NOR determines when laytime is to commence.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the years}} she {{researched}} in some 40 archives - parish, municipal, notarial, judicial, etc. - {{in places such as}} Tolosa, Bilbao, Burgos, Valladolid, Madrid, Seville and Lisbon. Little by little she discovered thousands of manuscripts from the 16th and 17th centuries, mostly in old Spanish, relating to the Basque fisheries in Terra Nova: including insurance policies, lawsuits, wills, <b>charter-parties,</b> crew agreements and lists of provisions and equipment. She also gradually found thousands of manuscripts to do with the other sectors of the Basque maritime economy such as shipbuilding, trade and fishing in Europe. This detailed documentation allowed her to establish that the Basques had carried out, in different specific areas of Atlantic Canada, a prosperous cod fishery as well as a major whale fishery on an industrial scale during the 1500s. Furthering her analysis of these documents, she was able to reconstruct most aspects of those Basque fisheries particularly in the 16th century: their scale and evolution, the organization and financing of the expeditions, types of ships, composition of crews, routes and destinations, fishing and whaling seasons, shipwrecks, the sailors' life, work and death, their food and clothing, contact with Amerindians, markets, etc.|$|R
60|$|I ask pardon of {{the learned}} {{gentlemen of the}} long robe if I do them any wrong in this chapter, having no design to affront them when I say that in matters of debate among {{merchant}}s, {{when they come to}} be argued by lawyers at the bar, they are strangely handled. I myself have heard very famous lawyers make sorry work of a cause between the merchant and his factor; and when they come to argue about exchanges, discounts, protests, demurrages, <b>charter-parties,</b> freights, port-charges, assurances, barratries, bottomries, accounts current, accounts in commission, and accounts in company, and the like, the solicitor {{has not been able to}} draw a brief, nor the counsel to understand it. Never was young parson more put to it to make out his text when he is got into the pulpit without his notes than I have seen a counsel at the bar when he would make out a cause between two merchants. And I remember a pretty history of a particular case, by way of instance, when two merchants, contending about a long factorage account, that had all the niceties of merchandising in it, and labouring on both sides to instruct their counsel, and to put them in when they were out, at last they found them make such ridiculous stuff of it that they both threw up the cause and agreed to a reference, which reference in one week, without any charge, ended all the dispute, which they had spent a great deal of money in before to no purpose.|$|R
60|$|We reached Bordeaux {{without any}} further accident, or delay. I {{discharged}} {{in the usual}} way, and began to look about me, for another freight. It had been my intention to return to New York, {{and to keep the}} festivities of attaining my majority, at Clawbonny; but, I confess the discourse of these eternal gossips, the Brighams, had greatly lessened the desire to see home again, so soon. A freight for New York was offered me, but I postponed an answer, until it was given to another ship. At length an offer was made me to go to Cronstadt, in Russia, with a cargo of wines and brandies, and I accepted it. The great and better informed merchants, as it would seem, distrusted the continuance of the hollow peace that then existed, and a company of them thought it might be well to transfer their liquors to the capital of the czar, in readiness for contingencies. An American ship was preferred, on account of her greater speed, as well as on account of her probable neutral character, in the event of troubles occurring at any unlooked-for moment. The Dawn took in her wines and brandies accordingly, and sailed for the Baltic about the last of August. She had a long, but a safe passage, delivering the freight according to the <b>charter-party,</b> in good condition. While at Cronstadt, the American consul, and the consignees of an American ship that had lost her master and chief-mate by the smallpox, applied to me to let Marble carry the vessel home. I pressed the offer on my old friend, but he obstinately refused {{to have anything to do}} with the vessel. I then recommended Talcott, and after some negotiation, the latter took charge of the Hyperion. I was sorry to part with my mate, to whom I had become strongly attached; but the preferment was so clearly to his advantage, that I could take no other course. The vessel being ready, she sailed the day after Talcott joined her; and, sorry am I to be compelled to add, that she was never heard of, after clearing the Cattegat. The equinox of that season was tremendously severe, and it caused the loss of many vessels; that of the Hyperion doubtless among the rest.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the price of transport we heavily relied on one kind of source which is found in massive numbers in the Amsterdam notarial archives: chartering contracts. A chartering contract is an agreement between a shipping company and one or more freighters or charterers who charter the ship for a particular voyage or, less often, for a specified period like a month. The freighter chartered the whole {{or part of the}} ship to carry a cargo from port A to port B at a certain price. The contracts conta{{in the name of the}} shipmaster who was acting in the name of the shipping company, his residence, the name of the charterer (s), the name of the ship, the freight charge and often but not always the tonnage of the ship and the kind of cargo and its quantity or weight. The chartering contracts are also called <b>charter-parties</b> or freight contracts. In Amsterdam lots of chartering contracts were notarized, which means that a signed copy was entered in notarial registers. An unknown number of them were not (Van Tielhof 2002 : 199; Knoppers 1976 : 17 - 18; Van Royen 1996 : 108). It is important to stress that these prices were the prices actually agreed upon for a specified transport service. The market for freights in Amsterdam must have expanded considerably in the course of the 16 th century, along with the expansion of overseas trade and shipping. In the 15 th century chartering contracts were probably still concluded on the first of the two big fairs, where foreign merchants appeared to look for possibilities to ship their goods (Posthumus 1953 : 130). At the end of the 16 th century chartering contracts were signed all year round. Jan Franssen Bruyningh started to work as a notary public in Amsterdam in October 1593, and had a large clientele of merchants and ship-owners from the start. Every year, about hundred freight contracts referring to voyages to the Baltic are documented in his protocols. Bruyningh also witnessed huge numbers of charter parties referring to other trade routes, such as Spain and Portugal for which about 50 contracts remain in his protocols each year. 1 It is highly probable that Bruyningh did not build his practice up from nothing but that he continued the flourishing practice of a predecessor. This can very well have bee...|$|R
50|$|In other cases, if {{the vessel}} is {{detained}} beyond the fixed number of demurrage days, the ship owner can recover damages for detention. Sometimes the <b>charter-party</b> defines no fixed time for loading or discharging. In such cases the <b>charter-party</b> is obligated to load or discharge {{as quickly as}} possible. If loading or discharging is not done in a reasonable time, the shipowner can claim damages for detention.|$|E
50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay days, for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the <b>charter-party,</b> or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the <b>charter-party,</b> the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the <b>charter-party</b> ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The <b>charter-party</b> is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the <b>charter-party,</b> the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|E
50|$|Demurrage is a {{fixed sum}} per day or per hour that the {{charterer}} agrees {{to pay for}} any time that the vessel is detained for loading or discharging over the time contractually allowed—usually described as lay days. Sometimes {{the number of days}} the vessel may be kept on demurrage at the agreed rate is fixed by the <b>charter-party.</b> If no demurrage is provided for by the <b>charter-party,</b> and the vessel is not loading or discharging beyond the lay days, the shipowner can claim damages for the loss suffered by the detention of the ship.|$|E
50|$|This {{means that}} the holder of a bill of lading signed by the master without {{knowledge}} {{of the terms of}} the time <b>charter-party</b> may hold the owner responsible for the contract the master signed as an employee of the shipowner—though, in fact, in signing the bill of lading the master acted as an agent for and at the direction of the time charterer. In the language of the ordinary time <b>charter-party</b> the ship is let to the charterers—but there is no true demise, because the vessel remains in the possession of the shipowner.|$|E
50|$|A ship may be let, like a house, to {{a person}} who takes {{possession}} and control of it for a specified term. The person who hires a ship in this way occupies during the specified time the position of ship-owner. The contract under which a ship is so let may be called a charter-party—but it is not, properly speaking, a contract of affreightment, and is mentioned here only to clarify the distinction between a <b>charter-party</b> of this kind, which is sometimes called a demise of the ship, and a <b>charter-party</b> that is a contract of affreightment.|$|E
50|$|An {{ice clause}} is {{inserted}} in {{a bill of}} lading or a <b>charter-party</b> when a vessel is bound for a port or ports which may be closed to shipping by ice when the vessel arrives or after the vessel's arrival.|$|E
50|$|Where {{possession}} of a ship given to a hirer, who appoints his own master and crew, different considerations apply. However, though the contract by which the ship is let may be called a <b>charter-party,</b> it is not truly a contract of affreightment.|$|E
