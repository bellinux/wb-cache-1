40|$|In March 2012, the Society of Light and Lighting (SLL) {{published}} {{a new edition}} of the Code for Lighting. This revision includes a number of changes, which are discussed in detail. Among these changes are a recommendation for mean <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance</b> within enclosed spaces and increased room surface reflectances. A method has been proposed by others to perform in-field measurement of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance</b> without a dedicated meter. Research in a small test space is undertaken to validate this proposed methodology and comment on its accuracy and practicality. Using the same test space, room surface reflectances are altered to demonstrate {{their impact on the}} visual environment. The proposed method for recording <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance</b> is found to be accurate, but tedious and time-consuming to implement. Room surface reflectances were increased and the effect on illuminance on surfaces, luminance, horizontal illuminance, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance</b> and modelling index was significant for the test room used...|$|E
40|$|Summary The IES Code {{relies on}} the {{specification}} of horizontal illuminance {{for the majority of}} lighting installations. From the earliest days it was realized that the illuminance on other surfaces was also impartant. The paper considers the suggestion that for overhead lighting installations a vector/cylindrical illuminance ratio might be more informative than the vector/scalar illuminance ratio already used. Values of vector/scalar illuminance ratio and vector/cylindrical illuminance ratio are calculated for situations in which a figure is viewed under two quite different light distributions and for two reflectance combinations. The vector/ <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance</b> ratio is shown to be marginally better than the vector/ scalar illuminance ratio for controlling the modelling properties of an installation. It is argued that, in addition, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance</b> is a more useful quantity than scalar illuminance. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzed}} {{the accuracy of}} simplified glare analysis methods compared to the Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) through a parametric study. It consisted of glare calculations in a sample office room, with varying façade layout and orientation. Calculations were performed with Radiance, obtaining the simplified and full glare indices for each case. The different options were compared for discrete daylight conditions {{as well as for}} complete annual simulations. As a final output of the research, a new metric is proposed based on the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance.</b> This has the advantage of retaining the vertical component of illuminance, while being view independent...|$|E
40|$|Light {{modelling}} is a {{small but}} {{important part of the}} lighting quality concept. It determines not only the capability of the eye to detect any objects in a space but also its ability to discriminate contours, shapes and details, the most important visual characteristics of any object. These are essential and significant indicators that allow a person to analyse and ascertain another person’s state of health, the freshness of food, the mood of the interlocutor and many other key characteristics of visual environments. Thus, light modelling is an essential aspect important in various architectural spaces, from museums to hospitals to offices. To date, few studies have been dedicated to light modelling. Some basic knowledge has been achieved from studies on pedestrian visibility and road lighting. However, few investigations have been performed in day-lit interiors. Thus, the light modelling topic remains underestimated and insufficiently studied. To address this gap, the present research aims to develop the concept of light modelling of real 3 D objects in day-lit environments. The author will propose the metrics of contour, shape and details distinctness of the examined units as the most critical aspects of light modelling. Based on the idea that light and colour are mentally inseparable in the human perception of visual environments, it is of great importance to create experimental conditions that provide both of these principal concepts (light and colour). The high dynamic range (HDR) imaging technique will be used as part of the experimental research methodology, giving reliable, analysable, numerical data obtained from luminance maps. Three experiments and their outcomes form the basis of this dissertation. Work on this dissertation began with general research questions regarding studies of chromatic interiors using HDR images, examining the possible effect of achromatic and chromatic colours and colour combinations on the perception of room illumination (Experiment 1). The focus then turned {{to the development of the}} appropriate luminance-based metrics of real 3 D achromatic and chromatic objects placed in a room illuminated by daylight (Experiment 2). These metrics were then verified in a real room study and repeated through computer simulation (Experiment 3). The results obtained from these experiments indicate that majority of the proposed luminance-based metrics correlate very well with subjective assessments that deem contour, shape and details to be distinguishable in different degrees. The metrics also indicate considerable variations among 3 D objects with different luminance and chromatic contrasts. These luminance-based metrics outperformed currently used modelling index and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>illuminance</b> metrics. Furthermore, these luminance-based metrics can be used both in real architectural spaces and computer simulations. Considering these advantages, the author of this dissertation proposes that luminance-based metrics should be recommended for practical use to ensure light modelling; specifically, to better guarantee the distinctness of objects’ contours, shapes and details. The metrics have some limitations dictated by existing experimental conditions and therefore require further testing if they are to be made universally applicable. These will be further discussed in the present dissertation, as will some proposals for possible future research...|$|E
