50|$|An {{important}} {{genetic component}} {{of this process}} is Sox9, a HMG box transcription factor, which marks progenitor cells for chondrogenic differentiation. Inactivation of the Sox9 gene will result in the loss of all Cartilage, and thus <b>Chondroblast,</b> formation. This factor is also expressed alongside Sox5 and Sox6.|$|E
50|$|Runx2 {{is another}} {{important}} genetic component of <b>Chondroblast</b> formation. It {{has been found that}} expressing this gene will result in the suppression of the differentiation of chondroblasts. Expression of this gene will also prompt already formed cartilage to undergo endochondral ossification which will prompt the cartilage to form bone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chondroblasts</b> {{appear to}} migrate to {{cartilage}} whenever chondrocytes are destroyed via mechanical force. Remaining chondrocytes divide {{in order to}} form more <b>chondroblasts.</b> HMGB-1, a growth factor which promotes chondrocyte division while receptors for advanced glycation products (RAGE) mediated chemotaxis to clean up cell debris resulting from the damage. <b>Chondroblasts</b> then secrete cartilage matrix around themselves in order to reform the lost cartilage tissue.|$|R
50|$|Within {{adults and}} {{developing}} adults, most <b>chondroblasts</b> {{are located in}} the perichondrium. This is a thin layer of connective tissue which protects cartilage and is where <b>chondroblasts</b> help to expand cartilage size whenever prompted to by hormones such as GH, TH, and glycosaminoglycans. They are located on the perichondrium because the perichondrium, located on the outside of developing bone, is not as heavily ensheathed in cartilage extracellular matrix as the interior and because here where capillaries are located. The type of growth maintained by <b>chondroblasts</b> is called appositional bone growth and increases the girth of the affected tissue. It {{is important to note that}} perichondrium, and thus <b>chondroblasts,</b> are not found on the articular cartilage surfaces of joints.|$|R
40|$|Phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) has a prompt, differential, and {{partially}} reversible effect on cultured chick <b>Chondroblasts.</b> Within 36 hr PMA transforms sessile, polygonal, epithelioid <b>Chondroblasts</b> into motile, multilayered, fibroblastic cells. In PMA chick <b>Chondroblasts</b> rap idly cease to synthesize {{two of their}} terminal luxury molecules, the type IV sulfated proteoglycan that charac terizes the extracell matrix and a glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 180, 000.

50|$|Chondrocytes (from Greek χόνδρος, chondros = {{cartilage}} + κύτος, kytos = cell) are {{the only}} cells found in healthy cartilage. They produce and maintain the cartilaginous matrix, which consists mainly of collagen and proteoglycans. Although the word <b>chondroblast</b> is commonly used to describe an immature chondrocyte, the term is imprecise, since the progenitor of chondrocytes (which are mesenchymal stem cells) can differentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts.|$|E
50|$|Chondroblastomas can {{sometimes}} form, which are benign tumors that form at {{the sites of}} endochondral ossification due to over stimulation of the chondroblasts. When they form, they are usually found on the upper or lower tibia {{as well as the}} upper humerus where <b>chondroblast</b> activity is most apparent. Rarely, they {{can be found on the}} feet, hands, flat bones, or spine. 30-50% of these sarcomas have an accompanying osteoblastoma which is similarly benign.|$|E
50|$|Mesenchymal (mesoderm origin) {{stem cells}} (MSC) are un{{differentiate}}d, meaning they can differentiate into {{a variety of}} generative cells commonly known as osteochondrogenic (or osteogenic, chondrogenic, osteoprogenitor, etc.) cells. When referring to bone, or in this case cartilage, the originally undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells lose their pluripotency, proliferate and crowd together in a dense aggregate of chondrogenic cells (cartilage) at the location of chondrification. These chondrogenic cells differentiate into so-called chondroblasts, which then synthesize the cartilage extra cellular matrix (ECM), consisting of a ground substance (proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans for low osmotic potential) and fibers. The <b>chondroblast</b> is now a mature chondrocyte that is usually inactive but can still secrete and degrade the matrix, depending on conditions.|$|E

50|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix secreted by <b>chondroblasts</b> {{is composed of}} fibers, collagen, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, water, {{and a host of}} macromolecules. Within finished cartilage, collagen fibers compose 10-20% of the volume, water 65-80%, and the proteoglycan-hyaluronic acid aggregates the remaining portion. Due to the proliferative nature of <b>Chondroblasts,</b> cells compose a larger portion of the composition than what is normally found within completed cartilage.|$|R
40|$|Several common {{congenital}} limb {{disorders are}} characterized by normal tissue differentiation but abnormal somatic growth. These include: idiopathic clubfoot, idiopathic leg length discrepancy, hemi-atrophy and hemi-hypertrophy. Both clinical and research {{studies have suggested that}} peripheral nerves may be important in regulating somatic growth of limb tissues. To investigate the hypothesis that peripheral nerves convey trophic substances to mesenchymal tissues that are involved in the regulation of growth, we developed an in vitro assay to assess the effect of fractions of peripheral nerve on myoblast and <b>chondroblast</b> growth and differentiation in a mammalian (rat) system. Whole rat sciatic nerve extract was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and by affinity chromatography. Concavalin A chromatography resolved whole nerve extract into a glycoprotein and a non-glycoprotein fraction. Serial ammonium sulfate precipitation yielded three pellet fractions designated as 35 %, 70 %, and 100 % pellets; corresponding to ammonium sulfate concentrations of 0 to 35 %, 35 to 70 %, and 70 to 100 % saturation, respectively. Dialyzed solutions of these pellets as well as the fractions from Concavalin A chromatography were assayed for biological activity in micromass cultures of rat limb bud mesenchyme, which allowed assessment of both myoblast and <b>chondroblast</b> stimulation. Stimulation of protein synthesis and myoblast proliferation (as measured by MF 20 staining) occurred with both 70 % and 100 % ammonium sulfate fractions. Stimulation of chondroblasts (as measured by the number of alcian blue staining nodules) occurred with the 35 % and 100 % fractions. The glycoprotein fraction from the affinity chromatography stimulated protein synthesis and myoblast proliferation and inhibited <b>chondroblast</b> development. Stimulation of chondroblasts was seen with the non-glycoprotein fraction. No effect on protein synthesis, myoblast proliferation or <b>chondroblast</b> proliferation was found in cultures treated with rat transferrin (transferrin has been reported to stimulate myoblasts in avian culture systems) ...|$|E

50|$|Retinoic acid, part of {{a family}} of {{molecules}} called retinoids, need to be repressed in order for <b>Chondroblasts</b> to form. A 2003 study using transgenic mice with a weak, constitutively active retinoic acid receptor found that retinoids maintain cells within condensations in a prechondrogenic, mesenchymal cell state which prevents cell differentiation. It has also been suggested that the inhibition of receptor mediated retinoid signaling induces Sox9 expression which is considered a “master switch” for the differentiation of <b>chondroblasts.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} immunohistochemically {{the fracture}} repair process in rat tibial bone using antibodies to PCNA, BMP 2, TGF-b 1,- 2,- 3, TGF-b R 1,- R 2, bFGF, bFGFR, PDGF, VEGF, and S- 100. The peak level of cell proliferation as revealed by PCNA labelling appeared first in primitive mesenchymal cells and inflammatory cells at the fracture edges and neighboring periosteum at 2 -days after fracture, {{followed by the}} peaks of periosteal primitive fibroblasts and <b>chondroblasts,</b> which appeared at fracture edges at 3 - and 4 -days after fracture, respectively. BMP 2 was weakly positive in primitive mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts and <b>chondroblasts.</b> At 3 -days post-fracture, periosteal osteoblasts produced osteoid tissue and callus with marrow spaces lined by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and all primitive mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts were positive for TGF-b 1,- 2,- 3, and TGF-b R 1,-R 2. They were also positive for vascular growth factors bFGF, FGFR and PDGF, but negative for VEGF, and the peak of PCNA labelling of vascular endothelial cells in the marrow space was delayed to 4 -days after fracture. <b>Chondroblasts</b> at fracture edges produced hypertrophic chondrocytes at 5 -days after fracture and they were positive for TGF-b 1,- 2,- 3, and TGF-b R 1,-R 2. Primitive <b>chondroblasts</b> were positive for vascular growth factors VEGF as well as bFGF, FGFR, and the peak of PCNA labelling of vascular endothelial cells in the cartilage was at 5 -days after fracture. Hypertrophic chondrocytes were also positive for these growth factors but negative for bFGF and bFGFR. S- 100 protein-induced calcification was only positive on <b>chondroblasts</b> and hypertrophic chondrocytes. At 7 -days after fracture, bone began to be formed from the cartilage at fracture edges, by a process similar to bone formation in the growth plate. Enchondral ossification established a bridge between both fracture edges and periosteal membranous ossification encompassed the fracture site like a sheath at 14 - day after fracture. Our study of fracture repair of bone indicates that this process is complex and occurs through various steps involving various growth factors...|$|R
5000|$|Days after fracture, {{the cells}} of the {{periosteum}} replicate and transform. The periosteal cells proximal (closest) to the fracture gap develop into <b>chondroblasts</b> which form hyaline cartilage. The periosteal cells [...] distal to (further from) the fracture gap develop into osteoblasts which form woven bone. The fibroblasts within the granulation tissue develop into <b>chondroblasts</b> which also form hyaline cartilage. These two new tissues grow in size until they unite with their counterparts {{from other parts of the}} fracture. These processes culminate in a new mass of heterogeneous tissue which is known as the fracture callus. Eventually, the fracture gap is bridged by the hyaline cartilage and woven bone, restoring some of its original strength.|$|R

40|$|The sulfated {{proteoglycans}} synthesized by definitive chondroblasts in cultured 10 -day chick vertebral or epiphyseal cartilages {{were characterized}} by their sedimentation profile in a sucrose gradient and their susceptibility to chondroitinase ABC (EC 4. 2. 2. 4; chondroitin ABC lyase). These sulfated proteoglycans were indistinguishable from those synthesized by definitive chondroblasts that emerge from older cultures of somites plus notochord or in older cultures of limb buds. The sulfated proteoglycans of these definitive chondroblasts are readily distinguished from those synthesized by their mother cells, the presumptive chondroblasts, or those synthesized by dedifferentiated or bromodeoxyuridine-suppressed chondroblasts. However, the sulfated proteoglycans synthesized by presumptive chondroblasts or by dedifferentiated or bromodeoxyuridine-suppressed chondroblasts cannot be dintinguished by these techniques from those synthesized by (i) blastodisc cells, (ii) fibroblasts, (iii) spinal cord cells, or (iv) skeletal, cardiac, or smooth muscle cells. Addition of glycosaminoglycans or collagen to the medium did not induce somite or limb presumptive chondroblasts to synthesize the chondroblast-unique sulfated proteoglycans.

30|$|While its {{etiopathogenesis}} is unknown, it {{is likely}} that more than one factor (vascular stasis, low tissue oxygenation, microtraumas) contributes to activation of osteoblast and <b>chondroblast</b> progenitor cells with a consequent precipitation of calcium salts within the connective tissue [1 – 3]. Clinically, heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs in rare congenital disorders and, more commonly, in acquired conditions such as after surgery or related to spinal cord or head lesions. This latter condition, called neurogenic heterotopic ossification, is the topic of this article.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Polyclonal {{antibodies}} {{were raised}} in a rabbit against the major proteoglycan of chick sternal cartilage. A total of six antisera was obtained, three after the first booster injection (Al, A 2, and A 3) and three after the second booster injection (A 4, A 5, and A 6). The Al antiserum, which was characterized in most detail, immunoprecipitated native as well as chondroitinase ABC-digested or chondroitinase ABC/keratanase-digested cartilage proteoglycan synthesized by cultured chick <b>chondroblasts,</b> but failed to immunoprecipitate the major proteoglycan synthesized by chick skin fibroblasts. This antiserum was also able to immunoprecipitate the cartilage proteoglycan core protein newly synthesized by cultured <b>chondroblasts,</b> but no other major cell protein. However, the late bleed antisera obtained from the same rabbit after a second booster injection reacted with a new chondroblast-specific polypeptide(s) of ^- 60, 000 mol wt {{in addition to the}} cartilage proteoglycan. By immunofluorescence procedures, the Al antiserum stained the extracellular proteoglycan matrix of cultured <b>chondroblasts</b> but not that of skin fibroblasts.

5000|$|Chondroblastoma is a rare, benign, locally {{aggressive}} bone tumor {{that typically}} affects the epiphyses or apophyses of long bones. [...] It {{is thought to}} arise from an outgrowth of immature cartilage cells (<b>chondroblasts)</b> from secondary ossification centers, originating from the epiphyseal plate or some remnant of it.|$|R
50|$|Differentiation of <b>chondroblasts</b> {{is favored}} in an {{environment}} with high compressive force and low partial oxygen pressure which combine to inhibit protein 3, a protein which inhibits cartilage differentiation. These preferences are important since mature cartilage tissue is avascular and thus would be ill-suited to a high oxygen environment.|$|R
40|$|Chondrogenesis is a multistep process {{culminating}} {{in the establishment of}} a precisely patterned template for bone formation. Previously, we identified a loss in retinoid receptor–mediated signaling as being necessary and sufficient for expression of the <b>chondroblast</b> phenotype (Weston et al., 2000. J. Cell Biol. 148 : 679 – 690). Here we demonstrate a close association between retinoic acid receptor (RAR) activity and the transcriptional activity of Sox 9, a transcription factor required for cartilage formation. Specifically, inhibition of RAR-mediated signaling in primary cultures of mouse limb mesenchyme results in increased Sox 9 expression and activity. This induction is attenuated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, and by coexpression of a dominant negative nuclear receptor corepressor- 1, indicating an unexpected require-ment for RAR-mediated repression in skeletal progenitor differentiation. Inhibition of RAR activity results in activation of the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways, indicating their potential role in the regulation of chondrogenesis by RAR repression. Accordingly, activation of RAR signaling, which attenuates differentiation, can be rescued by activation of p 38 MAPK or PKA. In summary, these findings demonstrate a novel role for active RAR-mediated gene repression in chondrogenesis and establish a hierarchical network whereby RAR-mediated signaling functions upstream of the p 38 MAPK and PKA signaling pathways to regulate emergence of the <b>chondroblast</b> phenotype...|$|E
40|$|A {{central issue}} in {{developmental}} biology is {{the formation of}} spatial pattern in the early embryo. From the homogeneous mass of dividing cells {{in the very early}} stge of development, emerge the vast range of pattern and structure observed in animals. The skeleton, for example, is laid down during chondrogenesis, when <b>chondroblast</b> cells condense into aggregates which lead via cartilage to bone formation. The skin, the major body organ of vertebrates, forms many specalized structures, for example, hair, scales, feathers and glands, as well as antlers and horns. Butterfly wings exhibit spectacular colours and patterns and many animals develop dramatic coat markings...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of the paraxial skeleton requires that commitment and differentiation of skeletal progenitors is precisely coordinated during limb outgrowth. Several signaling molecules have been identified {{that are important in}} specifying the pattern of these skeletal primordia. Very little is known, however, about the mechanisms regulating the differentiation of limb mesenchyme into chondrocytes. Overexpression of RARα in transgenic animals interferes with chondrogenesis and leads to appendicular skeletal defects (Cash, D. E., C. B. Bock, K. Schughart, E. Linney, and T. M. Underhill. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 136 : 445 – 457). Further analysis of these animals shows that expression of the transgene in chondroprogenitors maintains a prechondrogenic phenotype and prevents <b>chondroblast</b> differentiation even in the presence of BMPs, which are known stimulators of cartilage formation. Moreover, an RAR antagonist accelerates <b>chondroblast</b> differentiation as demonstrated by the emergence of collagen type II–expressing cells much earlier than in control or BMP-treated cultures. Addition of Noggin to limb mesenchyme cultures inhibits cartilage formation and the appearance of precartilaginous condensations. In contrast, abrogation of retinoid signaling is sufficient to induce the expression of the chondroblastic phenotype in the presence of Noggin. These findings show that BMP and RAR-signaling pathways appear to operate independently to coordinate skeletal development, and that retinoid signaling can function in a BMP-independent manner to induce cartilage formation. Thus, retinoid signaling appears to play a novel and unexpected role in skeletogenesis by regulating the emergence of chondroblasts from skeletal progenitors...|$|E
50|$|In embryogenesis, the {{skeletal}} system {{is derived from}} the mesoderm germ layer. Chondrification (also known as chondrogenesis) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into <b>chondroblasts</b> and begins secreting the molecules (aggrecan and collagen type II) that form the extracellular matrix.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chondroblasts,</b> or perichondrial cells, is {{the name}} given to mesenchymal {{progenitor}} cells in situ which, from endochondral ossification, will form chondrocytes in the growing cartilage matrix. Another name for them is subchondral cortico-spongious progenitors. They have euchromatic nuclei and stain by basic dyes. These cells are extremely important in Chondrogenesis due to their role in forming both the Chondrocytes and cartilage matrix which will eventually form cartilage. Use of the term is technically inaccurate since mesenchymal progenitors can also technically differentiate into osteoblasts or fat. <b>Chondroblasts</b> are called Chondrocytes when they embed themselves in the cartilage matrix, consisting of proteoglycan and collagen fibers, until they lie in the matrix lacunae. Once they embed themselves into the cartilage matrix, they grow the cartilage matrix by growing more cartilage extracellular matrix rather than by dividing further.|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{cartilage}} {{and bone}} {{formation in the}} limb bud <b>chondroblasts</b> condense into foci which provide the pattern for subsequent bone development. Formation of these condensations is, finally, a mechanical event, {{and so it is}} natural to ask what are the forces responsible for creating them. We have constructed a model for the process of cell aggregation during chondrogenesis which involves the following forces: (1) the passive elasticity of the extracellular matrix (ECM), (2) the osmotic swelling pressure of the ECM, which is generated principally by the hyaluronate (HA) component, (3) the active cell tractions developed by the <b>chondroblasts.</b> By examining the balance of forces between the cells and matrix we find that patterns of cell aggregation can spontaneously arise by an instability mechanism analogous to that which occurs in chemical pattern formation models...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{sought to}} examine {{possible}} changes in pattern and concentration of type II collagen in the condylar cartilage and articular disc of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{in response to}} unilateral extraction of mandibular teeth in a rabbit model {{as a means of}} elucidating the effects of unilateral mastication on the TMJ. Methods: A total of 12 experimental rabbits were killed either 3 or 6 weeks after the extractions, and 3 additional rabbits without extractions were used as controls. TMJ blocks from both sides of each of the 15 animals were examined for type II collagen via an immunoperoxidase procedure. Results: Anti-type II collagen antibody, (Ab) binding was detected mainly in the hypertrophic <b>chondroblast</b> layer of the condylar cartilage of normal rabbits. At 3 weeks after unilateral extraction of teeth, anti-type II collagen Ab binding to the territorial matrix of the hypertrophic <b>chondroblast</b> layer of the condylar cartilage and to the disc was stronger than normal. The increase in Ab binding appeared more dramatic on the nonfunctional side than on the functional side of TMJ. Variations from the normal pattern of anti-type II collagen Ab binding in terms of distribution through the extracellular matrix and fibrillar appearance were also observed. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the condylar cartilage and disc adapt to the imbalance induced by unilateral extraction of teeth through chondrocyte repair responses involving collagen II expression that appear to differ between the functional and nonfunctional sides of the TMJ. © 2003 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
