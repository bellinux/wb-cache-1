50|$|Genome {{type and}} {{transmission}} vector {{are two of}} the most important traits used for classification.

40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{complete}} nucleotide sequences of lettuce infectious yellows virus (LIYV) RNAs 1 and 2. LIYV RNA 1 is 8118 nucleotides and includes three open reading frames (ORFs). Computer-assisted analysis of LIYV RNA 1 ORFs identified domains for a papain-like protease, methyltransferase (MTR), RNA helicase (HEL), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We {{suggest that the}} RdRp domain is expressed independently of the other replication-associated domains via a + 1 ribosomal frameshift. Amino acid sequences of the MTR, HEL, and RdRp show highly significant similarity to the homologous sequences from other <b>closteroviruses</b> and lower similarity to the respective proteins of tobamoviruses, tobraviruses, hordeiviruses, bromoviruses, and furoviruses. LIYV RNA 2 is 7193 nucleotides and includes six ORFs. These ORFs include a gene array that is characteristic of the closteroviruses: ORFs encoding a small membrane protein, a homologue of the HSP 70 family of chaperone proteins, a protein whose function is unknown, the coat protein, and a diverged duplicate of the coat protein. LIYV is distinguished from the monopartite <b>closteroviruses</b> in the following ways: its genome consists of two RNAs, {{the positions of the}} coat protein gene and its diverged duplicate are reversed, and LIYV includes ORFs that are unrelated to ORFs found in other <b>closteroviruses...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Closteroviruses</b> have a (+)ssRNA genome, so {{it needs}} to first be {{transcribed}} into dsDNA before translation. Replication also involves formation of subgenomic RNA. Replication happens in vesicles known as viral factories. <b>Closteroviruses</b> can have up to 10 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in their genome that encode several enzymes, like RNA polymerase, methyltransferase, RNA helicase, and papain-like protease (L-pro). L-pro has {{an essential role in}} replication. The dsRNA is then used as a template for the replication of ssRNA which is then transcribed into mRNA and translated into viral proteins. Using Beet Yellow Virus as an example, it is possible to see that the virion is formed mainly by the major capsid protein. The virus has a short tail that is formed by the minor capsid protein. Cell mechanisms are used to translate these and all the other viral proteins.|$|R
50|$|For {{classifying}} the Carrot yellow-leaf virus, the Baltimore {{system and}} the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses system classifies this virus as closteroviridae, or a <b>closterovirus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Viruses in <b>Closterovirus</b> are non-enveloped, with flexuous and Filamentous geometries. The {{diameter}} {{is around}} 10-13 nm, with {{a length of}} 1250-2200 nm. Genomes are linear, around 19.3kb in length.|$|E
50|$|The Potato yellow vein virus (PYVV) is a plant {{pathogen}} of the Closteroviridae family. It is a whitefly-transmitted <b>closterovirus</b> vectored by Trialeurodes vaporariorum, {{which is known}} to cause a yellowing disease in potato crops in South America.|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the family}} Closteroviridae have been {{traditionally}} defined as plant viruses with thread-like particles having messenger-sense single-stranded RNA, the largest genomes among RNA plant viruses. Individual virus species are distributed worldwide {{and some of them}} cause devastating crop losses. The natural host range usually narrow. Diseases symptoms are yellowing type or pitting and/or groowing of the woody cylinder. Infection systemic, but usually limited to the floem. Natural vectors are aphids, whiteflies, pseudococcids, coccids and mealybugs. Trans­mission is semipersistant. <b>Closteroviruses</b> contains 9 - 13 ORFs flanked by 5 '- and 3 '- untranslated regions with different length. The genome strategy is based on  polyprotein precessing, + 1 ribosomal frame­shift and formation of subgenomic RNAs.

40|$|The <b>closteroviruses</b> and capilloviruses are {{diverse groups}} of {{structurally}} similar, flexuous, filamentous plant viruses. However, {{because of a}} lack of information of other than a morphological nature the taxonomy of these virus groups and of other similar elongated viruses has been somewhat confused, and to some extent is likely to remain so for some time...|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{research}} {{specifically on the}} cytopathic effect of CYLV, however {{there is a general}} pattern in the Closteroviridae family that might apply to this particular virus. <b>Closteroviruses</b> are usually phloem-limited, but some groups might infect parenchyma and mesophyll cells; therefore, <b>closteroviruses</b> are more often described simply as [...] "phloem-associated" [...] with regard to tissue tropism. That is why symptoms are associated with phloem; the cytopathology is mainly caused by vesicles containing virus particles, which is also a form of diagnosis.Another important viral mechanism is the capacity to escape the host's immune system. In plants, a common strategy is the use of interference RNA or RNAi, which are short sequences homologous to the viral genome. When these short sequences bind to the genome, they prevent transcription into dsDNA, therefore controlling the infection. Some viruses have developed proteins called Silencing Suppressors in response to RNAi. The mechanism is unknown, but mutation in those proteins allow the plant to recover from the viral infection and prevents systemic infections.|$|R
50|$|The carrot yellow-leaf {{virus was}} first {{isolated}} in Japanese carrots that had yellowing leaves. Using electron microscopy, the virus particle {{was found to}} be 1.6006 X 1012 nm long with a 3.7-nm helical pitch. These are characteristics from the <b>Closterovirus</b> genus. There was a suspected case found in the Netherlands that was originally going to be studied because it seemed similar to CYLV, but it ended up having a different host range.|$|E
50|$|<b>Closterovirus,</b> {{also known}} as beet yellows viral group, is a genus of viruses, in the family Closteroviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are {{currently}} 11 species in this genus. Diseases associated with this genus include: yellowing and necrosis, particularly affecting the phloem. This genus has a probably worldwide distribution and includes among other viral species the Beet yellows virus (the type species) and Citrus tristeza virus, rather economically important plant diseases. At least some species require vectors such as aphids or mealybugs for their transmission from plant to plant.|$|E
5000|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV) is a viral {{species of}} the <b>Closterovirus</b> genus that causes the most economically damaging disease to its namesake plant genus, Citrus. The disease {{has led to the}} death of millions of Citrus trees {{all over the world and}} has rendered other millions useless for production. Farmers in Brazil and other South American countries gave it the name [...] "tristeza", meaning sadness in Portuguese and Spanish, referring to the devastation produced by the disease in the 1930s. The virus is transmitted most efficiently by the brown citrus aphid.|$|E

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{survey was}} carried out to assess, by ELISA, the occurrence of grapevine <b>closteroviruses</b> in several grape-growing areas of Greece, with particular regard to GLRaV- 7. Samples were collected in commercial vineyards and varietal collections from apparently symptomless and symptomatic leafroll vines.

40|$|Closteroviruslike particles, {{designated}} as grapevine corky bark-associated virus (GCBaV), were purified from mature leaves and stem phloem tissue of a corky bark-affected grapevine that had indexed negative for other grapevine viruses. Electron microscopy of purified preparations revealed {{the presence of}} flexuous rod-shaped viruslike particles that were about 13 nm in diameter and between 1, 400 and 2, 000 nm long, with a helical pitch of 3. 4 nm. In purified preparations, the GCBaV particles degraded within a few weeks, unlike grapevine leafroll associated virus (GLRaV), which was stable for more than 1 mo under the same storage condition. The molecular weight of the coat protein of GCBaV was 24, 000. A large dsRNA molecule (about 15. 3 kbp), along with lower molecular weight species, was detected in tissues of corky bark-diseased grapevines, but not in healthy grapevines. Polyclonal antisera were produced in rabbits against purified or partially purified virus preparations. In direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antisera to GCBaV did not react to the serologically distinct types (II and III) of the long <b>closteroviruses</b> associated with grapevine leafroll disease and grapevine virus A (GVA), and vice versa. This antiserum also reacted in ELISA with other corky bark-affected grapevines. Our data suggest that closteroviruslike particles, {{designated as}} GCBaV, may be the causal agent of corky bark disease. However, definitive proof is still lacking. The inclusion of GCBaV {{in the group of}} <b>closteroviruses</b> with citrus tristeza virus is proposed...|$|R
50|$|The viruses of this genus have segmented, bipartite genomes {{that add}} up to 7,500-19,500 {{nucleotides}} in length. Their genomes also code for proteins that do not form part of the virion particles as well as structural proteins. The Universal Virus Database describes that their genome sequences near their 3'-ends are capable of hairpin-loop formation and also believe that their 5'-ends may have methylated caps. Each of the viral RNA molecules contains four hair-pin structures and a pseudoknot in the 3'UTR. The pseudoknot is unusual in that it contains a small stem-loop structure inside loop L1. In the related genus <b>Closterovirus,</b> these secondary structures {{have been found to}} be important in viral RNA replication.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{work has}} {{identified}} five groups of positive-stranded RNA viruses containing four, three, three, three, and one order(s), respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This analysis suggests that alphaviruses and flaviviruses can be separated into two families—the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, respectively—but suggests that other taxonomic assignments, {{such as the}} pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus, and arteriviruses, may be incorrect. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders and not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. The luteoviruses appear to be two families rather than one, and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears {{not to be a}} <b>closterovirus</b> but a new genus of the Potexviridae.|$|E
50|$|The virus cell {{specificity}} depends more on {{the vector}} than on the virus itself. There are some hypotheses afirming that CYLF evolved to infect phloem cells {{because they are the}} most common feeding site for the vectors. During feeding, aphids transmit the virus into phloem cells. However, in order to spread the infection, viruses need to move from one cell to another. Using Citrus tristeza virus as an example of <b>closterovirus,</b> it is possible to observe two different types of movement: one from adjacent cells and one from long distance. In order to penetrate the thick cell wall, closteroviruses have specific movement proteins encoded in their genome, along with mechanisms to use host proteins to facilitate transport. One of the most important proteins for cell-to-cell movement is a Hsp70 homolog, or Hsp70h; it has this name because {{it is one of the}} heat shock proteins with a weight of 70kDa.|$|E
40|$|Two whitefly-transmitted viruses elicit {{identical}} {{symptoms of}} interveinal chlorosis (yellowing) in greenhouse- and field-grown cucurbits in Mediterranean countries. The agents of these diseases are partially characterized <b>closteroviruses</b> and {{are known as}} beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV), which is transmitted by Trialeurodes vaporariorum, and cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV), transmitted by Bemisia tabaci. Using previously determined sequence information for fragments of the HSP 70 homolog genes of both BPYV and CYSDV, oligonucleotide primers were designed for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols to differentiate between the two viruses. RT-PCR amplified products for each virus were subsequently cloned and specifically hybridized with the homologous dsRNA (approximately 9 kbp in size for both viruses) following Northern hybridization analysis. Minor dsRNAs of approximately 5 kbp for both viruses and one dsRNA of 3 kbp for CYSDV were also identified by Northern hybridization and might represent defective RNA species. In order to compare the predicted amino acid sequence of fragments of the HSP 70 homolog genes of BPYV and CYSDV, oligonucleotide primers were designed for RT-PCR amplification of a previously unknown segment of the BPYV gene from a Greek isolate and the American isolate of the virus. The RT-PCR products of both isolates were cloned and found to be identical in sequence. Computer assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the assembled HSP 70 homolog gene fragments showed that BPYV and CYSDV {{are closely related to}} each other and individually as closely related to the corresponding gene of lettuce infectious yellows virus, which is the prototype member of the recently proposed Crinivirus genus of whitefly-transmitted, bipartite <b>closteroviruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|This e-Book on {{the virus}} family Closteroviridae {{provides}} an overview on some representative members of this family. Most articles are reviews on different fundamental and applied aspects, but a few are original contributions focused on more specific issues.

First, Dawson et al. (2013) discuss CTV-host interactions, highlighting that in contrast to movement of viruses in herba-ceous plants that largely occurs through adjacent cells, CTV infection relies mainly on long-distance movement.

40|$|There {{are several}} causes of shriveled fruit in vineyards, {{including}} sunburn, dehydration, bunchstem necrosis (BSN), and a recently described sugar accumulation disorder (SAD). Due to the similarities in fruit appearance these disorders are often confused with one another, {{but they can}} easily be distinguished by the location and/or composition of the shriveled fruit and by {{the condition of the}} rachis. Sunburn is typically exhibited only on berries that are exposed to direct sunlight, and BSN is typified by necrotic rachis tissue, with shriveled berries distal to the necrotic tissue. SAD berries exhibit low sugar content as well as concentration, whereas late season dehydration berries, as well as BSN berries, typically have normal to above normal sugar concentration. SAD berries exhibit lower berry weight, pH, and anthocyanins, as well as differences in many nitrogenous compounds compared to normally-developing fruit. In one location, SAD is expressed at the whole-vine level, but none of the commonly known pathogenic organisms (phytoplasmas, <b>closteroviruses,</b> fanleaf viruses, nepovirusesm, and fleck complex viruses) were found to be associated with SAD...|$|R

40|$|Computer-assisted {{analysis}} revealed a striking sequence {{similarity between the}} putative 24 -kDa protein (p 24) encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 5 of beet yellows <b>closterovirus</b> and the coat protein of this virus encoded by the adjacent ORF 6. Both of these proteins {{are closely related to}} the homologous proteins of another <b>closterovirus,</b> citrus tristeza virus. It is hypothesized that the genes for coat protein and its diverged tandem copy have evolved by duplication. Phylogenetic analysis using various methods for tree generation suggested that the duplication was already present in the genome of the common ancestor of the two closteroviruses. The genes for p 24 and coat protein of beet yellows <b>closterovirus</b> were cloned, transcribed, and translated in vitro yielding products of the expected size. It was shown that p 24 is translated starting from the first of the two alternative AUG codons located near the 5 ' terminus of ORF 5. The presence of a single protein species in beet yellows <b>closterovirus</b> virions and the near identity of the amino acid composition of this protein with the composition of the ORF 6 but not the ORF 5 product indicated that p 24 is not a major virion component. Most of the amino acids that are conserved in the coat proteins of filamentous viruses of plants are retained also in p 24. These observations suggest that p 24 may share some structural and functional features with the coat protein but probably fulfills a distinct function in virus reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 In this {{investigation}} {{we examined the}} molecular architecture and functions associated with the virion components of the Beet yellows virus (BYV), family Closteroviridae. The BYV virions are filamentous particles composed of two coat proteins, the major coat protein (CP), which encapsidates {{the majority of the}} genome, and the minor coat protein (CPm) that makes a small tail-like structure {{at one end of the}} virions. The bipolar architecture of <b>closteroviruses</b> is unique among the plant helical viruses, and suggests that CP and CPm evolved to fulfill different functions in the life cycle of <b>closteroviruses.</b> Current models propose that the CPm tails are specialized virion components that participate in the vector transmission and cell-to-cell movement of the virus. In addition to CP and CPm, the cell-to-cell movement of BYV requires the contributions of three highly conserved viral genes encoding a small 6. 4 -kDa hydrophobic protein (p 6), a HSP 7 O homologue (HSP 7 Oh) and a 64 -kDa protein (p 64). Using nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and biochemical analyses we demonstrate that HSP 7 Oh and p 64 are associated with virions. This conclusion is based on the co-migration of HSP 7 Oh and p 64 with BYV virions in sucrose density gradients, and on the co-immunoprecipitation of HSP 7 Oh, pM and BYV capsid protein using anti-HSP 7 Oh or anti-p 64 serum. The association of HSP 7 Oh and p 64 with the virions is resistant to high concentrations of sodium chloride, which normally disrupt non-covalent protein interactions. Low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or lithium chloride (LiC 1), and treatment with alkaline or acidic pH resulted in the simultaneous disassembly of virions and dissociation of HSP 7 Oh and p 64. The N-terminal domain of p 64 is exposed at the virion surface and is accessible to antibodies and mild trypsin digestion. In contrast, the C-terminal domain is embedded in the virion and is inaccessible to antibodies or trypsin. The C-terminal domain of p 64 is shown to be homologous to CP and CPm. Mutation of the signature motifs of capsid proteins of filamentous RNA viruses in p 64 results in the formation of defective virions, which are unable to move from cell to cell. These results reveal the dual function of HSP 7 Oh and p 64 in tail assembly and BYV motility and support the concept of the virion tail as a specialized device for BYV cell-to-cell movement...|$|R

40|$|Common green ti plants (Cordyline fruticosa L.) in Hawaii can be {{infected}} by four recently characterized <b>closteroviruses</b> that are tentative {{members of the}} proposed genus Velarivirus. In this study, a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay developed to detect and distinguish Cordyline virus 1 (CoV- 1), CoV- 2, CoV- 3, and CoV- 4 was used to determine: (i) the distribution of these viruses in Hawaii; and (ii) if {{they are involved in}} the etiology of ti ringspot disease. One hundred and thirty-seven common green ti plants with and without ti ringspot symptoms were sampled from 43 sites on five of the Hawaiian Islands and underwent the RT-PCR assay. Eleven ornamental ti varieties were also sampled and assayed. Based on this survey, it appears none of the CoVs are involved in the etiology of ti ringspot. The observation of a non-uniform geographic distribution of the CoVs in common green ti, combined with the presence of CoVs in seed-derived ornamental varieties, suggests active vector transmission. Eight herbarium specimens collected between 1903 and 2003 from plants on the island of Oahu also underwent the RT-PCR assay.

III) Recombination between divergent sequence variants have generated new genotypes and plays an important role for the evolution of some viruses of the family Closteroviridae. IV) Interaction between virus strains or between different viruses in mixed infections may alter accumulation of certain strains.
