These systems present new challenges in distributed human-computer interfaces {{such as how to}} best use sensor streams, distribute interfaces across multiple devices, and dynamic network management as users come an go, and as devices are added or fail. The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY SMART DATA FLOW system is a low overhead, high bandwidth transport mechanism for standardized multi-modal data streams. It is designed to allow integration of multiple sensors with distributed processing needed for the sense-recognize-respond <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> modal user interfaces. Its core is a server/client architecture, allowing clients to produce or subscribe to data flows, and supporting steps toward scalable processing, distributing the computing requirements among many network connected computers and pervasive devices.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is demonstration of the role <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> scale modelling in the system, which optimizes the whole production chain. Product exploitation and properties are the key parameters for formulation of the objective function in the optimization problem. Such parameters as fatigue resistance, wear resistance or thermal resistance are crucial for extending the life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> products, therefore, theoretical prediction of those parameters is inevitable for the optimization of the manufacturing system. Thus, the main focus in the paper is on description of the idea <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> scale modelling and on presentation <b>of</b> the <b>multi</b> scale model developed by the Authors. This model combines finite element (FE) solution of the macro scale problem with the cellular automata (CA) model of the micro scale phenomena. Simulation of the production chain is {{the second part of}} the paper. The chain under consideration is composed of stock heating, cold forging, machining and simulation of exploitation conditions. The correlation between the process parameters and the exploitation properties of the product is demonstrated. Finally, the optimization problem which would be the base of intelligent manufacturing, is formulated. 1...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1980 s major {{importance}} {{in the growth of}} franchising systems {{can be attributed to the}} advent of a new governance form due to multi unit franchising. In a multi unit agreement a franchisee is permitted the right to establish a mini chain of outlets within the franchise system. Three distinct types <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> unit franchising have been categorised by researchers, namely, master franchising (or sub franchising), area development and area representative (sequential multi unit franchising) agreements. This work tries to explain the situation and use <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> unit franchising in the German franchise sector which is quite young compared to the U. S. market. Premises to explain the use of this ownership strategy are based on agency theory and transaction cost theory. The hypotheses formulated suggest that behavioural uncertainty through the franchisee, because of shirking and free riding, should have a positive relationship with the tendency to the use <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> unit franchising. A likewise positive relationship should be established due to specific investments by the franchisee at start of the contract. However, environmental uncertainty, because of rapid changing markets, should reduce the tendency to the use <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> unit franchising. The study revealed that franchisors did not see a strong relationship between the use <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> unit franchising and its efficiency in mitigating moral hazard. The findings corroborated outcomes of prior transaction cost theory research with regard to the positive influence of asset specific investments as an ex post bonding mechanism. Environmental uncertainty was strongly supported by the data but in having a negative relationship with the implementation <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> unit franchising as ownership strategy. Mixed support of the hypotheses was obtained. Limitations of the study, like the use of cross-sectional data and not paying attention to different types <b>of</b> <b>multi</b> unit franchising, make it necessary to further explore this research question to get a better understanding of franchising in Germany and its application to different requirements.
