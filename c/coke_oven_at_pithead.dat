He formed George Stephenson & Company in 1837 and built a colliery and <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>at</b> Clay Cross which opened in 1840. The company passed to his son Robert Stephenson on George's death in 1848, and in 1852 he sold his shares, the business becoming the Clay Cross Company, which was at one time the largest independent employer in the UK.|$|R

50|$|In 1910, {{the company}} {{obtained}} two major contracts.

5000|$|In 1840 local boys {{digging a}} {{groundhog}} {{out of the}} ground discovered coal. In the early 1870s Tracy City an experimental blast furnace was built by Samuel Jones and owned by the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. The furnace, called [...] "Fiery Gizzard", was built to see if local coal would be used to produce iron. The furnace made 15 tons of iron before the stovepipe fell on the third day. The former location of the furnace is marked with a historical marker. The <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>at</b> Tracy City supplied railroad and industrial fuel and workers and their families moved into the area in great numbers from 1875 until 1900. By 1910 the industry faded due to problems invoked by labor unions and convict labor. Tracy City is also home to the oldest family bakery in Tennessee, Dutch Maid Bakery. In 1987 the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Tracy City was incorporated in 1915.|$|R
50|$|Coalburg is an unincorporated {{community}} in Jefferson County, Alabama, United States. Coalburg {{was home to}} coal mines first developed by John T. Milner, who sold them in May 1883 to the Georgia Pacific Railway. Edward Magruder Tutwiler became the superintendent of the mines. Sloss-Sheffield Iron and Steel Company operated <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>at</b> Coalburg during this time. At its peak, the Coalburg mines produced four thousand tons of coal per day. Overall, the Coalburg mines produced over 186,000 tons of coal. Sloss used convict labor {{to work in the}} Coalburg mines, with 320 men working in 1889. As the mines grew, the number of convicts used to work in the mines increased. The coal mined at and coke produced in Coalburg was sent to Sloss Furnaces in Birmingham to be turned into pig iron.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{presented in}} this thesis {{is concerned with the}} effect of size segregation on the bulk density of coal in a model <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> as a function of different operating variables. In {{the first part of the}} investigation, basic experiments were carried out with binary mixtures of coal particles received from Kembla Coal 2 ̆ 6 Coke Pty. Limited. The results show that there were no corresponding relationships between the bulk density and size segregation because of the differences in microstructure of the mixture, and that the multiple charging point system gives higher in-bin bulk density than the single point system does. The distribution of bulk density and size segregation in the model <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>at</b> different heights were plotted as an aid in further understanding the influence of charging height. In the second part of the investigation, the experiments were conducted with coal mixtures of continuous size distribution and different moisture content and oil additions by using Quadratic Regressive Orthogonal Design of experiments. The investigations were mainly concentrated on the effects of size distribution, moisture content and oil addition...|$|R
5000|$|In 1864 John Brogden & Sons leased {{the land}} at Garth and bought Garth Fach and Cwmdu Canol Farms. On that land they sank a {{colliery}} in 1865 and constructed {{a large number}} of <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>at</b> the surface. An underground explosion occurred at the mine in 1867, and although no one was injured the mine was closed for a year. The company continued to work the mine until the long depression forced the mines closure in 1877. The mine re-opened under the ownership of the Tondu and Ogmore coal and Iron company. But by 1884 it again swapped hands, form this point being run by the Garth Merthyr Colliery Company. In an 1896 report by the Inspector of Mines, the colliery is named as the Garth Merthyr Colliery and was recorded as employing 504 men, extracting both house and steam coal.|$|R

50|$|The coals of the Pocahontas {{coalfield}} {{developed a}} good reputation, and by 1903, U.S. Steel {{had set up}} a subsidiary named U.S. Coal and Coke to mine coal in central McDowell County. The operations centered around Gary, with numbered coal mines/camps surrounding the central coal town of Gary like coal town suburbs. Wilcoe was Gary No. 1, Ream was Gary No. 6, Elbert was Gary No.8, and Venus was Gary No. 10 and Thorpe was No.11. At first the coal was baked in beehive <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>at</b> the mine site and shipped to the steel mills as coke (much as U.S. Steel had done in the Connellsville coalfield in Pennsylvania). After 1918 the coal was shipped by rail to the massive coke works at Clairton. The captive mines of U.S. Steel in the Gary area continued to thrive until the 1980s, when they were closed and Gary began an economic decline.|$|R
50|$|The {{market for}} steel was slow due to intense {{competition}} from eastern mills, and the mill was often idle.

5000|$|BC {{has had a}} {{long history}} with narrow-gauge {{railways}} starting with the horse-drawn and gravity-assisted Seton Lake tramway in 1858, and then to the [...] gauge coal mine railways atNanaimo. Coal was moved to the pier at Departure Bay. Other railways sprang up including the Kaslo and Slocan Railway, the Columbia and Western Railway near Trail,and the Leonora and Mt. Sicker Railway on Vancouver Island. Narrow-gauge lines were used extensively in mining and logging. However, by 1910 narrow-gauge logging lines were phased out as it was found that they were unsafe for the large BC timber. Other small industrial lines used narrow gauge for a few years—the Kitsault Mine, and the Western Peat operation in Burns Bog. Narrow gauge worked in the Kootenays too <b>at</b> the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>at</b> Fernie and logging sites of Cranbrook. The White Pass and Yukon Route in the far north west corner of the province, connects Alaska, BC and the Yukon. It is still in operation and seasonally steam hauled.

5000|$|According to {{an insert}} in the Park County News, {{the story of}} Aldridge begins when Major Horr {{discovered}} five coal veins on a side hill near Cinnabar in 1872. In 1882 Major Horr and his two sons formed the Horr Coal and Coke Company. After the company was passed down to his sons it was sold to H.F. Brown and the Horr Coal and Coke Company became the Park Coke and Coal Company. During Brown’s {{control of the company}} <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> were erected to expand the company. In 1889 J.H. Conrad became the manager of the company. By this time 50 tons of coal and coke were produced daily to be sent to the Anaconda Copper Mining Company smelters in Butte, East Helena, Great Falls, and Anaconda. [...] In 1894 the Park Coke and Coal Company was sold to entrepreneurs from New Jersey who turned it into the Montana Coal and Coke Company. Under the management of Ware B. Gay, the Montana Coal and Coke Company was employing 400 men, and it became the largest producing coke company in the western United States. [...] Prospectors from the Montana Coal and Coke Company explored the nearby area of Horr and in 1892 discovered a rich coal vein near the Lake (later renamed Aldridge Lake). By June 1895 much of the mining activity near Horr started moving toward the lake where the “Camp at the Lake” was formed. In November, 200 men marched from the mines at Lake to the Montana Coal and Coke Company office in Horr to demand higher wages. The Montana Coal and Coke Company sent W.H. Aldridge from Helena to break the strike. After the strike was over (with the help of Mr. Aldridge) the mining camp was renamed Aldridge. With the completion of a conveyor from the mines at Aldridge to the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>at</b> Horr the Aldridge mines produced 300 to 500 tons of coke daily. With this, in 1897 the mines at Horr were abandoned and all mining operations were focused at Aldridge.|$|R
