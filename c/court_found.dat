5|$|Though the act won easy {{passage through}} the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen {{reserved}} royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, the <b>court</b> <b>found</b> that it was unconstitutional, and it never became law.|$|E
5|$|All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, {{the only}} {{case of the}} five {{originating}} from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School. The Gebhart case {{was the only one}} where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme <b>Court,</b> <b>found</b> that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The <b>court</b> <b>found</b> the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots.

50|$|In Hayburn's Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408 (1792), federal circuit courts held {{an act of}} Congress unconstitutional for {{the first}} time. Three federal circuit <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> that Congress had {{violated}} the Constitution by passing an act requiring circuit court judges to decide pension applications, subject to {{the review of the}} Secretary of War. These circuit <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> {{that this was not a}} proper judicial function under Article III. These three decisions were appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeals became moot when Congress repealed the statute while the appeals were pending.|$|R
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district <b>court</b> <b>found,</b> is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Supreme Court {{announced}} {{four factors}} {{relevant to the}} determination of a Speedy Trial Clause violation: (1) {{the length of the}} delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether the defendant demanded a speedy trial, and (4) prejudice. Applying Barker, the <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest. The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Modi was {{appointed}} Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi {{was elected to}} the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a <b>court</b> <b>found</b> no evidence to prosecute Modi. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.|$|E
5000|$|At {{trial and}} on appeal, the <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> {{in favour of}} Robertson. It was noted that for the Globe to seek {{protection}} under its collective copyright the database must constitute a newspaper or consist of a [...] "substantial part thereof in any material form whatever". A substantial part of a newspaper exists in the arranging and formatting of articles, much of which is lost when the articles are put on a database. Thus, the <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> that the database was not merely a newspaper in a different guise but a new work.|$|R

5|$|On June 29, 2006, the Court {{issued a}} 5–3 {{decision}} holding {{that it had}} jurisdiction, and that the administration did not have authority to set up these particular military commissions without congressional authorization, {{because they did not}} comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention (which the <b>court</b> <b>found</b> to be incorporated into the Uniform Code of Military Justice).|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the <b>court</b> <b>found</b> that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|Stack v. Boyle (1951) is {{the only}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally {{excessive}}. There, the <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act. In United States v. Salerno (1987), the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the determination of the amount of, or the denial of, bail.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Intel {{alleged that}} Cyrix had infringed several patents and {{initiated}} legal action. The <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> that Cyrix had indeed reverse engineered the Intel part, but had conceived their own compatible design, the <b>courts</b> also <b>found</b> that Texas Instruments, SGS-Thomson and IBM were licensed to produce Intel designs. Eventually {{the case was}} dropped and Intel paid Cyrix $12 million to drop anti-trust charges against them.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, loosely-knit {{ownership}} chains (such as Travelodge) {{and referral}} chains (such as Quality <b>Courts,</b> <b>founded</b> in 1939 by seven motel operators as a non-profit referral system) {{were converted to}} franchise systems.|$|R

5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The <b>court</b> <b>found</b> that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
50|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{of the day was}} very hostile to the convention and challenged the local authorities' right to finance the convention, although the <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> that they were in fact entitled to do so.|$|R
