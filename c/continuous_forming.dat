The contribution of stress relaxation and its parameters on the ductility of materials has not been established so far.

The polarized specimen without plastic deformation under the potential range for S. C.

The activation behavior by plastic deformation is associated with local break down of passivity at slip steps and then selective dissolution at the rougher slip steps.

Microscopic organisms such as spermatozoa use similar mechanisms to propel themselves. In this work, we present a numerical analysis {{of the effect of}} traveling plane-wave deformations on an elastic-film actuator within a fluid medium inside a channel. In particular, we analyzed a micropump that consists of a wave actuator, which is placed in a channel to pump the fluid {{in the direction of the}} plane-deformation waves. The unsteady flow over the moving boundary between the parallel plates has very low Reynolds number, and, hence, is mod-eled using the two-dimensional time-dependent Stokes equations. The fluid-structure interaction due to moving boundary is modeled with the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method incorporating the Winslow smoothing. COM-SOL is used to solve two-dimensional time-dependent Stokes equations on a deforming mesh, and to carry out simulations of the flow.

40|$|In {{computational}} solid mechanics, the ALE formalism can be {{very useful}} {{to reduce the size}} of finite element models of <b>continuous</b> <b>forming</b> operations such as roll forming. The mesh of these ALE models is said to be quasi-Eulerian because the nodes remain almost fixed—or almost Eulerian—in the main process direction, although they are required to move in the orthogonal plane in order to follow the lateral displacements of the solid. This paper extensively presents a complete node relocation procedure dedicated to such ALE models. The discussion focusses on quadrangular and hexahedral meshes with local refinements. The main concern of this work is the preservation of the geometrical features and the shape of the free boundaries of the mesh. With this aim in view, each type of nodes (corner, edge, surface and volume) is treated sequentially with dedicated algorithms. A special care is given to highly curved 3 D surfaces for which a CPU-efficient smoothing technique is proposed. This new method relies on a spline surface reconstruction, on a very fast weighted Laplacian smoother with original weights and on a robust reprojection algorithm. The overall consistency of this mesh management procedure is finally demonstrated in two numerical applications. The first one is a 2 D ALE simulation of a drawbead, which provides similar results to an equivalent Lagrangian model yet is much faster. The second application is a 3 D industrial ALE model of a 16 -stand roll forming line. In this case, all attempts to perform the same simulation by using the Lagrangian formalism have been unsuccessful. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The implications of the economic crisis in Romania are analyzed along with proposed measures to be followed by the Government through budgetary fiscal strategy.

This dissertation joins this effort, reporting an empirical study on the growth of HR service firms (SMEs) in Guangzhou City, China, which have been playing an increasingly important role in fast economic development of the country. The study aims {{to gain a better understanding}} on how and why these service firms were able to grow so as to identify ways to facilitate their growth. To achieve the objectives, this study first reviewed the theories of the growth of the firm, in particular, theory of Penrose (1959), from which research gaps were identified and research questions were raised. Next, using multiple-case (embedded) design, the researcher of the study carried out two phases of empirical research on growth of the HR service SMEs in Guangzhou City. Findings from the research were then thoroughly discussed in view of extant literature on firm growth and conclusions were drawn on the research questions as to how and why these firms in the city were able to grow. Based on the findings, it is concluded in this dissertation that HR service SMEs studied were in dialectical relation with their market (mainly their customers and competitors), with market constantly challenging these SMEs which in turn, continuously taking up and quite often overcoming these market challenges; it is this dialectical process of <b>continuous</b> <b>forming</b> and resolving conflicts between firm capabilities and market demands that led to spiral growth of these SMEs; thus, it could be said that causes of growth were the increase in market demands and the development of firm capabilities; 3 both forces interacted constantly in a dialectical manner to produce forces driving firm growth.

40|$|If {{two pieces}} of a glassy polymer are brought into {{intimate}} contact (within molecular proximity) at temperatures well below their glass transition temperature (Tg) negligible adhesion, {{due to lack of}} inter-diffusion of macromolecules, will be noted. Because polymer chains are kinetically trapped well below the Tg, the time-scales for relaxations in the glassy state are extremely large, and the system is effectively frozen with respect to any long range diffusive motion. This thesis shows the discovery of a new phenomenon of solid-state, plasticity-induced bonding at temperatures well below Tg which take on the order of a second, by subjecting amorphous polymers to active plastic deformation. In spite of the glassy regime, the bulk plastic deformation triggers requisite molecular mobility of polymer chains to cause inter-penetration across the interface. Quantitative levels of adhesion and morphology of the fractured interfaces validate the sub-Tg, plasticity-induced, molecular mobilization causing bonding. The absence of bonding during compression of films in a near hydrostatic setting (which inhibits plastic flow), and between an 'elastic' and a 'plastic' film, further establishes the explicit role of plastic deformation in this newly reported sub-Tg solid-state bonding. Other components of this thesis comprise the design and fabrication of machines to perform <b>continuous</b> <b>forming</b> and sub-Tg, solid-state bonding of polymer films.
