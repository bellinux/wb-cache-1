40|$|On 27 April 1998, the European Union (EU) {{removed the}} People's Republic of China from {{its list of}} {{non-market}} economies (NMEs) due to the progress made under China's economic reforms. After that, it has applied a hybrid anti-dumping policy towards imports from China, {{including the use of}} the analogue country method, conditional market economy treatment, one country one duty rule and individual treatment. However, there has been no significant change as far as the EU anti-dumping authority's practice is concerned. This is inconsistent with China's current economic status as a transitional economy with many sectors very close to a market economy. This thesis analyses the implementation of the policy and explores its legal problems and issues from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. The study begins by examining the origin of EU <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation</b> - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) anti-dumping rules. It identifies the legal problems of EU anti-dumping practice in the context of China's economic reforms starting from 1979. In order to suggest solutions to several of the problems thus identified, comparative studies are made to reveal alternative strategies by illustrating the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation</b> of the U. S, Australia, New Zealand and Japan insofar as it is applicable to China. Due to China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 December 2001, new issues and disputes may arise with regard to the EU's anti-dumping practice. With regard to all of these issues, this thesis finally attempts to propose solutions to both the EU and China. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|I {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to explain the}} heterogeneity observed in the adoption of antidumping laws by small developing countries {{in an environment of}} multilateral tariff reduction. The analysis is based on a three-stage game of trade policy determination with imperfect competition in differentiated products where the poten-tial lobby for protection is reflected in the government’s objective function and where tariffs may be bound due to multilateral trade agreements. This framework implies that the implementation of this administrative protection device is the government’s best response when multilateral bound tariffs reach a sufficiently low threshold. The heterogeneity in the adoption decision is explained by the relative size of the domestic market, the degree of product differentiation and political economy motives. Relatively large economies, highly competitive domestic markets, and countries with high domestic lobbying pressure for protection enact <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation</b> sooner.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation</b> was {{implemented}} in Canada {{and in the}} European Communities. This comparison of Canadian and EC anti-dumping law aims at examining how the Anti-Dumping Code was transposed and applied in each jurisdiction by looking at each step of an anti-dumping investigation, starting with the initiation of an investigation, the calculation of the normal value and of the export price, {{the determination of the}} dumping margin, the finding of injury, and ending with other related matters such as anti-absorption and anti-circumvention rules. Having looked at Canadian and EC anti-dumping law as such, this paper examines the compatibility of anti-dumping actions with the creation of free trade areas and the effect of anti-dumping duties on such free trade areas. It looks specifically at the EC and the NAFTA examples. Both the NAFTA and the EC treaty create, generally speaking, a free trade area, however the approach taken vis-a-vis anti-dumping duties within the free trade area is different in each case: while the EC abolished anti-dumping duties within the free trade area, these duties are maintained under the NAFTA regime...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Commission of the European Community has made Korea one of three main target {{countries}} of anti-dumping measures, because Korea is pressing to export more of the electronics products which the Community is struggling to protect, study of the Community Antidumping Law in Korea has barely begun. Therefore, in this thesis, the measures that may be imposed by Community authorities with respect to trade with countries not members of the European Community, especially with Korea, under the <b>Community</b> <b>Anti-dumping</b> Regulation, {{in the context of the}} GATT Anti-dumping system are explained and analysed. With regard to the <b>Community's</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> rules, protectionist bias in their application is examined, in particular the determination of normal value and export price, constructed normal value and constructed export price, the comparison of normal value and export price, the calculation of dumping margin, and the determination of injury, and proposals are made as to the extent to which the <b>Community</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> rules need to be revised to diminish the bias in their range that explicitly favours Community producers and a finding of dumping, in the context of the GATT rules. With regard to the Korean Anti-dumping rules, on the other hand, they are introduced, generally. Anti-dumping measures in Korea have not been applied properly in favour of Korean producers, mainly because of the lack of transparency and institutional inertia. Therefore, enactment of a special Act governing anti-dumping complaints, modelled on a unitary system rather than a bifurcated system, should be considered for the transparent and speedy investigations. Institutional inertia must be rectified, i. e., more precise definition is required in some terminologies, and provisions on cumulation and anti-circumvention should have been prescribed before their application. Through a comparative study of the anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea, it becomes clear that various aspects of the technical methodology applied by the authorities in anti-dumping determinations have a tendency to make findings of dumping largely automatic and inevitable. Therefore, it must always be borne in mind that anti-dumping measures can be imposed only where dumping and resulting injury is actually established, not artificially. This study has looked at anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea comparatively, in the context of the GATT <b>Anti-dumping</b> rules. The <b>Community</b> refers to GATT and the Code in the preamble of its anti-dumping regulation, which has no binding effect in Court, and adopts the regulation in accordance with existing international obligations, in particular those arising from Article VI of the GATT and from the GATT Anti-dumping Code. However, this does not ensure an interpretation in conformity with GATT rules and its spirit, because the wording of the GATT anti-dumping rules taken literally is very ambiguous and can be interpreted very differently. Therefore, a comparative study with the Community's antidumping rules and its practice as a legislative model should be very helpful, in order to improve the current Korean anti-dumping system, because the GATT anti-dumping rules can play a very limited role only as a guideline...|$|R
40|$|The report {{identifies}} {{concerns with}} the EU anti-dumping instrument, as applied today, {{regardless of the}} fact that the investigation procedures and methods might be in line with the current regulation and practice. The report's arguments are based on the recent anti-dumping investigation – and imposition of anti-dumping measures – on imports of ceramic tiles from China, but the observations and conclusions from the analysis are valid for most EU anti-dumping investigations. The report observes that price dumping is evaluated differently depending on whether the product is manufactured in the EU or imported from third countries. What is considered to be price dumping when imported is considered normal competition for a product manufactured in the EU. This is due to the fact that spatial price differentiation within the EU is covered by competition rules, and that competition rules have higher requirements for market share and price undercutting than the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation.</b> The report, accordingly, advocates that the criteria for imposing anti-dumping duties should be harmonized to the EU competition rules in order to ensure fair competition on the EU market. In the absence of a reformed anti-dumping regulation, the anti-dumping measures will most likely only contribute to a distorted competition where the complaining EU manufacturing industry will be protected to the detriment of the consumers. ...|$|R

40|$|Political {{pressures}} {{and concerns about}} 'unfair' trade provide the main rationale for retaining broad anti-dumping provisions in most countries. Almost one hundred years ago, New Zealand was the second {{country in the world}} to introduce <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation.</b> Since then New Zealand 2 ̆ 019 s <b>anti-dumping</b> policy and <b>legislation</b> have changed significantly in response to both internal and external pressures. The key issues over the years have remained essentially the same. To what extent should domestic producers be protected from the effects of dumping? To what extent should the interests of other groups, such as consumers and downstream industries, be taken into account? There is a natural tension between the first issue - protection of the private interests of producers - and the second - the public or national interest. The issues of protectionism and the public interest are at the centre of the debate about anti-dumping. The political factors influencing anti-dumping policy are this study 2 ̆ 019 s main focus. The study examines the history of anti-dumping policy in New Zealand, how and why it has been justified and what has shaped it. The study shows that the anti-dumping debate involves the concentrated and organised interests of import-competing industries and their employees, who benefit directly from the protection provided by anti-dumping duties, and other interest groups who bear the more or less widespread costs of anti-dumping action, such as consumers and downstream industries. Manufacturing industries have been able to place significant pressure on governments to retain strong anti-dumping provisions, particularly as other general forms of protection have been removed or reduced and New Zealand has entered into bilateral free trade agreements. Despite this pressure, governments and officials have remained intent on ensuring that anti-dumping does not replace general protection and anti-dumping on trans-Tasman trade was removed in the interests of competition. Recent proposals that competition and wider interests should be considered before taking anti-dumping action have met strong resistance from manufacturers, with pressure from importers, consumers and downstream industries remaining either limited or absent...|$|R

5000|$|The Australians {{proved to}} be tough bargainers. As was the case during earlier rounds of negotiations, there was little {{incentive}} for them to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement. Australian officials also resented Mackenzie King's reluctance to seek a broad imperial solution to the postwar slump in trade. In their view any agreement with Canada would merely assist American subsidiaries operating in the dominion {{at the expense of}} companies from Britain. For over two years, the discussions dragged on before Canadian negotiators were forced to give in to Australian demands in order to preserve the market for British Columbia's forestry products. In exchange for receiving important concessions on canned salmon, auto parts and paper, Canada reduced its duties on Australian meat and butter and increased the margin of preference enjoyed by Australian dried fruit. The 1925 agreement was soon the source of some controversy. It was strenuously opposed by Canadian farmers, who feared new competition from imported Australian meat and butter. Canada's conciliatory prime minister fretted about the accord which caused this noisy debate and condemned the minister responsible. Mackenzie King's liberal philosophy was offended by the prospect of raising Canadian tariffs on imports from third countries in order to give Australia an increased margin of preference for dried fruit. Moreover, these provisions were aimed primarily at the United States just as trade between the two North American countries had begun to recover. The prime minister gave the accord only lukewarm support, and no sooner had the agreement been approved than he delighted in crippling one of its main provisions. An Australian program to promote the export of butter was found guilty on a technicality of violating Canada's <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation</b> in early 1926. King rejected the Australian prime minister's repeated pleas for understanding and insisted on imposing punitive duties. When, later in the decade, a slump in international trade began to pinch at Canadian exports to the United States, F.L. McDougall, a close advisor to the Australian prime minister, gleefully waited for depression [...] "to drive Mackenzie King into a much more helpful attitude towards Empire economic cooperation."15 In anticipation, perhaps, Australia appointed its first trade commissioner to Canada, R.A. Haynes, in 1929.|$|R
40|$|This mini-dissertation {{critically}} analyse {{the use of}} {{anti-dumping regulations}} between South Africa, the European Union and China. South Africa, the European Union and China are {{all members of the}} World Trade Organisation. Dumping is legally defined in terms of Article VI of the General Agreements Act on Tariffs and Trade as “a product that is exported from one country to another at a price less than a price at which like goods are sold from domestic consumption in the exporting country”. The only way to protect a country from dumping is to use their universal, legal instruments set out by the World Trade Organisation, namely the most commonly used trade remedy, anti-dumping, countervailing and subsidies and lastly safeguards. On the 14 th of November 2003, South Africa promulgated their anti-dumping regulations that had a broader overview regarding dumping than the previous legislation on this matter. Although there had been several opportunities to properly legislate anti-dumping substance and procedures, the existing South African legislation including the International Administration Act, still does not conform to the requirements and standards of the World Trade Organisation. In the early 20 th Century, a number of European countries came together and formulated an Anti-dumping Agreement and was also known as the European Union. The European Union is seen as one of the biggest trade actors in the world. In 1994 the European anti-dumping laws were laid down. Regarding to non-market economies, the European legislation did not have a lot of change during the last decade. The European Union conforms to the requirements and standards set out by the World Trade Organisation. On 25 March 1997 the state council of the People’s Republic of China promulgated anti-dumping and countervailing regulations. At this point in time, China is undergoing an economic transformation, but before China plays an important part in the World Trade Organisation, it must learn to use the World Trade Organisation and integrate the World Trade Organisation laws that are directly related to China by looking at the international trade’s advantages and disadvantages. China is under severe dumping and anti-dumping status quo, which is directly paired with the development of China's <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation</b> where new demands are being brought forward. South Africa’s relationship regarding China, lead to a Memorandum of Understanding in December 1999 where the regional trade protocol was signed between the two countries in terms of textiles, that South Africa won’t impose any duties against China until December 2013, but antidumping duties can be imposed on any other country. South Africa and the European Union have not yet created such a relationship of that between South Africa and China, but South Africa and the European Union, both signed the Trade Development and Co-operation Agreement. This was the first bi-lateral framework agreement between South Africa and the European Union. The final ratification occurred in 2004 and was revised in March 2007. The international trade war against China and the European Union has been won by China, because the WTO recently {{came to the conclusion that}} the European Union’s trade policies against China were discriminatory. It should be mentioned that these three countries will play an important role in the development and implementation of international trade relations and regulations and by their collusion, it could only improve the visions of international trade.

40|$|Thesis (PhD. (Law) North-Wets University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues of}} anti-dumping law and practice from a critical and juridical analysis position. In particular, the thesis seeks {{to determine whether}} the South African anti-dumping regime is compliant with the anti-dumping regime of the World Trade Organization (hereafter WTO), and to consider possible solutions for addressing instances where the South African law is not WTO compatible. The thesis departs from the hypothesis that the WTO merely requires functional equivalence of the implementation of national <b>legislation</b> on <b>anti-dumping,</b> and not the verbatim adoption of WTO jurisprudence and relevant provisions of the Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994 (hereafter URAA), into the legislation of State Parties. Some of the provisions of the URAA are not completely clear, and are cast in convoluted and complicated technical jargon, leaving loopholes that may be justifiably exploited by State Parties. The study in this thesis was achieved through the critical analysis of legislation and relevant legal documents, case law and contemporary literature. The primary research paradigm used in this study is interpretive and analytical, which is the same as qualitative research methodology. The legal comparative research method, with a historical component, also {{played an important role in}} this study. The literature study undertaken and the critical analyses made of the South African anti-dumping regime show mixed findings. The South African antidumping regime was found to have both positive aspects and problematic aspects when compared with WTO regulations. Some of the critical areas of the South African anti-dumping regime are WTO compatible whilst others are not. In some areas the South African anti-dumping regime has adopted functionally equivalent provisions to the provisions of the WTO law. However, the practice of the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) is sometimes fraught with inconsistencies. The compatibility of the South African anti-dumping system with the WTO regime came close to being examined by the WTO on 1 April 1999 in the dispute of South Africa - Anti-dumping Duties on the Import of Certain Pharmaceutical Products from India based on allegations that the method for calculating normal value used by the ITAC was found to be inconsistent with the URAA. Similarly, the conformity of the procedures and findings of the International Trade and Administration Act (ITAA) in anti-dumping cases came under attack in the cases of Algorax v The International Trade Administration Commission and others, and Scaw v The International Trade Administration Commission and others, respectively. Finally, the thesis ends with recommendations in response to the challenges identified and key submissions made throughout the analysis. Key recommendations include the broadening of the concept of interested parties to include registered trade unions and trade union federations; introducing an explicit and mandatory "public Interests" provision to ensure that South Africa's anti-dumping administration is free from political trappings in the form of the involvement of the Minister of Trade and Industry; introducing the new section 31 bis of the ADR in order to allow the initiation of anti-dumping petitions by a registered trade union or trade union federation; providing procedural guidelines for self-initiation of anti-dumping petitions by the ITAC; increasing transparency in anti-dumping proceedings and enquires; setting realistic time-lines for all anti-dumping processes and ensuring compliance with the same; improving the institutional and functional capacity of the ITAC; amending section 18. 3 of the ADR to allow search and seizure operations pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 and the Customs Act; having a clear provision on verification visits confidentiality and a clear provision on producer knowledge; introducing a clear provision in the ADR dealing explicitly with zeroing pursuant to Article 2. 4. 3 (ii) of URAA; and the introduction of duty refund procedures. It is hoped that the recommendations made in this thesis, which are in the form of suggested legislative interventions required to upgrade certain areas of South African anti-dumping law and practice to be fully WTO compliant, will influence the introduction of suitably crafted <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation</b> in South Africa. It is further hoped that the thesis will become an invaluable source of information for practitioners and students, and a critical source on the best practice for the imposition and implementation of anti-dumping measures. Moreover, the thesis will add to the body of academic writing on South African anti-dumping law. Doctora...|$|R

Over the past decade, 2, 500 anti-dumping actions and almost 300 countervailing duty actions have been initiated and notified to the GATT/WTO. The strengthening of the multilateral disciplines on afeguards — including the prohibition and elimination of voluntary export restraints and he commitments to phase out the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) — appears to have provoked an increasing resort to anti-dumping measures. C rtain countries and product sectors, such as teel and textiles, have been targeted more than others. At the same time, there has been an increasing resort to anti-dumping measures by non-traditional users — particularly developing countries — many of which have introduced <b>anti-dumping</b> and countervailing <b>legislation</b> since the entry into force of the WTO Agreements. Developing countries continue to be the main targets of anti-dumping measures. This has the effect of creating instability and uncertainty for their exports, which has resulted in reductions in trade volumes and market shares for their goods. The increased resort to anti-dumping measures and the rising number of disputes related to these measures, have prompted many countries, including several developing countries, to call for improvements in the application of these measures.

40|$|Includes bibliographySummary Competition {{policy has}} become an {{important}} topic {{in the context of}} the global trade and capital liberalization processes of the past decade. The average tariff rate on imports has decreased substantially and various non-tariff restrictions have been abolished. Barriers to trade erected by private parties have hardly been tackled, however, although these business practices can distort trade and investment flows and lead to conflicts between countries. Competition policy deals with anti-competitive business practices (sometimes called restrictive business practices). Competition laws were first introduced in the United States and later in European countries. Latin American countries have only recently adopted competition laws. The subject is complex and interdisciplinary. It combines the fields of international law, corporate law, industrial organization, innovation policy, transnational corporations, international trade and transport. Competition policy seeks to prevent companies from reducing the efficiency of market mechanisms. It is aimed at keeping firms from forming cartels or monopolies and from abusing a dominant market position and at ensuring that mergers and acquisitions and subjected to proper scrutiny. These practices often limit competition and take away incentives to excel, innovate, reduce prices and improve customer service. Anti-competitive practices mayalso act as trade barriers that distort trade and investment flows. They may reduce gl obal welfare and lead to conf l i ct s between countries. Hence, some sort of international agreement may be necessary to forestall or eliminate these new kinds of trade barriers. Such an agreement could, in addition, take the place of anti-dumping measures and thus avoid their detrimental effects. The United States was the first country to introduce competition policies. The European Union has a supranational system of competition policies that regulate anti-competitive practices, mergers and acquisitions having transborder effects. Competition laws in Latin American countries are relatively new, and their structure and wording resemble those of Western countries. Enforcement activity in these countries has, however, been less than energetic. There have been various unsuccessful attempts in the past to establish a multilateral agreement on competition policy. International organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have studied and discussed the topic extensively. UNCTAD has been involved in many competition policy initiatives and has assisted developing countries with the introduction of suitable legislation. In addition, UNCTAD has made available a set of non-binding multilateral rules to control restrictive practices. OECD perceives competition policies as a step towards the creation of contestable markets at the international level. It recommends that all countries adopt competition policies and establish the required enforcement agencies. The OECD countries should cooperate to restrain anti-competitive practices that have effects on more than one country. Currently, competition policies are being discussed in various international organizations. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a working group that is studying the subject, and some countries even want to establish a multilateral agreement on competition rules. Furthermore, the OECD are also studying the topic and have published several proposals. In Latin America, discussion groups are taking place on the theme. Various subregional groups, including the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), Group of Three, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) have formed working groups that are examining questions related to competition policy. The topic is also included in the preparatory work for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The United States does not support a new international agreement on competition policy. Instead, it advocates bilateral agreements whose scope would be confined to cooperation between national competition-policy enforcement agencies. Furthermore, the United States prefers to keep its domestic <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>legislation.</b> The European Union, on the other hand, is more enthusiastic about multilateral rules on competition policy. The European Union would also like other countries to make their courts accessible to foreign firms. The next step would be the adoption of common rules by all countries and international cooperation between enforcement agencies. The developing countries position on multilateral rules governing competition policy is more vague. Before Latin American countries commit themselves to international agreements on competition policy, they should carefully study the issue as it relates to their development needs. On the one hand, it is in their own interest to adopt competition policies. However, there are a number of as yet unanswered questions concerning the impact of competition policies on foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, certain modifications can be made in the legislation to address those concerns. For instance, exemptions for certain practices and sectors might be given. The authority of the enforcement agency might even be extended to such an extent that it could act as a general promoter of economic liberalization. It is sometimes argued that developing countries should adopt more lenient policies in order to build large, competitive domestic enterprises. This probably has a negative overall welfare effect, however, and should be avoided. The final point made in this study is that multilateral negotiations are more in the interest of Latin American countries than bilateral agreements with industrialized countries. This paper reviews the current debate on competition policy. It starts with an introduction to the subject, followed by a short survey of competition policy in the United States, Europe and Latin America. An overview of anti-competitive business practices is then provided. Subsequently, the paper examines the reasons for the adoption of multilateral rules on competition policy. Chapter II describes the different domestic competition policies in the United States, Europe and Latin American countries. The following chapter deals with the rationale for multilateral rules on competition policy and reviews previous attempts to establish multilateral rules, as well as the work of UNCTAD and OECD on competition policies. The current discussions at WTO are outlined in chapter IV, with emphasis on the negotiating positions of the United States, the European Union and developing countries. The paper closes with a discussion of issues that could be important to the formulation of a negotiating position for Latin American and Caribbean countries. It addresses questions such as (1) whether it is favourable or necessary for Latin American countries to adopt domestic competition laws, (2) whether these laws need a specific form (different from the laws in developed countries) to meet their development needs and (3) whether multilateral rules are in the interest of developing countries...|$|R
