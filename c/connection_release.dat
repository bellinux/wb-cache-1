40|$|We {{describe}} a new multi-robot system, named SWARM-BOTS, that exploits physical inter-connections to solve {{tasks that are}} impossible for a single robot. This is for instance the case of passing large gaps or high steps in all-terrain conditions.

This paper presents the choices made in the SWARM-BOTS project and the know-how collected until now. The requirements for autonomous operation and mobility of each robots have {{led to the development of}} a connectivity very different those found in selfrecon gurable robots. Some of the solutions employed for this problem are inspired upon physical connectivity of social insects.

40|$|Introduction The sole Transport Connection (TC) release {{facility}} {{provided by}} the current ISO/IEC Connection-Mode Transport Service [ISO 8072] is an abrupt (and thereby possibly destructive) one. At present, in the OSI Reference Model [ISO 7498], the concept of orderly (or graceful) release is introduced at the session service level. So {{it is up to}} the peer session entities to make sure that there are no more in-transit data on the TC to which is assigned the session connection that is to be gracefully released before requesting the abrupt termination of this TC. Some people even think that there is no objective reason for providing an orderly <b>connection</b> <b>release</b> in any layer except the application layer (cf. Question 6 in [ISO SD 9]). They argue that peer application entities could ensure, by way of an exchange of application protocol control information, that there are no more data in transit on the presentation connection and could then safely perform an abrupt termination o...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{performance}} evaluation of windowing mechanisms in world-wide web applications. Previously, such mechanisms have been studied by means of measurements only, however, given suitable tool support, we show that such evaluations can also be performed conveniently using infinite-state stochastic Petri nets. We briefly present this class of stochastic Petri nets {{as well as the}} approach for solving the underlying infinite-state Markov chain using matrix-geometric methods. We then present a model of the TCP slow-start congestion avoidance mechanism, subject to a (recently published) typical world-wide web workload. The model is parameterized using measurement data for a national connection and an overseas connection. Our study shows how the maximum congestion window size, the <b>connection</b> <b>release</b> timeout and the packet loss probability influence the expected number of bu#ered segments at the server, the connection setup rate and the connection time. Furthermore, the crucial effect of correctly modeling the bursty nature of the system workload is illustrated by investigating several arrival models...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{deployment of}} Internet of Things (IoT) over cellular networks, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) {{or the next}} generation 5 G, entails several challenges. For massive IoT, reducing the energy consumption on the device side becomes essential. One of the main characteristics of massive IoT is small data transmissions. To improve the support of them, the 3 GPP has included two novel optimizations in LTE: one of them based on the Control Plane (CP), {{and the other on}} the User Plane (UP). In this paper, we analyze the average energy consumption per data packet using these two optimizations compared to conventional LTE Service Request procedure. We propose an analytical model to calculate the energy consumption for each procedure based on a Markov chain. In the considered scenario, for large and small Inter-Arrival Times (IATs), the results of the three procedures are similar. While for medium IATs CP reduces the energy consumption per packet up to 87 % due to its <b>connection</b> <b>release</b> optimization...|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} of smartphones and mobile applications {{has experienced a}} considerable growth during recent years. As a consequence, efficient resource management mechanisms are required {{to cope with the}} increasing demands and user expectations. Since smartphones have only very limited energy resources, battery efficiency is one of the determining factors for a good user experience. Therefore, some smartphones tear down connections to the mobile network soon after a completed data transmission to reduce the power consumption of their transmission unit. However, frequent connection reestablishments caused by apps which send or receive small amounts of data often lead to a heavy signalling load within the mobile network. The investigation of this trade-off between energy consumption at the smartphone and the generated signalling traffic in the mobile network {{is one of the major}} contributions of this paper. We explain that this trade-off can be controlled by the <b>connection</b> <b>release</b> timeout and study the impact of this parameter for a number popular apps that cover a wide range of traffic characteristics in terms of bandwidth requirements and resultin...|$|E
40|$|Communications Networks {{consist of}} layers where each layer {{provides}} {{a service to}} the layer above. A service consists of phases {{each of which is}} a sequence of message interactions intended to achieve a specific user goal [Boyc 90]. For example, Transport Service has three phases: connection establishment, data transfer and <b>connection</b> <b>release.</b> Recent research [Dsou 95] and [Sale 96] has emphasized the need for systematic methods to build services. We propose such a method to build a Global Service FSM (Finite State Machine) from a set of Sequence Diagrams. We use these diagrams to capture a set of constraints on the service: local, end-to-end and concurrency constraints. The service synthesis method is composed of a series of algorithmic steps. The two major steps are: (i) construction of Phase Scenario Machines (PSM), (ii) coupling of PSMs at the phase boundaries. The resulting FSM, called a Global Scenario Machine (GSM), is a more precise and complete model of the global service. This thesis shows that a global service specification, the Global Scenario Machine can be semiautomatically and systematically built from a set of sequence diagrams. More work is needed on tools and verification methods to insure the completeness of this approach and its ease of use, but a realistic case study is used illustrate the feasibility of the approach...|$|E

40|$|The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an {{important}} transport layer protocol providing a reliable data transfer service to support many applications running over the Internet such as the World Wide Web. It is therefore important to define the intent of TCP. This is achieved by describing the services {{it is intended to}} provide in an abstract way, known as a service definition. Several {{attempts have been made to}} define the services provided by TCP, however, they are all inadequate in various ways. In particular, most of them follow the applications interface defined in the TCP Request for Comments (P&C 793) too closely, making them rather implementation specific. The aim of our work is to provide an appropriately abstract definition of the TCP service, following the guidance of the Open Systems Interconnection service conventions, and to make it as general and as complete as possible. We define the service in terms of a set of 15 service primitives and their sequences, for TCP's main features of connection establishment, data transfer, urgent data transfer, orderly <b>connection</b> <b>release,</b> and aborting connections. The choice of primitives is discussed in terms of their relationship with the Interface Definition of RFC 793. We formalise the TCP service using Coloured Petri Nets, and from it generate the global sequences of service primitives for TCP's Connection Management ser- vices (including aborts). We believe this is the first time this has been achieved...|$|E
