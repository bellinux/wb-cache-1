40|$|Magnetite and sulfides in {{the black}} rims of {{carbonate}} globules in Martian meteorite ALH 84001 have been studied extensively because of the claim by McKay et al. that they are biogenic in origin. However, exclusively inorganic (abiotic) processes are able {{to account for the}} occurrence of carbonate-sulfide-magnetite assemblages in the meteorite. We have previously precipitated chemically zoned and sulfide-bearing carbonate globules analogous to those in ALH 84001 (at {{less than or equal to}} 150 C) from multiple fluxes of variable-composition Ca-Mg-Fe-CO 2 -S-H 2 O solutions. Brief heating of precipitated globules to approx. 470 C produced magnetite and pyrrhotite within the globules by thermal decomposition of siderite and pyrite, respectively. We have also shown that morphology of magnetite formed by inorganic thermal decomposition of Fe-rich carbonate is similar to the morphology of so-called biogenic magnetite in the carbonate globules of ALH 84001.

30|$|When crude {{glycerol}} {{was directly}} used as carbon source, the overall two-stage fermentation lasted 131  h, {{in which the}} anaerobic stage lasted 98  h. Under the aerobic growth stage, the untreated crude glycerol showed negative effect on cell growth, and the μmax was only 0.184 /h, which were 9.3 % and 12.8 % {{lower than that of}} using the treated crude <b>glycerol</b> and <b>pure</b> <b>glycerol,</b> respectively (Table  2). During the anaerobic stage, the utilization of the untreated crude glycerol was inhibited dramatically and only 54.2  mM glycerol was consumed; the final succinate concentration was only 50.3  mM. The yields of succinate were 0.11  mol/mol in the whole two-stage fermentation and 0.93  mol/mol in the anaerobic stage (Table  2). The specific succinate productivity dropped sharply during the anaerobic stage (data not shown). However, succinate production was significantly improved when the simply purified crude glycerol was used as carbon source. The titer of succinate achieved 566.0  mM, which was 11.2 times that produced by the cells used crude glycerol as carbon source. The specific succinate productivity was also much higher than that of using untreated crude glycerol (Table  2). Compared with the <b>pure</b> <b>glycerol,</b> the specific succinate productivity and the specific glycerol consumption rate were decreased by 27 % and 34 %, respectively. However, the final succinate concentration of the simply purified crude glycerol condition dropped slightly to 91.9 % of using the <b>pure</b> <b>glycerol,</b> which indicated that the residual impurities in the simply purified crude glycerol exhibited slight influence on succinate production. The yield of succinate changed little, somehow, even a little higher than that of using the <b>pure</b> <b>glycerol.</b> Similar finding was also reported by Zhou et al. (2014), which indicated that the yield of fumaric acid based on glycerol consumption was improved significantly on crude glycerol medium in comparison to <b>pure</b> <b>glycerol.</b> In addition, our results further indicated that the activated carbon absorption is a convenient and favourable way to reduce the inhibitory effect of the crude glycerol, and the engineered E. coli has good ability to utilize the simply purified crude glycerol for succinate production.|$|R
