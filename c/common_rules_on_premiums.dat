40|$|This paper aims {{to acquire}} {{insights}} into processes and mechanisms behind {{the development of}} policies on universal citizenship rights at higher political scales. It considers politics on national minority rights at different scales {{in the context of}} thoughts on postnationalisation and denationalisation of citizenship, which are mainly based on globalisation theories, and in the context of thoughts on shifts in the scales of state activity from a regulation theoretical perspective. The development of <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> the rights of minorities at the global and European scales is examined and confronted with policies of the individual states. From a systematic analysis of all national minorities in the European Union it appears that <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> at higher scales still allow for considerable diversity. The differences can be attributed to different characteristics of the minorities themselves {{as well as of the}} states concerned. Both reflect the vital legacy of strongly different historical paths of nation-state formation in different parts of Europe. The outcomes are better fitting in a regulation theoretical perspective than in a globalisation theoretical perspective on the development of <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> minority rights in Europe. ...|$|R

50|$|The Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004 is a {{regulation}} in EU law establishing <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> compensation and assistance to passengers {{in the event}} of denied boarding, flight cancellations, or long delays of flights. It requires compensation of €250 to €600 depending on the flight distance for delays over 4 hours, cancellations, or being denied boarding from overbooking. Shorter delays mean a percentage of the full compensation. Airlines must provide refreshments and accommodation where appropriate. The Court of Justice of the European Union has interpreted passenger rights strictly, so that there are virtually no exceptions for airlines to evade their obligations for breach of contract.|$|R
2500|$|The union, {{represented}} by Arthur, {{applied for the}} award to be declared a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> for the boot, shoe and slipper industry within New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. No employer in Tasmania had been served with the log of claims. 35 employers, {{represented by}} Starke, objected to the award being made a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> the ground that the provisions were unconstitutional. The President again stated a case for the High Court to decide the question of law. Beeby, having previously represented the union, now represented some employers who were respondents to the award, including Whybrow & Co. The respondent employers argued that the <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> was necessary for the effective settlement and prevention of dispute, This argument reflected the employer's economic interest in competition from boot manufacturers paying lower wages. The Commonwealth, represented by Duffy [...] intervened to support {{the validity of the}} Act while Victoria, represented by Irvine [...] intervened to argue the Act was invalid.|$|R

The literature indicates that industrial relations rules and rule-making processes can take {{a variety of forms}} in different systems and environments. The Irish system is characterised as one in which the actors largely established their own procedural and substantive rules through the social institution of collective bargaining, with minimal intervention {{of the state and the}} law, except for the provision by the state of a number of third party agencies. The agencies underpinned collective bargaining and assisted disputing parties in reaching mutually acceptable collective bargaining outcomes, and established a kind of voluntary law or <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> a norms and precedents basis...|$|R

50|$|White {{examined}} the <b>common</b> law <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> this matter and its rationale. At common law, {{it was perfectly}} legitimate for law enforcement personnel to kill a fleeing felon. At the time when this rule was first created, most felonies were punishable by death, {{and the difference between}} felonies and misdemeanors was relatively large. In modern American law, neither of these circumstances existed. Furthermore, the <b>common</b> law <b>rule</b> developed at a time before modern firearms, and most law enforcement officers did not carry handguns. The context in which the <b>common</b> law <b>rule</b> evolved was no longer valid. White further noted that many jurisdictions had already done away with it, and that current research has shown that the use of deadly force contributes little to the deterrence of crime or the protection of the public.|$|R
40|$|International air transport: {{enforcement}} of rights of passengers under Regulation (ES) No. 261 / 2004 {{in the light of}} judgments of the European court of Justice The subject of this thesis is the {{enforcement of}} the rights of passengers under the Regulation (EC) No 261 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. The thesis is divided into five chapters. In the first chapter the particular conventions which have been concluded {{in the area of the}} international air transportation and which have influenced this area greatly are covered, in particular the Warsaw and Montreal Conventions. The second chapter focuses on the Regulation 261 / 2004 itself. Particular situations which establish the right for compensation to the passengers are described and analyzed. The issue of the definition of the term "extraordinary circumstances" has not been omitted either. The provisions of the Regulation 261 / 2004 are interpreted in the light of the SDEU judiciary. The conclusion of the second chapter consists of the future view and the view on the Regulation 261 / 2004 de lege ferenda. The third chapter follows the substantive regulation by its [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades {{improvements}} have been achieved in industry regarding several major polluting substances and gradually the environmental impact has shifted towards the so-called diffuse sources of pollution. Nevertheless, industrial processes still account for a considerable share of the overall pollution in Europe {{and it is very}} important to further reduce their contribution to 'unsustainability'. The European Union (EU) has a set of <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> permitting of industrial installations. These rules are set out in the so-called Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive of 1996 (IPPC). Cyprus is one of the accession countries to become a full member of the EU and is currently in the implementation process, in order to fulfill all the obligations that apply to the 15 Member States. A large number of these obligations derive from the IPPC Directive, which aims at the protection of the environment as a whole and the public health as well. In this framework, the National Technical University of Athens, after thorough examination of a large number of documents relevant to the Best Available Technologies, developed guidelines for the application of BATs for 14 categories of the industry of Cyprus. This paper concerns the developed guidelines for foundries. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

3000|$|The European Union, {{from its}} {{creation}} as the, {{has had a}} strong tradition of market intervention. In the arena of transport it has previously used directives, which have force of law in all member states, to define air passenger rights in the Passengers Charter for Air Travel: “establishing <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> compensation and assistance to passengers {{in the event of}} denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights” [17]. In the area of rail freight, the EU began a process towards mandatory quality standards, such as the UIC -Freight Department [37]) authored: “Guide: Quality of rail freight transport”. Also, the European Commission proposal for a regulation of compensation, in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail freight services, eventually led, in 2003, to the industry-led UIC/CER/CIT Freight Quality Charter [9]. Notably, in the latter case, the leading rail client organisation, the International Union of combined Road-Rail transport companies (UIRR), began as supportive of market intervention, but moved to a more liberal position as time progressed. Similarly, the European Commission, transitioning from an interventionist stance, in the 2001 White Paper on Transport [16], to the more laissez-faire approach of the 2006 mid term review [15], looked to researchers to answer the question: “To what extent are specialised, international standards useful for the quality performance of freight logistics in Europe?” [...]...|$|R
40|$|Police and Customs Cooperation Centres (PCCCs) {{have been}} {{established}} throughout the Schengen area as an important institution reinforcing mechanisms and procedures of cross-border law enforcement cooperation. Since the first PCCC became operational in Offenburg in 1999, about 40 centres have emerged, performing various functions and tasks {{in the area of}} internal security and law enforcement and constituting a valuable local tool of direct cross-border cooperation. In the reflection period preceding the 2009 Stockholm Programme, the so-called Future Group (High Level Advisory Group on EU Internal Security) suggested that the EU should establish a model of PCCC applicable to all member states and serving as "real police-customs centres of crisis management capable of handling events on an international scale. " This chapter seeks to verify the above proposal and to reflect further on the importance of PCCCs for internal security of the EU and for cross-border cooperation in the Schengen zone. Several PCCCs will be analysed in order to extract similarities and differences as functional and institutional prerequisites for the elaboration of a framework PCCC. The evaluation of the role that PCCCs perform in everyday cross-border police cooperation will be juxtaposed with new instruments of Schengen governance, adopted in October 2013, particularly new provisions <b>on</b> <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders...|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} evolution of trade relations between Poland and the European Union {{has been a}} step-by-step transition from a stage of non-agreement type trade regime of the years 1975 - 1989 through the phase {{of the first generation}} Free Trade Agreement of 1989 up to the second generation association agreement signed in the form of Europe Agreement in 1991 (Zielinska-Glebocka, 1991). Given the absence of both a multilateral agreement between the EC and the CMEA, and a bilateral agreement between the EC and Poland, the Community introduced an autonomous import regime in 1975. This regime transferred full competence from the national governments to the Commission. An autonomous import regime applied to state-trading countries imposed a certain type of trade discrimination in a form of specific quantitative restrictions and <b>common</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> imports. This regime, combined with the central organization of the foreign system in Poland characterized by the state monopoly of foreign trade and foreign exchange, proved an entirely restrictive economic environment. The introduction of the political and economic reform in Poland in 1989 has opened up room {{for the establishment of a}} formalized trade regime with the European Community. In 1989, the EC decided to abandon its autonomous import regime and to get involved in the programme of coordinated aid for Central and Eastern Europe (PHARE).
