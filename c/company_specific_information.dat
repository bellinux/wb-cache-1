30|$|The main {{research}} {{question is how}} higher reporting frequency impacts information asymmetry and the resulting processing of such information by investors through their trading activities. Stock price reflects long-term fundamental values if there are more <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> available, {{but it could also}} reflect short-term growth momentum if there are higher growth prospects due to recent growth trend. In China, retail investors are primarily momentum oriented. However, given that information asymmetry is not readily measureable, among the well-established information asymmetry measurements in past academic studies, bid-ask spreads, illiquidity and stock price volatility are finally selected after examining the possible ones available.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} finance papers {{have shown that}} the {{downward}} sloping demand curve for equity exists. Many of these previous studies have come to their conclusion via one of two ways. The first method looks at new equity offerings by companies and their affect on stock returns due to increase in supply. The second looks at company inclusion into the S&P 500 Composite Index and its effect on company returns due to increase in demand from index mutual funds. In both cases there has been evidence of the downward sloping demand curve but skeptics still persist due to the inability of these techniques to eliminate <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information.</b> The use of creations and redemptions of IPUs in the verification of the downward sloping demand curve has the benefit of being free of company specific pressures since they are stand alone equity products. Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts (SPDRs) are the IPU under study in this paper. Through the use of standard event studies we have found that with larger or infrequent creations and redemptions there exists support for the downward sloping demand curve exists. More specifically, with creations we observe negative abnormal returns and with redemptions we observe the reverse. When new creations and redemptions in SPDR units take place, a demand and supply shift occurs in the market due to purchases and sales of S&P 500 portfolio baskets. We found strong evidence that redemptions of SPDRs affects the returns of the underlying stocks of the S&P 500. The negative significance would imply that redeeming parties are not liquidating the equity basket upon receipt. When we eliminate <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> results persist in large redemption...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{coordinate}} and deliver {{information in the}} right time and to the right place, theories from multi-agent systems and information logistics are combined. We use agents to support supply chain by searching for <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information.</b> Hence, there are a vast number of agents working at the Internet, simultaneously, which requires supervising agents. In this paper, we suggest using meta-agents to control the behaviour of a number of intelligent agents, where the meta-agents are working with coordination of the communication that takes place in a supply chain system. As an example, we look at a manufacturing company receiving orders on items from customers, which need to be produced. The handling of this distributed information flow {{can be thought of as}} an Information Logistics Processes and the similarities of the functioning of processes and intelligent agents ’ behaviour are illuminated...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the wealth effect of the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) {{regulation}} on the U. S. commercial banking industry. The RBC plan was first proposed in January 1986, and its final form was announced on July 11, 1988. This plan resulted from dissatisfaction with the old capital regulation, which did not account for asset risk and off-balance sheet activities. The present study hypothesizes that the new regulation restricted bank optimal behavior and, therefore, adversely affected stock prices. The second and third hypotheses suggest that investors used <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information,</b> Net Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios respectively, in valuing stocks of the affected bank holding companies. Hypotheses four and five suggest that abnormal returns are proportionally related to the levels of Net Tier 1 or Total RBC ratio.

The purpose of this research is to scan PRESSAC’s internal and external environment in order to develop a better understanding of where PRESSAC stands, and attempt to identify opportunities PRESSAC can benefit from. The second major aspect of this research is to understand the positive role that business-to-business (B 2 B) branding and B 2 B relationship marketing can play for PRESSAC. The literature acknowledges the need for B 2 B organizations to have robust and coherent brands if they are to operate successfully.

40|$|The {{marketing}} discipline’s {{knowledge about}} the drivers of service customers’ repeat purchase behavior is highly fragmented. This research attempts to overcome that fragmented state of knowledge by making major advances toward a theory of repeat purchase drivers for consumer services. Drawing on means–end theory, the authors develop a hierarchical classification scheme that organizes repeat purchase drivers into an integrative and comprehensive framework. They then identify drivers {{on the basis of}} 188 face-to-face laddering interviews in two countries (USA and Germany) and assess the drivers’ importance and interrelations through a national probability sample survey of 618 service customers. In addition to presenting an exhaustive and coherent set of hierarchical repeat-purchase drivers, the authors provide theoretical explanations for how and why drivers relate to one another and to repeat purchase behavior. This research also tests the boundary conditions of the proposed framework by accounting for different service types. In addition to its theoretical contribution, the framework provides <b>companies</b> with <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> about how to manage long-term customer relationships successfully...|$|R
40|$|Several papers {{document}} idiosyncratic volatility is time-varying {{and many}} {{attempts have been}} made to reveal whether idiosyncratic risk is priced. This research studies behavior of idiosyncratic volatility around information release dates and also its relation with return after public announcement. The results indicate that when a <b>company</b> discloses <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> to the market, firm’s specific volatility level shifts and short-horizon event-induced volatility vary significantly however, the category to which the announcement belongs is not important in magnitude of change. This event-induced volatility is not small in size and should not be downplayed in event studies. Moreover, this study shows stocks with higher contemporaneous realized idiosyncratic volatility earn lower return after public announcement consistent with “divergence of opinion hypothesis”. While no significant relation is found between EGARCH estimated idiosyncratic volatility and return and also between one-month lagged idiosyncratic volatility and return presumably due to significant jump around public announcement both may provide some signals regarding future idiosyncratic volatility through their correlations with contemporaneous realized idiosyncratic volatility. Finally, the study show that positive relation between return and idiosyncratic volatility based on under-diversification is inadequate to explain all different scenarios and this negative relation after public announcement may provide a useful trading rule...|$|R
40|$|Rationale - Increasing world {{population}} and consumption, and rising dependency on certain countries for {{the supply of}} raw materials lead to the demand for new raw material resources. This demand, combined {{with the increase in}} complexity of new land-based mining operations increases the chances for a viable offshore mining business case. Goal and scope - The aim of this research is twofold. The first aim is to fill knowledge gaps in the offshore mining value chain, with a focus on the processing of the mined material. The second goal is to assess if shallow water offshore mining is a viable business option. Explicitly left out of scope are the exploration for mineral deposits as well as the detailed or new design of an extraction method for subsea minerals. Furthermore, resources beyond the continental plate are not part of this research. Approach - To answer the first goal of this research, an extensive literature study is performed comprising an assessment of potential offshore mineable minerals and their respective markets. It also included an analysis of current land-based mineral processing techniques and its limitations in an offshore environment. Furthermore environmental, legislative and tax aspects were included as well as detailed descriptions of future offshore mining projects, and current dredge mining projects. To assess the viability of an offshore mining project, a case study is set-up of a prospective offshore mining project. A method for executing the case study is developed. Results of the case study - For the case study the mineral deposit has been studied and based on its mineral characteristics a location specific processing flow sheet is developed. The case study resulted in a set of execution alternatives, from which a preferred option was selected. Based on this option the viability of the project is assessed {{with the use of a}} discounted cash flow method (DCF-method). Conclusions - Main knowledge gaps are identified as the impact on the environment, and the lack of legislation regarding offshore mining. Furthermore, it should be noted, that the public opinion regarding offshore mining is important to consider as well. This project was done in cooperation with Van Oord Dredging and Marine contractors, therefore any <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> is not taken into account in this public report...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} Dissertation has the aim {{of giving}} a proper insight into business valuation theory. The work consists on valuing Altri, a specialized pulp producing company listed on the Euronext Lisbon stock exchange. I end up with an analysis and comparison between my own valuation results and an independent valuation, made by the Millennium BCP Investment Bank. Both valuations target a stock price for YE 2010, both {{taking into account the}} published information until the company‟s 2 nd quarter (2010) results release. The work proposed above was structured in the following way: Literature review - This section consists on a review of the existent valuation theories and respective methodologies, grasping, at the same time, the different views observed between academics and finance practitioners. My intention was to broaden the review long enough to discuss some basic valuation concepts, while also narrowing it down just enough to focus on the most important subjects for my valuation case. I have assumed that the subjects and concepts approached in this review are well known for a reader familiar with financial theory. Therefore, I will not proceed to unnecessary finance demonstrations, transcription of known valuation formulas or other previous concepts that originate the issues that are discussed. Industry and company analysis - As an introduction to the valuation itself, I present the current industry scenario and <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information,</b> critical not only to the valuation itself, but also to a proper understanding of the Company‟s business, as it is. Company valuation - This section intended to show the results derived from my valuation. I try to detail, as much as possible, how the valuation model was built and how the required business assumptions were supported. This includes both the cash-flows projections and used discount rates, taking also into account that, as one may see later on, two different businesses and two DCF valuation methodologies were applied. I have also decided to complement the valuation with a dedicated part to sensitivity analysis. Valuation through the use of multiples - This methodology was introduced not in order to substitute the previous DCF methodologies but rather to complement them, establishing a set of price targets, dependent upon the multiples and peer group chosen. Investment Banking valuation analysis and comparison – On this section, the final valuation results were compared against an equity research report made by Millennium BCP Investment Bank. This comparison intends to expose the differences resultant from the use of different valuation methods and assumptions made by the investment bank‟s analyst and me. I intend therefore to make a critical appraisal over the analyst‟s valuation assumptions...|$|E
40|$|I. This study {{examines}} the value to financial analysts and investors generally in the UK of firms' accounting disclosures {{and other information}} contained in the annual report and accounts for share valuation purposes. 2. Using daily share price data and a large sample of actively traded UK firms the relative information content of four major information releases, the preliminary announcement, annual report and accounts, annual general meeting and the interim report, are examined. Three different models are employed, two of which involved the calculation of the market risk measure; the firm's beta. To increase comparability with previous studies, some of the tests were replicated using weekly data. 3. Previous studies have shown a bias when calculating abnormal returns due to the size composition of the sample. Re-estimating the parameters using Ordinary Least Squares but including a size variable, showed virtually {{no effect on the}} magnitude of the estimated parameters. Neither the constant `alpha' nor the coefficient 11 of the size variable were statistically significant. The former is consistent with prior research. 4. Infrequency of trading is largely associated with small companies and gives rise to a downward bias when estimating betas. Although the sample comprised actively traded mainly large companies, the betas were re-estimated using a method which takes into account thin trading. The results indicated that parameter estimates have to take into consideration thin trading even when using predominantly large actively traded stocks. The degree of stability in the betas over successive periods was low though the difference in the average betas of the two periods was negligible. The pooled betas were therefore used. 5. The initial test was to ascertain the extent of the information content of the four events. The three different model formulations employed produced almost identical results suggesting a naive model with beta= 1 may well be adequate in many such event study situations. Therefore, all further tests were conducted using only the market model with adjusted betas. Of the four events, the preliminary announcement and interim report, largely representing earnings and dividends announcements, had the highest information content, whilst little information in aggregate is conveyed to the market by the annual general meeting and the annual report and accounts. Similar results were produced using a different information measure and weekly data. No unusual share price activity was observed prior to 111 the event day or after event day plus one, which is consistent with the semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. 6. Evidence was found in tests of the market's reaction to `good' and `bad' news that, on average, they are given equal value except for the interim report where there is a sharper reaction to `bad' news. 7. This study supports previous research showing an inverse relationship between company size and the abnormal return on an event day. When variance of returns is included in the regression, the size coefficient albeit statistically significant becomes negligible in magnitude which suggests, like prior work, that size is probable a surrogate for absent firm specific variables. 8. Using a control group of companies with low annual report and accounts abnormal returns but otherwise matching a sample of outlier companies with high annual report and accounts residuals, an analysis was made of both groups. Little difference was noted in the amount of statutory or voluntary information disclosed in the preliminary announcements of the groups. There was, however, significant evidence of greater price-sensitive information being provided in the annual reports and accounts of the outlier group. 9. There was little evidence to suggest that one group was more closely followed by analysts than the other. Capital gearing and income cover were, on average, little different. Apparently what was driving the returns of the outlier sample was <b>company</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information.</b> The information seemed to be largely contained in two sections of the annual report, the balance sheet and the chairman's statement, which previous studies have shown to be valued by users. 10. Tests of association between information content of the events produced conflicting results but analysis of the press comments seemed to furnish some evidence of an informational relationship between the preliminary announcement and the annual report and accounts of the outlier group not observed in the control group. Press comments on the annual reports of the outlier group bear some relationship to the press comments on their preliminary announcements. 11. No previous study has directly examined the informational value of the annual report and accounts for individual firms and used analysis of press comments to identify those parts of the annual report which seem to have information content. The value of this study lies in the new evidence that it provides suggesting the annual report and accounts does have some information value for the stockmarket for particular firms and in identifying those parts of the annual report found useful by investors. 12. The implications of this study are that whilst, in aggregate, {{there seems to be an}} apparent lack of incremental information in the annual report and accounts,this is not a true reflection of its value to all market participants. Unless the stockmarket has access to this financial statement potential adverse valuation consequences may be missed. This study suggests summary accounts are unsuitable for active stockmarket participants...|$|E
40|$|Background and Discussion: The {{adoption}} of the IFRS by Swedish companies was an arduous task which required {{a lot of resources}} and time. The regulations that the IFRS contain are more complex and require more extensive disclosures than Swedish companies are used to. It can be a difficult task for companies to comply with IAS 36 disclosure requirements {{and at the same time}} not to disclose too much of a <b>company’s</b> <b>specific</b> <b>information.</b> The importance of disclosure should not be underestimated, as more disclosures lead to lower cost of capital. Recent studies show that disclosures about goodwill impairment testing provided by companies are too general and not sufficient to enable users of financial statements to assess the reliability of goodwill impairment testing. Research Question: The research question of this thesis is to what extent company characteristics may explain the degree of compliance with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. In order to measure the degree of compliance, the examination of goodwill impairment accounting practices has been conducted. Methodology: The research question has been addressed using an empirical approach with an emphasis on note-form disclosures in the 2011 and 2011 / 2012 consolidated financial statements of Swedish firms listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. This study has examined relationships between company-specific, institutional and goodwill-related company characteristics and degree of compliance with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36 with the help of multiple regression analysis. The degree of compliance in this study is measured by a self-constructed index. Results and conclusions: The study has shown that a combination of examined company characteristics explain only about 9 % of the degree of compliance with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. Regarding company-specific characteristics, this study has indicated that company size has a significant impact of the degree of compliance with disclosure requirements as larger companies seem to have a higher degree of compliance. No significant relationships between company performance and degree of compliance as well as between financial needs and degree of compliance have been found in this study. The study has further indicated that degree of compliance with disclosure requirements regarding goodwill impairment tests varies across industries and auditor firms. Finally, the results of this study show that goodwill-related characteristics do not seem to have a significant impact on the degree of compliance with disclosure requirements, as no significant relationships between the degree of compliance and the amount of goodwill on the balance sheet of the company and the degree of compliance and the goodwill impairment rate were found...|$|R
30|$|One {{consequence}} of measures taken to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is that more electric vehicles (EVs) are appearing on the roads. Oslo, Norway, for example, has encountered a huge increase in such vehicles in recent years [1]. This increase will bring accidents differing from those involving conventional combustion engines, and news coverage has reported on fires in EVs. There {{is a need for}} information about how to handle such new technology in case of accidents. This involves the community more than the individual vehicle users [2]. In today’s complex technical society, Rasmussen [3] describes the difficulty of handling risks when many stakeholders are involved in socio-technical systems.

Important questions for society include facilitating adaption and taking responsibility for risk evaluation and information dissemination about the safe handling of EVs.

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{contribute}} to the research stream of organizational buying behavior by examining the impact of the economic situation on organizational buying. It aims to discover whether purchasing managers changed their behavior during the economic boom in 2007 and the subsequent crisis of 2008. On the basis of 84 interviews in the business-to-business field, the perceived risks and countermeasures revealed by purchasers in these exceptional economic circumstances were investigated. The empirical findings suggest that economic circumstances influence altered risk perception and also the type of risk which is perceived. The further research results indicate that purchasers adapt their countermeasures according to the types of risks they perceive. For instance, many purchasers still pursue a co-operative policy during times of economic boom but only change to aggressive buying behavior when recession afflicts business. Moreover, their openness and search for new suppliers are more important during economic booms. Based on the examined types of perceived risk, sales and marketing managers of B-to-B <b>companies</b> could provide <b>specific</b> <b>information,</b> support and argumentation to purchasing managers in different economic situations, e. g. support them in internal marketing activities during an economic boom or provide them data about internal production planning as well as non-confidential cost analysis.
