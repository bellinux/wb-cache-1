5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{led to a}} faster identification, as well as techniques which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> reduced its impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> prevented Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite {{could serve as a}} base for all TLS implementations.|$|E
5|$|It was as yet {{too early}} to assume 'night {{cruising}} order.' The enemy <b>could</b> <b>have</b> compelled us to fight before dark, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> prevented our exercising our initiative, and finally he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> cut off our return to the German Bight. There {{was only one way}} of avoiding this: to inflict a second blow on the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost...It also offered the possibility of a last attempt being made to bring help to the hard-pressed , or at least of rescuing her ship's company.|$|E
5|$|A combativity {{award was}} also {{attributed}} for the rider who had ridden the most aggressively {{in the eyes}} of the judges at the end of every stage. It <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a rider who featured in breakaways or a cyclist who attacked often.|$|E

5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E

5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill <b>could</b> <b>have</b> used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird <b>could</b> <b>have</b> crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E

5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God <b>could</b> <b>have</b> created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people <b>could</b> <b>have</b> chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001 Marc Terenzi met German pop star Sarah Connor at a music festival. The two soon hit it off and were dating despite Lou Pearlman's wishes.
