5000|$|A <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> {{is used to}} {{mark the}} center of a point. It is usually used to mark {{the center of a}} hole when {{drilling}} holes. A drill has the tendency to [...] "wander" [...] if it does not start in a recess. A <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> forms a large enough dimple to [...] "guide" [...] the tip of the drill. The tip of a <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> has an angle between 60 and 90 degrees. When drilling larger holes, and the web of the drill is wider than the indentation produced by a <b>center</b> <b>punch,</b> the drilling of a pilot hole is usually needed.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1006 pistol was introduced, Smith and Wesson issued a recall on the {{one-piece}} plastic grip. It seems when the pistol was dropped on its heel, the plastic grip could break, allowing the hammer spring to fly free. Customers who contacted Smith and Wesson were sent new grips at no charge. Smith and Wesson {{did not ask}} for the bad grips to be sent back and these suspect grips are still showing up at gun shows to this day. The new replacement grip has a <b>center</b> <b>punched</b> mark {{on the bottom of the}} heel, whereas the bad grips did not.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} designs for {{automatic}} <b>center</b> <b>punches</b> {{have been developed}} since the late 19th century as improvements over punches requiring {{the use of a}} striking tool. The earliest types were not fully automatic, using a captive weight lifted by the user or a spring and weight drawn by the user to provide the striking impulse. A number of patents have been issued for these designs, and they continue to be referenced in patents into the 21st century. There are also a number of examples of hammer and punch combinations intended for one-handed use, but being modeled upon a conventional hammer striking a separate punch tool.|$|R

50|$|An {{automatic}} <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> is a {{hand tool}} {{used to produce}} a dimple in a workpiece (for example, a piece of metal). It performs the same function as an ordinary <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> but {{without the need for}} a hammer. When pressed against the workpiece, it stores energy in a spring, eventually releasing it as an impulse that drives the punch, producing the dimple. The impulse provided to the point of the punch is quite repeatable, allowing for uniform impressions to be made.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} US patents for {{the modern}} automatic <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> were filed during 1904 by Hartley and Stryhal for designs using a leaf spring catch to release the hammer, both assigned to Brown and Sharpe. In 1905, Seitz patented a manually triggered punch that has many of the internal structural elements of some later fully automatic models, and Spalding was granted a patent in 1908 on an application filed in 1904 for a different design of leaf spring controlled fully automatic punch that included easy adjustment of blow as well as interchangeable, threaded on points.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is built}} of welded steel tube and is fabric covered. The wings consist of two solid spruce spars, built up wooden ribs, compression struts and internal bracing. The Parasol's empennage is built of wood, the tailplane being externally braced. Two five gallon fuel tanks are {{installed at the}} root end of each wing, the fuel being gravity fed. The only tools necessary to assemble one of the Parasol kits were a pair of small pliers, screwdriver, hacksaw (with plenty of blades), hammer, small hand drill, chisel, <b>center</b> <b>punch,</b> file and drill.|$|E
50|$|Heating in {{just one}} area, like the flat end of a <b>center</b> <b>punch,</b> will cause the grade to spread evenly {{down the length of}} the tool. Because having a {{continuous}} grade along the length of the entire tool is not always desired, methods of concentrating the change have been devised. A tool like a chisel may be heated quickly but evenly along the entire shaft, tempering it to a purple or blue color, but allowing the residual heat to quickly conduct a short distance to the edge. Another method is to hold the edge in water, keeping it cool as the rest of the tool is tempered. When the proper color is reached, the edge is removed from the water and allowed to temper from the residual heat, and the entire tool is plunged in the water when the edge turns the proper color. However, heating in localized areas with such low temperatures may be difficult with larger items, like an axe or a splitting maul, because the steel may lose too much heat before it can conduct to the edge. Sometimes the steel is heated evenly to just below the desired temperature, and then differentially tempered, making it easier to control the temperature change. Another way is to partially embed the steel in an insulator, like sand or lime, preventing too much heat loss during tempering.|$|E
5000|$|Joe meets Rikiishi in the {{juvenile}} detention center. He was a boxer but was sentenced to {{the juvenile}} detention <b>center</b> because he <b>punches</b> an audience member half to death after the audience member says that the match was rigged in Rikiishi's favor, enraging him. Joe challenges Rikiishi without knowing he was once a professional boxer and manages to punch {{him in the face}} once before Rikiishi knocks him out in one punch. He is quintessential in motivating Joe to start taking boxing seriously, even if his only reason is to beat Rikiishi in a rematch.|$|R
50|$|The Adell and Starrett {{mechanism}} uses {{a sliding}} block crosswise through the hammer {{rather than an}} intermediate pin. The hammer has a hole through its center that {{the top of the}} punch sits in, and holds the top of the <b>punch</b> <b>centered.</b> The sliding block has a hole through it that, when reset, is misaligned with the hole through the hammer. When the body is pressed to the trip point, a taper in the body forces the block sideways until the hole in the block is aligned with the hole through the hammer, and the hammer is released to strike the punch.|$|R

30|$|Ankylos® {{implants}} were {{inserted in}} the other tibia/femur head of the animals according to the manufacturer’s protocol as follows: After mobilizing the subperiosteal flap and using a 3 -mm <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> to register a guiding point for the osteotomy, a twist drill, depth drill series and a conical reamer were used sequentially to complete the osteotomy {{and to develop a}} conical shape for accomodation of the implant’s body. A counterclockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in case of soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used to create the threads in dense bones. Following, the implant assembly was aseptically transferred to the osteotomy site, and the implant placement was started manually and finalized using a hand ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was irrigated, and the depth was checked by retapping.|$|E
30|$|Equal {{number of}} {{comparator}} implants (size 3.5  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm) were {{inserted in the}} other tibia/femur head of the animals after doing the osteotomy according to the manufacturer’s protocol as follows. After mobilizing the mucoperiosteal flap, the 3 -mm <b>center</b> <b>punch</b> was used to register a guide for the twist drill. The twist drill was used to establish the axial alignment of the implant and {{to assist in the}} guidance of the depth drill. The depth drills were sequentially used to create osteotomy to the subcrestal axial depth of 0.5  mm. The conical reamer was used to develop the conical shape of the implant body and to check the osteotomy depth. A counter-clockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used for dense bone to create the threads in the osteotomy. The thread cutter’s diameter corresponds to the implant diameter. To engage the implant into the implant placement tool, the square faces on the implant fixture mount were aligned with those on the implant placement tool, then pushed together. Using the handle (finger wheel), the implant was pulled out of inner vial and the plastic collar was discarded. The implant placement assembly was transferred to the osteotomy and the implant was secured into the osteotomy site. The implant placement was started with the handle and finally placed using the hand-ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was rinsed out and the depth was checked by retapping. To disengage fixture mount from implant, the open-ended spanner was used to break the retention force of the fixture mount retention screw. The knurled top of the implant placement tool was turned by hand to fully disengage the fixture mount with the implant. Pushing down on the knurled top of the implant placement tool disengaged the fixture mount.|$|E
5000|$|Ruth's {{second home}} run in game 3 {{probably}} would have been merely an exclamation point for the 1932 World Series and for Ruth's career, {{had it not been for}} reporter Joe Williams. Williams was a respected but opinionated sports editor for the Scripps-Howard newspapers. In a late edition the same day of the game, Williams wrote this headline that appeared in the New York World-Telegram, evoking billiards terminology: [...] "RUTH CALLS SHOT AS HE PUTS HOME RUN NO. 2 IN SIDE POCKET." [...] Williams' summary of the story included, [...] "In the fifth, with the Cubs riding him unmercifully from the bench, Ruth pointed to <b>center</b> and <b>punched</b> a screaming liner to a spot where no ball had been hit before." [...] Apparently Williams' article was the only one written the day of the game that made a reference to Ruth pointing to center field. It was probably due to the wide circulation of the Scripps-Howard newspapers that gave the story life, as many read Williams' article and assumed it was accurate. A couple of days later, other stories started to appear stating that Ruth had called his shot, a few even written by reporters who were not at the game.|$|R
2500|$|A {{month before}} the [...] {{training}} camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot. He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker. He {{was ready for the}} start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him. In January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He <b>punched</b> <b>center</b> Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players. O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000. For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.|$|R
40|$|Changes {{are often}} {{necessary}} during the tryout of stamping tools. These changes may range from adjustments on die and punch designs {{to the selection}} of a new material with better formability characteristics. All these actions, however, require time and money creating the need for better initial sheet metal evaluation. Hence, increasing attention has focused on the development of laboratory tests that enable stamping companies {{to know more about the}} sheet metal stampability or that can, at least in part, ensure that their stamped products are produced without major problems. Identification of high stress region on stamping may allow for better tool stamping adjustment during tests, rendering a more uniform material’s deformation and leading to the production of higher quality parts. Increasing attention has focused on the material evaluation based on the tool geometries in order to calculate the strain distribution. This study deals with an evaluation of four punch models with varied geometries in addition to the traditional Nakazima test tool. An evaluation was also made of the major true strain distribution profile at points distributed linearly from the region close to the die shoulder to the <b>punch</b> <b>center...</b>|$|R
