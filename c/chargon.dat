50|$|In {{condensed}} matter physics, {{spin-charge separation}} {{is an unusual}} behavior of electrons in some materials in which they 'split' into three independent particles, the spinon, the orbiton and the holon (or <b>chargon).</b> The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital degree of freedom and the <b>chargon</b> carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{original}} electrons {{in the system}} are fermions, one of the spinon and <b>chargon</b> {{has to be a}} fermion, and the other one has to be a boson. One is theoretically free to make the assignment in either way, and no observable quantity can depend on this choice. The formalism with bosonic <b>chargon</b> and fermionic spinon is usually referred to as the [...] "slave-fermion" [...] formalism, while the formalism with fermionic <b>chargon</b> and bosonic spinon is called the [...] "Schwinger boson" [...] formalism. Both approaches have been used for strongly correlated systems, but neither has been proved to be completely successful. One difficulty of the spin-charge separation is that while spinon and <b>chargon</b> are not gauge-invariant quantities, i.e. unphysical objects, there are no direct physical probes to observe them. Therefore more often than not one has to use thermal dynamical or macroscopic techniques to see their effects. This implies that which formalism we choose is irrelevant to real physics, so in principle both approaches should give us the same answer. The reason we obtain radically different answers from these two formalisms is probably because of the wrong mean field solution we choose, which means that we are dealing with the spin-charge separation in a wrong way.|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{separation}} of electrons into spinons and <b>chargons,</b> the spin-charge separation, plays a decisive role when describing strongly correlated density distributions in one dimension. In this manuscript, we extend the investigation by considering {{a model for the}} third electron fractionalization: the separation into spinons, <b>chargons</b> and orbitons [...] the last associated with the electronic orbital degree of freedom. Specifically, we deal with two exact constraints of exchange-correlation (XC) density-functionals: (i) The constancy of the highest occupied (HO) Kohn-Sham (KS) eigenvalues upon fractional electron numbers, and (ii) their discontinuities at integers. By means of one-dimensional (1 D) discrete Hubbard chains and 1 D Hydrogen molecules in the continuum, we find that spin-charge separation yields almost constant HO KS eigenvalues, whereas the spin-orbital counterpart can be decisive when describing derivative discontinuities of XC potentials at strong correlations...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} an insulating phase in the three-legged Hubbard ladder at two-thirds filling. In this phase <b>chargons</b> are bound because the physics within a unit cell favors the formation of triplets. The resultant moments lead to a ground state in the Haldane phase, a symmetry protected topological state of matter. In this purely fermionic model, reflection is protecting but time reversal and dihedral symmetries are not, in contrast to spin models. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

50|$|Spin-charge {{separation}} {{is one of}} the most unusual manifestations of the concept of quasiparticles. This property is counterintuitive, because neither the spinon, with zero charge and spin half, nor the <b>chargon,</b> with charge minus one and zero spin, can be constructed as combinations of the electrons, holes, phonons and photons that are the constituents of the system. It is an example of fractionalization, the phenomenon in which the quantum numbers of the quasiparticles are not multiples of those of the elementary particles, but fractions.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} the spin-charge separation mechanism to the quark-lepton unification models which consider the lepton number as the fourth color. In certain finite-density systems, quarks and leptons are decomposed into spinons and chargons, which carry the spin and charge {{degrees of freedom}} respectively. Neutrinos {{can be related to}} the spinons with respect to the electric-charge and spin separation in the early universe or other circumstances. Some effective, probably universal couplings between the spinon sector and the <b>chargon</b> sector are derived and a phenomenological description for the <b>chargon</b> condensate is proposed. It is then demonstrated that the spinon current can induce vorticity in the <b>chargon</b> condensate, and spinon zero modes are trapped in the vortices, forming spinon-vortex bound states. In cosmology this configuration may lead to the emission of extremely high energy neutrinos when vortices split and reconnect. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure.

40|$|Doping a Mott-insulating Z_ 2 spin liquid {{can lead}} to a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*). Such a phase has several {{favorable}} features that make it a candidate for the pseudogap metal for the underdoped cuprates. We focus on a particular, simple Z_ 2 -FL* state which can undergo a confinement transition to a spatially uniform superconductor which is smoothly connected to the `plain vanilla' BCS superconductor with d-wave pairing. Such a transition occurs by the condensation of bosonic particles carrying +e charge but no spin (`chargons'). We show that modifying the dispersion of the bosonic <b>chargons</b> {{can lead to}} confinement transitions with charge density waves and pair density waves at the same wave-vector K, co-existing with d-wave superconductivity. We also compute the evolution of the Hall number in the normal state during the transition from the plain vanilla FL* state to a Fermi liquid, and argue, following Coleman, Marston, and Schofield [Phys. Rev. B 72, 245111 (2005) ], that it exhibits a discontinuous jump near optimal doping. We note the distinction between these results and those obtained from models of the pseudogap with fermionic <b>chargons.</b> Comment: 25 + 5 pages, 7 figures, 1 table; (v 2) 25 + 6 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, added clarifications and discussion on stability of phase...|$|R
50|$|Holons (also {{known as}} <b>chargons,</b> from English hole or charge, plus the -on suffix for particles) {{are one of}} three quasiparticles, along with spinons and orbitons, that {{electrons}} in solids are able to split into {{during the process of}} spin-charge separation, when extremely tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero. The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital location and the holon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can become deconfined and behave as independent particles.|$|R
40|$|We study {{a quantum}} point contact in a quantum spin Hall insulator. It has {{recently}} been shown that the Luttinger liquid theory of such a structure maps {{to the theory of}} a weak link in a Luttinger liquid with spin with Luttinger liquid parameters g_ρ = 1 /g_σ = g 2. This behavior is a direct consequence of the unique edge state structure of the quantum spin Hall insulator. Finally, we show that for g< 1 / 2 the presence of spin non conserving spin orbit interactions leads to a novel time reversal symmetry breaking insulating phase. In this phase, the transport is carried by spinless <b>chargons</b> and chargeless spinons. These lead to nontrivial correlations in the low frequency shot noise. Implications for experiments on HgCdTe quantum well structures will be discussed. Comment: 23 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|Using the U(1) holon pair slave boson theory [Phys. Rev. B 64, 052501 2001) ], we derive a {{low energy}} field theory {{of dealing with}} both d-wave {{superconductivity}} and antiferromagnetism for underdoped cuprates by constructing both the Cooper pair field and the <b>chargon</b> pair field. In terms of the internal gauge field, the Cooper pair field carries no internal charge while the <b>chargon</b> pair field carries the internal charge. They are decoupled in the low energy limit. This allows us to separately treat the XY model of the Cooper pair field to describe superconductivity and the Abelian Higgs model of the <b>chargon</b> pair field to describe antiferromagnetism {{in the presence of}} Dirac fermions at and near the d-wave nodal points. Thus we find that the d-wave superconductivity can coexist with antiferromagnetism and that despite the coexistence, the antiferromagnetism can not affect the superconducting transition, thus allowing the XY universality class in the extreme type II limit.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} disorder in the Mott-Hubbard transition based on the slave-rotor representation of the Hubbard model, where an electron is decomposed into a fermionic spinon for a spin degree of freedom and a bosonic rotor (<b>chargon)</b> for a charge degree of freedom. In the absence of disorder the Mott-Hubbard insulator {{is assumed to be}} the spin liquid Mott insulator in terms of gapless spinons near the Fermi surface and gapped chargons interacting via U(1) gauge fields. We found that the Mott-Hubbard critical point becomes unstable as soon as disorder is turned on. As a result, a disorder critical point appears to be identified with the spin liquid glass insulator to the Fermi liquid metal transition, where the spin liquid glass consists of the U(1) spin liquid and the <b>chargon</b> glass. We expect that glassy behaviors of charge fluctuations can be measured by the optical spectra in the insulating phase of an organic material κ-(BEDT-TTF) _ 2 Cu_ 2 (CN) _ 3. Furthermore, since the Mott-Anderson critical point depends on the spinon conductivity, universality in the critical exponents may not be found...|$|E
40|$|We propose several {{tests of}} the idea that the {{electron}} is fractionalized in the underdoped and undoped cuprates. These include the ac Josephson effect, and tunneling into small superconducting grains in the Coulomb blockade regime. In both cases, we argue that the results are qualitatively modified from the conventional ones if the insulating tunnel barrier is fractionalized. These experiments directly detect the possible existence of the <b>chargon</b> - a charge $e$ spinless boson - in the insulator. The effects described in this paper provide a means to probing whether the undoped cuprate (despite it's magnetism) is fractionalized. Thus, the experiments discussed here are complementary to the flux-trapping experiment we proposed in our earlier work(cond-mat/ 0006481). Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of Cooper pairs in high-Tc cuprate superconductors within a spin uctuation model for doped quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets. The charge of the dopants (<b>chargons)</b> is associated to quantum skyrmion excitations of the Cu++ antiferromagnetic spin background. We then compute the quantum skyrmion e effective interaction potential {{as a function of}} doping and temperature in order to study charge pairing. It becomes clear that Cooper pair formation is determined by the competition between the spin uctuations of the Cu++ magnetic ions and the spins of the O [...] doped holes (spinons). The superconducting transition occurs when the effective potential allows for skyrmion bound states. Our theoretical predictions for the superconducting phase diagram of La 2 -x Sr x CuO 4 and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x are in good agreement with experiment...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{discovery}} in mid 80 's, a complete theory of high temperature superconductors {{is yet to}} take its final shape. Theory of fractionalization attempts to explain the phenomenon by assuming that the electron is split into two particles, <b>chargon</b> and spinon, carrying charge and spin respectively. Although capable of producing the qualitative features of the phase diagram, this theory is {{not been able to}} account for a number of experimental observations. A simple mean field model based on fractionalization ideas is proposed in this work which can possibly get around some of the drawbacks of the original fractionalization theory.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electron}} spectral function of various zero-temperature spin-charge separated phases in two dimensions. In these phases, the electron {{is not a}} fundamental excitation of the system, but rather "decays" into a spin- 1 / 2 chargeless fermion (the spinon) and a spinless charge e boson (the <b>chargon).</b> Using low-energy effective theories for the spinons (d-wave pairing plus possible Néel order), and the chargons (condensed or quantum disordered bosons), we explore three phases of possible relevance to the cuprate superconductors: 1) AF*, a fractionalized antiferromagnet where the spinons are paired into a state with long-ranged Néel order and the chargons are 1 / 2 -filled and (Mott) insulating, 2) the nodal liquid, a fractionalized insulator where the spinons are d-wave paired and the chargons are uncondensed, and 3) the d-wave superconductor, where the chargons are condensed and the spinons retain a d-wave gap. Working within the Z_ 2 gauge theory of such fractionalized phases, our results should be valid at scales below the vison gap. However, on a phenomenological level, our results should apply to any spin-charge separated system where the excitations have these low-energy effective forms. Comparison with ARPES data in the undoped, pseudogapped, and superconducting regions is made. Comment: 10 page...|$|E

In such circumstances, {{there will be some}} companies which want to differentiate themselves from competitors and create a unique and favorable position in the minds of their own enterprise customers; one way to create a sustainable competitive advantage in these mar-kets that already has been less discussed is the creation of brand equity. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate brand equity in software companies that <b>Chargon</b> Company was selected. The statistical population included managers of Chargon’s subsidiary companies and their users that given the un-limited society, Cochrane formula has been used in unlimited population to determine sample size. Due to the minimal amount of sample that is 386 questionnaires, 500 questionnaires were distributed in the population. Structural equation modeling approach and SmartPLS. 2 were used to analyzing collected data. The results show that emotional variables affect value on brand equity is 0. 64. Also functional variables affect value on brand equity is 0. 89. market behavior variable plays a positive mediating role between emotional variables and brand equity. On the other hand market behavior plays a negative mediating role between emotional variables and brand equity. Considering t-values higher than 1. 96, the significance of relationships obtained is confirmed in 95 % confidence level.
