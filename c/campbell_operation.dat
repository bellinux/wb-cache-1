50|$|However the {{steamboat}} {{connection was}} taken up by Captain James Gillies and Captain Alexander Campbell, {{who took over the}} liquidated Steamboat Company's fleet, and built the service up with high levels of comfort and service, with extremely low fares. Once again the Railway Company found itself subordinate to the activities of other parties: the Caledonian Railway and Captain <b>Campbell's</b> <b>operation</b> agreed the low fares—for some time the return fare was half a crown—and the Wemyss Bay Railway was not consulted. The half crown fare was exceedingly popular, however, and carryings, and profits, on the route escalated considerably.|$|R
5000|$|Boiling down {{works have}} been an {{important}} industry throughout Queensland during a number of periods. The establishment of such works usually coincided with drought and low prices for wool and beef. Boiling-down factories were started in Brisbane in 1843 by John [...] "Tinker" [...] Campbell and in Ipswich in 1847. By 1851, two works were located in Ipswich. Other boiling down works being established on the Darling Downs during the 1860s, included <b>Campbell's</b> <b>operation</b> on Westbrook Homestead, the depression of the time being the predominant reason behind the establishment of such industries. Consequently, reasons behind {{the establishment of the}} boiling down works at St Lawrence may also have been due to the effects of the depression.|$|R

50|$|BBC {{documentary}} maker Michael Cockerell {{produced a}} full-length documentary about <b>Campbell's</b> media <b>operation,</b> 'News From Number Ten', which Michael Cockerell said attracted more coverage {{than any of}} the other films he made. Campbell attacked the news media for their obsession with him, and eventually began to pull back from front-line work and delegated direct briefing of the media to others, but, if anything, his profile continued to grow. He then moved to the post of Prime Minister's Director of Communications which gave him a strategic role in overseeing government communications.|$|R

50|$|After {{the siege}} was over he joined Lord Gough on 10 February 1849, {{and served with}} great {{distinction}} at Gujrát. He was promoted colonel on 20 June 1854, and {{was appointed to the}} command of the Jalandhar brigade on 11 May 1855. He had handed over his command, and was just going home on sick leave, when the mutiny of 1857 broke out. Thereupon he refused to go to England, and remained at Calcutta until his health was sufficiently restored to enable him to take the field. In January 1858 he was appointed to command the 4th infantry division in the field, with the rank of brigadier-general. This division, nearly six thousand strong, was intended to carry out a favourite scheme of Lord Canning. Franks was directed to march across the north-eastern frontier of Oude, driving the mutineers before him, and then to meet Sir Jung Bahadur, the prime minister of Nepal, who had promised to bring a force of Goorkhas to the assistance of the English, after which the two corps together were to co-operate in Sir Colin <b>Campbell's</b> <b>operations</b> against Lucknow. This programme was successfully carried out; the junction with Jung Bahadur's Goorkhas was cleverly effected, and on 19 and 23 Feb. Franks inflicted two severe defeats on the rebel leader, Muhammad Hussein Nazim, at Chanda, and between Badshahganj and Sultánpur respectively. The effect of these victories, in which Franks only lost two men killed and sixteen wounded, was, however, minimised by the severe check which he received in an attempt to take Dohrighat. Sir Colin Campbell was much incensed at this defeat, and after the final capture of Lucknow he refused to give Franks another command in the field.|$|R
50|$|Dart was an {{experimental}} ship, designed {{to operate in}} coastal waters at close range, she carried 30 carronades but no long guns, and her armament proved highly successful in an attack on Dunkirk in 1800 in which Dart was able to come alongside the larger and better armed French frigate Désirée, fire into her and bring {{her out of the}} harbour successfully, despite the enemy having numerous advantages over the British sloop. For this <b>operation,</b> <b>Campbell</b> was promoted to post captain and given command of the frigate HMS Ariadne.|$|R

On December 19, 2005, during his second deployment, he was severely injured in an IED attack in Yusafiah, Iraq. He lost his left arm above the elbow and his left leg above the knee; his right leg and jaw were badly injured, the latter having to be wired shut. He was unconscious for five days, and later was moved to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. for further treatment and rehabilitation.|$|R

In 1850 he served under Sir Charles Napier in the expedition against the Afridis of the Kohat pass, and in 1852 under Sir Colin <b>Campbell</b> in the <b>operation</b> against the Utman Khels, where his men bridged the swift Swat river. In 1853 he served under Colonel Boileau in his expedition against the Bori Afridis. On the completion of the military survey of the Peshawar frontier he was promoted to lieutenant.|$|R

In her first season Devonia deputised for Balmoral on the Bristol Channel, and ran on the Thames. P&A Campbell hoped to use her freight capacity to serve Lundy, work eventually {{taken over by the}} Oldenburg. Over the winter of 1977/1978, Devonia was chartered for oil rig ferry work at Loch Kishorn, before returning to the Bristol Channel. P & A <b>Campbell</b> ceased <b>operations</b> in 1980, after which the ship was acquired by Torbay Seaways and renamed Devoniun in 1982. She operated trips to the Channel Islands and local excursions from Torquay. In 1984 she was sold to Norse Atlantic Ferries, and renamed Syllingar after arriving in the Orkney Islands in November 1984. She made up to two return trips each week between Kirkwall, Westray and Scalloway, plus additional cruises to Foula and Fair Isle. Financial problems forced the service to cease in August 1985. Following her period as Syllingar the ship was renamed Remvi in 1986, and ran across the Adriatic for Hellenic Cruising Holidays until 1989. As Africa Queen she was operated by J.A.R. Atlantic Ocean Ltd of Belize from 1989 to 1997 and sailed off West Africa. The latter company renamed her the Princess Eliana in 1997 before her final sale in 1998 as Olga J to the Cypriot Greek ship-owner, John Christodoulo, who was director of Asterias Maritime, a company registered in Belize. The ship and her crew were finally abandoned by her owner in Bourgas, Bulgaria [...] and she later sank there in 2004.|$|R
