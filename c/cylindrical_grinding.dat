40|$|AbstractA {{heat flux}} {{distribution}} model was proposed based on Rayleigh curve for the contact area in <b>cylindrical</b> plunge <b>grinding.</b> In this paper, an embedded thermocouple {{which can be}} grind {{was used to measure}} the workpiece surface temperature. Based on the sequential algorithm, an inversed heat transfer method was built to calculate the heat flux by using the measured temperature. The results indicated that the heat source along the contact area is asymmetric and more conformed with Rayleigh curve by comparing to the other three typical heat flux models (quadratic curve, left-angled triangle and rectangular uniform). The ratio of the grinding heat transported to the workpiece in the grinding contact area is a critical factor for calculating grinding temperatures. The energy partition to the workpiece was obtained by the experimental grinding temperature and grinding force. The actions of the abrasive grains on the workpiece surface were reflected by the changes of the grinding temperature signals in high sampling rate. The real contact length can be deduced by the time interval that the temperature sparks appeared. The grinding force monitored by a dynamometer equipped on the rear center of the grinding machine.

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} temperatures {{generated in the}} workpiece during profile and <b>cylindrical</b> traverse <b>grinding</b> in the High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) regime. The HEDG regime takes large depths of cut at high wheel and workpiece speeds to create a highly efficient material removal process. This aggressive processing generates high temperatures in the contact zone between the wheel and workpiece. However, the beneficial contact angle and the rapid removal of the heated wheel – workpiece contact zone results in low temperatures in the finished surface. Temperatures in the ground surface can be predicted {{with knowledge of the}} specific grinding energy and the grinding parameters used. Specific grinding energies recorded at high specific material removal rates demonstrated a constant value of specific grinding energy dependent on cutting and contact conditions, improving accuracy of the predictive model. This was combined with a new approach to burn threshold modelling, which demonstrated an improved division of damaged and undamaged surfaces. Cutting and contact conditions in the grinding profile vary dependent on their position. This thesis shows how temperatures vary with location and estimates the partitioning of the heat flux to the regions of the grinding profile. This suggested a constant partitioning of energy to each of the three surfaces considered independently of specific material removal rates. Further a potential link was shown between the surface and the sidewall of the grinding profile, which allows temperatures in a secondary surface to be predicted given knowledge of that in the primary. Finally, the work has demonstrated the feasibility of the Superabrasive Turning process. Using small values of feed per turn and high workpiece feedrates promoted high values of removal rate with low depths of thermal penetration in the as ground surface.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of high performance grinding machines {{in combination with}} the latest superabrasive technology has the potential to impact significantly on existing process chains. The aim of the research was to look at both the high and low rate removal grinding processes and their effects on the surface integrity, as a means to exploit the above technologies. A major objective was to determine the feasibility of High Efficiency Deep <b>Grinding</b> (HEDG) in <b>cylindrical</b> plunge <b>grinding.</b> HEDG is a high speed removal process which differs from conventional forms of grinding in that it uses large depths of cut together with high feedrates. Together, these changes affect the thermal energy partitioning within the work zone. Through this work an understanding of the process conditions enabled the development of this process, such that prevention of thermal damage to the finished workpiece surface is achievable. At the opposite extreme to the high material removal rates of HEDG, kvdrk was carried out in the high precision finish grinding regime. Developments *ere undertaken to look at the implementation of a modified path into the normal <b>cylindrical</b> plunge <b>grinding</b> action, in a process referred to as Superfinish Grinding. The aim of this process being to demonstrate an improvement to the surface texture primarily through a reduction in grinding directionality. Surface integrity is an important consideration in the development of any grinding process. Damage as a result of grinding is predominately of a thermal nature and results in changes to the material properties in the near surface region. One such change is the residual stress, which was measured using Barkhausen Noise intensity instrumentation, which provided a reliable early indication to a build up in thermal energy. Developments in thermal modelling supported by temperature measurements provided {{a better understanding of the}} HEDG regime. The model employed new energy partitioning theories together with circular arc modelling of conditions along the contact length. A model was derived to predict the surface finish produced with the Superfinish Grinding approach, this again provided an increased understanding of the grinding process. Industrial trials have shown how HEDG can be implemented on standard production machine tools for the <b>cylindrical</b> plunge <b>grinding</b> of crankshaft components. The process demonstrated the potential for improved surface integrity, whilst maintaining surface finish and form accuracy. The same grinding machine was also used to generate high quality surfaces using a Superfinish Grinding process. Roughness values of the order of 0. 11 um RQ were routinely obtained exhibiting reduced levels of grinding directionality. Thus, using a single machine tool and a single set-up, exceptionally high stock removal rates are achievable in a roughing cycle followed by superfinishing to generate the required surface characteristics and profile.

Although modern twist drills can perform excellently in many cases—usually producing sufficiently accurate holes for most applications—sometimes the stringency of the requirements for the hole's geometry and finish necessitate two operations: a drilling to slightly undersize, followed by reaming with a reamer. The planned difference between the drill diameter and the reamer diameter is called an allowance. (It allows for the removal of a certain small amount of material.) The allowance should be < 0.2 mm (.008 in) for soft materials and < 0.13 mm (.005 in) for hard materials. Larger allowances can damage the reamer. The drilled hole should not be enlarged by more than 5% of the drilled diameter.
