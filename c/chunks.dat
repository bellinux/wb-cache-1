5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are <b>chunks</b> of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are <b>chunks</b> from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe Award {{for his role in}} the drama feature Hard To Watch but realizes that in order to win the award he needs to act as a serious actor. As a result, Tracy buys the rights to his new comedy movie, The <b>Chunks</b> 2: A Very Chunky Christmas, in order to block the distribution of the feature and improve his chances at winning the award. Later, Tracy decides to do a charity event by screening Hard To Watch—a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto—for a women's shelter. At the charity event, Tracy introduces the movie but decides against showing it, realizing that laughter is the best medicine and instead screens The <b>Chunks</b> 2: A Very Chunky Christmas.

5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large <b>chunks</b> of ore left by the riddling process into smaller <b>chunks.</b> Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting <b>chunks,</b> separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the <b>chunks</b> of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chunking</b> is {{a unifying}} information-processing {{mechanism}} in human cognition and {{plays an important}} role in problem solving. In the present experiment, we use a Chinese character <b>chunking</b> task to explore the neural basis of the goal-oriented <b>chunking,</b> which were classified into loose <b>chunking</b> and tight <b>chunking.</b> The behavioral result confirmed our prediction that the tight <b>chunking</b> was more difficult than the loose <b>chunking.</b> For the imaging result, we observed similar neural activations in the occipital, parietal and frontal lobule in both conditions, which may reflect the visual perception, visuo-spatial and executive processing in the manipulation of Chinese chunks; by direct contrast the tight <b>chunking</b> and loose <b>chunking,</b> we found stronger activation in bilateral cuneus and we suggested that it may be resulted from the more mental operation of visual mental manipulation needed in the tight <b>chunking...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new Chinese <b>chunking</b> method based on maximum entropy Markov models. We firstly present {{two types of}} Chinese <b>chunking</b> specifications and data sets, based on which the <b>chunking</b> models are applied. Then we describe the hidden Markov <b>chunking</b> model and maximum entropy <b>chunking</b> model. Based on our analysis of the two models, we propose a maximum entropy Markov <b>chunking</b> model that combines the transition probabilities and conditional probabilities of states. Experimental results for two types of data sets show that this approach achieves impressive accuracy {{in terms of the}} F-score: 91. 02 % and 92. 68 %, respectively. Compared with the hidden Markov <b>chunking</b> model and maximum entropy <b>chunking</b> model, based on the same data set, the new <b>chunking</b> model achieves better performance...|$|R

5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large <b>chunks.</b> This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E
5|$|East–west-directed {{compression}} from subduction off {{the west}} coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and thrust faulting strata.

Larval insects and amphibians are supported by periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. Periphyton also absorbs calcium from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round <b>chunks</b> of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form {{as the result of}} compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt <b>chunks</b> of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's lithosphere where compression (supportive of mountain formation) and extension (supportive of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E
