40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Friction {{occurs in}} all metal forming operations and, in general, {{it has a}} negative impact on process parameters, die life, as well as workpiece quality. In <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> forming processes high interface pressures between die and material take place. These pressures can be the limiting factor of application of cold forming. By reducing interfacial friction, contact pressures can be reduced too. Knowledge of friction amount (factor of friction µ and/or friction ratio m) is essential for calculation of the main process parameters (load, energy), for choosing a proper lubricant but also for numerical modelling of forming operations. There exist a number of experimental methods to determine friction in metal forming processes. Current paper deals with the possibilities to evaluate friction. It analyses and assesses a number of existing friction models in <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> operations. Proposal of a new friction model for <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> forming operations is presented and discussed.

40|$|In this study, three {{different}} arc modes are studied in laser hybrid arc welding with a gasmetal arc, i. e. Standard, Pulsed and <b>Cold</b> <b>Metal</b> Transfer mode. Originally developed forbeing able to weld thin materials, the pulsed mode is the favoured arc mode in both ordinaryarc welding and hybrid welding. The pulsed mode {{is a more}} controlled gas metal arc weldingprocess that uses less heat {{and is able to}} weld thinner materials than the spray mode processwith globular drop transfer. The <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer mode utilizes surface tension droptransfer, compared to the free flying drops governing the other modes and is thus even morecontrolled than the pulsed mode. The <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer mode is much colder than the otherarc modes and is considered to generate less undercuts and spatter than the other modes, byboth developers and users alike. This study compares welds made by the three arc modes for both low and highdeposition rates. The welds are studied by macrographs, scanning and high speed imaging. This study shows that the differences between drop transfer modes are partially eliminateddue to the presence of a laser keyhole. The main arguments to use either arc mode arediscussed.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} {{significant}} new developments in welding processes for joining stainless steel and dissimilar metals. This {{is associated with the}} rise in interest of using stainless steel in the automotive industry from both car manufacturers and stainless steel producers. The main reason for using stainless steel within the automotive industry is the combination of formability and high strength but also the improved corrosion resistance when compared to zinc coated mild steel. This research explores the mechanical and metallurgical properties of dissimilar metal joining and determines a relationship between the fatigue properties and weld geometry. The research focuses on the relatively unexplored joining techniques of Laser Hybrid Welding and <b>Cold</b> <b>Metal</b> Transfer applied to joining stainless steel grades Hy-Tens 1000 and LDX 2101 to Dogal 260 RP-X mild steel. The joints are assessed in terms of tensile, fatigue and metallurgical properties. Experimental results and analysis show that the fatigue properties of both laser hybrid welding and <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer joints are a linear relationship with a negative gradient to value of the root angle on the mild steel side of the joints, as the angle at the root decreases the fatigue life increases. It was found that when joining the material combinations outlined in this research with Laser Hybrid Welding the resulting solidified weld pool was chemically inhomogeneous. However, welds produced using <b>Cold</b> <b>Metal</b> Transfer resulted in a chemically homogenous weld pool and consistent microhardness. Comparisons with laser welding show that laser hybrid welding and <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer can produce joints with mechanical properties comparable to welding methods currently being used in the automotive industry, for example, laser welding...|$|R
30|$|Aim: Main {{impurities}} in the 90 Y-DOTA-TOC labelling process, {{apart from}} the “free” yttrium- 90, are DOTA-TOC complexes with other metals that could {{be present in the}} solution. The most common method for determination of radiochemical purity (RCP) of labeled peptides is RP-HPLC. However, the standard gradient HPLC methods may not allow determination of the DOTA-TOC complexes with “cold” metals. The information about presence of <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> complexes might be very important in particular for investigation of reasons of radiolabeling failure and poor RCP. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop a new HPLC method that would be suitable for determination of RCP as well as for identification and determination of <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> complexes that could be present in 90 Y-DOTA-TOC.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} advancements in the modelling, optimisation, {{process control}} and mechanical performance of novel high deposition rate {{gas metal arc}} welding processes for large scale additive manufacturing applications. One of the main objectives {{of this study was to}} develop fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved during processing with particular focus on single layer welds made of carbon steel using both pulsed-current {{gas metal arc welding}} and <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer processes. The effects of interactions between critical welding process variables and weld bead and plate fusion characteristics are studied for single and multi-layers. It was shown that several bead and plate fusion characteristics are strongly affected by the contact tip to work distance, TRIM, wire feed speed, wire feed speed to travel speed ratio, and wire diameter in pulsed-current gas metal arc welding. The arc-length control, dynamic correction and the contact tip to work distance are shown to strongly influence the weld bead geometry in the <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer process. This fundamental knowledge was essential to ensure the successful development of predictive interaction models capable of determining the weld bead geometry from the welding process parameters. The models were developed using the least-squares analysis and multiple linear regression method. The gas tungsten constricted arc welding process was utilised for the first time for out-of-chamber fabrication of a large scale and high-quality Ti- 6 Al- 4 V component. The main focus was, however, in the use of the <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer process for improving out-of-chamber deposition of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at much higher deposition rates. The effect of the <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer process on the grain refinement features in the fusion zone of single layer welds under different torch gas shielding conditions was investigated. It was shown that significant grain refinement occurs with increasing helium content. The morphological features and static mechanical performance of the resulting multi-layered Ti- 6 Al- 4 V walls were also examined and compared with those in gas tungsten constricted arc welding. The results show that a considerable improvement in static tensile properties is obtained in both testing directions with <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer over gas tungsten constricted arc welding. It was suggested that this improvement in the mechanical behaviour could be due to the formation of more fine-grained structures,which are therefore more isotropic. The average ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of the as-deposited Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material processed via <b>cold</b> <b>metal</b> transfer meet the minima specification values recommended for most Ti- 6 Al- 4 V products. Neutron diffraction technique was used to establish the effect of repeated thermo-mechanical cycling on the generation, evolution and distribution of residual stresses during wire and arc additive manufacturing. The results show a significant redistribution of longitudinal residual stresses along both the substrate and multi-bead with repeated deposition. However, a nearly complete relaxation occurs along the built, once the base plate constraint is removed...|$|R
