2500|$|John Fitzgerald Kennedy [...] (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), was the 35th President of the United States, serving from 1961 {{until his}} {{assassination}} on November 22, 1963. Few American Presidents have quotes that are remembered long after their deaths, and Kennedy {{was among those}} few for saying to the nation, [...] "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> country." [...] He was the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt). Kennedy {{was faced with a}} number of important events during his term as President which include the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Space Race and the Berlin Wall crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Others doubted whether recent {{graduates}} had {{the necessary}} skills and maturity {{for such a}} task. The idea was popular among students, however, and Kennedy pursued it, asking respected academics such as Max Millikan and Chester Bowles to help him outline the organization and its goals. During his inaugural address, Kennedy again promised to create the program: [...] "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> country". President Kennedy in {{a speech at the}} White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps and what this organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what I consider to be the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world that we have seen in recent years". The Peace Corps website answered the question [...] "Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps?", acknowledging that the Peace Corps were based on Operation Crossroads Africa founded by Rev. James H. Robinson.|$|E

6000|$|... "Go, then!" [...] said Sam, {{stopping}} {{short in}} disgust. [...] "You're a big fool, Dan, and serve you right if Walters lands {{you off to}} jail; but I don't wish you no ill. If I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>for</b> <b>your</b> family after you're gone, I will, and I'll try and give your remains Christian burial--if there are any remains. So long, Danny! Give my love to old Walters!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had given}} him her hand for good-bye, and he thus for a moment did keep her. Something then, while he seemed to think if there were {{anything}} more, came back to him; though something of which there wasn't too much to be made. [...] "Of course if there's anything I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> friend: I mean the gentleman you speak of--?" [...] He gave out in short that he was ready.|$|E

[...] "Let us run {{to the top of the}} rise, then we'll be in less danger from the flood if the river gets much higher." [...] He turned to the distracted girl. [...] "Come, you had better go with us, then we will see what we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> brother." ...|$|E

"Miss Rowan," [...] he said, [...] "if {{there is}} {{anything}} which I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> brother, I will do it, {{for the sake of}} the days when we lived together, and when we were so near the very heart of life and death. But I tell you frankly that I see very little chance of successful intervention on my part. It takes a good deal in this country to stay the arm of the law, and your brother has grievously offended against it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Did Rosamond know? {{was perhaps}} the {{foremost}} of his weary thoughts. Ah! did she not! Was she not standing with her crimson shawl round her, and the long black plaits falling on it, to beckon him to the firelit comfort of his own room? Did she not fall on his neck as he came heavily up, and cling around him with her warm arms? [...] "Oh, Julius, what a dear brother he was! What <b>can</b> we <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, granting, then, {{that you}} <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>for</b> <b>your</b> fellow-creatures {{unless you are}} {{to do it in}} the most genteel, comfortable, and picturesque manner possible, is there not a great field for a woman like you, Florence, in your {{influence}} over your associates? With <b>your</b> talents <b>for</b> conversation, <b>your</b> tact, and self-possession, and ladylike gift of saying any thing you choose, are you not responsible, in some wise, for the influence you exert over those by whom you are surrounded?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a risky}} experiment," [...] exclaimed the cook, [...] "for I do {{not know}} the new King's temper. But the idea may please His Majesty, and since you will not allow me to kill the birds, it is the best thing I <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> As <b>for</b> <b>your</b> other condition, you seem to be a very bright boy, and so I will have the butler take you as his page, and you shall stand back of the King's chair and keep the flies away while he eats." ...|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{after the}} return of Colonel Hannay to Calcutta, this miserable Nabob {{received}} intelligence, which concurrent public fame supported, that Mr. Hastings meant to send him up into the country again, on a second expedition, probably with some such order as this:--"You have sucked blood enough for yourself, now try what you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> neighbors." [...] The Nabob was {{not likely to be}} misinformed. His friend and agent, Gobind Ram, was at Calcutta, and had constant access to all Mr. Hastings's people. Mr. Hastings himself tells you what instructions these vakeels always have to search into and discover all his transactions. This Gobind Ram, alarmed with strong apprehensions, and struck with horror at the very idea of such an event, apprised his master of his belief that Mr. Hastings meant to send Colonel Hannay again into the country. Judge now, my lords, what Colonel Hannay must have been, from the declaration which I will now read to you, extorted from that miserable slave, the Nabob, who thus addresses Mr. Hastings.|$|E
