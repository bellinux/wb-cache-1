40|$|Therapeutic {{options to}} treat atopic {{dermatitis}} are limited. Leukocytes from atopic patients have an abnormally high activity of {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} (AMP) -phosphodiesterase (PDE), which can be normalized in vitro by PDE inhibitors. <b>Cipamfylline</b> is a new potent and selective inhibitor of PDE- 4. To compare the efficacy and safety of up to 14 days' topical treatment with <b>cipamfylline</b> (0. 15 %) cream with vehicle and with hydrocortisone 17 -butyrate (0. 1 %) cream. International, multicentre, prospective, randomized double-blind, left-right studies of <b>cipamfylline</b> vs. vehicle and <b>cipamfylline</b> vs. hydrocortisone 17 -butyrate in adult patients with stable symmetrical atopic dermatitis on the arms. Both <b>cipamfylline</b> and hydrocortisone 17 -butyrate reduced the Total Severity Score significantly (P < 0. 001). The reduction with <b>cipamfylline</b> was significantly greater than that with vehicle (difference vehicle-cipamfylline 1. 67 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 06, 2. 28; P < 0. 001) and was significantly less than with hydrocortisone 17 -butyrate (difference hydrocortisone-cipamfylline - 2. 10 95 % CI - 2. 93, - 1. 27; P < 0. 001). Investigator and patient assessments of the overall treatment response showed a similar picture. <b>Cipamfylline</b> cream is significantly more effective than vehicle, but significantly less effective than hydrocortisone 17 -butyrate cream {{in the treatment of}} atopic dermatiti...|$|E

Tableting, flow, dispersion and filtering properties, and even shelf-life may be dependent to some extent on the habit or morphology of the crystalline solid state, and it is therefore an important parameter to understand in an industrial development process, for example in the production of a drug or medicine. In the first instance, the crystal habit depends on the arrangement of molecules within the crystal, and can therefore vary between different polymorphs o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE) 4 is {{the predominant}} cyclic AMP degrading enzyme {{in a variety}} of inflammatory cells including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, T cells and monocytes. In addition, this enzyme is expressed in non-immune cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Highly selective PDE 4 inhibitors are currently under evaluation for the treatment of asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to the broad anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory action of PDE 4 inhibitors, it has been proposed that PDE 4 inhibitors might also be efficacious for skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. Consequently, PDE 4 inhibitors including cilomilast and AWD 12 - 281 have been tested in several models of allergic and irritant skin inflammation. These PDE 4 inhibitors displayed strong anti-inflammatory action in models of allergic contact dermatitis in mice, in the arachidonic acid induced skin inflammation in mice and in ovalbumin sensitised guinea pigs. The determination of cytokines in skin homogenates revealed that both Th 1 as well as Th 2 cytokines are suppressed by PDE 4 inhibitors, indicating an anti-inflammatory activity in both the Th 2 dominated acute phase as well as the Th 1 dominated chronic phase of atopic dermatitis. Due to the suppression of Th 1 cytokines, activity can also be expected in psoriasis. Results of early clinical trials with both topically (<b>cipamfylline,</b> CP 80, 633) and systemically (CC- 10004) active PDE 4 inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in atopic dermatitis {{and in the case of}} CC- 10004, also in psoriasis. AWD 12 - 281 (GW 842470) is currently under clinical evaluation for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis. Results concerning clinical efficacy of this potent and selective PDE 4 inhibitor are anxiously awaited...|$|E
