SCSIO 20089 was isolated from a marine sediment of South China Sea. Using chromatographic techniques, the extracellular protease was purified to homogeneity from the culture supernatant. The purified protease exhibited maximal activity at 30 degrees C, pH 8. 0, and remained more than 20 % of its activity at 0 degrees C. Its activation energy was calculated to be 34. 4 kJ/mol, suggesting it is a cold-adapted protease. Based on the N-terminal {{amino acid sequence}} of the purified enzyme, full gene encoding the enzyme was obtained by combination of degenerate primer PCR and hiTAIL-PCR. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 57 % and 52 % identity with mesothermal and thermophilic protease in thermolysin family respectively. All these indicate the enzyme is a unique cold-active thermolysin-like protease with potential in both basic research and industrial application areas. (C) 2012, The Society for Biotechnology, japan.

40|$|Bacteria are {{the most}} {{abundant}} organisms {{and can be found}} in different habitats, from polar regions, deserts and volcanoes, deep ocean trenches to the upper atmosphere. In all these environments, they are exposed to various chemical hazards, such as antibacterial chemicals (antibiotics) produced by other organisms that are found in the same habitat. In addition, they are exposed to threats from infection by bacteriophages. In order to protect themselves, bacteria have evolved several mechanisms towards avoiding antibiotics and phage infection. In this work, enzymes involved in these protection mechanisms have been attempted characterized both functionally and structurally. Specifically two DNA modifying enzymes have been studied. They are involved in bacterial protection from phages, namely the type II restriction enzyme DpnI and the C 5 -DNA-MTase ParI, both originating from the psychrophilic bacterium Psychrobacter arcticus. The third enzyme that has been investigated is a metallo-β-lactamase (ALI- 1) from the cold adapted marine bacterium Aliivibrio salmonicida. Since all these enzymes originate from organisms adapted to a cold environment, the presence of <b>cold</b> adapted <b>enzyme</b> features like heat lability and high activity at low temperature, were investigated. In Manuscript I and in Manuscript III we partially characterized the type II restriction enzyme DpnI and the C 5 -DNA-MTase ParI. In addition to being important for the bacterial cell, these types of enzymes are valuable in several molecular biology techniques and the development of more efficient enzymes is necessary in terms of reducing cost and increasing efficiency. Due to their characteristics such as higher activity at lower temperatures and heat lability <b>cold</b> adapted <b>enzymes</b> became very attractive targets. Both DpnI and ParI were recombinantly expressed, but with some difficulties, that were overcome by usage of specialized E. coli strains. Both enzymes were partially characterize with regards to function, DpnI showed activity in vitro, while MTase was shown to have methylating activity in vivo. One of the mechanisms in antibiotic resistance is the acquirement and development of β-lactamases, enzymes that can cleave the amide bond in the β-lactam ring, a common structure in all β-lactam antibiotics, and thus inactivate it. This presents a huge problem in usage of β-lactam antibiotics, which are widely used against bacterial infections in both humans and animals. In Paper II, the metallo-β-lactamase ALI- 1, from the cold adapted marine bacterium Aliivibrio salmonicida, was characterised. When compared to a mesophilic counterpart (VIM- 1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa) it was shown to be adapted to its natural habitat, in terms of being more active at lower temperatures and in higher salt concentrations. In addition, in this work {{it was found that the}} gene encoding ALI- 1 is present in environmental bacterial samples.

The DHFR catalysed reaction has often been used to study enzymatic tunnelling and the contribution of protein dynamics to catalysis. To gain a better understanding of such phenomena and to investigate the key elements of structural adaptation in DHFR, in this thesis the hydride transfer reaction of DHFR from Moritella profunda (MpDHFR), a <b>cold</b> adapted <b>enzyme,</b> was studied and compared to the mesophilic and extensively studied enzyme from Escherichia coli (EcDHFR) and the thermophilic enzyme from Thermotoga maritima (TmDHFR). Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to the thesis. Description of the materials and methods used in evaluating this work is reported in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, the steady state and pre-steady state temperature dependences of the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the MpDHFR catalysed reaction was elevated, compared to data obtained for the mesophilic and the thermophilic DHFR homologues and the results interpreted according to the environmentally coupled tunnelling model. The work presented in Chapters 4 and 5 has investigated the role of dynamics during catalysis by DHFR using site directed mutagenesis. In Chapter 4, mutations were created in the GH loop for both EcDHFR and MpDHFR to elucidate the role of the occluded conformation during catalysis by DHFR. In Chapter 5, different MpDHFR and EcDHFR variants in the highly mobile M 20 loop were generated and their temperature dependences of KIE were studied in addition to studying the two variants MpDHFR-G 123 V and MpDHFR-D 124 N in the catalytically important FG loop. The results obtained suggest that MpDHFR does not undergo the dynamical loop movements that have been recognized previously for EcDHFR in spite of following the same catalytic cycle. Further findings were found which contradict the current models that relate protein dynamics to catalysis efficiency, thus modifying these models has become essential. Chapter 6 has focused on studying the effect of different denaturants/salt concentrations on MpDHFR chemical step. Finally, a summary of the work presented in this thesis and future guidelines are provided in Chapter 7...|$|R
40|$|Premise of research. Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{accumulate}} in plant tissues when {{the plant is}} exposed to stress, causing damage to cell structure and metabolism. Plants {{have a variety of}} mechanisms to prevent such damage, including a number of enzymes that scavenge ROS. The impact of specific enzymes, however, is as yet poorly understood. Methodology. The impact on plant tolerance to <b>cold</b> stress of <b>enzymes</b> involved in scavenging ROS was explored by comparing transplastomic tobacco lines overexpressing genes encoding glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and manganese superoxide dismutase, singly or in pairwise combinations, with nontransformed (NT) tobacco. Pivotal results. Chilling to 10 °C resulted in less photoinhibition in lines overexpressing GR alone or in combination with GST, compared to NT tobacco, but more photoinhibition in lines overexpressing DHAR alone or in combination with GR. These differences were not, however, reflected in other indicators of stress. When chilled at 4 °C, all lines showed similar damage to NT, except under relatively high photosynthetically active radiation, in which case photoinhibition was reduced in all transplastomic lines compared to NT. Growth over several weeks in a greenhouse was inhibited in the transplastomic lines when the duration included transient cool air temperatures. When optimal air temperature was maintained, growth over a similar duration was equal in transplastomics and NT tobacco. Conclusions. These experiments suggest a subtle interaction of enhanced ROS scavenging and tolerance of chilling stress...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracellular {{concentration}} of {{reactive oxygen species}} is held within tight physiological limits by enzymes with scavenging and repair functions. Under extreme conditions such as prolonged <b>cold</b> ischemia, these <b>enzymes</b> {{may be unable to}} adequately protect the organ, resulting in reperfusion injury that renders the graft dysfunctional after transplantation. In this study, we investigated normal human variation of some of these inducible enzymes to determine if certain phenotypes could be identified that are associated with a reduced risk of delayed graft function (DGF). METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction was performed to differentiate polymorphisms for manganese superoxide dismutase and three classes of glutathione-S-transferase in donors and recipients of transplants with over 24 hr of cold ischemia. The data attained was analyzed compared with {{the presence or absence of}} DGF, defined as the requirement of hemodialysis in the first week after transplantation. RESULTS: Enzyme polymorphisms were defined for 229 recipients and 104 of their respective donors. Patients receiving a kidney from a donor who expressed GSTM 1 *B either alone or in combination with GSTM 1 *A experienced significantly lower rates of DGF (P < 0. 05). No association was found between any enzyme polymorphism in the recipients and the development of DGF. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a genetic allele, which is protective against reperfusion injury, generates the possibility for defining polymorphisms at the time of tissue typing to give insight to the inherent biological risk of DGF that an organ possesses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Wangiella dermatitidis {{is a human}} {{pathogenic}} fungus that is an {{etiologic agent}} of phaeohyphomycosis. W. dermatitidis produces a black pigment that {{has been identified as}} a dihydroxynaphthalene melanin and the production of this pigment is associated with its virulence. Cell wall pigmentation in W. dermatitidis depends on the WdPKS 1 gene, which encodes a polyketide synthase required for generating the key precursor for dihydroxynaphthalene melanin biosynthesis. Results We analyzed the effects of disrupting WdPKS 1 on dihydroxynaphthalene melanin production and resistance to antifungal compounds. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that wdpks 1 Δ - 1 yeast had thinner cell walls that lacked an electron-opaque layer compared to wild-type cells. However, digestion of the wdpks 1 Δ - 1 yeast revealed small black particles that were consistent with a melanin-like compound, because they were acid-resistant, reacted with melanin-binding antibody, and demonstrated a free radical signature by electron spin resonance analysis. Despite lacking the WdPKS 1 gene, the mutant yeast were capable of catalyzing the formation of melanin from L- 3, 4 -dihyroxyphenylalanine. The wdpks 1 Δ - 1 cells were significantly more susceptible to killing by voriconazole, amphotericin B, NP- 1 [a microbicidal peptide], heat and <b>cold,</b> and lysing <b>enzymes</b> than the heavily melanized parental or complemented strains. Conclusion In summary, W. dermatitidis makes WdPKS -dependent and -independent melanins, and the WdPKS 1 - dependent deposition of melanin in the cell wall confers protection against antifungal agents and environmental stresses. The biological role of the WdPKS -independent melanin remains unclear. </p...|$|R
40|$|Enzymes from psychrophiles show higher {{catalytic}} {{efficiency in}} the 0 - 20 degrees C temperature range and often lower thermostability {{in comparison with}} meso/thermophilic homologs. Physical and chemical characterization of these enzymes is currently underway {{in order to understand}} the molecular basis of <b>cold</b> adaptation. Psychrophilic <b>enzymes</b> are often characterized by higher flexibility, which allows for better interaction with substrates, and by a lower activation energy requirement in comparison with meso/thermophilic counterparts. In their tertiary structure, psychrophilic enzymes present fewer stabilizing interactions, longer and more hydrophilic loops, higher glycine content, and lower proline and arginine content. In this study, a comparative analysis of the structural characteristics of the interfaces between oligomeric psychrophilic enzyme subunits was carried out. Crystallographic structures of oligomeric psychrophilic enzymes, and their meso/thermophilic homologs belonging to five different protein families, were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank. The following structural parameters were calculated: overall and core interface area, characterization of polar/apolar contributions to the interface, hydrophobic contact area, quantity of ion pairs and hydrogen bonds between monomers, internal area and total volume of non-solvent-exposed cavities at the interface, and average packing of interface residues. These properties were compared to those of meso/thermophilic enzymes. The results were analyzed using Student's t-test. The most significant differences between psychrophilic and mesophilic proteins were found in the number of ion pairs and hydrogen bonds, and in the apolarity of their subunit interface. Interestingly, the number of ion pairs at the interface shows an opposite adaptation to those occurring at the monomer core and surface...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular enzymatic {{activities}} (EEAs) are a crucial {{step in the}} degradation of organic matter. Dissolved (cell-free) extracellular enzymes in seawater can make up a significant contribution of the bulk EEA. However, the factors controlling the proportion of dissolved EEA in the marine environment remain unknown. Here we studied the seasonal changes {{in the proportion of}} dissolved relative to total EEA (of alkaline phosphatase (APase), β -glucosidase (BGase), and leucine aminopeptidase (LAPase)), in the Baltic Sea for 18 months. The proportion of dissolved EEA ranged between 37 and 100, 0 and 100, and 34 and 100  % for APase, BGase, and LAPase, respectively. A consistent seasonal pattern in the proportion of dissolved EEA was found among all the studied enzymes, with values up to 100  % during winter and [*]<[*]  40  % during summer. A significant negative relation was found between the proportion of dissolved EEA and temperature, indicating that temperature might be a critical factor controlling the proportion of dissolved relative to total EEA in marine environments. Our results suggest a strong decoupling of hydrolysis rates from microbial dynamics in cold waters. This implies that under <b>cold</b> conditions, cell-free <b>enzymes</b> can contribute to substrate availability at large distances from the producing cell, increasing the dissociation between the hydrolysis of organic compounds and the actual microbes producing the enzymes. This might also suggest a potential effect of global warming on the hydrolysis of organic matter via a reduction of the contribution of cell-free enzymes to the bulk hydrolytic activity...|$|R
40|$|The cold-adapted {{alpha-amylase}} from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (AHA) is a multidomain enzyme {{capable of}} reversible unfolding. Cold-adapted proteins, including AHA, have been predicted to be structurally flexible and conformationally unstable {{as a consequence}} of a high lysine-to-arginine ratio. In order to examine the role of low arginine content in structural flexibility of AHA, the amino groups of lysine were guanidinated to form homoarginine (hR), and the structure-function-stability properties of the modified enzyme were analyzed by transverse urea gradient-gel electrophoresis. The extent of modification was monitored by MALDI-TOF-MS, and correlated to changes in activity and stability. Modifying lysine to hR produced a conformationally more stable and less active a-amylase. The k(cat) of the modified enzyme decreased with a concomitant increase in Delta H-# and decrease in K-m. To interpret the structural basis of the kinetic and thermodynamic properties, the hR residues were modeled in the AHA X-ray structure and compared to the X-ray structure of a thermostable homolog. The experimental properties of the modified AHA were consistent with K 106 hR forming an intra-Domain B salt bridge to stabilize the active site and decrease the cooperativity of unfolding. Homo-Arg modification also appeared to alter Ca 2 + and Cl- binding in the active site. Our results indicate that replacing lysine with hR generates mesophilic-like characteristics in AHA, and provides support for the importance of lysine residues in promoting <b>enzyme</b> <b>cold</b> adaptation. These data were consistent with computational analyses that show that AHA possesses a compositional bias that favors decreased conformational stability and increased flexibility. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Psychrophiles {{are cold}} loving organisms that {{have adapted to}} live in {{permanently}} cold environments. These microorganisms synthesize psychrophilic enzymes with high catalytic efficiencies at cold temperaturesranging from - 20 °C to + 10 °C. This research intends to perform an in silico analysis of the cold adaptation of Glycosyl hydrolase enzymes isolated from psychrophilic yeast Glaciozyma antarctica. Two enzyme were selected; ß-mannanase (PMAN) and ß-glucanase (PLAM) from two different glycosyl hydrolase families with different domains. A 3 D model was predicted for both genes using a fold recognition method. The proteins were comparatively studied against their mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic counterparts. The study of these enzymes illustrates that they mostly use similar strategies for cold adaptation. The structure of PLAM and PMAN consist of longer loops in three different positions. Their structure also has several amino acids substitution including increased number of alanine, glycine, and polar residues and decreased number of proline, arginine, and hydrophobic residues. The PLAM and PMAN structure showed longer motions around the entrance region to active site. A lower number of salt bridges and H-bonds have been observed in the PLAM and PMAN structure. PLAM consists of 5 salt bridges while its homologous proteins have 9, 7, and 18 salt bridges, respectively. Also, the number of H-bonds per residue is 0. 54 where it is 0. 62, 0. 63, and 0. 70 for its homologous counterparts. Furthermore, PMAN includes 5 salt bridges in its structure while its homologous counterparts have 10, 14, and 21 salt bridges, respectively. The number of H-bonds per residue for PMAN is 0. 62 while it is 0. 71, 0. 73 and 0. 78 for its homologous counterparts. The PLAM structure has 41 % of secondary structure, while its homologous counterparts have 54 %, 58 %, and 60 % of secondary structure. Also, this percentage is 47 % for PMAN, and 48 %, 50 %, and 53 % for its homologous proteins. Additionally, they also use different strategies related {{to the role of}} salt bridges in their structure. The PLAM structure contains alternative salt bridges connecting inner and outer leaflets, while the PMAN structure includes weakly linked salt bridges between residues located on a loop instead of ß-sheet. In conclusion, in silico analysis of two psychrophilic proteins revealed novel characteristics of these <b>cold</b> adapted <b>enzymes.</b> The analysis showed the adopted strategies by these two proteins in contributing to the general and local flexibility of their structure and increase capability of the enzymes to be active at cold temperatures. The presented findings in this research will assist future attempts in the rational design of enzymes with enhanced enzymatic capabilities...|$|R
