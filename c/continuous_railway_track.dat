40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of prototype automatic devices for the measurement of residual stress in magnetic materials. The device, called an "Automatic Rotation Rig", or ARR for short, uses the principal of magnetic anisotropy to determine {{the difference in the}} principal stresses and their direction at the surface of the material. The stress measurement is averaged over an area of approximately 5 mm by 5 mm, to a depth of about 1 mm. Three such devices have been built in the period from January 1987 to February 1989. These have been designed for the measurement of residual stress in <b>railway</b> wheels and <b>tracks.</b> <b>Railway</b> wheels may fail if the rim becomes sufficiently tensile, hence the device may be used to detect unsafe wheels and allow for their removal from service. <b>Continuous</b> <b>railway</b> <b>tracks</b> are welded together to induce tension along their length. This tension counteracts compression due to heating of the rail. Thus the ARR may be able to be used to determine the "stress free" temperature of the rail. This can be used to find whether or not the welding has induced sufficient tension into the rail, or at what ambient temperature the rail may buckle due to excessive longitudinal compression. The residual stress measuring device can also be used for other applications where the difference imprincipIe stresses needs to be measured on reasonably flat ferrous materials. The device is portable and reasonably cheap and easy to produce. Prototype ARR's have proven to be reliable in field trials, thus leading to the possibility of their being manufactured commercially...|$|R

The comparison between the proposed method and other methods of analysis of <b>railway</b> <b>tracks,</b> such as Lorente de Nó and Zimmermann-Timoshenko, clearly shows the accuracy of the obtained results for the proposed method, even for low values of N. In addition, identical results between the proposed and the Lorente methods have been found, although the proposed method seems to be of simpler application and computationally more efficient than the Lorente one. Small but significative differences occur between these two methods and the one developed by Zimmermann-Timoshenko. This article also presents a detailed sensitivity analysis of the vertical displacement of the sleepers. Although standard matrix methods of structural analysis can handle this railway model, one of the objectives of this article is to show the efficiency of DFT method with respect to standard matrix structural analysis. A comparative analysis between standard matrix structural analysis and the proposed method (DFT), in terms of computational time, input, output and also software programming, will be carried out.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} indicate one of major causes of damages, which {{is attributed to}} the resonant behaviours, in a <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> and its components. Basically, when a <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> is excited to generalised dynamic loading, the <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> deforms and then vibrates for certain duration. Dynamic responses of the <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> and its components {{are the key to}} evaluate the structural capacity of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> and its components. If a dynamic loading resonates the <b>railway</b> <b>track’s</b> dynamic responses, its components tend to have the significant damage from excessive dynamic stresses. For example, a rail vibration could lead to defects in rails or wheels. The track vibrations can cause the crack damage in railway sleepers or fasteners, or even the breakage of ballast support. Therefore, the identification of dynamic properties of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> and its components is imperative, in order to avoid any train operation that might trigger such resonances. This chapter deals with the vibration measurement techniques and the dynamic behaviours of ballasted <b>railway</b> <b>tracks,</b> and in particular their major components. It describes the concept of vibration measurements and the understanding into the dynamic behaviour of ballasted railtrack sleepers. It discusses briefly on the track structures and track components in order to provide the foundation of understanding ballasted <b>railway</b> <b>tracks.</b> The highlight in this paper is the state-of-the-art review of dynamic properties of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> and its components.

40|$|Abstract: The main design {{criteria}} of ballasted <b>railway</b> <b>tracks</b> include rail deflections, rail bending stresses, rail wheel contact stresses, sleeper bending moments and ballast sleeper contact pressures. Various criteria have been defined {{for the design}} of ballasted <b>railway</b> <b>tracks</b> due to the various mechanical properties of track components and their complex interaction. Therefore, the <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> design is a difficult and time-consuming process. These complications highlight the need to focus attention on the necessity of a thorough investigation into the effect of the track and rolling stock parameters on the {{design criteria}}. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a sensitivity analysis of the main <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> design criteria was conducted in this study. Consequently, the roles of track and rolling stock parameters (including track modulus, sleeper spacing, train speed and axle load) in the design of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> were investigated for various track design criteria. The research findings provide new and practical suggestions in the analysis and design of ballasted <b>railway</b> <b>tracks...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>track</b> {{maintenance}} plays a {{key role}} in enhancing the reliability and safety of railway transportation, as it reduces the potential risks of defects and derailments. A <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> degrades over time, due to its cumulative usage (in terms of million gross tons) that results from traffic movements. When the cumulative usage reaches a failure threshold, the <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> breaks and has to be replaced with a new section. Moreover, the infrastructure owner charges the maintenance agent a specific penalty due to traffic disrruption and passenger dissatisfaction. To avoid such costly defects,the <b>railway</b> <b>tracks</b> must be preventively replaced at regular time intervals. In this paper, we propose an optimal bivariate(age–usage) maintenance strategy for <b>railway</b> <b>tracks</b> such that the average long-run maintenance cost per unit time is minimized. The proposed model is applied to 60 E 1 track on a small part of the Swedish heavy haul line ‘Malmbanan’, and the results are compared with two conventional age-based and usage-based maintenance policies. The results show that the proposed maintenance policy has a substantial potential to reduce the servicing costs of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> maintenance...|$|R
