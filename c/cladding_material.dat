40|$|It {{is known}} that it is {{difficult}} to bond dissimilar metals such as aluminum and copper or aluminum and iron using diffusion bonding, because an intermetallic compound is easily produced at the bond interface and bonding strength becomes low. However it is possible to bond the dissimilar metals using the vacuum roll bonding which performs hot rolling in a vacuum. In this study, we investigated the effect of bonding temperature and reduction of aluminum plate thickness on bonding strength of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> when aluminum-clad copper (Al/Cu <b>clad)</b> <b>materials</b> were produced at 3 Pa in vacuum degree by the vacuum roll bondings. Bond tensile strength of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> increased as the reduction was increased. Their fracture types were classified according to the fracture pass, that is, in the base metal of the aluminum, at the bond interface of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>material</b> or in the base metal and/or at the bond interface. Furthermore, the bond interfaces of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> were observed using a transmission electron microscope and an electron dispersive spectroscopy. As a result, it was clarified that Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> are soundly produced using the vacuum roll bonding when thickness of diffusion layer is less than 60 nm even if intermetallic compounds were developed...|$|R

Six-sided stars that adorn the main gateway on the west, are also seen on the iwan of the main tomb structure, though it has been used as ornamental cosmic symbol. The mosque usually present alongside royal tombs, like the Taj, is conspicuously missing from the enclosure, which has only one other structure, the tomb of Emperor's favourite barber, now commonly known as Nai ka Gumbad (Dome-of-barber). The tomb built of rubble masonry and red sandstone, uses white marble as a <b>cladding</b> <b>material</b> and also for the flooring, lattice screens (jaalis), door frames, eaves (chhajja) and for the main dome. It stands on a vaulted terrace eight-metre high and spread over 12,000m².
