Their orders are to cut out Snow's heart {{and bring it to}} the Queen. Charming attacks the henchmen with his sword, killing two. One henchman gets away with Snow, and Charming quickly dispatches him with an arrow. Now that he has saved Snow, she decides to trust him, and agrees to lead him to the place where she sold the items.|$|E
5|$|Lewis is {{a gentleman}} escort, who is {{described}} as being suave, <b>charming</b> <b>and</b> charismatic. He is first seen accompanying Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska) to a Christmas ball. He is introduced to Audrey, who falls for his charm and later hires him to be her companion to another event. In March 2010, Lewis was seen advertising his services in The Lady, {{as part of a}} crossover between the society magazine and Coronation Street. Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) sees the advert and books Lewis for a date, forming a love triangle storyline between them and Audrey. Lewis eventually declares his feelings for Audrey, and they plan to leave Weatherfield together.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as <b>charming</b> <b>and</b> friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study on the spectra for heavy flavor (<b>charm</b> <b>and</b> bottom) decayed {{electrons}} in 200 GeV p+p collisions and provide the relative contributions of <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> bottom hadrons from the PYTHIA calculations. The results suggest that the crossing point of the electron spectra from <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> bottom decays is above 7 GeV/c and bottom contribution is not dominant for electron p_T< 3 GeV/c. The upper limit of the relative cross section ratio is reported as σ_bb̅/σ_cc̅≤(0. 49 ± 0. 09 ± 0. 09) ...|$|R
5|$|The Intelligence Directorate {{was formed}} in 1985 to oversee special operations. It had four subcommittees: the Committee for Special Missions, the Foreign Intelligence Committee, the Counterespionage Committee and the Lebanon Committee. Led by Abd al-Rahman Isa, the longest-serving member of the ANO—Seale writes that Isa was unshaven and shabby, but <b>charming</b> <b>and</b> persuasive—the {{directorate}} maintained 30–40 people overseas who looked after the ANO's arms caches in various countries. It trained staff, arranged passports and visas, and reviewed security at airports and seaports. Members {{were not allowed to}} visit each other at home, and no one outside the directorate was supposed to know who was a member.|$|E
5|$|After {{an attempt}} on Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) life, Mark is {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective in the case. When he received conflicting information from the suspects he interviews, Mark struggled to identify the culprit. McGregor told a writer from SX News that he enjoyed {{being involved in the}} storyline, as he had never had that much responsibility before. To prepare for the role, McGregor chose to research his character's job. Mark was described as being handsome, <b>charming</b> <b>and</b> a perfectionist. He was dedicated to his job as a police detective and often put his work ahead of everything else. As a consequence, Mark struggled to balance his work and personal lives. McGregor stated that he shared some similarities with Mark and he enjoyed getting into character.|$|E
5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, <b>charming,</b> <b>and</b> at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E
40|$|Measurement of <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> beauty {{production}} in deep inelastic ep scattering from decays into muons at HERA ZEUS Collaboration The production of <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> beauty quarks in ep interactions has been measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA for squared four-momentum exchange Q 2 > 20 GeV 2, using an integrated luminosity of 126 pb − 1. <b>Charm</b> <b>and</b> beauty quarks were identified through their decays into muons. Differential cross sections were measured for muon transverse momenta p µ T> 1. 5 GeV and pseudorapidities − 1. 6 < η µ < 2. 3, {{as a function}} of p µ T, ηµ, Q 2 and Bjorken x. The <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> beauty contributions to the proton structure function F 2 were also extracted. The results agree with previous measurements based on independent technique...|$|R

5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be <b>charming,</b> <b>and</b> although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he will visit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, during {{a night out}} with Dr. Whale (David Anders), Mary Margaret (Goodwin) tries {{to make a little}} {{conversation}} with him; however, he is busy ogling Ruby (Meghan Ory), prompting Mary Margaret to leave the cafe by herself. As she walks back to her apartment, she notices Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) in her car reading a newspaper and searching for a place to stay. Mary Margaret offers Emma a spare room at her apartment. The following day, Mary Margaret notices Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) looking at the comatose John Doe (Dallas) while they are setting up decorations at the hospital. Henry believes that John Doe is Prince <b>Charming</b> <b>and</b> Mary Margaret is Snow White. Henry asks her to read to Charming from the storybook, convinced that it will wake him up. Emma persuades Mary Margaret to go along with Henry's wishes so that they can prove the stories aren't real. At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the stories to the patient, until his hand grabs hers, shocking Mary Margaret. She tells Dr. Whale that Charming might be waking up, but the doctor does not believe her. After she leaves, Dr. Whale calls Regina (Parrilla), as he had been instructed to do should there be a change in John Doe's state, revealing that he had been lying to Mary Margaret.|$|E

Experimental results from both fixed target and colliding beam experiments are presented and compared to theoretical predictions. Predictions based on QCD perturbation theory are generally successful in explaining the shapes of differential cross sections but underestimate the scale of the cross section by factors of 2 - 3. An exception is production of the vector meson quarkonia which cannot be satisfactorily explained by perturbative processes alone. ...|$|R

25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works. While it has been criticized as the least {{substantial}} of the composer's three ballets, {{it should be remembered}} that Tchaikovsky was restricted by a rigorous scenario supplied by Marius Petipa. This scenario provided no opportunity for the expression of human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, at its best, the melodies are <b>charming</b> <b>and</b> pretty, and by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E
25|$|Sudipto Sen was the {{chairman}} and managing director of the Saradha Group. Sen was described as a softly spoken, <b>charming,</b> <b>and</b> forceful orator. At the time of his arrest, he was in his mid-50s. In his youth, he was known as Shankaraditya Sen, and was part of the Naxalite movement in West Bengal. He changed his name to Sudipto Sen and may have had plastic surgery sometime in the 1990s, after which he became associated with land development projects in South Kolkata. The land bank he formed in around 2000 became the catalyst for enticing early customers into his Ponzi scheme.|$|E
