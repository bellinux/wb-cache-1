40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} stringent <b>campaign</b> <b>contribution</b> laws on competition in gubernatorial contests. In addition to the stringency of <b>campaign</b> <b>contribution</b> laws, however, it explores several other potential causes of competition. For instance, this study considers the availability of public funding, a state’s vote for president, {{the existence of an}} open seat race, income of a state, state population, the institutional powers of a given state’s governor, and the winning party. This study ultimately demonstrates the extent to which <b>campaign</b> <b>contribution</b> limits have little effect on gubernatorial competitiveness. Of the alternatives, both the presence of an open seat and the availability of public financing to challengers proves partially determinative, and present additional avenues for further research...|$|R
5|$|Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Berrios {{regularly}} accepted {{hundreds of}} thousands of dollars a year in <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions</b> from lawyers who appealed property tax assessments before the Board. Berrios controls five personal political action committees, not including the fund for the Cook County Democratic Party, which he also controls. Berrios collected more than $3 million in political contributions between 2000 and 2010, 64 percent from property tax appeal lawyers. About one-third of Berrios’ <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions</b> in that decade came from the 15 property tax appeal law firms that gained the most for their clients between 2006 and 2008, contributing almost $1 million to six political action committees controlled by Berrios and his daughter, Illinois State Representative Maria Antonia Berrios, Democrat of the 39th Illinois House district on Chicago's northwest side. Berrios started 2008 with $1.2 million in just one of his several campaign funds, much of it from attorneys who appeared before him.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{issued an}} {{executive}} order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions</b> or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A.

Sherman agreed with Hayes that the three had to resign, but he made clear {{in a letter to}} Arthur that he had no personal grudge against the Collector. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements but the Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees.|$|E

5|$|The $40 million-a-year Hired Truck {{program was}} the biggest scandal of Daley's first 15 years as mayor. The Hired Truck Program hired private truck {{companies}} to do city work. A six-month investigation by the Chicago Sun-Times resulted in a three-day series of articles in January 2004 that revealed some participating companies were being paid for doing little or no work, had American Mafia connections or were tied to city employees, or paid bribes {{to get into the}} program. Between 1996 and 2004, companies in the Hired Truck Program gave more than $800,000 in <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions</b> to various politicians, including Daley, House Speaker Michael Madigan, and Governor Rod Blagojevich; Daley received at least $108,575 and his brother John Daley and his ward organization more than $47,500.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he could}} not {{convince}} Congress to outlaw the spoils system, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions</b> or otherwise taking part in party politics.

In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., L. Bradford Prince, and Edwin Merritt—all supporters of Evarts, Conkling's New York rival—to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements. The Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees, and the full Senate rejected Roosevelt and Prince {{by a vote of}} 31–25, confirming Merritt only because Sharpe's term had expired.|$|E
5|$|Mathias officially {{declared}} his candidacy for the Senate on February 10, 1968, calling for troop {{reductions in the}} Vietnam War, and identifying urban blight, racial discrimination, welfare reform, and improving public schools as major issues. As the campaign drew on, the two primary issues became the war and crime. Mathias argued that the extensive bombing campaigns in North Vietnam should be reduced, while Brewster had argued for increasing bombardment. Brewster adopted a hard line stance on law and order, while Mathias advocated addressing the precipitating causes of poverty and the low standard of living in urban ghettos. Campaign finances were also an issue, with controversy erupting over Brewster's receipt of $15,000 in <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions</b> from his Senate staff and their families. On November 5, 1968, Mathias was elected, garnering 48% of the vote to Brewster's 39% and perennial candidate George P. Mahoney's 13%.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{business}} judgment rule protects corporate board's decisions from second guessing by shareholders or the courts, in this case, the board's decision to [...] "loan" [...] {{money to the}} Democratic National Committee was an illegal <b>campaign</b> <b>contribution,</b> {{in violation of the}} Tillman Act. The courts found that the decision not to collect on the loan was a knowing decision of the board's, and that it also constituted an illegal <b>campaign</b> <b>contribution.</b> The business judgement rule, therefore, did not protect the board's decision even from a civil suit by shareholders.|$|R
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions,</b> while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|McCreary {{was not as}} {{successful}} in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions</b> and expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at the capitol – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee {{attempted}} {{to raise more}} individual contributions in smaller dollar amounts compared with the second inauguration of GeorgeW. Bush in 2005. The 2009 contribution limit was set at $50,000for donations by individuals, whereas individuals and companies were able to give a maximum of $250,000 apiece for the 2005 event. As of January 30, 2009, the presidential committee raised more than $53million, with at least 458people giving the committee-imposed maximum of $50,000, including celebrity donors such as George Soros, Halle Berry, Jamie Foxx and George Lucas. Emphasizing a change from business as usual, the committee set stringent guidelines for <b>campaign</b> <b>contributions,</b> barring donations from corporations, political action committees, registered federal lobbyists, labor and trade unions, registered foreign agents and non-U.S.citizens. The committee did accept donations from people with active lobbying interests before the federal government, but not registered as federal lobbyists, such as Google executive Eric Schmidt and Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer.|$|E
