As a result, in 1932, citizens of both cities voted for the annexation of South Jacksonville into Jacksonville. While full city-county <b>consolidation</b> was voted down, the efforts of the 1930s set the stage for further attempts, ultimately resulting in the 1968 Jacksonville <b>Consolidation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{spate of}} {{hospital}} <b>consolidations</b> {{that occurred in}} the late 1990 s and early 2000 s {{had a profound impact on}} the US hospital industry. However, only two published studies using data from five states examined the effects of these <b>consolidations</b> on inpatient quality of care. This paper examines the impacts of hospital <b>consolidations</b> that occurred in 1999 and 2000 in 16 states on 25 measures of quality using pre–post, difference‐in‐differences models. We categorize hospitals participating in <b>consolidations</b> as acquiring institutions, target institutions, or participants in a “merger of equals”. We find that the quality effects of <b>consolidations</b> differ by the hospital’s role and the quality measure used. Acquiring hospitals experienced significantly improved quality with respect to iatrogenic pneumothorax and postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma, but the quality impacts for target hospitals and “mergers of equals” were mixed. Hospital <b>consolidations</b> appear to have complex, inconsistent effects on quality, as measured using all‐payer administrative data, suggesting the need for antitrust agencies to conduct prospective and retrospective reviews of individual mergers.

5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or <b>consolidation)</b> therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of <b>consolidation</b> therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E

We examine how the cost of corporate credit varies around fiscal <b>consolidations</b> aimed at reducing government debt. Using a new dataset on fiscal <b>consolidations</b> and syndicated corporate loan data, we find that loan spreads increase with fiscal <b>consolidations,</b> especially for small firms, domestic firms, and for firms with limited alternative financing sources. These adverse effects are mitigated substantially if <b>consolidations</b> are large, and can be avoided if <b>consolidations</b> are also accompanied with more adaptable macroeconomic policies and implemented by a stable government. These findings suggest that lenders price the short-term recessionary effects in loans but large <b>consolidations</b> can reduce or undo the increase in spreads, especially under favorabl...|$|R

In contrast to existing studies we find that cuts in capital spending at sub-central levels are a feature of successful <b>consolidations.</b> We also show that the government type and the nature of fiscal arrangements in a country impact on these results. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new insights}} {{about the existence}} of expansionary fiscal <b>consolidations</b> in the Economic and Monetary Union, using annual panel data for 14 European Union countries over the period 1970 - 2012. Different measures for assessing fiscal <b>consolidations</b> based on the changes in the cyclically adjusted primary balance were calculated. A similar ad-hoc approach was used to compute monetary expansions, in order to include them in the assessment of non-Keynesian effects for different budgetary components. Panel Fixed Effects estimations for private consumption show that, in some cases, when fiscal <b>consolidations</b> are coupled with monetary expansions, the traditional Keynesian signals are reversed in the cases of general government final consumption expenditure, social transfers and taxes. Keynesian effects prevail when fiscal <b>consolidations</b> are not matched by monetary easing. Panel probit estimations suggest that longer and expenditure-based <b>consolidations</b> contribute positively for its success, whilst the opposite is the case for tax-based ones...|$|R
5|$|The 1951 charter reforms {{included}} <b>consolidation</b> of {{city and}} county offices. When all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices. The new charter allowed for their <b>consolidation,</b> but litigation ensued about which county offices were actually state offices, and thus immune from the city's jurisdiction. A State Supreme Court case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently elected official.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{interaction}} between fiscal <b>consolidations</b> and private sector deleveraging in an economy inside a monetary union. Pre-existing long-term collateralized private debt - a core ingredient of the deleveraging process - plays {{a critical role in}} shaping fiscal multipliers. By buffering the short-run fall in debtors´ spending capacity, long-run private debt reduces the shortrun multipliers of aggressive (large and/or fast) <b>consolidations.</b> However, absent credibility concerns, aggressive <b>consolidations</b> raise the intensity and length of private deleveraging, causing higher output losses over the medium-run. In terms of discounted output losses and welfare, this latter effect dominates, so that larger and faster <b>consolidations</b> are relatively costlier than smaller and more gradual ones. Also, in this environment, alternative budgetary instruments generate sizable differences in terms of their incidence on private deleveraging dynamics and, hence, on their overall output costs of fiscal <b>consolidations.</b> The ADEMU Working Paper Series is being supported by the European Commission Horizon 2020 European Union funding for Research & Innovation, grant agreement No 649396...|$|R
