50|$|While <b>cats</b> <b>have</b> {{a variety}} of breeds and coats, pink is not a natural colour among them. Nevertheless, several {{instances}} of pink <b>cats</b> <b>have</b> been reported by the media, sometimes {{as a result of}} interference with chemicals or dyes rather than any natural genetics. Additionally, several fictional pink <b>cats</b> <b>have</b> been used in popular culture.|$|R
50|$|Feral <b>cats</b> <b>have</b> also {{hampered}} any {{attempts to}} re-introduce threatened species back into {{areas where they}} have become extinct as the <b>cats</b> <b>have</b> hunted and killed the newly released animals.

5000|$|While {{arguments}} {{attempt to}} show that something is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try to show why or how something is or will be. If Fred and Joe {{address the issue of}} whether or not Fred's <b>cat</b> <b>has</b> fleas, Joe may state: [...] "Fred, your <b>cat</b> <b>has</b> fleas. Observe the cat is scratching right now." [...] Joe has made an argument that the <b>cat</b> <b>has</b> fleas. However, if Fred and Joe agree on the fact that the <b>cat</b> <b>has</b> fleas, they may further question why this is so and put forth an explanation: [...] "The reason the <b>cat</b> <b>has</b> fleas is that the weather has been damp." [...] The difference is that the attempt is not to settle whether or not some claim is true, but to show why it is true.|$|R

Her <b>cat</b> <b>had</b> not been fed, nor any arrangements made for it. Prescription medication for the lupus she suffered from was left behind, and Moore had not gotten any more pills from the pharmacy. Despite the shortcomings that ACS found in her treatment of her children, Moore had never missed family events such as birthdays of her children.|$|E
25|$|Douglas Adams {{describes}} {{an attempt to}} enact the experiment in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. By using clairvoyance to see inside the box, {{it was found that}} the cat was neither alive nor dead, but missing, and Dirk's services were employed in order to recover it, Dirk deducing that the <b>cat</b> <b>had</b> simply grown tired of being subjected to the experiment and wandered off (although he admits later that he was actually using the experiment as an attempt to determine the mental state of his friend Richard Macduff, Richard's logical arguments about why the experiment was pointless confirming that he was mentally stable).|$|E

50|$|Since 1988, killing feral <b>cats</b> <b>has</b> been {{illegal in}} Rome, Italy, and the Latium Region which {{includes}} Rome. Since August 1991, feral <b>cats</b> <b>have</b> been protected throughout Italy when a no kill policy was introduced for both cats and dogs.

50|$|<b>Cats</b> <b>have</b> complex dreams while sleeping, {{retaining}} and recalling long {{sequences of}} events {{while they are}} asleep, as many other animals do.

Occasionally <b>cats</b> <b>have</b> violent nightmares with muffled screams and may suddenly wake up screaming from the nightmare.|$|R
500|$|Fritz the Cat {{was created}} in 1959 by Robert Crumb in a {{homemade}} comic book story called [...] "Cat Life", based on the experiences of Fred, the family cat. The character's next appearance was in a 1960 story entitled [...] "Robin Hood". By this point, the <b>cat</b> <b>had</b> become anthropomorphic and had been renamed Fritz, a name derived from a minor unrelated character who appeared briefly in [...] "Cat Life". Fritz appeared in the early 1960s Animal Town strips drawn by Charles and Robert Crumb. Sometimes Fritz was accompanied by Fuzzy the Bunny, who served as an alter ego for Charles, his creator.|$|E

On 14 February 2011, it was reported that a cat called [...] "Larry" [...] had been brought in to address the problem. The London Evening Standard reported that the <b>cat</b> <b>had</b> been selected by David Cameron and his family, from those at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home.|$|E

2500|$|Storm first {{appeared}} in 1975 in the comic book Giant-Size X-Men #1, written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum. [...] In this comic, Wein uses a battle against the living island Krakoa to replace the first-generation X-Men of the 1960s with new X-Men. [...] Storm was an amalgam of two characters Cockrum created: The Black Cat and Typhoon. The Black <b>Cat</b> <b>had</b> Storm's costume, minus the cape, and was submitted for the new X-Men's original lineup. However, during a hiatus in the new X-Men project, other female cat characters like Tigra were introduced, making the Black Cat redundant.|$|E

On September 8, they marched for Chaffin's Farm seven miles east of Richmond. Wood {{described}} {{the next few months}} as [...] "the most comfortable quarters we had occupied during the war." [...] He described the winter encampment there as [...] "jolly", although rations were [...] "scarce", tempting some men to endeavor to cook a stray cat they found.

They offer extra ventilation grilles outside the engine compartment to cope with Southern Nevada's dry desert climate and high summertime temperatures. Las Vegas's Enviro500s have the largest air conditioning system ever created for a transit vehicle, with eight fans fitted on the air conditioning unit. As of October 2006, <b>CAT</b> <b>had</b> firm orders for another 41 [...] of the type worth $29.8 million; these were delivered in late 2007.
