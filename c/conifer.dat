5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive <b>conifer</b> forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and <b>conifer</b> forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is common}} east of the Rocky Mountains, but rare in the Pacific Northwest. In California, where it is widely distributed, the fungus is found {{in a variety of}} plant communities, {{including}} aspen, coastal oak woodland, Douglas Fir, Klamath mixed <b>conifer,</b> montane hardwood, montane hardwood-conifer, montane riparian, Redwood, Sierran mixed <b>conifer,</b> valley oak woodland, valley-foothill riparian, and White Fir. It was found to be the most common Armillaria species in hardwood and mixed oak forests in western Massachusetts.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>conifers</b> are {{an ancient}} group, with a fossil record {{extending}} back about 300 million {{years to the}} Paleozoic in the late Carboniferous period; even many of the modern genera are recognizable from fossils 60–120 million years old. Other classes and orders, now long extinct, also occur as fossils, particularly from the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Fossil <b>conifers</b> included many diverse forms, the most dramatically distinct from modern <b>conifers</b> being some herbaceous <b>conifers</b> with no woody stems. Major fossil orders of <b>conifers</b> or conifer-like plants include the Cordaitales, Vojnovskyales, Voltziales and perhaps also the Czekanowskiales (possibly {{more closely related to}} the Ginkgophyta).|$|R

5|$|Pycnoporellus alboluteus, {{commonly}} known as the orange sponge polypore, is a species of polypore fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae. Distributed throughout the boreal <b>conifer</b> zone, the fungus is found in mountainous regions of western North America, and in Europe. It causes a brown cubical rot of <b>conifer</b> wood, especially spruce, but also fir and poplar. The soft, spongy orange fruit bodies grow spread out on the surface of fallen logs. Mature specimens have tooth-like or jagged pore edges. A snowbank mushroom, P.alboluteus can often be found growing on logs or stumps protruding through melting snow. Although the edibility of the fungus and its usage for human culinary purposes are unknown, several species of beetles use the fungus as a food source.|$|E
5|$|Reptile {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiations based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region one, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand. Deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of <b>conifer</b> or mixed <b>conifer</b> and hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in region two than region one. Region three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to region two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, which tends to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed <b>conifer</b> and broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed <b>conifer</b> and broadleaf forests again dominate.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} {{different}} types of <b>conifers</b> occupying the forest; Coastal Redwood, Douglas Fir, Sitka Spruce, the Western Red Cedar, and the Western Hemlock.

5|$|Romania: A single M.alcathoe was {{captured}} in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains riverine and <b>conifer</b> forest. The species was additionally recorded in a forested valley containing a small stream in Alba County.|$|E
5|$|The <b>conifer</b> and mixed-forests of {{the park}} and its {{surroundings}} provide habitats for northern saw-whet owl, blue-headed vireo, hermit thrush, dark-eyed junco, and magnolia, pine, yellow-rumped, Blackburnian, and black-throated green warblers.

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or {{sometimes}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground or}} on well-decayed <b>conifer</b> logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar. The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B.mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant <b>conifer</b> roots. It has been suggested that B.mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.|$|E

40|$|Soils {{collected}} from eight locations under exotic <b>conifers</b> and adjacent undeveloped grasslands in the montane {{zone of the}} eastern South Island were analysed chemically to examine the hypothesis that <b>conifers</b> increase the availability of nutrients, especially phosphorus, in topsoils.

5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like <b>conifer</b> Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al.

Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of <b>conifer</b> needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
