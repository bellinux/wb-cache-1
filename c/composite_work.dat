2500|$|Edmund Craster {{argued that}} the {{original}} Historia, or rather its [...] "original core", was composed in the mid-10th century soon after the visit of King Edmund (c. 945).

He theorised that chapters 29 to 32 were added in the 1030s, sometime after 1016, it was claimed, chapters 14–19½ along with chapter 33 were interpolated, a claim devised to explain the reference to the Battle of Assandun (1016) contained in chapter 16. Craster's arguments were criticised {{in the introduction to}} South's 2002 edition, where it was argued that the alleged Assandun interpolation was in fact {{an important part of the}} narrative, an argument earlier made by historian Luisella Simpson. South was inclined to date the narrative as a whole to the mid- or late 11th century, but adds that confidence can only come from further stylistic analysis. David Rollason, specialist in Durham history, has backed a similar date, though he does not suggest, like South, that the text was part of an Anglo-Norman revival in history writing. South also stressed that the Historia was a <b>composite</b> <b>work,</b> and that different passages used by the compiler probably do have earlier dates.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} the Nights is {{extremely}} complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle {{the story of how}} the collection as it currently exists came about. Robert Irwin summarises their findings: [...] "In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the Nights by Zotenberg and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the {{history of the}} text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a <b>composite</b> <b>work</b> and that the earliest tales in it came from India and Persia. At some time, probably in the early 8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title Alf Layla, or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of The Thousand and One Nights. The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th century, this original core had Arab stories added to it—among them some tales about the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. Also, perhaps from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book’s title." ...|$|E
