30|$|Kim et al. [12] {{investigated}} crashes {{which occurred}} at rural intersections. The {{results showed that}} clear weather increases the probability of angular and sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the same direction, and decreases the probability of rear-end and sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. Wet surface conditions increase the probability of sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the same direction, while the dry surface conditions increase the probability of angular, rear-end, and sideswipe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction [12].|$|R

30|$|Model 2 {{indicates}} {{the results of}} the probit model for those drivers who were involved in rear-end and angle <b>crashes,</b> <b>in</b> locations with no traffic control devices. Particularly, model 2 showed that route type is a contributing factor <b>in</b> <b>crash</b> severity model. Drivers who were involved in work zone weather-related <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> rural or secondary routes were 37 % more likely to be involved <b>in</b> severe <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> comparison with drivers who were driving on interstate highways. This could be because most of the rural roads are narrow two-way two-lane undivided roads which do not have enough shoulder width. Even secondary roads {{do not have the same}} quality as interstate roadways, which might intensify the severity of <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> rural and secondary roads.|$|R

5|$|Pilot error {{resulting}} in controlled flight into terrain was blamed for five fatal Comet 4 accidents: an Aerolíneas Argentinas crash near Asunción, Paraguay on 27 August 1959, Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 322 at Campinas near São Paulo, Brazil on 23 November 1961, United Arab Airlines Flight 869 in Thailand's Khao Yai mountains on 19 July 1962, a Saudi Arabian Government <b>crash</b> <b>in</b> the Italian Alps on 20 March 1963, and United Arab Airlines Flight 844 in Tripoli, Libya on 2 January 1971.

40|$|Prior {{literature}} suggests that Daylight Saving Time (DST) can both {{increase the risk of}} automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the short run and decrease the risk of automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the long run. We use 28 years (1976 - 2003) of automobile crash data from the United States, and exploit a natural experiment arising from a 1986 federal law that changed the time when states switched to DST to identify the short run and long run effects of DST on automobile crashes. Our findings suggest that (1) DST has no significant detrimental effect on automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the short run; (2) DST significantly reduces automobile <b>crashes</b> <b>in</b> the long run with a 8 - 11 % fall <b>in</b> <b>crashes</b> involving pedestrians, and a 6 - 10 % fall <b>in</b> <b>crashes</b> for vehicular occupants in the weeks after the spring shift to DST. ...|$|R
