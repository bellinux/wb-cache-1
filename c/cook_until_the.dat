40|$|AbstractRendang is a {{traditional}} Minangkabau food which voted by CNN viewers in 2011 {{as one of the}} most delicious foods in the world. The basic ingredients of rendang are beef meat, coconut milk and spices. The process of cooking rendang took around 6 to 7 hours at the temperature around 80 - 95 oC. There are 3 types of food will be produce during the cooking processes differentiated by water content and colors.

As the food is cooked in a relatively longer period of time and with various ingredients it is interesting to know the nutritional value of the food. This paper is presenting a preliminary results of the research which aim to evaluate the nutritional value of rendang by analyzing the chemistry compositions, protein digestibility (in-vitro), the profile of amino acid (HPLC), and measuring molecule weight of protein (SDS-PAGE). The result shown that the protein in rendang is decreased compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein digestibility decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio and the amino acid content is decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein band is increased from fresh meat to kalio and rendang, where in fresh meat have 15 protein bands, 16 in kalio and 17 in rendang...|$|R
