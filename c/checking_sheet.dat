The {{objective of this}} project is to design a circuit to detect the water level in the water tank of the External Chiller and a <b>check</b> <b>sheet</b> to detect water leakage in the cooling system. There are 3 phases to design this project: 1) Determine the water evaporation and usage rate in the cooling system and analyze the information to determine the time taken to completely dry up the water tank; 2) Design a water level detection circuit to sound an alarm when the water level is low; 3) Produce a <b>check</b> <b>sheet</b> {{to aid in the}} early detection of water leakage in the cooling system. With the use of the water level detection circuit, time taken to monitor the water level in the water tank can be reduced to zero.

30|$|All {{patients}} {{admitted to}} a medical ICU at a college affiliated with the Japan Society of Intensive Care Medicine between January 2008 and December 2014 were surveyed prospectively {{for the development of}} CRBSIs. A mandatory educational program (the intervention) targeting an infection control committee consisting of physicians was developed by a multidisciplinary task force to highlight correct practices for preventing CRBSIs. The program included a 30 -min video-based introduction, 120 -min lectures with a number of hands-on training sessions, a post-test, posters, safety <b>check</b> <b>sheets,</b> and feedback from the infection control committee. Lectures based on the education program were held every 3 months, and participants were free to choose when they attended the lectures. Each participant was required to view the 30 -min introduction before attending the 120 -min lectures and complete the post-test after each lecture. Safety <b>check</b> <b>sheets</b> were made to ascertain adherence to contents of the educational program. Posters describing the educational program were posted throughout the ICU. A pre- and post-intervention observational study design was employed, with the main outcome measure being yearly CRBSIs. We also calculated cost savings that resulted from improved CRBSI rates.|$|R
