25|$|With {{the formula}} C5H5N5O, guanine is a {{derivative}} of purine, {{consisting of a}} fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, carotenes are {{polyunsaturated}} hydrocarbons containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable {{numbers of}} hydrogen atoms, {{and no other}} elements. Some carotenes are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or {{both ends of the}} molecule. All are coloured to the human eye, due to extensive systems of <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> Structurally carotenes are tetraterpenes, meaning that they are synthesized biochemically from four 10-carbon terpene units, which in turn are formed from eight 5-carbon isoprene units.|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, {{and other}} {{photosynthetic}} organisms, lycopene {{is an important}} intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, {{which is responsible for}} yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection. Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, i.e. an unsubstituted alkene. Structurally, lycopene is a tetraterpene and assembled from eight isoprene units that are composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen. It is insoluble in water. Lycopene's eleven <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> give its deep red color and its antioxidant activity in vitro. Owing to the strong color, lycopene is a useful food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for usage in the USA, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d) and the EU.|$|E
5000|$|IPA {{is one of}} {{the members}} of the resin acid group which is a {{tricyclic}} diterpene. [...] It has a condensed three-ring structure, one carboxyl-group and a (<b>conjugated)</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|R
50|$|Around the {{perimeter}} of the macrocycle ring, there is a cyclic chain of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, all of which are part of a <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> system, giving the molecule its aromatic character. Resonance structures for porphin can be drawn as shown below here.The aromatic character of porphin stems both from its conjugation as well as its flat or planar geometry, meaning that all the atoms lie in a single plane. Bonded to the cyclic chain of carbons are four nitrogen atoms facing the center of the molecule, two of which are bonded to hydrogen atoms and the other two nitrogens forming part of the <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> system.|$|R

The (2 + 2) π adducts were selectively {{resulted from the}} <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> moiety. Reductive cyclization of the adduct afforded cycloneryl derivatives, whose further chemical conversion were carried out...|$|R
25|$|Lycopene is a {{symmetrical}} tetraterpene assembled {{from eight}} isoprene units. It {{is a member}} of the carotenoid family of compounds, and because it consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen, is also a carotene. Isolation procedures for lycopene were first reported in 1910, and the structure of the molecule was determined by 1931. In its natural, all-trans form, the molecule is long and straight, constrained by its system of eleven <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> Each extension in this conjugated system reduces the energy required for electrons to transition to higher energy states, allowing the molecule to absorb visible light of progressively longer wavelengths. Lycopene absorbs all but the longest wavelengths of visible light, so it appears red.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of suitable matrix compounds {{is determined to}} some extent by trial and error, but {{they are based on}} some specific molecular design considerations. They are of a fairly low molecular weight (to allow easy vaporization), but are large enough (with a low enough vapor pressure) not to evaporate during sample preparation or while standing in the mass spectrometer. They are often acidic, therefore act as a proton source to encourage ionization of the analyte. Basic matrices have also been reported. They have a strong optical absorption in either the UV or IR range, so that they rapidly and efficiently absorb the laser irradiation. This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds,</b> as seen in the structure of cinnamic acid. They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{useful in}} {{detecting}} <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{the new technology}} {{made it possible for}} researchers like Ralph Holman and George O. Burr to study dietary fats, work that had significant implications for human diet. The DU spectrophotometer was also used in the study of [...] steroids by researchers like Alejandro Zaffaroni, who helped to develop the birth control pill, the nicotine patch, and corticosteroids.|$|E

When the amino acid was changed from sarcosine to L-proline, the product formation took a different course as determined by 2 D NMR and X-ray crystallographic analysis...|$|R
25|$|Both {{saturated}} (alicyclic) {{compounds and}} unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain {{five or six}} carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered cyclopropane ((CH2)3). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or <b>conjugated)</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond.</b> Cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do.|$|R
5000|$|Dalfopristin is {{synthesized}} from pristinamycine IIa through {{achieving a}} stereoselective Michael-type addition of 2-diethylaminoethanethiol on the <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> of the dehydroproline ring [...] The first method found was using sodium periodate associated with ruthenium dioxide to directly oxidize the sulfur derivative into a sulfone. However, using hydrogen peroxide with sodium tungstate in a 2-phase medium produces an improved yield, {{and is therefore}} the method of choice for large scale production.|$|R
2500|$|The {{biochemical}} {{mechanism by}} which α-parinaric acid is formed in the plant Impatiens balsamina was elaborated using techniques of molecular biology. The enzyme responsible {{for the creation of}} the <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> was identified using expressed sequence tags, and called a [...] "conjugase". This enzyme is related to the family of fatty acid desaturase enzymes responsible for putting double bonds into fatty acids.|$|E
2500|$|Lutein is {{isomeric}} with zeaxanthin, differing only in {{the placement}} of one double bond. The principal natural stereoisomer of lutein is -beta,epsilon-carotene-3,3-diol. Lutein is a lipophilic molecule and is generally insoluble in water. The presence of the long chromophore of <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> (polyene chain) provides the distinctive light-absorbing properties. [...] The polyene chain is susceptible to oxidative degradation by light or heat and is chemically unstable in acids.|$|E
2500|$|Aromatic {{hydrocarbons}} contain <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> This {{means that}} every carbon atom {{in the ring}} is sp2 hybridized, allowing for added stability. The most important example is benzene, the structure of which was formulated by Kekulé who first proposed the delocalization or resonance principle for explaining its structure. [...] For [...] "conventional" [...] cyclic compounds, aromaticity is conferred {{by the presence of}} 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons, where n is an integer. [...] Particular instability (antiaromaticity) is conferred by the presence of 4n conjugated pi electrons.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the early}} studies on structure–activity of {{phenolic}} acids and their derivatives stated that the hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives had higher antioxidant capacities when compared to their benzoic acid counterparts [51]. This ability was attributed {{to the presence of}} propenoic side chain, instead of the carboxylic group of benzoic acid derivatives; the <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> in their side chains has a profound effect by resonance on the phenoxyl radical, thus enhancing the antioxidant capacities.|$|R
50|$|Resin acid is {{the general}} name {{for all kinds of}} acids that share the same basic skeleton, a three-fused ring and the {{empirical}} formula C20H30O2. The resin acids may be classified into two types, abietic and pimaric. The abietic-type group include levopimaric, l-abietic and neoabietic. The structure of these compounds differ only in the position of the <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> system. This feature influences their chemical reactivity. The pimaric-type acids are dextropimaric and isodextropimaric.|$|R

2500|$|... α-Parinaric acid is a {{conjugated}} polyunsaturated fatty acid. Discovered by Tsujimoto and Koyanagi in 1933, {{it contains}} 18 carbon atoms and 4 <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> The repeating single bond-double bond structure of α-parinaric acid distinguishes it structurally and chemically {{from the usual}} [...] "methylene-interrupted" [...] arrangement of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have double-bonds and single bonds separated by a methylene unit (−CH2−). Because of the fluorescent properties conferred by the alternating double bonds, α-parinaric acid is commonly used as a molecular probe {{in the study of}} biomembranes.|$|E
2500|$|HxA3, HxB3, {{and their}} isomers are {{distinguished}} from most other eicosanoids (i.e. signaling molecules made by oxidation of 20-carbon fatty acids) {{in that they}} contain both epoxide and hydroxyl residues; they are structurally differentiated in particular from two other classes of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, the leukotrienes and lipoxins, in that they lack <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bonds.</b> HxA4 and HxB4 are distinguished from HxA3 and HxB3 by possessing four rather than three double bonds. The 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 non-classical eicosanoids are distinguished from the aforementioned hepoxilins {{in that they are}} formed by a different metabolic pathway and differ in the positioning of their epoxide and hydroxyl residues. [...] Two other classes of epoxyalcohol fatty acids, those derived from the 22-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and the 18-carbon fatty acid, linoleic acid, are distinguished from the aforementioned hepoxilins by their carbon chain length; they are termed hepoxilin-like rather than hepoxilins. A hepoxilin-like derivative of linoleic acid is formed on linoleic acid that is esterified to a sphingosine in a complex lipid termed esterified omega-hydroxylacyl-sphingosin (EOS).|$|E

By HPLC-UV the AA evaluated tocopherols and squalene concentrations, of an extravirgin olive oil subjected to domestic frying. Results {{show that the}} squalene is more resistant to thermal degradation than α-tocopherol. The bi-dimensional fluorescence characterization (excitation-emission matrix EEM analysis) allowed to detect, among degradation products, tetraconjugated <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> compounds as parinaric acid isomers.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} carotenoids arises {{as a result}} of the ability of the <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> structure to delocalise species containing unpaired electrons. However, recent clinical trials explored potential prooxidant behaviour of certain carotenoids. In view of these findings we attempted to perform a study of a potential prooxidant effect of the lycopene. A model system which employed oxidation of triglyceride in the presence of lycopene was studied. The results have shown increased formation of hydroperoxides in the presence of lycopene with respect to control experiment (no lycopene). This prooxidant effect of lycopene was found to be reversed by α-tocopherol...|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{drying oil}} containing non-conjugated (linseed oil) and <b>conjugated</b> (tung oil) <b>double</b> <b>bonds</b> catalyzed by Co(II) - 2 -ethylhexanoate (Co-EH) is investigated. There is distinctive {{difference in the}} oxidation mechanism between the two model oils. For the non-conjugated linseed oil, H-abstraction occurs via the most susceptible double allylic H atom. A large amount of oxygen is taken up, leading {{to the formation of}} hydroperoxides; the hydroperoxides are then decomposed into alkoxy and peroxy free radicals, followed by the formation of cross-links and byproducts. In contrast, for the mainly conjugated tung oil, the oxidation has to start with H-abstraction from the monoallylic position. In comparison with linseed oil, a lower amount of oxygen is consumed, and much less hydroperoxides and byproducts are formed. It indicates that, once free radicals are formed, they tend to directly add to a <b>conjugated</b> <b>double</b> <b>bond,</b> instead of abstracting a monoallylic H atom. A tentative explanation is given in terms of bond dissociation energy of related bonds...|$|R
