40|$|Businesses {{are accused}} of using {{arbitration}} as a private dispute resolution system that shields their transgressions from public scrutiny, uses arbitrators and institutions that are perceived as biased, and prevents any real means of justice to the consumer. Something {{must be done to}} ensure that consumers facing mandatory arbitration <b>clauses</b> within contracts <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> are protected from businesses that seek to use arbitration as an advantageous means to resolve disputes. The American public, a section of Congress, and the arbitration community are all responding, but out-of-date law and recent decisions are thwarting their efforts. It is time for Congress to act, but in doing so it must recognize that old biases toward the use of arbitration will not move the discussion forward. Congress must seek to address the use of arbitration in consumer contracts without creating new issues by prohibiting the use of arbitration in its entirety and/or by attempting to protect consumers from contract clauses that do not seek to enhance the power imbalance that is inherent within contracts <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> This Article will seek to address these issues by first identifying the issues relating to the FAA, the surrounding case law, and the alternative readings of section 2 of the FAA. The Article will then examine and reject some of the early attempts at addressing those issues while considering current attempts by both academics and industry to address the issue <b>of</b> contracts <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> and arbitration <b>clauses.</b> The Article will conclude, in Part III, by considering who should be protected, identifying what they should be protected from and how those protections can be accomplished. Finally, the Article will claim that Congress must seek to protect a narrow class of individuals from significantly disadvantageous arbitration <b>clauses</b> within contracts <b>of</b> <b>adhesion...</b>|$|R
25|$|Starting in the mid-1980s, the Court {{has greatly}} {{expanded}} {{the reach of}} Prima Paint in later cases. Since some of these have applied to the expanded use <b>of</b> arbitration <b>clauses</b> in contracts <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> between companies and consumers, some consumer advocates and legal scholars have criticized the decision as the inadvertent opening wedge of {{an assault on the}} right to litigate, and a weakening of state contract law and the Erie Railroad principle of deference to state common law. Defenders of the decision have responded that it simply began bringing the U.S. more in line with international arbitration practice, helping American companies compete in a global economy. One, Alan Rau, has also argued that it is justified not just by the Arbitration Act but by general principles of contract law.|$|R

The relationship <b>of</b> the <b>clauses</b> in a sentence is especially important concerning complex sentences, in which the <b>clauses</b> are not <b>of</b> the same level but show a dependency.

For this reason, most of the people try to avoid them, and use simple clauses instead, nevertheless, this somehow loses the meaning and originality of the idea.

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} concept used {{to quantify}} adhesion on a fundamental molecular level {{is the work}} <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> However, most <b>of</b> the experimental techniques give no, or very limited information about its magnitude. In this paper, a way to estimate the work <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> for copper-(acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) (ABS) interface using molecular dynamics simulations is presented. The work <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> is calculated from the interactions between single molecules constituting the ABS polymer (poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) and polybutadiene molecules) and copper (oxide) surface, using their van der Waals contact area. The calculated work <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> seems to be independent {{of the number of}} polymer molecules present on the copper surface, monomer residue unit sequence within the polymer molecule, and the type of copper surface. Introduction of oxygen atoms to the metallic surface and the polymer molecules significantly increases the work <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> The highest work <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> was found between the oxidized copper surface and high oxygen content copolymer poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride). Results are shown to qualitatively correspond to previously reported experimental observations...|$|R

Appreciation of the pathophysiology <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> development described herein should allow a more informed approach to the rapidly evolving field <b>of</b> intra-abdominal <b>adhesions</b> and should serve as a reference for an evidence-based approach to consideration for the prevention and treatment <b>of</b> <b>adhesions...</b>|$|R
