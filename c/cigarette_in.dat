He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E

Later, at night, he is arrested for doing graffiti, and his parents pick him up at the police station.

According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> front of a police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge {{him out of the}} way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The largest fire in {{the park}} was the North Fork fire, {{both in terms of}} damage to {{structures}} and of area burned. The fire started on July 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> Caribou-Targhee National Forest just outside the park's western border. The North Fork fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15. The fire spread towards the northeast {{and by the end of}} the first week of August was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20. Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze. The fire continued its eastward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau and on August 25 reached visitor facilities at Canyon, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down-sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone, Montana. There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley.|$|E

Its share of cigarette production reached a top figure in 1911 when Strengberg accounted for nearly half of the <b>cigarettes</b> produced <b>in</b> Sweden.

25|$|Brynner began smoking heavily at age 12, and {{although}} his promotional photos often showed {{him with a}} <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> hand, he quit the habit in 1971. In September 1983, he found a lump on his vocal cords. In Los Angeles, only hours before his 4,000th performance in The King and I, he received the test results indicating that while his throat was fine, he had inoperable lung cancer. He and the national tour of the musical were forced {{to take a few}} months off while he underwent radiation therapy, which hurt his throat and made it impossible for him to sing or speak easily. The tour then resumed.|$|E

With a hint of the debonair style that was to characterise his life, he avoided participation in the OTC and all study of mathematics and science, instead enjoying art, French poetry and racquet sports. As a senior boy he was caned for making an unlicensed visit to Wimbledon; it was his misfortune that he figured, smoking a <b>cigarette,</b> <b>in</b> a photograph of spectators carried in his headmaster's newspaper the following morning.|$|E

25|$|That night Walt goes to {{the gang}} members' house, where they draw their weapons on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the {{attention}} of the neighbors. Putting a <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> his mouth, he asks for a light, then puts his hand in his jacket and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo cigarette lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy stay in prison.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{days after}} Bonin had been {{released}} from custody, on March 14, he abducted and killed an 18-year-old Van Nuys youth named Ronald Gatlin. Gatlin was abducted shortly after he had left a friend's home. He was beaten, sodomized and suffered several deep, perforating ice pick wounds to the ear and neck before being strangled with a ligature. Gatlin's body, bound hand and foot, was found the following day {{in the city of}} Duarte. One week later, on March 21, Bonin lured a 14-year-old named Glenn Barker into his van as the youth hitchhiked to school. Barker was also raped, beaten and strangled to death with a ligature; his body also bore evidence of numerous burns to the neck which had been inflicted with a lit <b>cigarette.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Barker had been violated with foreign objects which had extensively distended his rectum. At 4 p.m. the same day, a 15-year-old named Russell Rugh was abducted from a bus stop in Garden Grove. Rugh was bound, beaten and strangled to death after an estimated eight hours of captivity before his body was discarded alongside that of Glenn Barker in Cleveland National Forest. The youths' nude bodies were found on March 23.|$|E
