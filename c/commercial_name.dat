5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under <b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{marketing}} potential of <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> involved in the clientoriented communication and, more precisely, on the mechanisms of semantic derivation proper {{to the formation of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>names.</b> The author argues that the semantic shifts in the meaning of the original word result from its use {{as a part of a}} commercial message, i. e. for the transmission of specific marketing information. One of the current trends in contemporary Russian <b>commercial</b> <b>naming</b> is related to the actualization of the marketing content components (MCCs) ‘big’ and ‘small’ which communicate complementary information about the named object. The marketing content component ‘big’ communicates the idea of respectability, economic might, wide choice of goods. This idea is most commonly transmitted by the foreign language prefixes mega-, super-, hyper-, grand-, maxi-, macro-, big-. In <b>commercial</b> <b>naming</b> their meanings overlap, making them stereotypic means of advertising. The marketing content component ‘small’ often appears in the names of cosy cafés and restaurants, cheap shops and child care institutions. This marketing content component can be communicated by foreign language prefixes, e. g. mini-, micro-, nano-, but it is most often actualized by Russian diminutive suffixes. The analised MCCs are also transmitted by means of direct, metaphoric, metonymic and symbolic names in which it is also possible to distinguish stereotypic patterns of <b>commercial</b> <b>naming...</b>|$|R
25|$|Aix-les-Bains {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} French cities to have had a cinema. Today it has no less than three cinemas which are the Victoria, the Rex, and the Les Toiles du Lac of Aix-les-Bains. These three institutions are all owned by the same owner. With the creation of the multiplex Les Toiles du Lac offering eight rooms, the Rex with its two rooms is slowly disappearing. The Victoria, with its five rooms, should be retained and is still in operation. It is expected to gradually accommodate original films, arts films and trial releases. In addition, the establishment has the second casino of Aix-les-Bains. Smaller than the Casino Grand-Cercle, the Nouveau Casino, which is its <b>commercial</b> <b>name,</b> has an honorable playground of forty-five slot machines, a boule table, thirteen rollers (dice, roulette, etc.), fifteen video-rollers and seventeen video-poker screens.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, the Twins {{took the}} rights to the {{broadcasts}} in-house and created the Twins Radio Network (TRN). With that new network in place the Twins secured a new Metro Affiliate flagship radio station in KSTP. It replaced WCCO, which held broadcast rights for the Twins since the team moved to Minneapolis in 1961. For 2013, the Twins moved to FM radio on KTWN-FM 96.3 K-Twin, which is owned by the Pohlad family. The original radio voices of the Twins in 1961 were Ray Scott, Halsey Hall and Bob Wolff. After the first season, Herb Carneal replaced Wolff. Twins TV and radio broadcasts were originally sponsored by the Hamm's Brewing Company. In 2009, Treasure Island Resort & Casino became the first ever naming rights partner for the Twins Radio Network, making the <b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> of TRN the Treasure Island Baseball Network.|$|E
25|$|A large {{majority}} (93 percent) of fatalities from paraquat poisoning are suicides, which occur mostly in developing countries. For instance, in Samoa from 1979–2001, 70 percent of suicides were by paraquat poisoning. Trinidad and Tobago is particularly {{well known for}} its incidence of suicides involving the use of Gramoxone (<b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> of paraquat). In southern Trinidad, particularly in Penal, Debe from 1996–1997, 76 percent of suicides were by paraquat, 96 percent of which involved the over-consumption of alcohol such as rum. Fashion celebrity Isabella Blow committed suicide using paraquat in 2007. Paraquat is widely used as a suicide agent in third-world countries because it is widely available at low cost. Further, the toxic dose is low (10mL or 2teaspoons is enough to kill). Campaigns exist to control or even ban paraquat, and there are moves to restrict its availability by requiring user education and the locking up of paraquat stores.|$|E

It was based on the invention of the magnetic tape (1928) by Fritz Pfleumer, which used similar technology but with open reels (for which the tape was manufactured by BASF). These instruments were very expensive and relatively difficult to use and were therefore used mostly by professionals in radio stations and recording studios.|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> having {{reference}} to the cultural space of Russia. Their connotative meaning includes a ‘Russian ethno-cultural marker’ (REM) actualized in the advertising discourse by a multi-coded text constituted by an integrated complex of semantic, stylistic, and symbolic verbal and visual signs. The article analyzes the verbal means of expression of the REM in commercial naming: lexical, semantic, and stylistic features of the names; national precedent phenomena reflected by the words designating elements of Russian spiritual and material culture; notions of Russian history; ethnonyms; culture-specific vocabulary; archaic words; precedent personal names and toponyms; Russian colloquial expressions. The author also analyzes graphic elements and models of <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> formation as supplementary REM actualizers. The article focuses on three major functions of REM-names: informational, phatic, and connotative functions, outlining their spheres of use in commercial discourse, particularly in the <b>commercial</b> <b>naming</b> of Russian state enterprises and brands and in labeling exported goods and services. The Russian ethnically marked names represent an open, dynamically developing system which can be represented as a field structure whose center is constituted by <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> including ethnonyms, culture-specific vocabulary and words designating national precedent phenomena, and the periphery by all Russian names...|$|R

2500|$|In 1911 arsphenamine, {{the first}} {{synthetic}} anti-infective drug, {{was developed by}} Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim of the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin. The drug was given the <b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> Salvarsan. [...] Ehrlich, noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria, hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties {{could be used to}} treat bacterial infections. [...] Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds, and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity.

2500|$|Pure {{polystyrene}} is brittle, {{but hard}} enough that a fairly high-performance product {{can be made}} by giving it some of the properties of a stretchier material, such as polybutadiene rubber. The two such materials can never normally be mixed because of the small mixing entropy of polymers (see Flory-Huggins solution theory), but if polybutadiene is added during polymerisation it can become chemically bonded to the polystyrene, forming a graft copolymer, which helps to incorporate normal polybutadiene into the final mix, resulting in high-impact polystyrene or HIPS, often called [...] "high-impact plastic" [...] in advertisements. One <b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> for HIPS is Bextrene. Common applications of HIPS include toys and product casings. HIPS is usually injection molded in production. Autoclaving polystyrene can compress and harden the material.|$|E

2500|$|The gene {{encoding}} IFNα2, the IFNA2 gene, is clustered {{with all}} other type I IFN genes on chromosome 9 [...] and as all type I IFN genes, it is devoid of intron. The open reading frame (coding sequence) of IFNA2 codes for a pre-protein of 188 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide allowing secretion of the mature protein. The mature protein is made of 165 amino acids, one less than the other human IFNα subtypes. The secondary structure of IFNα2 consists of five α-helices: A to E, from the N-terminal to the C-terminal end. Helices A, B, C and E are organized as a bundle with a long loop between the helices A and B (the A-B loop) and two disulfide bonds which connect helix E to the A-B loop and helix C to the N-terminal end. Several variants, or allelic variants, {{have been identified in}} the human population.

2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc cutting equipment. These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the <b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. Lower recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E
