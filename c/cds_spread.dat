25|$|Capital Structure Arbitrage is {{an example}} of an {{arbitrage}} strategy that uses CDS transactions. This technique relies on the fact that a company's stock price and its <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> should exhibit negative correlation; i.e., if the outlook for a company improves then its share price should go up and its <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> should tighten, since it is less likely to default on its debt. However, if its outlook worsens then its <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> should widen and its stock price should fall.|$|E
25|$|All {{things being}} equal, {{at any given}} time, if the {{maturity}} of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a higher <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> is considered more likely to default by the market, since a higher fee is being charged to protect against this happening. However, factors such as liquidity and estimated loss given default can affect the comparison. Credit spread rates and credit ratings of the underlying or reference obligations are considered among money managers {{to be the best}} indicators of the likelihood of sellers of CDSs having to perform under these contracts.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if {{a company}} has {{announced}} some bad news and its share price has dropped by 25%, but its <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> has remained unchanged, then an investor might expect the <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> to increase relative to the share price. [...] Therefore, a basic strategy would be to go long on the <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> (by buying CDS protection) while simultaneously hedging oneself by buying the underlying stock. [...] This technique would benefit {{in the event of}} the <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> widening relative to the equity price, but would lose money if the company's <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> tightened relative to its equity.|$|E

2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{situation in}} which the inverse correlation between a company's stock price and <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> breaks down is during a Leveraged buyout (LBO). [...] Frequently this leads to the company's <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> widening due to the extra debt that will soon be put on the company's books, but also an increase [...] in its share price, since buyers of a company usually end up paying a premium.|$|E
2500|$|Transactions such {{as these}} do not {{even have to be}} entered into over the long-term. [...] If Risky Corp's <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> had widened by just a couple of basis points over the course of one day, the hedge fund could have entered into an {{offsetting}} contract immediately and made a small profit {{over the life of the}} two CDS contracts.|$|E
2500|$|After 1 year, {{the market}} now {{considers}} Risky Corp {{more likely to}} default, so its <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> has widened from 500 to 1500 basis points. [...] The hedge fund may choose to sell $10million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this higher rate. [...] Therefore, over the two years the hedge fund pays the bank 2 * 5% * $10million = $1million, but receives 1 * 15% * $10million = $1.5million, giving a total profit of $500,000.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Lehman Brothers, it is claimed that the {{widening}} of the bank's <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> reduced confidence in the bank and ultimately gave it further problems {{that it was not}} able to overcome. [...] However, proponents of the CDS market argue that this confuses cause and effect; CDS spreads simply reflected the reality that the company was in serious trouble. [...] Furthermore, they claim that the CDS market allowed investors who had counterparty risk with Lehman Brothers to reduce their exposure in {{the case of}} their default.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "spread" [...] of a CDS is {{the annual}} amount the {{protection}} buyer must pay the protection seller over {{the length of}} the contract, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} notional amount. For example, if the <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> of Risky Corp is 50 basis points, or 0.5% (1 basis point = 0.01%), then an investor buying $10million worth of protection from AAA-Bank must pay the bank $50,000. [...] Payments are usually made on a quarterly basis, in arrears. [...] These payments continue until either the CDS contract expires or Risky Corp defaults.|$|E
2500|$|In another scenario, {{after one}} year the market now {{considers}} Risky {{much less likely to}} default, so its <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> has tightened from 500 to 250 basis points. [...] Again, the hedge fund may choose to sell $10million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this lower spread. [...] Therefore, over the two years the hedge fund pays the bank 2 * 5% * $10million = $1million, but receives 1 * 2.5% * $10million = $250,000, giving a total loss of $750,000. This loss is smaller than the $1million loss that would have occurred if the second transaction had not been entered into.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the days}} and weeks leading up to Bear's collapse, the bank's <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> widened dramatically, {{indicating}} a surge of buyers taking out protection on the bank. [...] It has been suggested [...] that this widening was responsible for the perception that Bear Stearns was vulnerable, and therefore restricted its access to wholesale capital, which eventually led to its forced sale to JP Morgan in March. [...] An alternative view is that this surge in CDS protection buyers was a symptom rather than a cause of Bear's collapse; i.e., investors saw that Bear was in trouble, and sought to hedge any naked exposure to the bank, or speculate on its collapse.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} feared {{at the time}} of Lehman's {{bankruptcy}} that the $400billion notional of CDS protection which had been written on the bank could lead to a net payout of $366billion from protection sellers to buyers (given the cash-settlement auction settled at a final price of 8.625%) and that these large payouts could lead to further bankruptcies of firms without enough cash to settle their contracts. [...] However, industry estimates after the auction suggest that net cashflows were only in the region of $7billion. because many parties held offsetting positions. [...] Furthermore, CDS deals are marked-to-market frequently. [...] This would have led to margin calls from buyers to sellers as Lehman's <b>CDS</b> <b>spread</b> widened, reducing the net cashflows on the days after the auction.|$|E

40|$|We describe, for {{the first}} time, a cluster of lethal fulminant health-care {{associated}} Clostridium difficile (CD) colitis in Italy, observed {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) of an Italian tertiary care hospital in Rome. For all cases the cause of ICU admission was CD-related septic shock. Three out of seven patients were residents in a long-term care facility in Rome, and the others had been transferred to the ICU from different medical wards of the same hospital. Five patients died within 96 h of ICU admission. Because of a clinical deterioration after 4 days of adequate antibiotic therapy, two patients underwent subtotal colectomy: both of them died within 30 days of surgical intervention. In four cases, ribotyping assay was performed and ribotype 027 was recognized. This high mortality rate could be attributable to three findings: the extent of disease severity induced by the strain 027, the delay in antimicrobial therapy administration, and the lack of efficacy of the standard antibiotic treatment for fulminant CD colitis compared to an earlier surgical approach. In order to contain a CD infection epidemic, control and surveillance measures should be implemented, and empirical therapy should be administered. Because of potential 027 ribotype <b>CD</b> <b>spread</b> in Italy, CDI should be regarded with a high index of suspicion in all patients presenting with shock and signs or symptoms suggesting abdominal disease, and an early surgical approach should be considered...|$|R

40|$|HeLa, Vero, L, HEp 2, and MDBK cells respond {{immediately}} to 0. 2 – 0. 5 µg/ml cytochalasin D (CD) with sustained contraction (contracture), loss of microvilli, expression of endoplasmic contents (zeiosis), nuclear protrusion, and extension of cytoplasmic processes. The {{development of these}} changes is depicted, and the dose-response patterns in these cell lines are described. MDBK is generally most resistant and HeLa most sensitive to these effects of CD. Cells in G 1 are most sensitive to CD; responsiveness decreases progressively during early S and is least in mid S through G 2. CD inhibits transport of [14 C]deoxyglucose in HeLa by about 45 % but has no significant effect on hexose uptake in Vero and MDBK; sugar transport is thus apparently unrelated to any morphologic effect of <b>CD.</b> Although <b>spreading</b> and attachment are impeded, CD does not decrease and may even enhance the adhesiveness of established monolayers. Contraction {{appears to be a}} primary early effect of CD, upon which other visible changes follow. It is prevented by some inhibitors of energy metabolism (deoxyglucose and dinitrophenol) and does not occur in glycerinated models without ATP. The possible bases of the contractile response to CD are discussed. Although direct or indirect action of CD on some microfilaments may occur, a generalized structural disruption of contractile filaments by CD is considered unlikely...|$|R

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) {{can respond}} to a few viral peptide-MHC-I (pMHC-I) complexes among a myriad of virus-unrelated endogenous self pMHC-I complexes displayed on virus-infected cells. To elucidate the molecular recognition events on live CTL, we have utilized a self-assembled biosensor composed of semiconductor nanocrystals, quantum dots, carrying a controlled number of virus-derived (cognate) and other (noncognate) pMHC-I complexes and examined their recognition by antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) on anti-virus CD 8 (+) T cells. The unique architecture of nanoscale quantum dot/pMHC-I conjugates revealed that unexpectedly strong multivalent CD 8 -MHC-I interactions underlie the cooperative contribution of noncognate pMHC-I to the recognition of cognate pMHC-I by TCR to augment T cell responses. The cooperative, <b>CD</b> 8 -dependent <b>spread</b> of signal from a few productively engaged TCR to many other TCR can explain the remarkable ability of CTL to respond to virus-infected cells that present few cognate pMHC-I complexes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Optical fiber {{is capable}} of {{providing}} {{the solution to the}} need of high bandwidth communication. The main degradation to the optical signal integrity in single mode fibers (SMFs) is chromatic dispersion (CD). The effect of <b>CD</b> is pulse <b>spreading</b> which in turn leads to inter-symbol interference (ISI), thus increasing the bit error rate (BER) of the system. This paper presents a CD compensation technique that utilizes a parallel optical all pass filter (p-OAPF), where the design is based on the inverse phase response of the SMF. The p-OAPF is based on a class of all-pass filter. Simulation results of the proposed technique show an increase in the repeater-less length of a point-to-point optical communication system by 3 times with Gaussian pulses at 10 Gb/s and BER of 10 - 9. A passive infinite impulse response filter structure is proposed for the implementation of the p-OAPF.

The effect of <b>CD</b> is pulse <b>spreading</b> which in turn leads to inter-symbol interference, thus resulting in the deterioration of the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system. An alternative CD compensation technique that utilises a parallel optical all pass filter (p-OAPF) is presented, where the p-OAPF design is based on the inverse phase response of the SMF. The p-OAPF is based on a class of all-pass filter. Simulation results of the proposed technique show an increase in the repeater-less length of a point-to-point optical communication system by up to three and four times using a non-return-to-zero data format with a rectangular and Gaussian pulse shape, respectively, at error-free condition (BER< 10 ? 9). The results also show that the p-OAPF is robust in performing dispersion equalisation at a wide range of SMF lengths to attain error-free communication...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) {{has been}} {{isolated}} {{with increasing frequency}} in Brazilian hospitals. Since June 2003, its detection in a teaching hospital {{in the city of}} Florianópolis, Brazil, has increased. This study aimed to investigate the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), presence of Metallo-&# 946;-lactamase (M&# 946;L) and a possible clonal relationship among the isolates. METHODS: The study included 29 CRPA and seven isolates with reduced susceptibility. The MIC was determined by agar-dilution. Detection of M&# 946;L was performed by Double Disk Sinergism (DDS) and Combined Disk (CD). The M&# 946;L gene was verified by PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis. Epidemiological typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Among the 29 carbapenem-resistant isolates, polymyxin B presented 100 % susceptibility and piperacillin/tazobactam 96. 7 %. Seventeen (62 %) strains were verified as clonal (A clone) and among these, six isolates indicated phenotypically positive tests for M&# 946;L and harbored the blaSPM- 1 gene. The first CRPA isolates were unrelated to clone A, harbored blaIMP- 16 and were phenotypically positive only by <b>CD.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The <b>spread</b> of a high-level of resistance clone suggests cross transmission as an important dissemination mechanism and has contributed to the increased rate of resistance to carbapenems. This study emphasizes the need for continuous surveillance and improved strategies...|$|R
