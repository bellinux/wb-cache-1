5|$|Early in {{the process}} that was {{to lead to the}} 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which {{detailed}} John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series. The new series would have established a new continuity rather than following on from the classic series, and the bible reused many elements from the classic series. It is unclear whether clearance could have been obtained for all the episodes detailed, as the <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> likely have fallen to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, 270 {{sales were}} {{necessary}} to attain break-even and with 751 expected deliveries its Internal rate of return outlook was at 19%, but due to disruptions in the ramp-up leading to overcosts and delayed deliveries, it increased to 420 in 2006. In 2010, EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break-even could be achieved by 2015 when 200 deliveries were projected.

30|$|In {{monetary}} terms, we {{can take}} the polar cases of Germany and the UK. Suppose that we equate the marginal cost of the market to 10, 000 euros, the per-refugee compensation given by the Asylum and Migration Fund. The total cost, both under the existing pledges and under the market, would be equal to 40, 137 pledges times 10, 000 euros, that is 201 million euros. Under {{the current system of}} pledges, Germany’s <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> be equal to 150 million while the UK’s <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> be limited to 715, 000 euros. If the market were to be implemented, though, Germany would actually turn a profit of 77 million euros, while the UK’s <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> rise to 54 million.|$|R
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. The windows {{are believed to have}} been purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could have been following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E
5|$|A committee, led by Erik Himle {{and later}} Preben Munthe, was {{appointed}} in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle {{was about to}} the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including one airport in Florø. Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the {{government}} was spending NOK 1.4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from NSB. By introducing PSO, Skogsholm stated that she hoped the <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> be reduced, and that quality and safety levels would remain, or even improve. The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo. Skogsholm stated that {{the government}} had no plans to sell NSB.|$|E

5|$|Filmed in Canada, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations {{during the summer and}} autumn of 1999. In January 1999, Travolta flew his private Boeing 727 on a secret visit to Montreal to scout out locations for shooting. The film was reported to have been the most expensive production shot in Canada up to that point. It was also reported that the production <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> have been twice as high had the film been shot in the United States. Almost every shot in the film is at a Dutch angle, because, according to Roger Christian, he wanted the film to look like a comic book.|$|E
5|$|New York voters {{passed a}} {{transportation}} bond issue on November 8, 2005, allowing for dedicated funding allocated for that phase. Its passage {{had been seen}} as critical to its construction, but the bond was passed only by a narrow margin, with 55 percent of voters approving and 45 percent disapproving. At the time, the MTA said that the project would be done in 2012 in case the city's 2012 Summer Olympics bid succeeded, which it had not. On December 18, 2006, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced that they would allow the MTA to commit up to $693 million in funds to begin construction of the Second Avenue Subway and that the federal share of such <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> be reimbursed with FTA transit funds, subject to appropriations and final labor certification. The USDOT also later gave $1.3 billion in federal funding for the project's first phase, to be funded over a seven-year period.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures {{had done something}} similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E

It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an operating cost of NOK3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK1 million, {{and the rest of}} the operating <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> have to be taken by the municipality.

5|$|Thomas O'Brien was a Canadian miner and {{businessman}} who had prospered considerably during the rush, investing widely in businesses {{across the city}} {{to become one of}} the wealthiest of the local hotel and saloon owners. O'Brien had considerable confidence that Dawson would continue to grow as an economic powerhouse in the region, both because of its remaining gold deposits and the presence of Canadian government institutions. O'Brien believed that transportation <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> inevitably keep the prices for imported beer high in Dawson and make a local brewery a profitable venture, with the potential to export its product into the neighbouring U.S. district of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Until 1918, the {{majority}} of the primary roads through southern Ontario formed part of the County Road System. The Department of Public Works and Highways paid up to 60% of the construction and maintenance costs for these roads, while the counties were responsible for the remaining 40%. In 1919, the federal government passed the Canada Highways Act, which provided $20,000,000 to provinces under the condition that they establish an official highway network; up to 40% of construction <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> be subsidized. The first network plan was approved on February26, 1920, and included the Talbot Road. The majority of what would soon become Highway3 was designated several months later in August.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1997, NSB's board {{decided to}} {{purchase}} eleven of the locomotives, excluding number 664. This {{was based on}} an agreement whereby NSB would receive compensation for the incurred losses owing to late delivery and under-performance. Siemens guaranteed that ten of eleven locomotives would be operational at any time. All units were again grounded in January 1998, following two fires. Siemens had between 15 and 20 employees stationed in Trondheim to fix the issues. Regularity on the Nordland Line plummeted from 67 to 46 percent with the introduction of Di6. NSB was forced to keep 15 Di3s, which were up to 42 years old, in operational condition to keep services running. The extra costs of keeping the Di3s running were about NOK50 million per year. These <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> continue until NSB could take delivery of new locomotives, which could take up to three years from the time of order. One contributing factor was a 25percent extra wage for engineers for having above-regulation noise levels in the Di3 cabs. Two Di3s were often run along with a Di6 in a train as backup; should the Di6 fail, the Di3 would continue hauling the train.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E
5000|$|According to research, substituting all coal {{consumption}} for {{residential and commercial}} use to natural gas requires additional 88 billion cubic meters of natural gas, which is 60% of China's total consumption in 2012, and the net <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> be 32-52 billion dollars. Substituting the share of coal-fired power plant with renewable and nuclear energy also requires 700GW additional capacity, which cost 184 billion dollars.
