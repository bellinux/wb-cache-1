50|$|Auxin hormones {{are proven}} to stimulate mitoses, cell {{production}} and regulate interfascicular and fascicular cambium. Applying auxin {{to the surface}} of a tree stump allowed decapitated shoots to continue secondary growth. The absence of auxin hormones will have a detrimental effect on a plant. It has been shown that mutants without auxin will exhibit increased spacing between the interfascicular cambiums and reduced growth of the vascular bundles. The mutant plant will therefore experience a decreased in water, nutrients, and photosynthates being transported throughout the plant, eventually leading to death. Auxin also regulates the two types of cell in the vascular cambium, ray and fusiform initials. Regulation of these initials ensures the connection and communication between xylem and phloem is maintained for the translocation of nourishment and sugars are safely being stored as an energy resource. Ethylene levels are high in plants with an active <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> and are still currently being studied. Gibberellin stimulates the cambial cell division and also regulates differentiation of the xylem tissues, with no effect on the rate of phloem differentiation. Differentiation is an essential process that changes these tissues into a more specialized type, leading to an important role in maintaining the life form of a plant. In poplar trees, high concentrations of gibberellin is positively correlated to an increase of cambial cell division and an increase of auxin in the cambial stem cells. Gibberellin is also responsible for the expansion of xylem through a signal traveling from the shoot to the root. Cytokinin hormone is known to regulate the rate of the cell division instead of the direction of cell differentiation. A study demonstrated that the mutants are found to have a reduction in stem and root growth but the secondary vascular pattern of the vascular bundles were not affected with a treatment of cytokinin.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Cambial {{activity}} in white spruce stems in Alaska was observed from April, 1964 to September, 1965 in over 300 samples taken from 50 - to 60 -year-old natural stands. Mitotic index {{was used as}} a measure of the rate of periclinal division of fusiform cells in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone.</b> Anticlinal divisions are relatively rare, occurring only about once per 278 periclinal divisions in most stems. Mitotic index, at any given time, is quite uniform throughout the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> of an internode, among internodes of the same tree, and even among trees of a stand growing at markedly different rates. There may be some difference in rate of division across the radial extent of the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> [...] During dormancy, the radial number of fusiform cells in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> (NCZ) ranges from two to about eight, the number being related to annual growth rate of xylem and phloem. Two to three overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells border the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> in each radial file of cells. They are the last phloem derivatives of the previous year's cambial activity. They undergo rapid radial enlargement just prior to vernal reactivation of mitosis in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone,</b> and they become the first new conducting phloem elements of the current year. There are three distinct growing season periods: early period, grand period, and late period. Beginning of early period cambial activity is marked by reactivation of periclinal divisions, first near the apex, then at successively lower stem levels. Each <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> fusiform initial divides once before any new xylem or phloem derivatives are produced, thus approximately doubling the NCZ. Mitotic activity varies considerably during the early period, and the time required to double the NCZ varies from year to year depending upon weather conditions. Production of the first new xylem and phloem derivatives marks the beginning of the grand period. Rate of cell production in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> remains about equal to derivative production for the next 45 to 50 days, when about 80 percent of annual xylem and phloem increment is produced. Rate of division is comparatively uniform in all internodes in all trees. Rate of derivative production is, therefore, dependent on NCZ. There is a rather abrupt drop in NCZ {{at the beginning of the}} late period, apparently due to lengthening of the cell division cycle. Rate of derivative production exceeds rate of <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> cell production, and NCZ soon drops to about the dormant level. Subsequently, within about ten days, derivative production slows, the zone of developing tracheids begins to narrow, and radial enlargement of developing tracheids and sieve cells declines. In about two more weeks the zone of developing tracheids is almost eliminated, the most recently produced tracheids show little or no radial and there is evidence of partial inception of dormancy in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone.</b> Complete termination of cambial activity is gradual, extending through late August and, perhaps, into September...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of soluble carbohydrates in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone,</b> either from sugars recently produced during photosynthesis or from starch remobilized from storage organs, {{is necessary for}} radial tree growth. However, considerable uncertainties on carbohydrate dynamics and the consequences on tree productivity exist. This study aims {{to better understand the}} variation in different carbon pools at intra-annual resolution by quantifying how <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> sugar and starch concentrations fluctuate over the season and in relation to cambial phenology. A comparison between two physiologically different species growing at the same site, i. e., the evergreen Picea abies Karst. and the deciduous Larix decidua Mill., and between L. decidua from two contrasting elevations, is presented to identify mechanisms of growth limitation. Results indicate that the annual cycle of sugar concentration within the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> is coupled to the process of wood formation. The highest sugar concentration is observed when the number of cells in secondary wall formation and lignification stages is at a maximum, subsequent to most radial growth. Starch disappears in winter, while other freeze-resistant non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) increase. Slight differences in NSC concentration between species are consistent with the differing climate sensitivity of the evergreen and deciduous species investigated. The general absence of differences between elevations suggests that the cambial activity of trees growing at the treeline was not limited by the availability of carbohydrates at the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> but instead by environmental controls on the growing season duration...|$|E
40|$|Although a {{substantial}} proportion of plant biomass originates from {{the activity of}} vascular cambium, the molecular basis of radial plant growth is still largely unknown. To address whether cytokinins are required for cambial activity, we studied cytokinin signaling across the <b>cambial</b> <b>zones</b> of 2 tree species, poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and birch (Betula pendula). We observed an expression peak for genes encoding cytokinin receptors in the dividing cambial cells. We reduced cytokinin levels endogenously by engineering transgenic poplar trees (P. tremula × tremuloides) to express a cytokinin catabolic gene, Arabidopsis CYTOKININ OXIDASE 2, under the promoter of a birch CYTOKININ RECEPTOR 1 gene. Transgenic trees showed reduced concentration of a biologically active cytokinin, correlating with impaired cytokinin responsiveness. In these trees, both apical and radial growth was compromised. However, radial growth was more affected, as illustrated by a thinner stem diameter than in WT at same height. To dissect radial from apical growth inhibition, we performed a reciprocal grafting experiment. WT scion outgrew the diameter of transgenic stock, implicating cytokinin activity as a direct determinant of radial growth. The reduced radial growth correlated with a reduced number of cambial cell layers. Moreover, expression of a cytokinin primary response gene was dramatically reduced in the thin-stemmed transgenic trees. Thus, a reduced level of cytokinin signaling is the primary basis for the impaired cambial growth observed. Together, our results show that cytokinins are major hormonal regulators required for cambial development...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin {{is a central}} {{regulator}} of plant growth. TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 /AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR 1 /AFB) is {{a component of the}} E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCFTIR 1 /AFB and acts as an auxin co-receptor for nuclear auxin signaling. The SCFTIR 1 /AFB-proteasome machinery plays a central regulatory role in development-related gene transcription. Populus trichocarpa, as a model tree, has a unique fast-growth trait to which auxin signaling may contribute. However, no systematic analyses of the genome organization, gene structure and expression of TIR 1 -like genes have been undertaken in this woody model plant. In this study, we identified a total of eight TIR 1 genes in the Populus genome that phylogenetically clustered into four subgroups, PtrFBL 1 /PtrFBL 2, PtrFBL 3 /PtrFBL 4, PtrFBL 5 /PtrFBL 6 and PtrFBL 7 /PtrFBL 8, representing four paralogous pairs. In addition, the gene structure and motif composition were relatively conserved in each paralogous pair and all of the PtrFBL members localized in the nucleus. Different sets of PtrFBLs were strongly expressed in the leaves, stems, roots, <b>cambial</b> <b>zones</b> and immature xylem of Populus. Interestingly, PtrFBL 1 and 7 were expressed mainly in cambial and vascular tissues, respectively, indicating their potential roles in wood formation. Furthermore, Populus FBLs responded differentially upon exposure to various stresses. Collectively, these observations lay the foundation for further investigations into the potential roles of PtrFBL genes in tree growth and development...|$|R
40|$|Most {{dicotyledonous}} {{species with}} secondary growth possess a single cylindrical vascular cambium. However, anomalous types are not uncommon. The various classification systems for anomalous patterns of secondary thickening are compared {{and the distribution}} of successive cambria in about 20 families of 13 orders is summarized. The distribution of this feature within the Phytolaccaceae is detailed including new observations showing successive cambia in Stegnosperma. Serial sections of different developmental stages of plant axes permitted precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular system. Macerations of increments adjacent to the plant of transverse sectioning allowed comparison of xylem-cell dimensions between successive increments, different parts of individual plants, and all three species. Comparisons between species reveal that S. cubense has secondary xylem with the largest diameter pores, longest vessel elements, longest fiber-tracheids, and largest diameter fiber-tracheid pits. S. watsonii has the greatest number of pores per square mm, smallest fiber-tracheid diameter, and the largest ratio of fiber-tracheid to vessel-element length. Pore diameter, fiber-tracheid length, and the ratio of fiber tracheid to vessel-element length were less in small stems than in large stems and less in large stems than in roots. Pores per square mm, fiber-tracheid diameter, and vessel-element length were more or less constant between small stems and roots. Most xylary cell dimensions remain constant between successive increments of wood at a given level. The anomalous cambia arise in the conjunctive tissue and function bidirectionally. They are first evident as dedifferentiated parenchyma and then as small fascicular areas. Tangential expansion of existing regions produces larger arcs and rings of vascular tissue. Radial and tangential interconnections between vascular bundles are common in Stegnosperma. Dye movement traced through the axis confirms the presence of a complex network. At the upper and lower limits of a given ring or arc of anomalous vascular tissue, a radial connection occurs with the adjacent inner increment. The resulting pattern is a series of concentric cylinders of <b>cambial</b> <b>zones,</b> which anastomose with inner layers at their top and bottom. The normal increment of secondary thickening is the innermost cylinder and each successive layer forms a shorter but wider sheath around the previous layers. The apical organization of Stegnosperma consists of four zones: tunica, central mother cells, peripheral, and pith-rib meristem. A cambium-like or transition zone was not observed. The primary shoot vasculature is described as open, lacking direct vascular connections between sympodia, and followed a 2 / 5 phyllotaxy. Patterns of differentiation in shoot apices are detailed. The organization of the root apex as determined from seedling studies is analyzed by the constituent histogens. The vasculature of seedlings was found to follow the common dicotyledonous pattern. The initiation of secondary growth in the hypocotyl and its acropetal development is also typical of other dicotyledons. Secondary growth ascends the shoot helically according to phyllotaxy. The vascular cambium descends in the root, first appearing opposite the phloem and then in the pericycle. These observations are discussed in light of their differences with earlier studies, compared with other Phytolaccaceae, and examined with regard to the physiological function of the anomaly. Systematic implications are summarized and a tentative phyllogeny of the Phytolaccaceae is given...|$|R

The treatment led to an acute Cd stress with a reduction of growth and photosynthesis. Cd stress induced changes in the display of 120 spots for leaf tissue and 153 spots for the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone.</b> It involved a reduced photosynthesis, resulting in a profound reorganisation of carbon and carbohydrate metabolisms in both tissues.

40|$|Conifer stem pest {{resistance}} includes constitutive defenses that discourage {{invasion and}} inducible defenses, including phenolic and terpenoid resin synthesis. Recently, methyl jasmonate (MJ) {{was shown to}} induce conifer resin and phenolic defenses; however, {{it is not known}} if MJ is the direct effector or if there is a downstream signal. Exogenous applications of MJ, methyl salicylate, and ethylene were used to assess inducible defense signaling mechanisms in conifer stems. MJ and ethylene but not methyl salicylate caused enhanced phenolic synthesis in polyphenolic parenchyma cells, early sclereid lignification, and reprogramming of the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> to form traumatic resin ducts in Pseudotsuga menziesii and Sequoiadendron giganteum. Similar responses in internodes above and below treated internodes indicate transport of a signal giving a systemic response. Studies focusing on P. menziesii showed MJ induced ethylene production earlier and 77 -fold higher than wounding. Ethylene production was also induced in internodes above the MJ-treated internode. Pretreatment of P. menziesii stems with the ethylene response inhibitor 1 -methylcyclopropene inhibited MJ and wound responses. Wounding increased 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase protein, but MJ treatment produced a higher and more rapid ACC oxidase increase. ACC oxidase was most abundant in ray parenchyma cells, followed by <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> cells and resin duct epithelia. The data show these MJ-induced defense responses are mediated by ethylene. The <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> xylem mother cells are reprogrammed to differentiate into resin-secreting epithelial cells by an MJ-induced ethylene burst, whereas polyphenolic parenchyma cells are activated to increase polyphenol production. The results also indicate a central role of ray parenchyma in ethylene-induced defense...|$|E

Infested and non-infested samples of grand fir were collected near Corvallis during 1968 and 1969. Samples of subalpine fir, noninfested and infested, were collected near Odell Lake, at approximately 5, 000 ft. elevation, during 1969. Light infestations of the aphid were observed in both species. No differences within species between infested and non-infested trees were noted {{in the number of}} overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells or in the dates for reactivation and cessation of mitotic activity in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone,</b> or in the number of <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> cells per radial file.

Xylem production in grand fir, and phloem production in both species was significantly greater in infested samples. A greater number of phloem parenchyma strands were observed in infested samples of grand fir than in non-infested samples. The rate of cell division, as indicated by the mitotic indices, showed no significant differences between samples of infested and non-infested trees of either species. Differences in xylem and phloem production between infested and non-infested trees could not be attributed to either an increased rate of cell division or an increase in the number of <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> cells per radial file in infested samples for either species...|$|E

40|$|The {{stem cells}} of the {{vascular}} cambium divide to produce daughter cells, which in turn divide before undergoing differentiation during the radial growth of woody stems. The genetic regulation of these developmental events is poorly understood, however. We report here the {{cloning and functional characterization}} of a Populus class-I KNOX homeobox gene, ARBORKNOX 2 (ARK 2), which we show influences terminal cell differentiation and cell wall properties during secondary growth. In the early stages of secondary growth, ARK 2 is expressed broadly in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> and in terminally differentiating cell types, before becoming progressively restricted to the cambium. ARK 20 verexpression and synthetic miRNA-suppression' transgenics reveal positi'lle correlations between ARK 2 expression level and the timing of cambium formation, the width of the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> and inhibition of cambial daughter cell differentiation. These phenotypes in turn correlate with changes in the expression of genes affecting transcription, cell division, auxin and cell wall synthesis. Notably, wood properties associated with secondary cell wall synthesis are negatively associated with ARK 2 expression, including lignin and cellulose content. Together, our results suggest that ARK 2 functions primarily to regulate a complex suite of genes that together influence cell differentiation during secondary growth. We propose that ARKl may represent a co-evolved transcriptional module that influences complex, adaptive wood properties...|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{we found}} {{at both the}} Mt. Gambier and Flynn sites that the slower growing, never-thinned {{treatments}} had fewer days of detectable increment (within the season) than in previously thinned plots. Interpreting the occurrence of a detectable “over-bark” increment {{as measured by the}} dendrometers is, of course, complicated by water movement into expansible tissues, and other effects, and is not purely a function of the occurrence of cell production and irreversible expansion (Mäkinen et al. 2003; Zweifel et al. 2006; Drew et al. 2014) and ultimately “growth”. However, it is almost certain that cambial activity would be substantially reduced, if not stopped, when no growth was detectable (Abe et al. 2003; Gruber et al. 2010). Certainly, trees in unthinned plots maintained an overall smaller <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> than thinned plots. It is interesting, however, and consistent with previous findings in P. radiata by researchers like Skene (1969), that the sizes of these zones remained fairly constant throughout the season (although possibly a small decline was evident very late in the season in the unthinned plots). Potentially, the relatively more erratic growth during the season in the unthinned plots may have been more a function of variable meristematic activity in a constant-sized <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> than of constant expansion/reduction {{in the size of the}} meristematic population. The higher ratio between cambial and enlarging cells suggests that the unthinned plots also had a lower duration of enlargement than the thinned plots (cf. Drew and Pammenter 2007).|$|E

Woody plants present a highly complex system of vascular development in which isolated bundles of xylem and phloem gradually unite to form concentric rings of conductive tissue. We generated several transgenic lines of hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x alba) with the auxin-responsive DR 5 promoter driving GUS expression in order to visualize an auxin response during the establishment of secondary growth. Distinct GUS expression in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> and developing xylem-side derivatives supports the current view of this tissue as a major stream of basipetal PAT. However, we also found novel sites of GUS expression in the primary xylem parenchyma lining the outer perimeter of the pith. Strands of primary xylem parenchyma depart the stem as a leaf trace, and showed GUS expression as long as the leaves to which they were connected remained attached (i. e., until just prior to leaf abscission). Tissue composed of primary xylem parenchyma strands contained measurable levels of free indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and showed basipetal transport of radiolabeled auxin ((3) H-IAA) that was both significantly faster than diffusion and highly sensitive to the PAT inhibitor NPA. Radiolabeled auxin was also able to move between the primary xylem parenchyma in the interior of the stem and the basipetal stream in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone,</b> an exchange that was likely mediated by ray parenchyma cells. Our results suggest that (a) channeling of leaf-derived IAA first delineates isolated strands of pre-procambial tissue but then later shifts to include basipetal transport through the rapidly expanding xylem elements, and (b) the transition from primary to secondary vascular development is gradual, with an auxin response preceding the appearance of a unified and radially-organized vascular cambium...|$|E

Densities of vessels, <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> thickness, fiber wall thickness, fiber length were measured in bright-field microscopy images using AnalySIS Pro 3. 2 software. The results show that our species contain short wood fiber (1. 32 mm in average) while the fiber bark are longer. Gnidia wood fibers are the longest among Ailanthus altissima trunk fiber, wheat straw, canola stalks, cotton stalks and Aspen. Fiber diameter of bark is about twice of those of common papermaking and lumen width is the smallest. Cell wall thickness of Gnidia glauca fiber bark is thicker than those of Gnidia wood and non-wood fibers; consequently, the Runkel ratio is highest (7. 35). The flexibility coefficient of Gnidia glauca xylem fibers is 54. 51, so it is included in the elastic fibers group while phloem fibers is 12. 15 and it is included in the highly rigid fiber. The results of anatomical study of Gnidia glauca show that its xylem fiber dimensions are in the normal range for hardwood and are suitable for paper manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|Hypocotyl {{segments}} of V. sinensis cultured on modified White's medium supplemented with 1 ppm each of naphthaleneacetic acid (I) and kinetin (II) produced callus from the pith, vascular cambium, and inner layers of cortex. The young callus (7 days old) composed of large, thin-walled, highly vacuolated parenchyma cells interspersed with zones of small meristematic cells always assocd. with tracheids. Older callus showed a continuous <b>cambial</b> <b>zone.</b> Both an auxin and a cytokinin were {{essential for the}} induction of callus. IAA was ineffective, whereas in combination with II, both I and 2, 4 -D promoted callus formation. I promoted callus growth up to 6 subcultures only, whereas 2, 4 -D promoted indefinite growth of callus. Through regular monthly subcultures the callus tissue was maintained for 4 years on a medium supplemented with 1 ppm each of 2, 4 -D and II. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Light and {{electron}} microscopic {{studies were}} carried out on the secondary xylem of actively growing shoots of Hibiscus cannabinus treated with cellulose synthesis inhibitor 2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB). Treatment with 20 µM DCB induced differentiation of xylem fibres with thin secondary walls and parenchyma cells with abnormal wall thickening and lignification. At concentration above 50 µM resulted in the disappearance of <b>cambial</b> <b>zone,</b> inhibition of secondary wall deposition, lignification of primary walls, deformed vessel walls and dispersed lignin distribution in secondary walls. Transmission electron microscopic study revealed the initiation and formation of large intercellular spaces between the walls of differentiating xylem elements. Abnormal pattern of wall deposition and inhomogeneous lignin distribution was evident in fibres and vessel. The length and width of both fibres and vessel elements were reduced significantly even with lower concentrations of DCB...|$|E
40|$|The {{cell wall}} architecture, {{before and after}} lignifica-tion, of {{differentiating}} tracheids in Pinus thunbergii has been examined using a rapid-freeze deep-etching technique combined with transmission electron microscopy. Replicas of cells from the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> showed that the unlignified primary cell wall was highly porous with micronbrils extensively interconnected by crosslinks. The unlignified secondary cell wall has unidirectional microfibrils, more or less associated in bundles, forming a wavy pattern around pores of characteristic slit-like shape with narrowing ends. As the lignification progresses, the cell wall structure be-comes dense, with no detectable pores. Delignification of wood samples leads to the reappearance of crosslinks, in-dividual microfibrils and pores in the secondary cell wall, although in a somewhat altered shape. In addition, cel-lulose-synthesizing enzyme complexes (rosettes) have {{for the first time}} been detected on the plasma membrane of differentiating xylem cells of softwood...|$|E
40|$|Temporal {{dynamics}} of cambial activity and wood and phloem formation was monitored in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) at the sites Panška reka near Ljubljana (400 m a. s. l.) and on Menina planina (1200 m a. s. l.) from 2006 until 2014. The monitoring {{is based on}} histometrical analysis of stem tissues of adult trees including <b>cambial</b> <b>zone,</b> xylem (wood) and phloem. Samples (micro cores) for analyses were taken from trees using a Trephor tool at weekly intervals during the growing seasons. Micro cores were embedded in paraffin in order to cut cross-sections and make permanent slides for observations under the light microscope. We always measured the width or counted the number of cells in the cambium, forming xylem and forming phloem increments. The measurements or counting were performed along three radial files of xylem and phloem growth rings and the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone.</b> We recorded the phases of xylem formation: PC – post-cambial extension growth, SW – deposition of secondary wall and lignification, MT – mature cells. In phloem we separately recorded the formation of early and late phloem. Research on beech was conducted in 2006 and from 2008 until 2014, and on spruce from 2009 until 2014. The monitoring and sampling continues. We present some main findings on the beginning, dynamics and cessation of processes which lead to formation of wood and phloem annual growth layers in beech and spruce from both sites. We show how the processes depend on climatic factors. We also present how the spruce data included in a global data set of conifers helps to predict how tree productivity (and survival) will change due to climatic change. The described processes and their variability are still poorly understood; it is therefore necessary to continue the research presented. The results provide basic knowledge to better understand productivity of trees and forest stands, wood quality, the impact of climate change on tree growth and survival, accumulation of carbon and other processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} drought on the 8 - 9 -year-old {{seedlings}} of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was simulated {{in the field}} by isolating trees from precipitation. The biochemical changes typical of water stress wеre compared with the structural changes of the annual rings of wood. The samples of the current and last year needles, cambium and adjoining layers of xylem and phloem of stems and roots were analyzed. In the needles, the content of chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids were determined. The contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (MDA), the activity of enzymes, realizing antioxidant protection: superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase, glutathione reductase and content of sugars and starch were determined in tissues of xylem, phloem and cambium. It was shown that drought reduces {{the weight of the}} needles, the chlorophyll content and the width of the annual wood rings. In moderate drought in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> oxidative stress was developed and also protection system against free radicals was activated, which resulted in a high SOD activity and the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide due to the activity of peroxidase reduction. As a result, the division processes in <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> and cells extension growth were inhibited and the width of annual wood rings decreased due to reduction in the number and size of tracheids. It was found that decrease in growth was not due to deficit of carbohydrates for the process xylogenesis. Water deficit increases the concentration of low molecular weight carbohydrates in the tissues, which, due to the inhibition of division and extension cambial derivatives are only partially used for thickening tracheid cell walls. As a result, abnormal tracheides with reduced size of cells and lumens and thickened cell walls were formed. Abundance of soluble carbohydrates was deposited as a reserve pool in the root phloem in the form of starch. The stock function of root phloem was increased under water deficit conditions...|$|E
30|$|Cambial micro-core {{samples were}} taken from the three trees per plot on which dendrometers were mounted the Flynn site on four {{separate}} occasions during the 2011 – 2012 growing season using a Trephor corer (Rossi et al. 2006 a). These samples were immediately placed in FAA fixative solution (35 % distilled water/ 50 % ethyl alcohol/ 5 % glacial acetic acid/ 10 % formaldehyde). Samples were later reduced in size, mounted in resin, and sectioned to a thickness of 4  μm. These sections were mounted on glass slides, and images captured using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The numbers of cells in the dividing (<b>cambial)</b> <b>zone</b> and subsequent stage of permanent enlargement were counted, based on increasing radial diameter and the onset of secondary thickening (determined by detecting birefringence in the cell wall) which was taken to indicate the end of enlargement.|$|E
30|$|The {{lignification}} {{process and}} lignin distribution {{at different stages}} of cell wall differentiation in the secondary xylem of compression and normal woods of Pinus thunbergii were investigated by thioacidolysis and subsequent desulfuration. We prepared 50 -µm-thick, contiguous tangential sections of pine shoots, cut from the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> through to mature xylem. In compression wood, uncondensed guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) lignins were deposited simultaneously from early to late stages of lignification. The various types of G-G, G-H, and H-H dimers were detected in compression wood, and the ratio of G-H and H-H dimers to total dimers increased as lignification proceeded. In contrast, uncondensed and condensed H units were detected in trace amounts in normal wood. Significant differences in the relative distributions of lignin interunit linkages were not observed between compression and normal woods or between differentiating and mature xylems in either compression or normal woods.|$|E
40|$|In 10 silver firs (Abies alba), the {{following}} was investigated: anatomical structure of phloem growth rings (FB) {{in relation to}} their width, ratio between number of cell-layers in FB and in xylem growth rings (KB), variation in number of cell layers in FB and KB around the stem circumference, relation between widths of FB and KB formed in the same year, and the width of dormant <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> (KC). Samples of intact tissues were taken from living trees in 2001 and 2002, and permanent cross-sections for light microscopy prepared. We observed the relationship between width and anatomical structure of the FB. Narrower FB contained more early phloem, whereas wider FB contained more late phloem cells. Wider FB sometimes contained an additional band of axial parenchyma. The KB were 2 to 21 times wider than the FB. The widths of KB varied around the stem circumference more than the widths of FB. The widths ofdormant KC were positively correlated to the widths of FB and KB...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{dynamics of}} cambial activity of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) was {{studied at the}} northern limit of its natural distribution in a semi-arid grassland ecosystem in North China. We collected micro-cores from five even-aged trees at weekly intervals from April 15 to September 16, 2006. Cell division in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> of these trees started within {{the third week of}} May. In June and July the rate of xylem cell production was highest and around mid-August cell division ended. However, cell-wall formation was not yet completed around mid-September. The cell-division period appears to coincide with the time of highest monsoon precipitation and of above 0 degrees C daily minimum temperature. Moreover, the cambium activity period seems to be in agreement with the time of the highest number of sunshine hours/day. These preliminary results are important for dendroclimatic Studies with Chinese pine in North China and can furthermore be used as a benchmark for future monitoring activities in ecologically similar areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{width of}} {{earlywood}} and latewood in conifer xylem {{may have a}} profound effect on water transport and storage, vulnerability to embolism, and wood strength, yet the controls over the timing of latewood formation are unclear. Tracheids differentiating in the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> are influenced by IAA indole- 3 acetic acid, the radial concentration gradient of which appears to either increase cell expansion (earlywood) or increase cell wall deposition (latewood). There are suggestive data that latewood begins to form when the growth of the leader stops, but definitive results are lacking. Height growth was measured in 14 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) saplings at 10 dates between May and August, from the beginning of the growing season until after height growth had ceased. The cambium was also pinned six times between June and July, to induce xylem scarring at known dates. After height growth ceased, saplings were harvested and transverse sections of the wood were made at the pin insertion points. The date at which 95...|$|E
40|$|The autolytic {{protease}} {{system in}} maturing tracheids {{of the main}} stem of Pinus silvestris was investigated after separation (using surgical methods) of the <b>cambial</b> <b>zone</b> from the layer of differentiating xylem, in combination with decapitation and IAA application. Separation of the cambium prevented autolysis of the protoplast in maturing tracheids, although the specific activity of proteases was little reduced. It was found that a radial or longitudinal concentration gradient of exogenously applied auxin was not responsible for autolysis, but that it could influence the level of extracted protein, and proteolytic activity. Similarly, decapitation modified, only to small degree, {{the effects of the}} cambium separation. Thus, the data from this experiment lead to the conclusion that integration of all cells in the region of xylem formation is a crucial factor for the start of autolytic protoplast breakdown. Possible involvement of auxin waves in the transfer of the positional information for this process is suggested...|$|E
