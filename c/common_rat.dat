Prothrombin assays indicated that the compound had as marked an activity with warfarin-resistant <b>common</b> <b>rats</b> as coumatetralyl had with non-resistant animals. Feeding tests confirmed that 0 - 005 % would be a near-optimal concentration for field use, although there was some evidence of unpalatability. Results with ship rats and house mice were less favourable. Trials with enclosed colonies of warfarin-resistant mice confirmed the laboratory finding that although difenacoum was more effective than all other currently used anticoagulants, it was unlikely to give complete control.

40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} ultrasonographic {{features and}} reference {{values of the}} anatomy of the abdomen of <b>common</b> <b>rats</b> (Rattus norvegicus). Animals- 20 adult male and 20 adult female rats. Procedures-A complete abdominal ultrasonographic examination was performed with the rats sedated. The cadavers of 4 rats were used for anatomic comparisons. Two cadavers were dissected and 2 cadavers were frozen and then cross-sectioned by use of an electric bandsaw. Slices were cleaned with water and photographed on each side. Correlations between variables were determined. Results-The ultrasonographic anatomy of the abdomen was determined, including measurements of the kidneys and adrenal glands and thickness of {{the walls of the}} stomach (saccus caecus, fundus, and pylorus), duodenum, and cecum. A significant positive correlation between kidney size and body weight was detected. The dorsoventral measurements of the left and right adrenal gland were significantly different, regardless of sex.

60|$|The {{struggle}} we have hitherto {{been considering}} has been mainly that between an animal or plant and its direct enemies, whether these enemies are other animals which devour it, or {{the forces of}} nature which destroy it. But there is another kind of struggle often going on at the same time between closely related species, which almost always terminates in the destruction of one of them. As an example of what is meant, Darwin states that the recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush.[12] The black rat (Mus rattus) was the <b>common</b> <b>rat</b> of Europe till, {{in the beginning of the}} eighteenth century, the large brown rat (Mus decumanus) appeared on the Lower Volga, and thence spread more or less rapidly till it overran all Europe, and generally drove out the black rat, which in most parts is now comparatively rare or quite extinct. This invading rat has now been carried by commerce all over the world, and in New Zealand has completely extirpated a native rat, which the Maoris allege they brought with them from their home in the Pacific; and in the same country a native fly is being supplanted by the European house-fly. In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has driven away a larger native species; and in Australia the imported hive-bee is exterminating the small stingless native bee.|$|E

Renan's which chanced to be lying on the table, I composed myself to detect the sophistries of this brilliant but unprincipled writer. Thus, by an effort of will, I distracted myself from that state of 'expectant attention' to which modern science attributes such phantoms and spectral appearances as can neither be explained away by a morbid condition of the liver, nor as caused by the <b>common</b> <b>rat</b> (Mus rattus). I should observe by the way," [...] said the learned bishop, interrupting his own narrative, [...] "that scepticism will in vain attempt to account, by the latter cause, namely rats, for the spectres, Lemures, simulacra, and haunted houses of the ancient Greeks and Romans. With these supernatural phenomena, as they prevailed in Athens and Rome, we are well acquainted, {{not only from the}} Mostellaria of Plautus, but from the numerous ghost-stories of Pliny, Plutarch, the Philopseudes of Lucian, and similar sources. But it will at once be perceived, and admitted even by candid men of science, that these spiritual phenomena of the classical period cannot plausibly, nor even possibly, be attributed to the agency of rats, when we recall the fact that the rat was an animal unknown to the ancients. As the learned M. Selys Longch observes in his Etudes de Micromammalogie (Paris, 1839, p. 59), 'the origin of the rat is obscure, the one thing certain is that the vermin was unknown to the ancients, and that it arrived in Europe, introduced, perhaps, by the Crusaders, after the Middle Ages.' I think," [...] added the prelate, looking round, not without satisfaction, [...] "that I have completely disposed of the rat hypothesis, as far, at least, as the ghosts of classical tradition are concerned." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{will first}} briefly {{run through the}} class of mammals, and then turn to birds. The gorilla {{seems to be a}} polygamist, and the male differs {{considerably}} from the female; so it is with some baboons which live in herds containing twice as many adult females as males. In South America the Mycetes caraya presents well-marked sexual differences in colour, beard, and vocal organs, and the male generally lives with two or three wives: the male of the Cebus capucinus differs somewhat from the female, and appears to be polygamous.[340] Little is known on this head with respect to most other monkeys, but some species are strictly monogamous. The ruminants are eminently polygamous, and they more frequently present sexual differences than almost any other group of mammals, especially in their weapons, but likewise in other characters. Most deer, cattle, and sheep are polygamous; as are most antelopes, though some of the latter are monogamous. Sir Andrew Smith, in speaking of the antelopes of South Africa, says that in herds of about a dozen there was rarely more than one mature male. The Asiatic Antilope saiga appears to be the most inordinate polygamist in the world; for Pallas[341] states that the male drives away all rivals, and collects a herd of about a hundred, consisting of females and kids: the female is hornless and has softer hair, but does not otherwise differ much from the male. The horse is polygamous, but, except in his greater size and in the proportions of his body, differs but little from the mare. The wild boar, in his great tusks and some other characters, presents well-marked sexual characters; in Europe and in India he leads a solitary life, except during the breeding-season; but at this season he consorts in India with several females, as Sir W. Elliot, who has had large experience in observing this animal, believes: whether this holds good in Europe is doubtful, but is supported by some statements. The adult male Indian elephant, like the boar, passes much of his time in solitude; but when associating with others, “it is rare to find,” as Dr. Campbell states, “more than one male with a whole herd of females.” The larger males expel or kill the smaller and weaker ones. The male differs from the female by his immense tusks and greater size, strength, and endurance; so great is the difference in these latter respects, that the males when caught are valued at twenty per cent. above the females.[342] With other pachydermatous animals the sexes differ very little or not at all, and they are not, as far as known, polygamists. Hardly a single species amongst the Cheiroptera and Edentata, or in the great Orders of the Rodents and Insectivora, presents well-developed secondary sexual differences; and I can find no account of any species being polygamous, excepting, perhaps, the <b>common</b> <b>rat,</b> the males of which, as some rat-catchers affirm, live with several females.|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{tests were}} {{carried out in the}} {{laboratory}} to evaluate WBA 8119 as a potential new rodenticide against wild <b>common</b> <b>rats</b> (Rattus norvegicus), ship rats (R. rattus) and house mice (Mus musculus). The results obtained are compared with data previously obtained for difenacoum, another member of the same series of 4 -hydroxycoumarin anticoagulants. With warfarin-resistnat and non-resistant <b>common</b> <b>rats,</b> complete kills were obtained using a concentration of 0 - 0005 % for 2 days, or 0 - 001 % for 1 day: a 1 -day test at 0 - 0005 % killed 6 out of 10 and 17 out of 20 of the two types respectively. At 0 - 0005 % complete kills of resistant ship rats were obtained after 2 days exposure and of resistant house mice after 1 day, but at 0 - 002 % for 2 days there was some survival. Non-resistant ship rats and house mice were all killed after 2 days feeding on 0 - 002 % bait. In 2 -day palatability tests, R. norvegicus showed no significant aversion to the poison at 0 - 002 % and 100 % mortality was obtained. The poison was significantly unpalatable to R. rattus at 0 - 005 % and to M. musculus at 0 - 005 % and 0 - 002 %, although with the last species these concentrations gave complete kills. It is concluded that WBA 8119 has greater activity than other known anticoagulants against the three commensal species examined. The laboratory results suggest that concentrations between 0 - 0005 % and 0 - 002 % would be suitable for field use against <b>common</b> <b>rats,</b> and between 0 - 002 % and 0 - 005 % for ship rats and house mice...|$|R

60|$|These {{examples}} sufficiently {{indicate how}} divergence of character has acted, and {{has led to}} the adaptation of numerous allied species, each to a more or less special mode of life, with the variety of food, of habits, and of enemies which must necessarily accompany such diversity. And when we extend our inquiries to higher groups we find the same indications of divergence and special adaptation, often to a still more marked extent. Thus we have the larger falcons, which prey upon birds, while some of the smaller species, like the hobby (Falco subbuteo), live largely on insects. The true falcons capture their prey in the air, while the hawks usually seize it on or near the ground, feeding on hares, rabbits, squirrels, grouse, pigeons, and poultry. Kites and buzzards, on the other hand, seize their prey upon the ground, and the former feed largely on reptiles and offal as well as on birds and quadrupeds. Others have adopted fish as their chief food, and the osprey snatches its prey from the water with as much facility as a gull or a petrel; while the South American caracaras (Polyborus) have adopted the habits of vultures and live altogether on carrion. In every great group there is the same divergence of habits. There are ground-pigeons, rock-pigeons, and wood-pigeons,--seed-eating pigeons and fruit-eating pigeons; there are carrion-eating, insect-eating, and fruit-eating crows. Even kingfishers are, some aquatic, some terrestrial in their habits; some live on fish, some on insects, some on reptiles. Lastly, among the primary divisions of birds we find a purely terrestrial group--the Ratitae, including the ostriches, cassowaries, etc.; other great groups, including the ducks, cormorants, gulls, penguins, etc., are aquatic; while the bulk of the Passerine birds are aerial and arboreal. The same general facts can be detected in all other classes of animals. In the mammalia, for example, we have in the <b>common</b> <b>rat</b> a fish-eater and flesh-eater as well as a grain-eater, which has no doubt helped to give it the power of spreading over the world and driving away the native rats of other countries. Throughout the Rodent tribe we find everywhere aquatic, terrestrial, and arboreal forms. In the weasel and cat tribes some live more in trees, others on the ground; squirrels have diverged into terrestrial, arboreal, and flying species; and finally, in the bats we have a truly aerial, and in the whales a truly aquatic order of mammals. We thus see that, beginning with different varieties of the same species, we have allied species, genera, families, and orders, with similarly divergent habits, and adaptations to different modes of life, indicating some general principle in nature which has been operative {{in the development of the}} organic world. But in order to be thus operative it must be a generally useful principle, and Mr. Darwin has very clearly shown us in what this utility consists.|$|E
