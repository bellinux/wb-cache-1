40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} thesis was to compare {{different}} types of slaughter lines and their influence on the occurence of meat defects with emphasis on PSE defect. The research has been concentrated mainly on the slaughter lines which use the technology of stunning the animals with electricity and concentrated CO 2. The research monitors the rate of PSE defect from the slaughter to the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pig</b> (approximately 48 hours). For considering the difference in quality of the meat the basic identification indicators of both pH 1 and the draining of meat were created. Furthermore, we monitored pH 24 and pH 48, too. Analyzing of the above mentioned indicators shows that stunning with concentrated CO 2 is more suitable {{with regard to the}} quality of the meat. The average pH 1 value was 0, 3 (p < 0, 001) higher, pH 24 value was 0, 243 (p < 0, 001) higher and the average value of meat juice drainage was 2, 16 % lower (p < 0, 001). The anylysis of the PSEi and PSE quality difference based on pH 1 when stunning with the use of concentrated CO 2 shows lower frequency of PSEi (7, 843 % lower) and PSE (1, 961 % lower). Based on meat juice drainage, PSEi frequency was 23, 810 % lower and PSE 4, 762 % lower...|$|R

Annually, nitrogen was applied in four divided doses, after the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> forage grasses, which takes place five times a year. The total DM yield did not differ between years and increased linearly as a function <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> slurry application, ranging from 2, 698 kg of DM/ha/year (control) to 11, 371 kg of DM/ha/year (275 m³ <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> slurry/ha/year).

In addition, fat colour and flavour can be affected by the fatty acid profile.

In this study we analyze the determinants of the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production in Denmark with particular focus on spatial externalities and the interaction between the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production and upstream sector and slaughterhouses. It is the assumption that the location of slaughterhouses is influenced by the location of the primary producers, implying that this variable is endogenous, whereas the location of primary producers is independent of the location of slaughterhouses. This is due to the fact that transportation costs <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> are paid by the cooperatives owning the slaughterhouses. This assumption is tested applying a spatial econometric model.
