5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} <b>Commercial</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E
500|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines general {{aviation}} (GA) as [...] "an aircraft operation {{other than a}} <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> operation or an aerial work operation." [...] It defines <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> (CAT) as [...] "an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire", and aerial work as [...] "an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, aerial advertisement, etc." ...|$|E

500|$|Organisations in the United Kingdom (UK) {{describe}} GA in {{less restrictive}} terms that include elements of commercial aviation. The British Business and General Aviation Association interprets {{it to be}} [...] "all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by the major airlines and the Armed Services". The General Aviation Awareness Council applies the description [...] "all Civil Aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire". For the purposes of a strategic review of GA in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) defined the scope of GA as [...] "a civil aircraft operation other than a <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> flight operating to a schedule", and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include aerial work and minor CAT operations.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this accident, the AAIB issued safety {{recommendation}} 2006-101 (regarding shoulder harnesses) and a copy of their earlier study to the JAA and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which would take over from the JAA as the primary European regulatory body {{over a period of several}} years, beginning before the accident. While considering this recommendation, the EASA took the interim step of issuing its own Safety Information Bulletin (SIB 2008-24), which advised the air transport community of the CAA's earlier study and of the benefits of shoulder harnesses. In 2011, the EASA published its opinion that the requirement recommended by the AAIB following the Loganair accident that shoulder harnesses should be mandatory for each passenger seat in all <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft weighing less than 5,700kg, regardless of when the aircraft was first registered. The European Commission accepted the EASA opinion, and [...] new regulations requiring shoulder harnesses as described in the AAIB's safety recommendation 2006-101 became law for <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> operators in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{accident}} oil companies and helicopter operators voluntarily grounded similar helicopters until further notice, except for aircraft being used for search and rescue purposes. This was later followed by a grounding by the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway, specified to public transport flights and <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> operations with EC225LP helicopters. Later that day the British Civil Aviation Authority issued a Safety Directive which grounded all EC225LP helicopters on the United Kingdom Civil Aircraft Register, or flying in United Kingdom airspace, except for aircraft being used for search and rescue purposes. On 30 April, Airbus Helicopters issued a Safety Information Notice expressing their support {{of the decision to}} put all commercial passenger flights with Super Puma helicopters of model EC225LP [...] "on hold". Other versions of the Super Puma were not included in this decision.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was {{intended}} that the Delta would be sold in both airliner and executive transport (initially named [...] "Victoria") versions, a change to the regulations governing <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> in the United States in October 1934, prohibiting the use of single-engined aircraft to carry passengers at night or over rough terrain which would prevent a forced landing, stopped the market for single-engined airliners in the United States, and only three aircraft, all ordered before the passing of this regulation, were built as airliners. These consisted of the prototype, leased to Trans World Airlines for use to carry airmail, which crashed on 10 November 1933, one sold to Pan-Am for use by its Mexican subsidiary, destroyed by a fire in May 1934 and one sold to AB Aerotransport of Sweden, delivered in April 1934. AB Aerotransport purchased a second Delta, {{but this was a}} dedicated mailplane which more closely resembled the Gamma, with a slim fuselage carrying its cargo in a compartment ahead of the cockpit.|$|E

50|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, {{the base}} again became Albuquerque Army Air Field and {{was used by the}} Reconstruction Finance Corporation—later called the War Assets Administration. Old or surplus {{aircraft}} were to be sold or demolished at the site. Albuquerque Army Air Field received some 2,250 old or surplus aircraft, such as obsolete B-24 Liberator and B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and smaller aircraft like AT-6 Texan trainers, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. Aircraft that the Civil Aeronautics Administration licensed for public use were sold to the public, with prices ranging from $100 for a PT-17 Stearman to $90,000 for a C-54 Skymaster. North American Aviation bought back a large number of their AT-6s, overhauled and resold them to customers including the Dutch and Chinese governments. The remaining 1,151 aircraft were put up for bid in the fall of 1946.

The company also installed enough equipment to refine the crude oil into a type of fuel oil for use by church missions and fishing boats along the Mackenzie. But the refinery and oil field closed in 1921 because northern markets were too small to justify the costly operations.

The low-lying areas of the park and adjacent neighborhood is a former wetland which surrounded the mouth of Thornton Creek. As with nearby Magnuson Park at Sand Point, most of the wetland disappeared when the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the lake in 1916 by building the Montlake Cut and the Lake Washington Ship Canal.
