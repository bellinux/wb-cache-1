[...] We talked about this {{and we talked about}} it openly. [...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> years,’ I would have given it to him.

[...] He {{led them to the}} playoffs again in 1939–40, but the loss of players due to World War II took its toll on the franchise. [...] After finishing in last place the season before, the league announced that the Americans had suspended operations for the 1942–43 NHL season though Dutton {{continued to}} represent the team on the Board of Governors. Dutton believed that if the Americans could have held on through the war, his team would become more popular than the Rangers.

Increasing means the coupling preserves stochastic ordering. We first present our main construction theorem in the case where S is totally ordered, applications to attractive PCA's are given. When S is only partially ordered, we show on two examples that a <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> than two synchronous dynamics may not exist. We also prove an extension of our main result for a particular class of partially ordered spaces...|$|R

According to the senior vice president of urban marketing for J Records, Keys [...] "had a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> things in the oven and she wants this to be right [...] So we gave her the additional time she needed."

It was just two weeks' difference, but it made for an even better record".|$|E

He was cut somethin' turrible--in two places. They wrapped him all up an' next day packed him in a wagon back to Grass Valley. Evarts says Ted Meeker was {{friendly}} with Greaves an' {{went to see him}} as he was layin' in his room next to the store. Wal, accordin' to Meeker's story, Greaves came to an' talked. He said he was sittin' there in the dark, shootin' occasionally at Isbel's cabin, when he heerd a rustle behind him in the grass. He knowed some one was crawlin' on him. But before he could get his gun around he was jumped by {{what he thought was a}} grizzly bear. But it was a man. He shut off Greaves's wind an' dragged him back in the ditch. An' he said: 'Greaves, it's the half-breed. An' he's goin' to cut you--FIRST FOR ELLEN JORTH! an' then for Gaston Isbel!' ... Greaves said Jean ripped him with a bowie knife.... An' thet was all Greaves remembered. He died soon after tellin' this story. He must hev fought awful hard. Thet second cut Isbel gave him went clear through him.... Some of the gang was thar when Greaves talked, an' naturally they wondered why Jean Isbel had said 'first for Ellen Jorth.' ... Somebody remembered thet Greaves had cast a slur on your good name, Ellen. An' then they had Jean Isbel's reason fer sayin' thet to Greaves. It caused a lot of talk. An' when Simm Bruce busted in some of the gang haw-hawed him an' said as how he'd get the third cut from Jean Isbel's bowie. Bruce was half drunk an' he began to cuss an' rave about Jean Isbel bein' in love with his girl.... As bad luck would have it, a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> fellars come in an' asked Meeker questions.

30|$|Rapid blood {{clearance}} {{and extensive}} liver accumulation {{have also been}} observed for mAbs coupled with other chemical groups to their lysine residues even under conditions that did not cause impairment <b>of</b> mAb immunoreactivity. <b>Coupling</b> <b>of</b> 99 mTc/ 99 Tc-MAG 3 or 186 Re-MAG 3 chelate groups to lysine residues of a mAb caused faster blood clearance when, on an average, more than 8 groups were coupled, while immunoreactivity only slightly decreased upon <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> than 12 groups. Concomitantly, an increased uptake of the antibody conjugates in the liver and intestines was observed [37]. For mAbs labeled with 153 Sm via DTPA, rapid blood clearance and liver accumulation were observed in rats when 20 chelate groups were coupled per mAb [38]. A similar phenomenon was observed when photoactive dyes were coupled to the mAbs. Immunoreactivity did not alter when 19 hydrophilic fluorescein groups were coupled per mAb. However, upon evaluation of the biodistribution in mice <b>of</b> mAbs <b>coupled</b> with 4 to 14 dye groups, <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> than 10 dye groups per mAb resulted in enhanced blood clearance [39]. During development of conjugates for photoimmunotherapy, upon <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the hydrophobic photosensitizer meta-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin [m THPC] to lysine residues of mAbs, a twofold higher liver uptake and almost twofold lower tumor and blood values were observed when just 0.9 m THPC group was coupled per mAb molecule, while four m THPC groups could be coupled to a mAb without a decrease in immunoreactivity [40]. These studies clearly show that depending {{not only on the}} number of chelate or dye groups, but also on their nature, alterations in hydrophobicity, charge, or conformation might be introduced, resulting in an altered behavior of the antibody conjugates in vivo.|$|R
