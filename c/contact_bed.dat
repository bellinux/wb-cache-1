500|$|Called [...] "Jordan Bridge 21" [...] by British Waterways, {{this bridge}} carried a railway that linked Blackburn Meadows Sewage Works to {{additional}} filters and <b>contact</b> <b>beds</b> {{to the east}} of the navigation. It was constructed by Logan and Hemmingway, who won a contract valued at £41,046 in April 1907, which included six settling tanks, 24 <b>contact</b> <b>beds,</b> and the bridge. The eastern approach consists of three brick arches, which allowed a siding to pass through it. Continued expansion of the works required a second bridge to be constructed in 1922, to carry the railway over the river channel. The steelwork for Holmes bridge was supplied by Charles Ross Ltd, who were based in Sheffield, while piling work was carried out by Yorkshire Hennebique Concreting Co Ltd.|$|R
500|$|The {{quality of}} the {{effluent}} discharged into the Don was soon giving rise to concern, as the treatment process was unsatisfactory. An act of Parliament was obtained in 1900, which allowed Sheffield Corporation to buy an additional , on which <b>contact</b> <b>beds</b> would be built, so that the effluent could be better treated before discharge. The initial plan was costed at £367,355, which was reduced to £270,369 when secondary <b>contact</b> <b>beds</b> {{were removed from the}} scheme. The Local Government Board approved the plans on 13 May 1905, paving the way {{for the construction of a}} biological treatment system, instead of the system using lime. Logan and Hemmingway, who were contractors based at Nottingham, won the initial contract for excavations, and also the subsequent one for the construction of six settling tanks, 24 contact tanks, and Jordan bridge, which would carry the internal railway line over the River Don Navigation. The contract was worth £41,046, and further contracts followed, which included £36,500 for 36 more <b>contact</b> <b>beds</b> and three settling tanks, £5,000 for excavating [...] of earth, and £36,484 for storm beds and other work, which was subsequently raised to £39,184, so that they could pay their workers at the same rate as Sheffield Corporation paid their own workmen.|$|R
40|$|The {{cohesive}} {{behavior of}} aerated solids controls fluidization behavior of bulk materials. Very cohesive materials cannot be easily fluidized. However, aeration {{is often used}} in <b>contact</b> <b>bed</b> situations to help maintain some cohesive materials in flowable conditions. The cohesive properties of aerated materials are not well understood. This paper presents a new test method to measure the effect of aeration on cohesive flow properties.

The proposed community administration of this drug presents dual novel paradigms; first, indirect impact on the community rather than on individuals, and second, the use of a drug for vector control. In this paper, the main questions related to the regulatory and policy pathways for such an application are identified.

Corncob bedding, for example, is often used because of its high absorbency, ability to minimize detectable ammonia, and low cost. However, observations that mice eat the corncob lead to concerns that its use can interfere with dietary studies. We evaluated the effect of corncob bedding on feed conversion (change in body weight relative to the apparent number of kcal consumed over 7 d) in mice. Four groups of mice (6 to 12 per group) were housed in an individually ventilated caging system: (1) low-fat diet housed on recycled paper bedding, (2) low-fat diet housed on corncob bedding, (3) high-fat diet housed on recycled paper bedding, and (4) high-fat diet housed on corncob bedding. After 4 wk of the high-fat diet, feed conversion and percentage body weight change both were lower in corncob-bedded mice compared with paper-bedded mice. Low-fat-fed mice on corncob bedding versus paper bedding did not show statistically significant differences in feed conversion or change in percentage body weight. Average apparent daily feed consumption did not differ among the 4 groups. In conclusion, these data suggest that corncob bedding reduces the efficiency of feed conversion in mice fed a high-fat diet and that other bedding choices should be favored in these models...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{engineering}} {{has been}} performed {{for thousands of}} years. Before Christ, Athenians in Greece irrigated with wastewater. In 1865, scientists in England experimented with sludge digestion. In 1889, filtration <b>contact</b> <b>beds</b> were tested in Massachusetts and in 1908 the first municipal trickling filter was installed in the United States (Chow, 1972). The use of bioremediation, the addition of microorganisms to waste, in the wastewater field has a history that is over a century old (Skinner, 1990), beginning with English experiments in the 1860 s (Chow, 1972). The study of biodegredation involves a mixture of several sciences: “microbiology, biochemistry, molecular ecology, physical chemistry, environmental science, chemical/environmental engineering, and analytical chemistry. 2 ̆ 2 (Sayler, 1990).

40|$|Zeolites are {{hydrated}} microporous aluminosilicate crystals. They are {{of great}} interest to the scientific and engineering communities due to their ability to catalyse reactions, ion- exchange and be size selective in their admittance of molecules. The main experimental work described in this thesis measures the long range transport rate of water through macroscopic powder samples of zeolite 4 A using recent developments in broad-line NMR imaging techniques. Samples consisting of <b>contacting</b> <b>beds</b> of packed zeolite 4 A powder were prepared with a step function concentration profile of water between the two beds. The equilibration of the water between the beds was then monitored as a function of time using a 1 H NMR broadline profiling technique. This long range transport process was investigated as a function of temperature, initial hydration and resident cation. Long range self diffusion experiments were also performed by preparing one bed with the tracer molecule deuterium oxide. This gives a constant concentration profile across the two beds. Experiments were performed as a function of temperature. A detailed diffusion model was then derived, describing the long range transport of water through beds of zeolite 4 A as a function of temperature and hydration. The long range transport was found to be an interplay between liquid intracrystalline diffusion and faster interparticle vapour diffusion. The relative importance of the two processes with respect to the effective transport rate, depends on the overall concentration in the bed. A concentration and temperature dependence is given. A set of mobility weighted, stray field imaging (STRAFI) profiles were taken of thin films of sodium silicate solutions during drying, as a function of temperature. It was found that for moderate drying temperatures up to 70 °C, the mobility of water molecules within sodium silicate is dependent on local hydration and is independent of drying history...|$|R
30|$|The {{transport}} of sand grains in {{water can be}} classified into four modes: sliding, rolling, saltation, and suspension (Allen 1982). Sliding and rolling grains remain in continuous <b>contact</b> with the <b>bed,</b> while suspended particles {{have little or no}} <b>contact</b> with the <b>bed.</b> Saltating grains jump over the bed in a series of low trajectories that are on the order of 10 to 20 particle diameters long and a few diameters high; thus, this is an intermediate mode between sliding and rolling and suspension. Reid and Frostick (1994) defined the bedload as the grains that move along the bed and that are essentially in contact with it at all times (i.e., including only sliding and rolling particles) and independently defined the saltation load; however, others (e.g., Allen 1982; Bridge and Demicco 2008) defined the bedload to include saltating grains in addition to sliding and rolling grains. Regardless of the definition of bedload, all researchers have pointed out that in subaqueous environments, sliding and rolling are most prevalent when the level of transport is low (low transport stage; Allen 1982; Reid and Frostick 1994; Bridge and Demicco 2008).|$|R
