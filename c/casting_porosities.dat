The dispersoids are reasonably well distributed in both cast and extruded {{materials and the}} extruded matrix grains size is about 0. 88 mm, in agreement with existing models on grain pinning. The Young’s modulus measured ultrasonically agrees well with the prediction of the Eshelby composite model. Premature failure in tension is observed in extruded DSC-Mg, due to <b>casting</b> <b>porosities.</b> In compression, strain softening after yield is observed in extruded DSC-Mg, which {{may be explained by}} the tension:compression asymmetry in wrought magnesium materials. Both cast and extruded DSC-Mg are much stronger in compression than most existing magnesium alloys and composites.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of overlap multi-pass friction stir processing on the microstructure and mechanical properties, in particular, strength, ductility and hardness of die cast Al- 7 Si- 3 Cu aluminium alloy was investigated. It was observed {{that with the}} increasing number of overlap passes friction stir processing resulted in significant refinement and redistribution of aluminium silicon eutectic phase with elimination of <b>casting</b> <b>porosities.</b> The microstructural refinement by the friction stir processing not only increases the ultimate tensile strength from 121 to 273 MPa, but also increases the ductility as observed by the increase in fracture strain from 1. 8 % to 10 %. Analysis of the fractured surface reveal that microstructural refinement obtained by friction stir processing plays a vital role in transforming the fracture mode from completely mixed mode to ductile mode of fracture with increasing number of passes. Change in the size, shape, morphology and distribution of eutectic silicon particles and elimination of porosities are the main reasons for the increase in tensile strength and ductility due to friction stir processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{machinery}} and equipment elements operating in a turbulent fluid flow, are exposed to destruction {{as a result of}} the impact of thecavitation, corrosion and abrasion processes, among which are hardest to minimize the imploding cavitation bubbles. Repeated cavitationimplosions of bubbles give rise to cracks, material loss, resulting in increased flow resistance and reduction of the efficiency of the device, or even its destruction. In order to prevent or mitigate the cavitation phenomenon and its harmful effects, two basic methods are applied. The first of these is the selection of geometrical parameters and hydraulic {{machinery and}} the relevant elements of the streamlined shape and flow channels. The second solution is the selection of engineering plastics with greater resistance to cavitation. In case of materials manufactured with the casting method, a very important role is being played by the quality of manufactured casting having the smallest number of casting defects.

40|$|Metal fatigue is a {{recurring}} problem for metallurgists and materials engineers, especially in structural applications. It {{has been responsible}} for many disastrous accidents and tragedies in history. Understanding the micro-mechanisms during cyclic deformation and combating fatigue failure has remained a grand challenge. Environmental effects, like temperature or a corrosive medium, further worsen and complicate the problem. Ultimate design against fatigue must come from a materials perspective with a fundamental understanding of the interaction of microstructural features with dislocations, under the influence of stress, temperature, and other factors. This research endeavors to contribute to the current understanding of the fatigue failure mechanisms. Cast aluminum alloys are susceptible to fatigue failure due to the presence of defects in the microstructure like <b>casting</b> <b>porosities,</b> non-metallic inclusions, non-uniform distribution of secondary phases, etc. Friction stir processing (FSP), an emerging solid state processing technique, is an effective tool to refine and homogenize the cast microstructure of an alloy. In this work, the effect of FSP on the microstructure of an A 356 cast aluminum alloy, and the resulting effect on its tensile and fatigue behavior have been studied. The main focus is on crack initiation and propagation mechanisms, and how stage I and stage II cracks interact with the different microstructural features. Three unique microstructural conditions have been tested for fatigue performance at room temperature, 150 °C and 200 °C. Detailed fractography has been performed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD). These tools have also been utilized to characterize microstructural aspects like grain size, eutectic silicon particle size and distribution. Cyclic deformation at low temperatures is very sensitive to the microstructural distribution in this alloy. The findings from the room temperature fatigue tests highlight the important role played by persistent slip bands (PSBs) in fatigue crack initiation. At room temperature, cracks initiate along PSBs in the absence of other defects/stress risers, and grow transgranularly. Their propagation is retarded when they encounter grain boundaries. Another major finding is the complete transition of the mode of fatigue cracking from transgranular to intergranular, at 200 °C. This occurs when PSBs form in adjacent grains and impinge on grain boundaries, raising the stress concentration at these locations. This initiates cracks along the grain boundaries. At these temperatures, cyclic deformation is no longer microstructure- dependent. Grain boundaries don’t impede the progress of cracks, instead aid in their propagation. This work has extended the current understanding of fatigue cracking mechanisms in A 356 Al alloys to elevated temperatures...|$|E

High thermal gradient casting improves fatigue life by reducing casting pore size. The alternate heat treatment improves the balance of strength and ductility which appears to improve low cycle fatigue life, but with a reduction in short time stress rupture life. Based upon these tests, hot isostatic pressing appears to afford further improvements in cyclic life, though additional evaluation is suggested.

Both these studies assume the addition of copper (2. 5 %, 3. 0 %, 3. 5 %, 4. 0 %, and 4. 5 % Cu) and vacuum pressure (76, 50, 40, cmHg), as independent variables, while dependent variable in the studies is porosity characteristics, which include...|$|R
40|$|The strength-normalized fatigue {{endurance}} {{strength of}} the bulk metallic glass (BMG) Zr 52. 5 Cu 17. 9 Ni 14. 6 Al 10 Ti 5 (Vitreloy 105) {{has been reported to}} be the highest for any BMG; however, to date, there has been no explanation of why this material is so much better than other Zr-based compositions. In this study, the fatigue-crack growth behavior of Zr 52. 5 Cu 17. 9 Ni 14. 6 Al 10 Ti 5 was compared in ambient air vs dry nitrogen environment. The excellent fatigue life behavior is attributed to a relatively high fatigue threshold (DKTH 2 MPaÖm) and a lack of sensitivity to environmental effects on fatigue-crack growth in ambient air, as compared to other Zr-based BMGs. Fatigue life experiments conducted in ambient air confirmed the excellent fatigue life properties with a 10 7 -cycle endurance strength of ~ 0. 24 of the ultimate tensile strength; however, it was also found that <b>casting</b> <b>porosity,</b> even in limited amounts, could reduce this endurance strength by as much as ~ 60 pct. Overall, the BMG Zr 52. 5 Cu 17. 9 Ni 14. 6 Al 10 Ti 5 appears to have excellent strength and fatigue properties and should be considered as a prime candidate material for future applications where good mechanical fatigue resistance is required...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} to Mg-Al casting alloys of property charts {{similar to the}} quality index charts used for Al casting alloys is explored. The charts are generated with an analytical method that accounts for the specific features of the deformation behaviour of Mg-based alloys. The effects of aluminium content, solution heat treatment, temper, <b>casting</b> method, <b>porosity,</b> cross sectional thickness and low temperature ageing on the mechanical performance of sand and die castings are assessed {{using data from the}} literature. The charts are extended to include the energy absorption of smooth bars. Limitations of the analytical charts are discussed...|$|R
