5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of the {{breeding}} male {{is mostly a}} deep shade of chestnut in colour with black colouration on the face, wings, and tail. The breeding male is not easily confused with any other birds except the chestnut weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of {{the breeding}} plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones on the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors have orange enamel and are opisthodont, {{with the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the tooth {{inclined}} backwards. The {{root of the}} lower incisors extends though the mandible (lower jaw) to a low capsular process {{at the back of}} the jawbone. The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear distinct cusps. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots. The molars are quite similar to those of Macrotarsomys, and differ only in minor details.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After the {{grinding}} process, the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> cemented carbide milling tools tend to chipping. Chipping {{has a strong}} influence on the tool performance. For this reason, the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> are further prepared. Additionally, a <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> rounding {{has an impact on}} the wear behavior and the process stability. For the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> preparation <b>of</b> milling tools, magnetic finishing is a promising process. This paper describes the process of magnetic finishing. The influencing parameters, i. e. the process time and the distance between the cutting tool and the magnetic disks, are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of magnetic finishing on the tool life is demonstrated using the example of a milling process with titanium...|$|R
40|$|Wear {{evaluation}} of cutting tools {{is a key}} issue for prolonging their lifetime and ensuring high quality of products. In this paper, we present a method for the effective localisation <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> inserts in digital images <b>of</b> an <b>edge</b> profile milling head. We introduce a new image data set of 144 images <b>of</b> an <b>edge</b> milling head that contains 30 inserts. We use a circular Hough transform to detect the screws that fasten the inserts. In a cropped area around a detected screw, we use Canny’s edge detection algorithm and Standard Hough Transform to localise line segments that characterise insert edges. We use this information and the geometry of the insert to identify which of these line segments is the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> The output <b>of</b> our algorithm {{is a set of}} quadrilateral regions around the identified <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> These regions can then be used as input to other algorithms for the quality assessment <b>of</b> the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Our results show that the proposed method is very effective for the localisation <b>of</b> the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> inserts in an edge profile milling machine...|$|R
