40|$|A method, apparatus, system, {{article of}} manufacture, and <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>medium</b> provide {{the ability to}} measure wind. Data at a first {{resolution}} (i. e., low resolution data) is collected by a satellite scatterometer. Thin slices of the data are determined. A collocation of the data slices are determined at each grid cell center to obtain ensembles of collocated data slices. Each ensemble of collocated data slices is decomposed into a mean part and a fluctuating part. The data is reconstructed at a second resolution from the mean part and a residue of the fluctuating part. A wind measurement is determined from the data at the second resolution using a wind model function. A description of the wind measurement is output...|$|E
40|$|WO 2004077360 A UPAB: 20041011 NOVELTY - Video coding method {{involves}} texture {{analysis and}} synthesis. According to the method, video scene texture is analyzed such that synthesized texture areas are determined. Video scene coding is then undertaken using the synthesized texture area data. Texture area data and metadata are generated. Coded data and metadata are evaluated by a decoder so that video scenes are reconstructed by synthetically generated textures by evaluation of determined area metadata. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:- (a) a chip and or processor arrangement for video coding; (b) {{a computer program}} for video programming and; (c) a <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>storage</b> <b>medium</b> for storing a program for video programming. USE - Video-coding method based on texture analysis and synthesis. ADVANTAGE - The amount of video data to be transferred is reduced...|$|E

40|$|A method, <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>storage,</b> and {{apparatus}} {{for implementing}} a recursive hierarchical segmentation algorithm on a parallel computing platform. The method includes setting a bottom level of recursion that defines where a recursive division {{of an image}} into sections stops dividing, and setting an intermediate level of recursion where the recursive division changes from a parallel implementation into a serial implementation. The segmentation algorithm is implemented according to the set levels. The method can also include setting a convergence check level of recursion with which the first level of recursion communicates with when performing a convergence check...|$|R
5000|$|Crouch {{pointed out}} that {{representative}} claim 1 of the first patent [...] "is an almost pure software claim — requiring computer code embodied on a <b>computer</b> <b>readable</b> <b>storage</b> medium." [...] Therefore, that the panel majority said that the claims are “much closer” to the ones found eligible {{than those of the}} many cases finding ineligibility should be translated as [...] "the judges in the panel majority prefer the decisions finding eligibility over those invalidating software patent claims." [...] He {{pointed out that}} the majority's focus on the system's [...] "enhancing data in a distributed fashion being an unconventional technological solution [...] [...] [...] to a technological problem (massive record flows which previously required massive databases)" [...] ignores the fact that the claim is not for a system but for software used to implement the system, and the software itself does not require the distribution of components that the specification describes. He then quotes Judge Reyna's dissent that says, [...] "But the inquiry is not whether the specifications disclose a patent-eligible system, but whether the claims are directed to a patent ineligible concept." ...|$|R

The method further includes sending an Axon-ARP request to the second Axon using the first route, and receiving an Axon-ARP reply from the second Axon, where the Axon-ARP reply includes a second route. The method further includes storing the first route in storage space on the first Axon, where the storage space is indexed by the target identification, and sending an ARP reply to the first host where the source host is configured to send a packet to the target host...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaFor {{investigations}} {{in the field}} of stability and control or handling qualities of helicopters, a Flighttest Instrumentation System is presented which combines some aspects of modern engineering. The aim was to create a system which is easy to understand and easy to handle, furthermore, allows the integration of future techniques and works with a maximum of performance under the given conditions. The system is modular. Good flexibility is guaranteed by the use of microprocessors combined with transducers in the front end modules. To avoid active or passive interference with the systems of the helicopter, the transportation of digital data is done by means of optical waveguides. The technique of processor control and data transmission is designed for future requirements like rising numbers of signals or bitrates. An "intelligent" transducer is shown together with its communication with the main onboard computer. On the other hand an overview is given of the onboard recording systems like Floppy Disc and Winchester, which have the advantage of <b>readable</b> <b>computer</b> data <b>storage.</b> For a quicklook telemetry a computer standardized protocol is also used as a method of online monitoring of digital data in the ground station...|$|R
