The aim was to investigate gastric emptying and CCK release in weight-stable obese subjects on their usual diet and to study the impact of factors known to determine gastric emptying. Patients entering a weight reduction program were asked {{to participate in a}} study examining gastric emptying by scintigraphy and CCK release in response to a meal with questionnaires on feelings of satiety. Forty-five patients (9 M, 36 F) with a mean (SD) BMI of 37. 0 (4. 0) kg/m(2) entered the Study. The mean T- 50 (emptying of 50 %) of fluids was 20. 7 (10. 3) min, and that of solids 141. 9 (168. 3) min. The percentage emptying of solids was 34. 5 (19. 9) %/hr. CCK values peaked within 42 min and paralleled the subjective ratings of satiety but did not correlate with gastric emptying. Five of 45 subjects (11 %) had very prolonged gastric emptying of solids; they showed higher <b>caloric</b> <b>intakes</b> and higher insulin levels. They did not differ in CCK values and ratings of satiety but scored higher in being active and awake.

25|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{physiology}} of starvation, in 1944 Keys carried out a starvation study with 36 conscientious objectors as test subjects in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. At the time, conscientious objectors were being placed in virtual concentration camps, with a few functioning like the Civilian Public Service, so that recruiting them would prove easier than seeking out volunteers in the general population. The original pool of 400 responders was reduced to 36 selectees, of whom 32 {{would go on to}} complete the study. The main focus of the study was threefold: set a metabolic baseline for three months, study the physical and mental effects of starvation on the volunteers for six months, and then study the physical and mental effects of different refeeding protocols on them for three months. The participants would first be placed on the three-month baseline diet of 3200 calories after which their calories were reduced to 1800 calories/day while expending 3000 calories in activities such as walking. The final three months were a refeeding period where the volunteers were divided into four groups, each receiving a different <b>caloric</b> <b>intake.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both men {{and women}} have the option of {{investing}} resources either to provision children or to have additional offspring based on life history theory. Males and females monitor costs and benefits of each alternative to maximize reproductive fitness; however, trade-off differences do exist between sexes. Females are likely to benefit most from parental effort because they are certain which offspring are theirs and have relatively few reproductive opportunities, each of which is relatively costly and risky. In contrast, males do not have an absolute certainty of paternity, but may have many more mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs and risks. Though not every hunter-gatherer population pinpoints females to gathering and males to hunting (most notably the Aeta and Ju'/hoansi), the norm of most current populations divide the roles of labor in this manner. Natural selection is more likely to favor male reproductive strategies that stress mating effort and female strategies that emphasize parental investment. As a result, women do the low-risk task of gathering vegetation and underground storage organs that are rich in energy to provide for themselves and offspring. Since women provide a reliable source of <b>caloric</b> <b>intake,</b> men are able to afford a higher risk of failure by hunting animals.|$|E

Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation, such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex, and the size of family group that each member traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5years younger than those who died; children aged between 6 and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and {{children under the age of}} 6, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths were [...] "extremely high" [...] among males aged between 20 and 39, at more than 66 percent. Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a <b>caloric</b> <b>intake.</b> Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks and, in this particular instance, the men were required to clear brush and engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate than bachelor males, possibly because family members more readily shared food with each other.|$|E
