Toxicity of a pre-manufactured preparation SCP- 1 was tested on bacteria, algae and higher plants and was expressed as a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Obtained results showed that among unicellular and more complex test-organisms MIC values differed 10 – 100 fold suggesting that an application of complex test-organism battery is necessary to evaluate the toxicity of SCP- 1 thoroughly. MIC values were different from the critical micelle concentration; this indicates that the SCP 1 mechanism of action might not involve membrane disruption and/or destabilization...|$|E

40|$|The {{microbial}} ecology of different indoor environments determines the human microbiome. Hence, {{cleaning and disinfection}} of indoor environments like hospitals, apartments, automobiles, etc. are of great importance. Nonaqueous surface <b>cleaning</b> <b>preparations</b> (SCPs) are often used for this purpose. A cleaning composition may contain the following compounds: primary surfactant, cosurfactant, solvent, cosolvent, organotropic (organic solubilizing) agent, hydrotropic (water solubilising) agent, water and salts, and special additives. In this paper, the efficacy of complex preparations is discussed, focusing on the chemical composition and testing methods. Particular {{attention is paid to}} quaternary ammonium compounds, i. e. surfactants with disinfection properties, which are known to act as antistatic agents, detergents, oil-in-water emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, and lubricants. Specificity of target microorganisms, physicochemical properties of surrounding media and treatment mode are the main factors affecting the efficacy of disinfection. Due to the enormous economic importance and massive worldwide use of surfactants and disinfectants, their environmental impact needs to be evaluated and controlled. Increased knowledge and better understanding of the antimicrobial capacity of disinfectants are essential to optimise sanitation procedures, to reduce costs, environment waste and to improve shelf life...|$|E

People buy too much of different cleaning substances to keep everything cleaner. The goal of my research is to present the fact about non-awareness among people buying cleaning substances: usually they are not aware which cleaning substance they are buying or if it is appropriate. The greater amount of cleaning substance does not mean greater cleanliness of their leaving premises. Using the questionnaire I have shown what is their custom and what are people's habits.

Additionally, microstructure of the metal plays a secondary role regarding initial hydrogen attack on the highly strained surfaces yet starts to dominate the system while moving to more pristine samples...|$|R

40|$|The {{volume of}} data being {{published}} on the Web and made available as Open Data has significantly increased {{over the last several}} years. However, data published by independent publishers are sliced and fragmented. Creating descriptive connections across datasets may considerably enrich data and extend their value. One way to standardize, describe and interconnect the information from heterogeneous data sources is to use Linked Data as a publishing technology. The majority of published open datasets is in a tabular format and the process of generating valid Linked Data from them requires powerful and flexible methods for data <b>cleaning,</b> <b>preparation,</b> and transformation. Most of the time and effort of data workers and data developers is concentrated on data cleaning aspects. In spite of the number of available platforms for tabular data <b>cleaning</b> and <b>preparation,</b> no solution is focused on the Linked Data generation. This thesis explores approaches for data cleaning and transformation {{in the context of the}} Linked Data generation and identifies their challenges. This includes reviewing typical tabular data quality issues found in the literature and practical use cases and their categorization in order to produce the requirements on designing a solution in the form of the set of data cleaning and transformation operations. Furthermore, the thesis introduces the Grafterizer software framework, developed to assist data workers and data developers in preparing and converting raw tabular data to Linked Data with simplifying and partially automating this process. The Grafterizer framework is evaluated against existing relevant tools and systems for data cleaning. The contribution of the thesis also includes extending and evaluating reference software system to implement the needed data cleaning and transformation operations. This resulted in a powerful framework for addressing typical data quality issues and a wide range of supported data cleaning and transformation operations...|$|R
