5|$|Sorkin {{has written}} for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of {{collaboration}} with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme {{for nearly a decade}} on the shows Sports Night, The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> in his office plotting out his next scripts. He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.|$|E
25|$|For twenty-eight days we were prisoners. Sentries at our cabin doors day and night, sentries on deck {{during the}} hour we were daily {{permitted}} to breathe the fresh air. Our men comrades were <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> in dark, damp quarters, wretchedly fed, {{all of us}} in complete ignorance of the direction we were to take.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failed}} Orlov Revolt of 1770, {{in which the}} Maniots took part, Muslim Albanians (also known as Turkoalbanians) ravaged the Peloponnese and kept the Maniots <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> inside Mani. The Turks also {{tried to keep the}} Maniots quiet by placing a Maniot bey to govern them. In 1770 the Ottoman bey of the Peloponnese, Hassán Ghazi, saw his chance to invade Mani and subjugate them once and for all.|$|E
6000|$|Neither {{spoke for}} a space. Then the eldest brother said, [...] "This <b>cooping</b> <b>up</b> and <b>cooping</b> <b>up</b> grows more than I can bear. At last, I believe, they will {{draw a line}} round our boots and tell us to live on that." ...|$|R

50|$|In some ways, {{the field}} hunter is {{more similar to}} a good {{cross-country}} horse seen in eventing than a show-ring hunter, as it must gallop and jump over varied terrain, jump ditches, <b>coops,</b> <b>up</b> and down banks, and occasionally go through water.|$|R
25|$|The newly {{activated}} VII Corps {{was made}} up of six infantry divisions and three cavalry brigades. Chabran's 1st Division, Lechi's 2nd Division, and the mounted brigades of Bessières and Schwarz were <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> inside Barcelona with Duhesme. With Gouvion Saint-Cyr were Reille's 3rd Division of 12 battalions, General of Division Joseph Souham's 4th Division of 10 battalions, General of Division Domenico Pino's 5th Division of 13 battalions, Louis François Jean Chabot's 6th Division of three battalions, and General of Brigade Jacques Fontane's cavalry brigade of one dragoon and one light cavalry regiment. There was also one unattached dragoon regiment. Including Duhesme's stranded troops, the VII Corps counted 42,380 soldiers. To build up this force, Napoleon had to shift troops from Italy to Spain. On 28 October the siege artillery finally arrived at the frontier.|$|E
25|$|Michael has {{brown eyes}} and thick, dark hair and is tall. He is {{extremely}} handsome, nice, funny, smart, and manly, despite staying <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> writing songs or on his computer the whole day. Michael is romantic and talented. Though he often clashes with his younger sister, Michael and Lilly are in fact close siblings and friends. He used to have his own webzine called Crackhead but had to disband it after an editorial that stated the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss in advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael decided to start a band called Skinner Box (name suggested by Mia), which refers to an experiment by the behavioural psychologist B. F. Skinner into proving {{the existence of a}} 'conditioned response', {{with the use of a}} specially designed box that held animals (such as rats and monkeys, in the experiment) until release, which could only be activated by pressing a lever. He started it with a few friends, including Boris Pelkowski.|$|E
500|$|Young Davenport {{was given}} a box of paints as a Christmas gift. At this stage of his youth, as his father later stated, Homer also had [...] "horse on the brain". [...] <b>Cooped</b> <b>up</b> inside {{during the winter of}} 1870–1871, in part because the entire family was quarantined on account of the {{smallpox}} outbreak that had killed Florinda, [...] Timothy told Homer stories of Arab people and their horses. Soon after, at the age of three years and nine months, the boy used his paints to produce an image he called [...] "Arabian horses." [...] He learned to ride on the family's pet horse, Old John. Following his mother's death, both of Davenport's grandmothers helped raise him. Timothy Davenport remarried in 1872, to Elizabeth “Nancy” Gilmour Wisner, and in 1873, the family moved to Silverton—the cartoonist later recounted that the move to the community, about [...] south of Portland and with a population of 300 at the time, was so he [...] "might live in the Latin Quarter of that village and inhale any artistic atmosphere that was going to waste".|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor little creature," [...] said Mr. Bell, as {{he drove}} away. [...] "It's downright cruelty, that's what it is, to keep her penned up like that.

5000|$|The word {{derives from}} the French muer, [...] "to moult", {{reflecting}} its original function to confine hawks while they moulted. [...] Shakespeare deploys to mew up to mean confine, <b>coop</b> <b>up,</b> or shut up in The Taming of the Shrew: [...] "What, will you mew her up, Signor Baptista?" [...] and also Richard III: [...] "This day should Clarence closely be mewed up".|$|R
50|$|The {{next person}} the team speaks to is Jimmy Bruno, Coop's partner before his murder. From him, a new lead arises. The {{one who was}} really {{corrupted}} was their superior, Lt. Tom McCree. Jimmy also reveals that it is Tom McCree who handles the dispatches in the precinct. With the ability to set <b>Coop</b> <b>up</b> and a reason to do so, Tom becomes a prime suspect.|$|R
500|$|The Missouri {{crisis of}} 1819–1821 {{sharpened}} commitments to expansionism among the country's slaveholding interests, when the so-called Thomas proviso established the 36°30' parallel, imposing free-soil and slave-soil futures in the Louisiana Purchase lands. While {{a majority of}} southern congressmen acquiesced {{to the exclusion of}} slavery from the bulk of the Louisiana Purchase, a significant minority objected. Virginian editor Thomas Ritchie of the Richmond Enquirer predicted that with the proviso restrictions, the South would ultimately require Texas: [...] "If we are <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> on the north, we must have elbow room to the west." [...] Representative John Floyd of Virginia in 1824 accused Secretary of State Adams of conceding Texas to Spain in 1819 in the interests of Northern anti-slavery advocates, and so depriving the South of additional slave states. Then-Representative John Tyler of Virginia invoked the Jeffersonian precepts of territorial and commercial growth as a national goal to counter the rise of sectional differences over slavery. His [...] "diffusion" [...] theory declared that with Missouri open to slavery, the new state would encourage the transfer of underutilized slaves westward, emptying the eastern states of bondsmen and making emancipation feasible in the old South. This doctrine would be revived during the Texas annexation controversy.|$|E
2500|$|In early September, western gales {{begin to}} make the North Atlantic a {{dangerous}} place for sailing. The Mayflower's provisions were already quite low when departing Southampton, and they became lower still by delays {{of more than a}} month. The passengers had been on board the ship for this entire time, and they were quite worn out and in no condition for a very taxing, lengthy Atlantic journey <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> in cramped spaces in a small ship. [...] But the Mayflower sailed from Plymouth on September 6, 1620 with what Bradford called [...] "a prosperous wind".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album in January 2010 at the [...] "magical, swampy [...] historical" [...] Dockside Studios in Maruice, Louisiana, which had previously hosted acts such as B.B. King, Derek Trucks, Mavis Staples and Dr. John. The group <b>cooped</b> <b>up</b> in guest rooms {{along the banks}} of the Vermilion Bayou in Maurice, and spent 20 days recording the album. In contrast to their debut EP, which was recorded in Campbell's bedroom and sporadically recorded with a list of limitations, they viewed Dockside as a virtual utopia in contrast. As they were completely separated from city life — [...] "You can't hear cars, there's no light pollution," [...] said Guarisco — they never found themselves distracted, simply waking up to record until [...] " [...] were dead tired" [...] in the late night. Each song from the band's debut EP was re-recorded and revamped; the band particularly redeveloped [...] "Meantime," [...] in order to [...] "recreate it in a better light." ...|$|E
50|$|East 96th Street, {{particularly}} near Second and Third Avenues, underwent significant gentrification in {{the late}} 1980s. By 2005, a wave of speculation for Harlem real estate pushed a corridor of luxury condos and <b>coops</b> <b>up</b> First Avenue from 96th Street as well. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway, which built a station on the street, has disrupted lives and businesses along 96th Street, but its opening in 2017 is expected to further increase residential and commercial development in East Harlem, as well as increasing housing value in Yorkville.|$|R
50|$|The consul Fabius {{had ordered}} Gracchus, a praetor, to march from Lucercia, {{where he had}} been wintering, on to Beneventum. Fabius' son, the Q. Fabius Maximus who became consul the {{following}} year, was in command of a separate force, and was ordered to take possession of Lucercia. Fabius ordered Gracchus to Beneventum with the idea of <b>cooping</b> <b>up</b> Hannibal in Campania, he had failed to do this previously in 215 BC, and perhaps with the scheme in mind of preventing reinforcements from reaching him. However, {{it should be noted that}} there is no evidence that Fabius had any idea that reinforcements were on their way.|$|R
5000|$|Scotty and Vera then {{approach}} Brogan Cooper {{and tell}} him they know about {{relationship between the two}} cops, but Brogan deludes himself and insists that Coop was a [...] "Lady's Man", as well as lying about the dispatch. Vera promptly reveals the dispatch slip and Brogan's false smile disappears. He proceeds to grimly admit what happened setting <b>Coop</b> <b>up</b> with help from Tom McCree to try put some sense into his son. As Scotty and Vera leave, a broken Brogan tells the two men who have turned their backs to him that he no longer cared who Coop was, and that he just wanted him back.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 1986, Prince Pujie told Behr: [...] "Puyi constantly talked about going to England and becoming an Oxford student, like Johnston." [...] On 4June 1922, Puyi attempted {{to escape from the}} Forbidden City, having decided that {{he wanted to go to}} study at Oxford, and planned to issue an open letter to [...] "the people of China" [...] renouncing the title of Emperor before leaving for Oxford. The escape attempt failed when Johnston vetoed it and refused to call a taxi and Puyi was too frightened to live on the streets of Beijing on his own. Pujie said about Puyi’s escape attempt: “Puyi’s decision had nothing to do with the impending marriage. He felt <b>cooped</b> <b>up,</b> and wanted out.” Johnston later recounted his time as Puyi's tutor between 19191924 in his 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City, which is one of main sources of information about Puyi's life in this period, though Behr cautioned that Johnston painted an idealised picture of Puyi in his book, avoiding all mention of Puyi's sexuality, that he was only an average student, his erratic mood swings, and the practice of eunuch-flogging. Pujie told Behr about Puyi's moods: [...] "When he was in a good mood, everything was fine, and he was a charming companion. If something upset him, his dark side would emerge." ...|$|E

5000|$|John Lloyd, a {{reviewer}} for Financial Times, {{wrote that}} “the sketches {{in this new}} book are vivid, humane and poignant....Khodorkovsky’s testimony is that here is a corrupt system {{with little or no}} effort to do more than <b>coop</b> <b>up</b> the hopeless, the drug-addicted, the vicious - and the occasional visionary. His vision is that Russia 'will ultimately take the road of European civilization'.... Khodorkovsky’s vision will take time - and may be realised in harsher ways than he hopes.” John O'Malley in the Washington Post called Khodorkovsky's book an [...] "illuminating and brave", noting that the stories accurately depict the state of Russian civil society caused by the years of political apathy and authoritarian rule. Roger Boyes of The Times gave a similar praise for My Fellow Prisoners describing the book as an accurate diagnosis of Russia's political struggles as evidenced by its symptoms, naming Khodorkovsky's [...] "real crime" [...] as failure to pledge feudal loyalty.|$|R
