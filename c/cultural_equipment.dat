Most of the blades are comparatively small; the longest one is about 7 cm in length. They are all made on the crested ridge technique. Besides the rich blade assemblage, we also recovered ground and polished stone axes. A small number of these were found in the course of excavations, but many have been found on the surface. It is possible that the axes were ground locally in huge querns, several of which were found in the excavations. A few ring-stones or mace-heads have also been found.

40|$|In this report, {{we argue}} {{that some of the}} most {{productive}} and edifying kinds of literature discussions among certain ages/grade levels may be best understood as “mangles of practice” (Pickering, 1995).   Mangles of practice involve the coalescence of planned and contingent forces, and they produce emergent or self-organizing transformations of ongoing social activities, as well as unpredictable outcomes or products.   Indeed, the discussions we studied had these characteristics.   They often involved both planned and contingent actions and reactions by individual, social, cultural, and material agents and agencies.   As such, they were emergent phenomena about which we could seldom predict what precise collections, collisions, and collusions of actions and reactions would occur within them or what the effects of these collections, collisions, and collusions would be.   In spite of (or more likely because of) their unpredictability, these discussions were extremely dynamic knowledge-producing activities.   Given this social fact, we think our findings contribute significantly to understanding the lineaments and potentials of dialogic pedagogy, which deepens students’ learning and development.   More specifically, when teachers successfully prompt and engage students in more robustly dialogic talk that promotes text-to-life connections, life-to text connections, linkages to non-school knowledge (like that of popular culture), etc., then students often reap a wide variety of benefits with respect to their abilities to engage in genuine inquiry, to reason and argue for particular interpretations, to evaluate complex human actions and decisions, and to develop principled social, <b>cultural,</b> and moral <b>equipment</b> for living their own lives. </p...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionA crisis team {{management}} (CTM) simulation course {{was developed by}} volunteers from Health Volunteers Overseas for physicians and nurses at Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC) in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The framework for the course was adapted from crisis resource management (1, 2), crisis team training (3), and TeamSTEPPs© models (4). The CTM course focused on teaching physicians and nurses {{on the development of}} team performance knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Challenges to providing this course at AHC included availability of simulation <b>equipment,</b> <b>cultural</b> differences in learning, and language barriers. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the impact of a CTM simulation course at AHC on attitudes and perceptions of participants on concepts related to team performance. MethodsEach of the CTM courses consisted of three lectures, including team performance concepts, communication, and debriefing followed by rotation through four simulation scenarios. The evaluation instrument used to evaluate the AHC CTM course was developed for Cambodian staff at AHC based on TeamSTEPPs© instruments evaluating attitude and perceptions of team performance (5). CTM team performance concepts included in lectures, debriefing sessions, and the evaluation instrument were: team structure, leadership, situation monitoring, mutual support, and communication. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze pre- and post-test paired data from participants in the course. ResultsOf the 54 participants completing the three CTM courses at AHC, 27 were nurses, 6 were anesthetists, and 21 were physicians. Attitude and perception scores were found to significantly improve (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) for team structure, leadership, situation monitoring, and communication.

40|$|International audienceOver 60 % of {{the world}} {{population}} lives within a 150 km belt from the coastline. These territories that combine classic urban characteristics and natural features (coast, beaches, salt marshes, biodiversity reserves) are fragile but also attractive for residence, leisure and retirement. They are characterized by an unequal repartition of amenities, services, jobs {{as well as by}} uneven real estate prices. This geographical and social context raises the issue of inequality in the capability of using urban spaces, which can need a regulation from public authorities (ESCR Global Environmental Change Program, 2001). A growing attention is paid by geographical research to uneven distribution of environmental properties. We propose to analyze environmental and ecological inequalities in the specific context of urban coastal areas {{in order to determine the}} influence of the coast on the structuring of this type of territories. Environmental and ecological inequalities can be defined as observed and perceived differences, in the relation between humans and their living environment, which can discriminate individuals or groups of individuals under 4 categories: territorial inequalities that refer to differences in the quality of territories and the distribution of population groups; inequalities in access to urban and environmental amenities that refer to unequal opportunities of mobility in the city, of access to spaces and public goods, as well as possibilities of choice of residence places; inequalities in nuisances and hazards exposure; inequalities in the capacity of action and interpellation of public authorities for the transformation of living conditions. The aim of our study is to analyze through a quantitative analysis to what extent, coastal cities have specific socio-environmental characteristics compared to inland cities and to determine if those specificities may reinforce the socio-environmental inequalities in coastal territories. Focusing on French medium sized urban spaces (between 100 000 and 200 000 inhabitants) we offer a comparative analysis of the spatial distribution of socio-environmental characteristics between coastal and inland urban areas. Then, still relying on this definition and on these indicators, we will focus on coastal urban areas. Multivariate analysis of data show that cities are divided into two groups: coastal groups and continental ones. Coastal urban areas are defined by a more touristic profile. The population is older and lots of equipment is dedicated to this population. The building and development dynamic is strong. Among coastal cities, it is possible to define different geographical profiles whose characteristics can be analyzed in terms of socio-environmental inequalities. Inland urban areas are defined by a larger proportion of social, <b>cultural</b> and education <b>equipment.</b> The population is dominated by working population but the entrepreneurial dynamic is lower. The surface of agricultural land is higher and the use of green transportation is more common. Finally the risks exposure is lower. In a context of growing attractiveness, politic options can play a central part in limiting the development of inequalities and managing the consequences of the attraction of the coastal part of the city and the associated socio-environmental inequalities resulting from the competition between groups of population...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of producing open pollinated (O. P) corn varieties as a grain source for the production of specialty whiskies. Low profit margins on corn grain as a commodity make it difficult for small to medium size farmers to grow corn competitively. Such farmers could benefit from a cash crop that could offer a higher profit margin. There is current popular interest in heirloom (old-time) grains, including O. P varieties. This may provide an opportunity for a distiller to develop a market for a specialty whisky using O. P. varieties. An advantage for O. P corn as a specialty crop for corn growers is the similarities in <b>equipment,</b> <b>cultural</b> practices, and inputs. No major conversion is needed. 	Field studies were initiated to determine the production potential and reliability of O. P. varieties in New York environments, and to identify the best varieties. Comparative yield trials were conducted over two growing seasons in various locations. Varieties were selected on the basis of anticipated adaptation to New York growing conditions, potential for grain production and commercial availability of seed. 	In 2001, seventeen open pollinated varieties along with a modern hybrid check were tested at Aurora, (central) and Kingston, (eastern), NY. In 2002, twenty varieties were planted at Aurora. Those considered earlier varieties were also planted at Bliss, (western). Also, in 2002, later varieties were planted at Kingston, and Pittsford, (western). 	All trials were set up in randomized complete block designs. Treatments consisted of two adjacent rows of each variety with approximately 36 - 40 seeds planted within each block. Each trial consisted of three blocks. The plots were thinned to a density of 18, 000 plants/acre. 	Several major obstacles were observed First, yields of O. P. varieties were lower and more variable than yields of hybrids. The mean corn yield in bushels for New York State is 100. 7 bu/acre (www. nass. usda. gov) averaged over the three years. (1999 - 2001). Many of the varieties in these trials occasionally performed at or above this level, but none consistently, except the hybrid checks. Stalks were also weak, blowing down in winds, and making harvest difficult. Perhaps most significantly, the data showed wide variation in variety performance between years and locations, even among the same varieties. 	Premium alcoholic beverage producers could tolerate high O. P. grain costs if they could develop a market for a high value specialty whiskey featuring an O. P. corn source. However they would need reliable grain supplies. In these studies O. P. corn production was erratic, and not dependable from year to year, or site to site. This lack of dependability would present an unacceptable business risk. One possible solution might be to develop a product based mostly on readily available, inexpensive hybrid corn grain, mixed with a small amount of open pollinated grain. 	If a business plan could be developed that protects against fluctuations of availability, the concept of using O. P. corn to differentiate a small batch premium alcoholic beverage might have potential for success. This could provide employment in the processing, distilling and bottling processes. And O. P corn might provide a profitable niche crop for a limited number of corn growers...|$|R

40|$|This article deals {{with the}} {{definition}} of amenity and more specifi- cally with cultural amenity issues. The very concept of amenity still remains unclear though it has been widely used both in the environmental field since the 70 ’s, and in the cultural one {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. In the latter stream of literature, it is used to discuss urban development based on culture and creative class theory. However, the concept is often reduced to the amount of <b>cultural</b> <b>equipment</b> available in a city. We define an amenity as a non-market service provided by the specific features pertaining to an area. In addition, the amenity is a non-excludable and non-rivalrous service within this area. The originality of this paper lies in the analysis of the conditions under which cultural amenities can be generated and strengthened at a city scale. The process of cultural amenity generation depends on three main features concerning cultural assets: their density, their anchorage in the city and the implementation of flagship assets. Cultural activities can be instrumental in shaping charm, image and ambiance of cities. The last three items are examples of amenities. The randomness, the complexity and the bottom-up aspect of the amenity generation phenomenon is also discussed. Side issues that are at stake such as city gentrification, strategies of access to amenities are also part of our reflection. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{traditional}} logic, {{one feature}} {{of the notion of}} proposition is that it can stand either true or false. A proposition can be tested, confirmed, and verifiedor falsified. In exact and empirical sciences, such an understanding of proposition holds sway. To be meaningful in the empirical or scientific sense, a proposition must have a truth-valuei. e., it should either be true or false. In ordinary life, it is important that our statements should also be capable of being tested and demonstrated as true or false. This is necessary to get on with our day-to-day living. That the statement The train leaves at 9 : 33 A. M.  is verifiable speaks {{a great deal about the}} necessity of having some viable order in the practical realm so that we can get on with our lives. There are, however, statements in our daily existencestatements havinga propositional formthat are meaningful but are not capable of being tested, demonstrated, and verified. God exists, Nature is One, and There is life after death, are such statements. They are called pivot-propositions. But pivot-propositions are actually not propositions. They are presuppositionsthings that we simply take for grantedwhich belong to the sphere of religious beliefs, communal convictions, and artistic intimations. More importantly, they form the world-view of a group of people sharing the same heritage, tradition, and <b>cultural</b> <b>equipment.</b> R. G. Collingwood and Ludwig Wittgenstein are interested in the fascinating and peculiar role that pivot-propositions play in our way of thinking, judging, and coping with things in the practical domain of human existence. The pivot-propositions are essentially the background to our thoughts, the standard of our judgments, and the motivating force of our actions. In a word, they shape the way we relate with the world around us and the way we manage things within our cultural matrix. Despite the differences in philosophical background, temper, and style,Collingwood and Wittgenstein basically articulate the same views on pivot-propositionsexhibiting an intellectual affinity that runs deep. The main burden of this dissertation is to explore this intellectual kinship as gleaned from their convergent construal of pivot-propositions in On Certainty (Wittgenstein) and An Essay on Metaphysics (Collingwood). It also attempts to situate the theme of pivot-propositions within the broader spectrum of their philosophical interests. This dissertation proposes the thesis that Collingwoods and Wittgensteins intellectual bondas exemplified in their notions of pivot-propositionsis forged by their common bent of mind. They are philosophers who think in terms of overlap and family-resemblances. This is underlying reason why their thoughts do not only articulate similar insights on pivot-propositions; they also converge at the crossroads of their discourses on language, ethics, aesthetics, and magic. Given the distinctive turn of mind, Collingwood and Wittgenstein are, at bottom, two thinkers who are mindful to the constantly changing disclosures of being. status: publishe...|$|E
