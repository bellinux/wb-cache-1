40|$|<b>Coppice</b> <b>systems</b> are {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} forms of woodland management known and on some sites their use {{has been documented}} for centuries. Distinctive assemblages {{of plants and animals}} are associated with such systems and are highly valued in nature conservation terms. The richness of such assemblages, and conversely, the species that do not thrive under coppice, are linked to the alternation of relatively short light and dark phases and the juxtaposition of stands at different stages in the coppice cycle. We review how and why the biodiversity of former coppice woods changes in response to abandonment and conversion to high forest. We focus on the situation in the UK, based on recent published literature searches and the authors’ extensive experiences of the practical issues involved in the conservation of <b>coppice</b> woodland <b>systems.</b> Vascular plants in the ground flora, invertebrates of open glades and scrub, and small birds of the understorey may have become more abundant in coppice than they would have been under ‘natural’ forest conditions. By contrast epiphytes dependent on mature trees and species of large-sized deadwood are less favoured by <b>coppice</b> management. <b>Coppice</b> <b>systems</b> developed to meet the local community needs. As social and economic conditions changed, so coppicing declined and the woods were transformed into high forest through neglect or deliberate management. High forests differ from coppice stands in their spatial and temporal dynamics and consequently in their wildlife particularly with respect to their vertical structure pattern; extent of open space and young growth; spatial heterogeneity; tree and shrub composition; and browsing levels. Three issues for the conservation of biodiversity arise from these changes: • What priority and resources should be given to halting further decline, by maintaining coppice compared to allowing sites to develop with more ‘natural’ high forest structures and dynamics; will associated high-forest species recolonise? • If we restore <b>coppice</b> <b>systems,</b> will the species assemblages present in the past also recover, under current and future changes in environmental conditions; i. e is the transformation reversible under current environmental conditions? • Are there other ways in which ‘coppice-associated’ species might be maintained?

40|$|Abstract- Ash-sycamore {{secondary}} forest {{is an important}} forest type that it is increasingly spreading in northern Italy. Nowadays, these forests are not managed with high forest system as they are left in natural evolution and subsequently managed with <b>coppice</b> <b>system</b> without improvement in timber quality. Remarkable potentiality and strong dynamism of these new spontaneous forests, able to colonize in short time fertile lands once used by agricultural activities, have been underlined in many sites. Research activities have shown interesting results in terms of high quality timber production by applying the target tree system. This management approach permits to improve the timber quality concentrating forest practices and production on a restricted number of trees (70 - 150 per hectare). This practice allows a considerable cost reduction and a good growth improvement. First thinning has to be realized at about 15 - 20 years when the dominant trees have average dbh of 9 - 12 cm, height of 12 – 16 m., and crowns deep enough and able to react to thinning and to maintain diameter growth about 1 cm.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to compare the cost of coppice and longer rotation poplar harvesting technology.

Two potential approaches for coppice harvesting are modified forage harvesters and modified mulcher-balers. Both of these systems effectively handle multistemmed feedstock. Total harvesting cost to roadside likely ranges from $ 11 to $ 15 Mg green. The most significant harvesting constraint with <b>coppice</b> <b>systems</b> is the requirement for dormant season operations. More conventional poplar harvesting at production scales uses forest machines for felling and extraction. The Billion Ton Update report used previous productivity studies to estimate a roadside cost for felling and skidding of about $ 6 Mg green (unchipped). With chipping cost, single-stem systems are about the same roadside price as coppice harvesting. Other factors such as stand establishment, feedstock storage, and rotation length are more likely to determine an economically optimum management system...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{bio-energy}} crops {{for electricity}} production {{is considered an}} effective means to mitigate the greenhouse effect, mainly due to its ability to substitute fossil fuels. A Whole range of crops qualify for bio-energy production and a rational choice is not readily made. This paper evaluates the energy and greenhouse gas balance of a mixed indigenous hardwood coppice as an extensive, low-input bio-energy crop. The impact on fossil energy use and greenhouse gas emission is calculated and discussed by comparing its life cycle (cultivation, processing and conversion into energy) with two conventional bio-energy crops (short rotation systems of willow and, Miscanthus). For each life cycle process, the flows of fossil energy and greenhouse gas that are created {{for the production of}} one functional unit are calculated. The results show-that low-input bio-energy crops use comparatively less fossil fuel and avoid more greenhouse gas emission per unit of produced energy than conventional bio-energy crops during the first 100 yr. Where the mixed <b>coppice</b> <b>system</b> avoids up till 0. 13 t CO 2 eq. /GJ, Miseanthus does not exceed 0. 07 t CO 2 eq. /GJ. After 100 yr their performances become comparable, amounting,to 0. 05 t CO 2 eq. /ha/GJ. However, if the land surface itself is chosen as a functional unit, conventional crops perform better with respect to mitigating the greenhouse effect.

40|$|One {{of major}} issues dealing with forest {{management}} in Italy {{is the lack}} or the suspension of silvicultural practices over an increased share of the forest area, in progress since a few decades ago. The abandonment of rural areas, the emerging environmental functions being nowadays addressed to natural resources, include also many forests and management systems formerly devoted mainly to wood production. This occurrence has its major evidence on coppice forests, i. e. about a {{half of the country}} forest area and the forest type historically submitted to the more intensive management practices. The results of an experimental trial started in 1972 in a beech coppice aged 27, i. e. a few years after the age of traditional rotation, comparing the natural evolutive pattern as well as the silvicultural practices aimed at its conversion into high forest, are here reported. The trial included the control thesis and three different thinning intensities. Each thesis was arranged within the same thinning type, taking into account the volume of former standing crop in each plot. The analysis includes the growth pattern and the dynamics of stand structure in the populations under natural evolution and under conversion into high forest. Four inventories were carried out since 1972 at each decade up to 2002. Three thinnings were undertaken within the same time. Results show that both the tested management options, alternative and/or complementary to the traditional <b>coppice</b> <b>system,</b> are based on reliable biological assumptions. The natural evolutive pattern highlights the growth trend at ages older than those monitored under the <b>coppice</b> <b>system.</b> Beech shows a peculiar behaviour in the range observed due to its specific shade-tolerance. The shoot population reveals a sustained growth between the ages of 30 to 40; then, the occurrence of a heavy, regular mortality up to 50; finally, the recovery of a high growth rate up to the age of 60 (ending of the monitored period at now). Such growth pattern moves up the current volume increment, delays its intersection to mean increment and postpones substantially the age of growth rates culmination. The observed trend deviates from the canonical stand growth pattern and seems to be grounded on beech auto-ecology. This extends the time of reaction between the opposite feedbacks of mortality and growth and allows monitoring a likely different behaviour ruling ageing coppice growth. The same occurrence had not been highlighted before studying light-demanding species (deciduous oaks in the case) under the same stand types, these species being able to settle much more rapidly the cycle mortality-growth recovery-incremental culmination. The thesis of conversion into high forest provides the technical cultivation rules (type, intensity and interval of thinning repetition) and suggests it as enforceable also in the private domain due to the shortly-repeated harvestings and intermediate volumes that make each intervention profitable. The basic outcomes of the applied silvicultural practices are (i) the early crown shaping of shoot dendrotypes; (ii) the modeling of clustered stand structure; (iii) the individual development of well-balanced trees, more suited to tackle the grown-up and mature stages till the time of regeneration from seed, ending of the transitory cycle. st 1 behavior:url(#ieooui) /* Style Definitions */ table.

Three alley coppice experiments were established to study the interaction of SRC with high value timber trees. In Experiment 1 the cherry variety - willow interaction is investigated: 5 willow varieties (and a mixture of all 5); (‘Resolution’, ‘Beagle’, ‘Endeavour’, ‘Olaf’ and ‘Terra Nova’) interact with rows of clonal wild cherry: ‘Neso’, ‘Pluto’, ‘Saturn’, ‘Hermes’ and ‘Concordia’ and one control of seedlings. The willow is planted in double rows 0. 75 m by 1. 5 m apart. Cherry trees are planted at an intra-row tree to tree spacing of 2. 5 m and inter-row spacing of 12. 75 m and alley widths of 1 m & 2 m.

These rates equate to biomass production of 2.71  t DM ha− 1 for ‘AF- 6 ’, 1.36  t ha− 1 for ‘AF- 2 ’, and 1.09  t ha− 1 for ‘AF- 8 ’ using a rate/share of DM (%) of 41 % (Niemczyk et al. 2016). Interestingly, the ‘AF- 6 ’ cultivar had relatively good productivity in that study but did very poorly in the current study. Benetka et al. (2014) compared the productivity of four local cultivars in a study {{conducted in}} the Czech Republic, south-west of Poland, using the ‘NE- 42 ’ cultivar as a control. The ‘NE- 42 ’ cultivar produced 8.3  t DM ha− 1  year− 1 during the first cycle under the most favourable site conditions. Each succeeding cycle (from the four employed) produced even higher yields, i.e. 15.4, 18.9, and 15.9  t ha− 1  year− 1, respectively. Importantly, ‘NE- 42 ’ was highly productive regardless of soil conditions. Such high productivity could be due to the exceptional adaptive capacities of this cultivar, which was selected from several thousand seedlings derived from planned crosses over 80  years ago (Stout and Schreiner 1933) and was one of 27 Schreiner and Stout crosses that were introduced to Poland in 1938.

Additionally, structural and compositional vegetation samplings were performed to test whether vascular species changes occurred between 2006 and 2011. In total 57 (20 x 20 mt) beech forest plots were investigated. Results shows that community changes have occurred between the 5 years, in particular the differences are driven by changes in tree canopy cover, substrate and aspect while official age since last coppice (Based on the registers of the National Forest Service) did not result significant.

Both site and land use variables explained the observed pattern of ground vegetation composition. The most important part of this variation was explained by the site variables that bring together environmental and habitat variables. The chief determinants of forest use were the historical forestry treatment and the historical dominant livestock. The species assemblage of forests historically grazed by cattle and treated as <b>coppice</b> selective <b>system</b> or without forestry practices {{for more than a century}} reflected high level of disturbances. On the contrary, the species assemblage of the forests historically grazed by sheep and that experienced <b>coppice</b> selective <b>system</b> or both coppice-with-standards and timber forestry treatment reflected a lower disturbance context. Finally, the forest historically grazed by both cattle and sheep and treated as coppice-with-standard revealed an intermediate level of disturbances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|Many {{species of}} fruit, e.g., fig, filbert, olive, and pomegranate, are {{commonly}} grown {{on their own}} roots, as {{there may be no}} great advantages to using a special rootstock, or suitable rootstocks may not be readily available. However, even for fruit trees that usually are grown grafted on a rootstock, there can be advantages in growing them on their own roots instead, particularly in the traditional <b>coppicing</b> <b>systems</b> advocated in both sustainable agriculture and permaculture. Disadvantages of using own-root trees can include excessive size and excessive production of wood (thus very long times until the start of fruit production), although training branches horizontally and limiting pruning to summer only may help encourage fruit production at an earlier age. There is a lack of research {{on the use of the}} own root method in large-scale systems. British horticulturalist Hugh Ermen was a prominent advocate of own root fruit trees, particularly Apple trees, following his work at the Brogdale research centre in Kent.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of a {{long-term}} research program concerning management of ageing holm oak coppices, results available after 14 growing seasons are reported in present paper. Experimental treatments include: A) 50 standards per hectare, all of the same age; B) 250 standards per hectare, all of the same age; C) 140 standards per hectare, with two different ages; D) conversion to high forest; E) natural evolution (control). A total of 15 permanent plots were established (5 treatments x 3 replicates per treatment) and the experimental design used is that of randomised blocks. Based on observations concerning seedlings and shoots development and standards growth and competitive effects, the following preliminary results may be highlighted: i) recovering the traditional <b>coppicing</b> <b>system</b> with few standards per hectare represents a valid option from both ecological and shoots growth point of view; the stools, with few standards per hectare, showed {{a larger number of}} sprouts, provided with a higher average height and larger diameters; ii) uneven-aged standards represent a good alternative form the points of view of both landscape impact immediately after felling operations and stand resistance to climatic damages; iii) a good alternative is to apply conversion treatments to high forest, whenever their site quality allows these operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} harvest on European forest net {{ecosystem}} exchange (NEE) of carbon and its photosynthetic and respiratory components (GPP (gross primary production) and TER (total ecosystem respiration)) were examined by comparing four pairs of mature/harvested sites in Europe via {{a combination of}} eddy covariance measurements and empirical modeling. Three of the comparisons represented high coniferous forestry (spruce in Britain, and pines in Finland and France), while a coppice-with-standard oak plantation was examined in Italy. While every comparison revealed that harvesting converted a mature forest carbon sink into a carbon source of similar magnitude, the mechanisms by which this occurred were very different according to species or management practice. In Britain, Finland, and France the annual sink (source) strength for mature (clear-cut) stands was estimated at 496 (112), 138 (239), and 222 (225) g C m− 2, respectively, with 381 (427) g C m− 2 for the mature (coppiced) stand in Italy. In all three cases of high forestry in Britain, Finland, and France, clear-cutting crippled the photosynthetic capacity of the ecosystem – with mature (clear-cut) GPP of 1970 (988), 1010 (363), and 1600 (602) g C m− 2 – and also reduced ecosystem respiration {{to a lesser degree}} – TER of 1385 (1100), 839 (603), and 1415 (878) g C m− 2, respectively. By contrast, harvesting of the coppice oak system provoked a burst in respiration – with mature (clear-cut) TER estimated at 1160 (2220) gC m− 2 – which endured for the 3 years sampled postharvest. The harvest disturbance also reduced GPP in the <b>coppice</b> <b>system</b> – with mature (clear-cut) GPP of 1600 (1420) g C m− 2 – but to a lesser extent than in the coniferous forests, and with near-complete recovery within a few years. Understanding the effects of harvest on the carbon balance of European forest systems is a necessary step towards characterizing carbon exchange for timberlands on large scales...|$|E

Plant {{diversity}} and energy potency of community forest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia: Searching for fast growing wood species for energy production. Nusantara Bioscience 8 : 22 - 30. Nowadays, {{there is an}} increasing interest in intensifying the production and use of biomass to replace fossil fuels {{for the production of}} heat and electricity, especially for a remote area that generally abundance with the wood biomass resources including in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. In this work, diversity of plant species that commonly growth in community forest area of East Kutai District, East Kalimantan, Indonesia had been studied to point out their energy potency to be used as biomass feedstock for the electricity generated. Diversity of plant species in the community forest was evaluated by making 13 sampling plots with 20 mx 20 m size approximately. Concurently, the energy properties of plant biomass such as proximate and ultimate compositions were also analyzed using ASTM methods. Results showed that more than 30 species of tropical trees and wood shrubs were grown in the community forest. The presence of them was classified into two different growth of origins: natural and artificial plantation, and also three different categories of plant resources: tree species from logged over forest, commercial fast growing plant tree species for the fiber production and woody shrubs. The highest dominancy and productivity was found in Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) Nielsen since the wood biomass was artificially planted for the commercial purposes. Among the 31 plant species analyzed we found the highest energy potency was obtained from Cratoxylum cochinchinense (Lour.) Blume that produced 3. 17 MWh/ton, and the lowest was from Trema orientalis (L.) Blume 0. 97 MWh/ton. The woody shrubs species such as Vernonia amigdalina Delile., Piper aduncum L., Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp., Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner., Bridelia tomentosa Blume, Vitex pinnata L., Vernonia arborea Buch. -Ham. and Bauhinia purpurea var. corneri de Wit. were suitable to be used as sustainable feedstocks for the electricity generated and promising to be developed as energy plant species in the future using Short Rotation <b>Coppice</b> <b>system</b> (SRC) ...|$|E
40|$|Fast growing hybrids of Salix and Populus can {{be grown}} in a short {{rotation}} coppice (SRC) system to produce renewable energy. This PhD investigates the interactions between the environment and productivity, {{with a view to}} finding the key limiting factors to yield and the potential of these crops to fulfil UK renewable energy obligations, now and in the future. An empirical modelling technique, using partial least squares regression was developed to extrapolate actual field observations to a national scale. Genotype x age x environment interactions were studied to examine the key limiting factors to productivity. Modelled yields differed between genotypes, with mean annual aboveground biomass ranging from 4. 9 to 10. 7 oven dry tonnes (odt) per hectare for Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides genotype ‘Beaupré’ and Salix triandra x S. viminalis genotype ‘Q 83 ’, respectively. Variation in yield was primarily described by spring and summer precipitation, suggesting water availability is the key limiting factor to yield. Output from the model was up-scaled across the UK using a geographic information system (GIS), and scenarios were developed to better understand the role and impact of land use management and policy development on potential crop distribution. For example, to meet UK biomass and biofuel targets without compromising food security or ecosystem services, would require 5 % of grade 3 land, 56 % grade 4 land and 47 % of grade 5 land. This quantity of biomass would produce 7. 5 M tonnes of biomass per annum and would theoretically generate 15. 5 TWh yr- 1 of electrical energy, displacing 3. 3 M tonnes of oil – approximately 4 % of current UK electricity demand. The South West and North West alone producing over a third of this figure (5. 2 TWh yr- 1). These results suggest that SRC has the potential to become a significant component of a mixed portfolio of renewables. Furthermore, climate change is predicted to have far reaching consequences on crop growth. Process-based models can help quantify these interactions and predict future productivity. Here we use ForestGrowth-SRC, a process-based model originally designed for high-forest species and parameterised for a <b>coppice</b> <b>system.</b> Climate change scenarios (UK Climate Projections) were run with the model {{to assess the impact of}} a changing climate on the growth and spatial distribution of SRC poplar. Results suggest ForestGrowth-SRC is capable of accurately simulating growth over a large spatial and temporal scale. However, pests and disease were found to significantly affect yield. In the absence of pests and disease, productivity could increase by 20 % nationwide by 2080 (under a medium emissions scenario), suggesting we will see a future increase in the value and production of these crops as feedstocks for heat, power and liquid transportation fuel...|$|E
40|$|In European {{mountain}} regions, forests play {{an important}} role in the mitigation of risk due to natural hazards such as landslides, rockfalls, floods and avalanches. Conifer species usually provide a protective effect at higher altitude, while at lower altitudes broadleaf species are dominant. These forests are or were often managed as <b>coppice</b> <b>systems.</b> The high stem density of coppice stands, their rapid growth and the permanence of root systems in the soil can be considered as assets in terms of protective function. However, these considerations are poorly researched and there is generally a lack of studies investigating the suitability of coppice as protection forests. The issue is relevant, considering that many coppice stands in mountain regions have become uneconomic and are now abandoned and overaged. Whether and how to manage these forests stands is a key question for practitioners. In this contribution we analyze the implications of coppice management for slope stability and in particular to mitigate shallow landslides, focusing on root reinforcement, the main mechanism by which vegetation can reinforce slopes. We review available studies concerning root distribution and dynamics in coppice stands to formulate hypotheses about their contribution in terms of root reinforcement. Finally we highlight the lacks of knowledge and the further steps needed to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the coppices in protecting against shallow landslides...|$|R
40|$|Aspen {{management}} in the Intermountain West has conventionally relied {{on its ability to}} vegetatively reproduce, and has long been used to guide silviculture (e. g., <b>coppice</b> <b>systems).</b> Aspen is prolific in its sprouting response to overstory removal, capable of producing thousands of shoots per hectare. The successful reproduction of aspen is of considerable {{management in}}terest. Without intervention, current threats to the persistence of aspen communities may lead to the continued decline of aspen in the Intermountain West. Successful regeneration is defined as the timely recruitment of a new cohort of aspen stems such that they are no longer susceptible to herbivory or other detrimental factors associated with juvenility. In the broader context of aspen ecology, we can postulate three important drivers of successful aspen regeneration: (1) stand vigor, (2) disturbance history (e. g., management actions), and (3) climatic conditions. A multitude of interactions between these drivers likely ultimately determines the timing, quantity, and quality of aspen regeneration. We measured sites with known management histories on Cedar Mountain and southwestern Utah in order to quantify the success of regeneration based on a comparison of unique pre-treatment versus post-treatment stand conditions. By simultaneously exploring a multitude of factors that possibly affect aspen regeneration, this research: (1) sampled across multiple stand conditions (N= 103), elucidating a diversity of regeneration drivers; (2) identified multiple management scenarios for successful aspen regeneration; and (3) incorporated state-of-the-art knowledge regarding aspen regeneration ecology into a management guide...|$|R
