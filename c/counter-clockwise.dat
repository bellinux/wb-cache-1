5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly <b>counter-clockwise.</b> On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are <b>counter-clockwise,</b> and other evidence shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows <b>counter-clockwise</b> rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{before leaving}} Mecca, pilgrims perform a {{farewell}} tawaf called the Tawaf al-Wadaa. 'Wadaa' means 'to bid farewell'. The pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times <b>counter-clockwise,</b> {{and if they}} can, attempt to touch or kiss the Kaaba.|$|E
5|$|October 26, 1897– After {{executing}} a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop, {{a tropical}} storm hits the Outer Banks from the northeast before continuing southeastward; its effects are minimal.|$|E
5|$|According to RSMC New Delhi, Cyclone Agni {{developed}} into a depression at 1.5°N, {{which is the same}} latitude as where according to RSMC Tokyo, Tropical Storm Vamei formed during December 2001. However, according to RSMC La Reunion, the precursor low to Cyclone Agni moved into the Southern Hemisphere and became an anticyclone as it had kept its <b>counter-clockwise</b> circulation.|$|E
5|$|Baseball is a bat-and-ball {{game played}} between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team {{attempts}} to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running <b>counter-clockwise</b> around {{a series of}} four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (<b>counter-clockwise,</b> as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|The outside {{edges of}} the Green are bordered by benches and trees; two {{flagpoles}} stand {{at the center of}} the western side. The plot is bounded by four streets: Wheelock Street to the south, College Street to the east, Wentworth Street to the north, and Main Street to the west. All but Wheelock Street are one-way roads, with traffic circulating <b>counter-clockwise</b> around the Green.|$|E
5|$|This list of {{bridges and}} other fixed links serving the Island of Montreal {{proceeds}} <b>counter-clockwise</b> {{around the island}} from southwest, at the exit of Lake Saint-Louis, downstream along the St. Lawrence River, then upstream along Rivière des Prairies {{all the way to}} Lake of Two Mountains, then downstream again along the East Channel of the Ottawa River until it reaches Lake Saint-Louis. The year of construction is that of the structure currently in place, accompanied by the year of construction of the original structure if the current one replaced an older span.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate <b>counter-clockwise</b> in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In an environment of cool ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection dissipated, leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop, the remnant low dissipated five days later.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent {{bursts of}} deep {{convection}} kept satellite intensity estimates at 40mph (65km/h) {{through the morning}} of June28. After becoming embedded within a low-level westerly flow, the system began to slowly execute a small <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop. That afternoon, Celia degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system; operationally, the system was monitored as a tropical depression for an additional six hours before the final advisory from the NHC was issued. The remnants of Celia continued to drift towards the north before finally dissipating on June30, about 990mi (1,590km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{consists}} of a mostly flat low-lying area in the midlands, ringed by mountain ranges such as (beginning in County Kerry and working <b>counter-clockwise)</b> the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, Comeragh Mountains, Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, the Mournes, Glens of Antrim, Sperrin Mountains, Bluestack Mountains, Derryveagh Mountains, Ox Mountains, Nephinbeg Mountains and the Twelve Bens/Maumturks group. Some mountain ranges are further inland {{in the south of}} Ireland, such as the Galtee Mountains (the highest inland range), Silvermine and Slieve Bloom Mountains. The highest peak Carrauntoohil, 1,038m (3,405ft) high, is in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, a range of glacier-carved sandstone mountains. Ireland's mountains are not high – only three peaks are over 1,000m (3,281ft) and another 457 exceed 500m (1,640ft).|$|E
5|$|On October3, {{the center}} of Onil skimmed the {{coastline}} of northwestern India; however, the center did not cross land. Around this time, the upper-level circulation detached from the low-level circulation, further weakening the storm. Early on October4, the JTWC stated that the system had degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system. After executing a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop, the depression slowly tracked south-southeastward, away from land. By October7, the system was reclassified as a tropical depression by the JTWC as it stalled several hundred kilometres southwest of Gujarat, India. The system maintained a relatively low intensity for the following several days before making landfall near Porbandar with winds of 45km/h (30mph). Within hours of moving inland, Onil dissipated early on October10.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Hurricane Hilary's motion became unsteady. After nearly stalling, the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} west on August22, only to become nearly stationary again the next day. Slowly executing a small <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop, Hilary underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Storm Irwin which was several hundred miles southeast. Meanwhile, Hilary began to weaken, by early on August22, the eye became poorly defined and convection diminished. The eye dissipated within 12 hours, and the winds quickly diminished to 85mph (130km/h). Later that day, the thunderstorm activity became partially exposed from the center, and on August23, Hilary was downgraded to a tropical storm {{due to lack of}} organization.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{our understanding of}} the Galilean moons, and also discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close-up images of the planet's atmosphere, revealing the Great Red Spot as a complex storm moving in a <b>counter-clockwise</b> direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} continued west-northwestward, passing {{north of}} the Leeward Islands, before drifting northwestward. It once again attained tropical storm status on September 28, while situated well {{to the east of}} the Bahamas. Inga continued to intensify, and achieved hurricane status at 0000 UTC on September 30, at which point it turned northeastward. The storm then abruptly, yet gradually, turned towards the south, and ultimately completed a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop as it bent back westward. Steering currents were weak, and the hurricane continued to proceed slowly. Late on October 3, it turned to the northwest, still as a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm then curved northeastward and intensified to Category 2 status at 0000 UTC on October 5.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical cyclone {{moved away}} from the coast and {{strengthened}} to the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on November1. It began a weakening trend on November2 while taking a wavering path across the north Atlantic Ocean. On November4, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November6 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop over northwest France until dissipating the storm on November8.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the central}} {{pressure}} of the depression had decreased to 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was {{compared to that of}} a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft flew into Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet flew into the storm. The storm executed a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop, ending on November3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system. By this time, the storm had also begun a southeastward track.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding with Chan-hom's abrupt {{collapse}} on July3, {{the system}} turned northeast as it entered a {{weakness in the}} steering ridge. Later that day, the broad circulation turned north-northwest. Wind shear eased early on July4 as the TUTT cell retreated {{to the north and}} the subtropical ridge steadily re-established itself. Convection started redeveloping over the tropical storm. Late on July4 into July5, the center of Chan-hom skirted the southern coast of Rota in the Mariana Islands. While near the island, Chan-hom executed an unusual <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop owing to interaction with a monsoon trough. Once clear of the Mariana Islands, steady development ensued owing to low wind shear and good outflow. Early on July7, Chan-hom attained typhoon intensity according to the JMA, following to a burst in central convection. Microwave satellite imagery indicated the formation of an eye as convection deepened and banding features tightened around the circulation.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Celia was a powerful, early-season Category5 {{tropical}} cyclone that existed over the open {{waters of the}} eastern Pacific Ocean during late June 2010. Forming out of a tropical wave about 370mi (595km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico on June18, Celia quickly organized as deep convection consolidated around the center, attaining hurricane status by June20. Over the following days, the hurricane's winds fluctuated as wind shear impeded significant development hindering it from becoming potientially dangerous. Once this shear lightened on June24, the storm rapidly intensified to attain its peak strength with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and an estimated barometric pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). Not long after reaching this strength, wind shear increased and the system entered a dry, stable environment. Over the following 42hours, Hurricane Celia's sustained winds decreased to tropical storm force and the system began to stall over the open ocean by June27. Despite highly unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to retain tropical storm status through June28 and degenerated into a non-convective remnant low that evening. The remnants of Celia drifted northward, completing a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop, and dissipated on June30.|$|E
5|$|Later on August6, the {{weakening}} trend briefly halted as outflow significantly improved {{due to an}} {{area of low pressure}} north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough approaching from the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on {{the weakening}} cyclone around 0600UTC on August8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August9. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop until August12. Shortly after crossing the International Date Line on August13, the storm was absorbed by a large non-tropical low over the Bering Sea.|$|E
5|$|On July1, the JTWC {{downgraded}} Tingting to {{a tropical}} storm. At 1200UTC the following day, the JMA downgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm as winds decreased below 120km/h (75mph 10-minute winds). Convection {{associated with the}} storm began to diminish as Tingting began to undergo an extratropical transition. Although the storm maintained its intensity as a severe tropical storm, it was moving into increasingly unfavorable conditions and weakening was anticipated. As Tingting tracked towards the northeast into the mid-latitude westerlies, it completed its extratropical transition on July4. After becoming an extratropical cyclone, Tingting accelerated towards the north before abruptly stalling near the Kamchatka Peninsula. On July6, the extratropical remnants of Tingting were absorbed by a developing {{area of low pressure}} located to the south of the former typhoon. However, the JMA continued to monitor Tingting as a separate system as it executed a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop though July10 before heading towards the international date line. The storm was last reported on July13 to the west Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|On September30, a weak surface low {{developed}} {{within the}} monsoon trough about 195km (120mi) south of Yap. Drifting northwestward, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression by October2. Later that day, aircraft reconnaissance revealed {{the system to}} have intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Nora. The system's movement soon became slow and erratic, with Nora executing a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop on October3. After completing the loop, it attained typhoon status and acquired a temporary northward trajectory. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Luming. Late on October4, Nora began to undergo a period of rapid intensification. Several aircraft reconnaissance missions were flown by the U.S. Air Force 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron into the storm between October5 and 6, documenting the typhoon's dramatic strengthening.|$|E
5|$|The Hajj is {{associated}} with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks <b>counter-clockwise</b> seven times around the Kaaba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs back and forth between the hills of Safa and Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{originated}} {{from a large}} extratropical cyclone that formed along a cold front on September27, roughly 470mi (755km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Initially attached to an occluded front, the low detached from the system and gradually acquired tropical characteristics. By October1, shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop {{near the center of}} the system as it tracked through the central Azores. However, the following day, convection began to decrease with the system, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) ceased monitoring it. Over the following two days, the system executed a <b>counter-clockwise</b> loop near the Azores. During the afternoon of October4, convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near São Miguel Island. Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours.|$|E
5|$|Until September 8, Typhoon Babe was {{forecast}} {{to continue}} northwestward into Taiwan and later China; however, another upper-level trough moved into northeastern China and further weakened the ridge. This in turn allowed {{a new area}} of low pressure to develop over the Korean Peninsula and cause Babe to curve northeastward. While moving northeastward, Babe gradually weakened and began to undergo a Fujiwhara-like interaction with the low near Korea as that system moved southwestward. Accelerating along a <b>counter-clockwise</b> arc, Babe moved through the Ryukyu Islands as a weakening typhoon on September 9 before taking a steady westward course into China. As the system passed through the archipelago, a pressure of 907.3 mbar (hPa; 26.80 inHg) was measured on Okinoerabujima. Babe eventually made landfall near Shanghai with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) before rapidly weakening over land. The system was last noted early on September 12 over Anhui Province.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or <b>counter-clockwise.</b> When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southeast}} of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and {{to the west of}} a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a <b>counter-clockwise</b> turn on October14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2mi (18.5 to 27.7km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75mph (120km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.|$|E
5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates <b>counter-clockwise</b> during the subsequent hands.|$|E
