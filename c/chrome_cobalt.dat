40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Major {{connectors}} {{are used}} with removable partial dentures to connect all other parts to the denture. The use of titanium to fabricate removable partial dentures has recently increased. Objective: This study aimed {{to assess the}} effect of the titanium alloy and <b>chrome</b> <b>cobalt</b> to fabricate connectors of removable partial dentures on tooth mobility, bone loss and tissue reaction. Materials and methods: A non-randomized clinical-controlled trial was conducted at the Dental Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry at Al-Azhar University-Assiut Branch, from January 2013 to January 2015. Eighty patients were classified into two groups, which were provided with removable partial dentures comprising titanium alloy and <b>chrome</b> <b>cobalt</b> connectors respectively. Patients’ demographic and clinical data (tooth mobility, bone loss and tissue reaction) were evaluated via the questionnaires, and clinical observations by qualified medical dentists with panoramic X-rays. Both groups were examined at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Results: Tooth mobility, in all directions, ranged between 0 mm at enrollment and 0. 10 mm in the titanium alloy group and ranged from 0 mm to 0. 20 mm in the <b>chrome</b> <b>cobalt</b> group. The difference in tooth mobility between the two groups {{at the end of the}} study was statistically significant (p= 0. 04). The bone loss ranged from 0 mm at enrollment and 0. 05 mm in the titanium alloy group and ranged from 0. 04 mm to 0. 15 mm in the <b>chrome</b> <b>cobalt</b> group. The difference in bone loss between the two groups was statistically significant (p= 0. 01). The tissue reaction in the titanium alloy group ranged from 0 to 0. 02, and it ranged from 0 to 0. 16 in the <b>chrome</b> <b>cobalt</b> group. The difference in tissue reaction was statistically significant (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: Clinical observations suggest that titanium alloy is more suited than <b>chrome</b> <b>cobalt</b> for fabricating the major connectors in removable partial dentures...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on animal and cellular models {{used to study}} the response to <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> alloy implants and wear and corrosion products is reviewed. Animal studies show that in solid form <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> alloy is relatively well tolerated. Injections {{of large numbers of}} particles in a single bolus lead to acute inflammation and necrosis, followed by a chronic inflammatory response. Macrophages are the predominant cell type and may persist in the tissues for years. Long term studies have failed to confirm the induction of tumors. In vitro studies confirm the toxic effects of <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> alloy corrosion products and wear particles, especially cobalt, and show that intracellular corrosion is an important mechanism for early release of cobalt ions. In vitro studies show that <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> alloy particles induce the release of inflammatory mediators from macrophages before causing cell death. These mediators have significant effects on osteoblastlike cells, as well as inducing bone resorption. Variations in the cell types, implantation site, and characteristics of the particles used in experimental models make interpretation of the results difficult. Standardized methods to control for size, shape, and number of particles for testing are proposed. It is important that in vitro and in vivo findings not be taken in isolation, but be compared with the results of human studies. Donald W. Howie, Susan D. Rogers, Margaret A. McGee and David R.

In this study, the potential to use injection moulded PEEK-OPTIMA™ {{as an alternative to}} <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> in the femoral component of a total knee replacement was investigated in terms of its wear performance. Experimental wear simulation of three <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> and three PEEK-OPTIMA™ femoral components articulating against all-polyethylene tibial components was carried out under two kinematic conditions: 3 [*]million cycles under intermediate kinematics (maximum anterior-posterior displacement of 5 [*]mm) followed by 3 [*]million cycles under high kinematic conditions (anterior-posterior displacement 10 [*]mm). The wear of the GUR 1020 ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene tibial components was assessed by gravimetric analysis; for both material combinations under each kinematic condition, the mean wear rates were low, that is, below 5 [*]mm³/million cycles. Specifically, under intermediate kinematic conditions, the wear rate of the ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene tibial components was 0. 96 [*]±[*] 2. 26 [*]mm³/million cycles and 2. 44 [*]±[*] 0. 78 [*]mm³/million cycle against <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> and PEEK-OPTIMA™ implants, respectively (p[*]=[*] 0. 06); under high kinematic conditions, the wear rates were 2. 23 [*]±[*] 1. 85 [*]mm³/million cycles and 4. 44 [*]±[*] 2. 35 mm³/million cycles, respectively (p[*]=[*] 0. 03). Following wear simulation, scratches were apparent {{on the surface of the}} PEEK-OPTIMA™ femoral components. The surface topography of the femoral components was assessed using contacting profilometry and showed a statistically significant increase in measured surface roughness of the PEEK-OPTIMA™ femoral components compared to the <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> implants. However, this did not appear to influence the wear rate, which remained linear over the duration of the study.

Despite trace elements metabolism has been reported {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disease that affects several aspects of homeostasis, little is known in the literature regarding concentration and possible variation of metallic elements in tear film. We studied the concentrations of several essential and non-essential metallic elements in the tear fluid and serum of patients with type II diabetes mellitus and a group of non-diabetic controls. Serum and tear fluid were collected from 97 patients: 47 type II diabetic patients and 50 non-diabetic controls. Regarding tear film, there were statistically significant differences in Zinc, <b>Chrome,</b> <b>Cobalt,</b> Manganese, Barium, and Lead between groups; the values of all metallic elements were found to be statistically significant higher in patients with mellitus type II diabetes. Regarding serum values there was a statistically significant difference in <b>Chrome,</b> <b>Cobalt,</b> and Selenium values; the concentrations of Chrome and Cobalt were higher in the control group, while Selenium concentration was higher in diabetic patients. In patients with type II diabetes, metal elements with higher concentrations in tears compared to serum were: Lead, Barium, Manganese, Cobalt, and Chrome. In the control group, the metal elements with the highest concentration in tear film compared to serum were Chrome, Manganese, Barium, and Lead. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the possible effect of a disease, such as diabetes, on the metabolism of metallic elements.

40|$|Abstract Surface-water {{includes}} {{different kinds}} of pollutants from traffic and roads. To prevent these pollutants to reach nearby lakes one can construct surface-water ponds on locations with heavy traffic. At Bergviks shopping centre in Karlstad, two ponds, one smaller and one bigger has been constructed in order to decrease the pollutant pressure from the receiving waters of Kattfjorden. Several heavy metals are essential for plants and animals in low concentration but when they occur in higher concentrations, they become toxic to the organism. The larger pond at Bergviks shopping centre has a sedimentation function so the heavy metals sink to the bottom thereby not releasing directly in to Kattfjorden. In this specific pond, plants such as reed, reed mace and broad-leafed pondweeds {{are the most common}} plants. Several studies show that plants have the ability to accumulate and store heavy metals. Reed, reed mace and broad-leafed pondweeds in the surface-water pond at Bergviks shopping centre all contains arsenic, lead, cadmium, <b>chrome,</b> <b>cobalt,</b> copper, nickel and zinc. The results in this study show a significant difference between these three plants in their heavy metals concentration. Broad-leafed pondweed had significantly higher concentrations of <b>chrome,</b> <b>cobalt,</b> copper, nickel, vanadium and zinc than reed and reed mace. Cadmium, copper and zinc also occurred in higher concentrations in broad-leafed pondweeds than in the sediment of the pond. Broad-leafed pondweed has the ability to accumulate heavy metals directly from the water while reed and reed mace only accumulate heavy metals with their roots. This could help explain the higher concentration in broad-leafed pondweed, in comparison to reed and reed mace. Due to the high metal concentration in the broad-leafed pondweed, it is appropriate to put this plant in surface-water ponds, in order to elute the water from heavy metals. Regular harvesting of the broad-leafed pondweed from the surface-water pond, together with regular cleaning of the sediment may reduce the occurrence of heavy metals in the recipient of Kattfjorden...|$|E

It is unclear if different biomaterials in the prosthetic components {{are more prone to}} facilitate this bacterial adherence, although ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) component exchange in modular systems has been clinically utilized in the early management of these infections. To clarify if the amount of clinically adhered microorganisms was related to the material or the component, we investigated retrieved implants from infected joint replacements. Thirty-two patients were revised after confirmed implant-related infection through positive cultures. Eighty-seven total joint components (hip and knee) were obtained and separately sonicated following a previously published protocol. Cultures were quantified, and detected colony forming units (CFU) were adjusted according to the component surface and compared based on the component material and location. Variable adherence of bacteria to <b>chrome</b> <b>cobalt</b> alloys, UHMWPE, hydroxyapatite coated components, and titanium alloys. The commonest isolated organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (23 of 87 components) and Staphylococcus aureus (10 of 87). Twelve components did not show any microorganism adhered despite location in an infected joint, with positive cultures in other components. A mixed linear model adjusted for random effects (the random effect being the infected patient) obtained convergence for the CFU/mm 2 variable, but could not confirm a significantly higher adherence to a particular component or to a particular biomaterial. Therefore, the bacterial adherence primarily depends on the infective microorganism and the response of each individual patient, rather than materials or components. © Copyright © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|Calcium sulfate bone void fillers are {{increasingly}} being used for dead space management in infected arthroplasty revision surgery. The presence of these materials as loose beads close to the bearing surfaces of joint replacements gives the potential for them to enter the joint becoming trapped between the articulating surfaces; the resulting damage to <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> counterfaces and the subsequent wear of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene is unknown. In this study, third-body damage to <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> counterfaces was simulated using particles of the calcium sulfate bone void fillers Stimulan® (Biocomposites Ltd., Keele, UK) and Osteoset® (Wright Medical Technology, TN, USA) using a bespoke rig. Scratches on the <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> plates were quantified {{in terms of their}} density and mean lip height, and the damage caused by the bone void fillers was compared to that caused by particles of SmartSet GMV PMMA bone cement (DePuy Synthes, IN, USA). The surface damage from Stimulan® was below the resolution of the analysis technique used; SmartSet GMV caused 0. 19 [*]scratches/mm with a mean lip height of 0. 03 [*]µm; Osteoset® led to a significantly higher number (1. 62 [*]scratches/mm) of scratches with a higher mean lip height (0. 04 [*]µm). Wear tests of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene were carried out in a six-station multi-axial pin on plate reciprocating rig against the damaged plates and compared to negative (highly polished) and positive control plates damaged with a diamond stylus (2 [*]µm lip height). The wear of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene was shown to be similar against the negative control plates and those damaged with third-body particles; there was a significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) rate of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene wear against the positive control plates. This study showed that bone void fillers of similar composition can cause varying damage to <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> counterfaces. However, the lip heights of the scratches were not of sufficient magnitude to increase the wear of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene above that of the negative controls...|$|R

Additive layer manufacturing processes provide a capability to produce orthopaedic implants with tailored mechanical properties. In this work <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> molybdenum cellular structures have been designed and manufactured using selective laser melting, with volume based porosity ranging between 25 % and 95 %. The effective mechanical properties have been determined through uniaxial compression testing and compared to numerical and analytical predictions where differences were observed. Cellular structures have been presented that exhibit similar stiffness and strength characteristics when compared to cortical and cancellous bone in the human femur. An expression has been proposed to predict the effective elastic modulus of <b>cobalt</b> <b>chrome</b> molybdenum cellular structures with volumetric porosity of 65 % and above. A finite element modelling technique {{has been used to}} demonstrate that structural variation and heterogeneities that are associated with the manufacture of cellular structures can significantly decrease the effective stiffness...|$|R
