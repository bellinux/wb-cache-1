The taxonomy is created by the introduction of two central dimensions in relation to innovating through suppliers. The first dimension concerns the number of companies involved, i. e., the innovation can involve a single supplier or a networking supplier. The second dimension concerns the level of cooperation between the customer and the supplier, i. e., either low or high. Thus, innovating through suppliers can involve the single supplier as a <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner,</b> the single supplier as a problem-solver, the networking supplier as a <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner,</b> and the networking supplier as a problem-solver.

40|$|From the Introduction]. While {{the aim of}} {{deepening}} {{integration in}} Southern Africa seems quite evident, the question remains what challenges SADC will face on its way. After introducing the organization SADC, this paper addresses the current challenges of regional integration in Southern Africa. However, in a globalizing world, regionalization is never just an internal affair of one world region. The interrelations with other regions and countries are and have always been an influential factor. Therefore this paper also analyses the role of SADC’s biggest International <b>Cooperating</b> <b>Partner</b> (ICP), the European Union, in the integration process.

We obtain and evaluate the achievable rate region based on our encoding strategy, and compare it with the achievable rates for the two user cooperative MAC. We demonstrate that the added diversity by the presence of the third user improves the region of achievable rates, and this improvement is especially significant as far as the sum rate of the system is concerned.

40|$|We {{propose a}} Cooperative Rate Adaptation (CRA) MAC {{protocol}} {{based on the}} standard CSMA/CA protocolused in IEEE 802. 11 wireless networks. The proposal provides cooperative error recovery, namely cooperativepacket retransmission, while using rate adaptation. The transmission rate is selected based onthe transmission rate history of the neighbours. The <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner</b> is selected based on a fuzzy logicselection algorithm. Three inputs are considered in the fuzzy system: the average transmission rate of aneighbour, the erroneous packet ratio and the acknowledged packet ratio of a neighbour. The output of thefuzzy system is the partnership probability of a neighbour. In this paper, the protocol is compared to thenon-cooperative rate adaptation scheme RBAR (Receiver Based Auto Rate) and to the cooperative rateadaptation scheme CRBAR (Cooperative Relay Based Auto Rate).

40|$|How {{to verify}} {{adaptable}} business conversations during the requirements engineering process {{is still an}} open issue, especially when conversation requirements are translated into a network of cooperating e-services. Model checking is a suitable technique to address this problem. However, since requirements engineers typically adopt less theoretical models, model checking is given little attention. In this paper, we propose a statecharts-like model that supports the specification of business conversation requirements. These requirements are expressed as quality of service (QoS) and structural properties related to the flow of actions implemented by each <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner.</b> This flow is partly standard and partly exceptional. The exceptional flow specifies how conversations should adapt their behavior {{as a consequence of}} violations of QoS constraints. Moreover, the paper shows that this specification can be formally defined through a predicative time-bounded automaton which, in turn, can be translated into Promela, the input language of the SPIN model checker. A case study is discussed to show the application of the model...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge in}} Swedish forestry {{is to avoid}} harming ancient and historical remains. In addition to already known objects, there might be numerous remains yet to be discovered. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the possibility for developing a GIS tool that could be used to predict the probability of finding unregistered remains based on the site characteristics registered in the compartment description. Sveaskog has been the <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner.</b> They wanted to focus on historical remains of Sami culture in Norrbotten and provided data from their estates within this area. The study has identified which site characteristics are common in the stands where registered remains are located. These characteristics are: vegetation type, soil type, soil moisture class, slope gradient, surface structure and altitude. Based on site characteristics, different criteria have been developed and used to create a filter which has been applied to all stands within the municipality of Arvidsjaur. The hypothesis was that the filter could be used to find stands with a certain type of remains. When using the filter to identify stands containing Sami-settlements, it becomes evident that the probability of identifying those stands increased. The conclusion is that the filter based on site characteristics can function as an important complement to find unregistered remains...|$|E

40|$|The {{chromosomal}} translocation t(11 : 14) {{is associated with}} human lymphoid neoplasia affecting centrocytic B-cells of intermediate differentiation. As a consequence the cyclin D 1 (bcl- 1) gene is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer E mu. To show that transcriptional activation of cyclin D 1 is causally involved in the generation of B-cell neoplasia we have generated transgenic mice that carry a cyclin D 1 gene under the transcriptional control of the E mu element. E mu cyclin D 1 transgenic mice show only very subtle alterations in the cycling behaviour of B-cell populations in the bone marrow compared with normal mice and do not develop lymphoid tumours. However, E mu-directed coexpression of cyclin D 1 and N-MYC or L-MYC in double transgenic mice reveals a strong cooperative effect between MYC and cyclin D 1 provoking the rapid development of clonal pre-B and B-cell lymphomas. Interestingly, crossing of cyclin D 1 transgenic mice with E mu L-myc transgenics that express their transgene in both B- and T-cells but predominantly develop T-cell tumours leads in double transgenics exclusively to B-cell neoplasia. The data presented here demonstrate that transcriptional activation of cyclin D 1 can oncogenically transform B-cells in concert with a myc gene. They establish cyclin D 1 as a proto-oncogene whose activity appears to depend on a specific cell type {{as well as on}} a specific <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner</b> and link disturbances in the regulation of cell cycle progression to the development of human malignancies...|$|E
40|$|PhDOptimizing radio {{resource}} within a network and across cooperating heterogeneous networks {{is the focus}} of this thesis. Cooperation in a multi-network environment is tackled by investigating network selection mechanisms. These {{play an important role in}} ensuring quality of service for users in a multi-network environment. Churning of mobile users from one service provider to another is already common when people change contracts and in a heterogeneous communication environment, where mobile users have freedom to choose the best wireless service-real time selection is expected to become common feature. This real time selection impacts both the technical and the economic aspects of wireless network operations. Next generation wireless networks will enable a dynamic environment whereby the nodes of the same or even different network operator can interact and cooperate to improve their performance. Cooperation has emerged as a novel communication paradigm that can yield tremendous performance gains from the physical layer all the way up to the application layer. Game theory and in particular coalitional game theory is a highly suited mathematical tool for modelling cooperation between wireless networks and is investigated in this thesis. In this thesis, the churning behaviour of wireless service users is modelled by using evolutionary game theory in the context of WLAN access points and WiMAX networks. This approach illustrates how to improve the user perceived QoS in heterogeneous networks using a two-layered optimization. The top layer views the problem of prediction of the network that would be chosen by a user where the criteria are offered bit rate, price, mobility support and reputation. At the second level, conditional on the strategies chosen by the users, the network provider hypothetically, reconfigures the network, subject to the network constraints of bandwidth and acceptable SNR and optimizes the network coverage to support users who would otherwise not be serviced adequately. This forms an iterative cycle until a solution that optimizes the user satisfaction subject to the adjustments that the network provider can make to mitigate the binding constraints, is found and applied to the real network. The evolutionary equilibrium, which is used to 3 compute the average number of users choosing each wireless service, is taken as the solution. This thesis also proposes a fair and practical cooperation framework in which the base stations belonging to the same network provider cooperate, to serve each otherâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 s customers. How this cooperation can potentially increase their aggregate payoffs through efficient utilization of resources is shown for the case of dynamic frequency allocation. This cooperation framework needs to intelligently determine the <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner</b> and provide a rational basis for sharing aggregate payoff between the cooperative partners for the stability of the coalition. The optimum cooperation strategy, which involves the allocations of the channels to mobile customers, can be obtained as solutions of linear programming optimizations...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis aims {{to provide}} insight and {{qualitative}} information about swelling mechanisms in volcanic rocks, {{in particular the}} swelling of rocks related to hydropower water tunnels. Additionally, traditional laboratory methods for determining the main rock material properties controlling swelling behavior are investigated. The rock samples tested are obtained from the Alimit area in Philippines, where The Alimit HEPP is in its feasibility phase. The hope is to provide an enhanced understanding of the swelling potential of the volcanic rocks, and introduce a suggestion on a proper investigation procedure to detect potential challenges at an early stage. The first step in this investigation, was to get {{an overview of the}} status quo in swelling rock sciences. The further work was based on the leading hypothesis on swelling clay minerals (i. e. smectites or similar groups of swelling clay minerals) to be the main cause of tunnel collapses in previous projects. Other explanations, as the swelling of chlorites and zeolites, and moisture swelling, were also kept in mind during the investigations. The next step was to survey the project case site, located in the Ifugao province of the Philippines, to get an overview of the geological and topographical features of the area. Sampling of the assumed most dominating rock types, with focus on regions in which major constructions are planned, was performed. The samples were obtained from the borehole core storage of SN Aboitiz (<b>cooperating</b> <b>partner</b> of SN Power/Statkraft) in Lagawe, Philippines. The main part of the investigation procedure was to obtain information on rock material key properties of the collected samples, by different laboratory test methods. The samples underwent mineralogical analyses, UCS-tests, and different types of swelling tests. Oedometer swelling tests were performed at two different institutes (NTNU and KiT), for comparison of methodology and output. The study has uncovered an unexpected swelling potential of strong, andesitic rock types, despite the lack of swelling clay minerals in the samples tested. The swelling pressure magnitudes are confirmed by repeated tests, and apply on the results obtained at both institutes. The swelling potential is assumed closely linked to the high content of laumontite (zeolite). Content of swelling clay minerals, in particular montmorillonite, ii is detected in other rock types tested. The rock material of these samples are weak and disintegrated, and thus not up to standards for UCS testing. However, the swelling pressure magnitudes are lower in the weak material, compared to the strong andesitic rock. The comparison of the oedometer methodology in operation at NTNU and KiT, uncovered important differences between the two institutes. The deviations apply on both the apparatus used, and the procedures of swelling tests. The differences include the version of the ISRM suggested methods, intern modifications on apparatus and procedures, and intern traditions in how specific points in the ISRM standard is translated in practice. Based on the work performed throughout the investigation, a suggestion on an improved investigation procedure is presented {{at the end of this}} thesis...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the role of family in the course of coordinated {{rehabilitation}}. At present time, rehabilitation is understood not only as a medical care within the sphere of physiotherapy but also as an interdisciplinary activity which includes health-care, social-legal, pedagogical-psychological as well as work-related activities. Coordinated rehabilitation therefore requires cooperation of a team of involved specialists. This is not only about qualified experts but also about the disables person and his/her family. Family is the most important social group and the basic building stone of society. It fulfils the basic educational function, forms the attitudes of the child to itself, its loved ones and the whole world. Thus it fundamentally affects the society and on the contrary the society influences the family. That is why the family has to receive information necessary for the fulfilment of its functions (in particular when taking care of a disabled person), for example in the form of expert counselling. The objective of the work was to identify the role of family and its cooperation with counselling agencies within the process of coordinated rehabilitation. In addition to agencies taking care of handicapped persons, counselling institutions include also organisations whose social services are primarily provided to this target group. Qualitative research was used in the course of work on the empirical part. Input data were collected by the method of questioning, in particular by the technique of semi-structured interview. The research group consisted of thirteen social workers who provide expert social counselling or other social services primarily intended for handicapped persons. In connection with the objective of the thesis, the main research question was: What difficulties social workers identify when working with the family within the process of coordinated rehabilitation? The sub-question derived from the main research question was: What is the role of family within the counselling process {{from the perspective of a}} social worker? The results showed that social workers are satisfied with the families of users of the social service and confirm that cooperation between them is good. However, cooperation between social workers and the family differs significantly according to the type of provided services. The research also revealed that providers of social services in the course of their work with family encounter difficulties rather exceptionally. Still, social workers perceive as difficulties especially limits in the communication with family. Providers of social services try to build relations between them and the family of the user of the particular service and provide social support. Social workers perceive the role of family especially as being their communicating and <b>cooperating</b> <b>partner.</b> The research showed that the best cooperation and communication between social workers and the family of user of the social services is one based on a partnership level. The thesis identified the difficulties of social workers encountered during their work with families taking care of a handicapped person and suggested recommendations for more active involvement of families in dealing with a difficult life situation of its members. In addition, the thesis can serve as a basis for further quantitative research of this theme...|$|E
