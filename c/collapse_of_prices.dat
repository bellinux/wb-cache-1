5000|$|The cotton {{industry}} in the United States hit {{a crisis in the}} early 1920s. Cotton and tobacco prices collapsed in 1920 following overproduction and the boll weevil pest wiped out the sea island cotton crop in 1921. Annual production slumped from 1,365,000 bales in the 1910s to 801,000 in the 1920s. In South Carolina, Williamsburg County production fell from 37,000 bales in 1920 to 2,700 bales in 1922 and one farmer in McCormick County produced 65 bales in 1921 and just 6 in 1922. As a result of the devastating harvest of 1922, some 50,000 black cotton workers left South Carolina, and by the 1930s the state population had declined some 15%, largely due to cotton stagnation. However, it wasn't the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> or pests which resulted in the mass decline of African American employment in agriculture in the American south. The mechanization of agriculture is undoubtedly the most important reason why many blacks moved to northern American cities in the 1940s and 1950s during the [...] "Great Migration" [...] as mechanization of agriculture was introduced, leaving many unemployed. The Hopson Planting Company produced the first crop of cotton to be entirely planted, harvested and baled by machinery in 1944.|$|E

A wide-ranging ‘liquidity crisis’ is typically traced to the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in markets for assets backed by or derived from the repayments of American subprime mortgagors, while public authorities {{are said to have}} responded by ‘restoring liquidity’ to markets in these now ‘distressed’ and ‘toxic assets’. Here the category of performativity is developed to enable a critical investigation of liquidity. The performance of liquidity in booming subprime markets is shown to have turned on the affirmation and exemplification of wider norms present in wholesale asset markets, and upon specific calculative and emotional valuations of risk through underwriting procedures, bond rating and hedging. However, the performance of liquidity contained its other, illiquidity, and this surfaced in subprime markets because asset prices symbolised risk valuations which could not capture incalculable future uncertainties. As the crisis broke, talk of liquidity and illiquidity licensed particular policy responses and closed down wider political debate...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} the rapid growth in US tight oil production for US and global energy markets. The behaviour of US crude markets is analysed, with a particular focus on changing arbitrage dynamics. The rapid growth in US tight oils production was not met with an equally fast response by the US midstream companies, resulting in severe regional crude price dislocations. These lower regional prices impacted on producer profits and, more significantly, benefitted refineries that secured cheap feedstock and sold end products at levels linked to global product markets. However, we argue that globally, US tight oil production has primarily impacted price spreads though changes in trade flows, rather than absolute oil price levels, given various offsetting factors such as extremely weak supplies from outside the US. ‎ Put another way, we argue that perhaps the correct way of seeing the US supply shock is not as something that should result in the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices,</b> but instead as a factor that has prevented prices from being significantly higher...|$|E
40|$|Although {{bankruptcy}} and default {{are well known}} as critical factors leading to various ﬁnancial recessions or ﬁnancial bubbles, such as the Great Depression in the USA that began in 1929 and the Lost Decade of Japan in the 1990 s, predicting when they will occur has not been studied sufﬁciently. In this paper, we propose a method that ﬁlters out risky investors and keeps good investors in a margin-trading simulation. Investors are divided into three classes (bankrupt, surviving and proﬁtable) instead of the standard two (bankrupt/bad and surviving/good). As a result, bubble bursting can be thwarted, since maintaining credit absorption for the qualiﬁed investors can prevent the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices.</b> We expose the problems with using the minimum margin as the de facto tool for controlling trading on the margin. We compare the results of four well-known data classiﬁcation methods (multiple discriminant analysis, neural networks, decision trees and support vector machines) {{in order to determine}} the one that is most suitable for building a credit-scoring schema. Of the methods considered, the C 4. 5 algorithm for building decision trees was found to be the best. Our proposed strategy can successfully use credit scoring to tame the bubble phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Current {{climate and}} energy policy has to operate under an ex-ante {{unforeseen}} economic crisis. An obvious consequence is the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> for carbon emission allowances as, for example, {{seen in the}} European Union. However, this price collapse may be amplified by the interaction of a carbon emission cap and supplementary policy targets such as the minimum shares for renewables in the power sector. The static interaction between climate and renewable policies has been discussed extensively. This paper extends this debate by analysing how uncertain differences in medium to long-run growth rates affect the effciency and effectiveness of a policy portfolio containing an emission trading scheme and a target for a minimum renewable share. Making use of a simple partial equilibrium model we identify an asymmetric interaction of emissions trading and renewable quotas with respect to different growth rates of an economy. The results imply that unintended consequences of the policy interaction may be particularly severe and costly when economic growth is low and that carbon prices are more sensitive to changes in economic growth if they are applied in combination with renewable energy targets. Our main example for the policy interaction is the EU, yet our research also relates particularly well to the uncertainty of economic growth in fast growing emerging economies like China...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{fared well}} in the first "EU year" despite a {{difficult}} starting position. The drop in prices and in revenues was offset by much higher direct payments to farmers. Thus, the level of income in agriculture could be stabilized {{in the first year}} of membership in the EU. The <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in the wake of EU membership and the resulting drop in the value of final output affected all regions of Austria, though with varying intensity. The value of final output declined at an above-average rate in Lower Austria (– 23 percent) and in Vienna (– 45 percent); the agricultural branches most affected by integration, such as production of grains and vegetables, are heavily represented in these areas. In Styria (– 14 ½ percent), Carinthia (– 14 percent), and in Vorarlberg (– 16 percent) losses in the value of final output were lower than in Austria on average. In Styria, regional particularities in plant production (the high weight of specialty farming and of corn production) cushioned the losses; in Vorarlberg, this effect was due to lower losses of the dairy industry. Carinthia benefited from the high share of forestry, which is far above average. The results for Burgenland, Upper Austria, Salzburg, and Tirol were close to the average, ranging from – 20 percent to – 22 percent. High direct payments to farmers compensated to a large extent for the regional disparities in the development of revenues. In Burgenland, Carinthia, and in Vorarlberg total revenues (value of final output plus direct payments) exceeded the level of 1994 by ½ to 2 ½ percent. With the exception of Vienna (– 37 percent), only slight losses of up to 3 percent (Upper Austria) were recorded for the other provinces. Landwirtschaft bewältigt erstes "EU-Jahr" gut.

40|$|The {{sustained}} U. S. {{stock market}} {{boom of the}} 1990 s fuelled private consumption in the USA to an extent that it grew at a substantially faster rate than the country's GDP (in 1999, the savings-ratio of private households actually turned negative). At the same time, {{the gap between the}} share price-based value of companies and their value based on balance sheet data widened: between 1989 and 1999 the share value of corporate business in the USA rose by 326 percent, while its real capital stock grew by just 50 percent. The (excessively) high valuation of U. S. shares makes it unlikely that their prices will continue to rise as in the past years. The projection therefore assumes that prices will be subject to "adjustments" over the next two years, which will put a damper on consumption and thus on growth. The slowdown will, however, be muted, for three reasons: some relaxation of the monetary reins will boost real investment demand; declining dollar interest rates, combined with the high current account deficit in the USA, will cause some depreciation of the dollar; and, lastly, fiscal policy will respond to the muted growth by sending expansive signals. After slowing down in 2001, growth in the USA will recover its pace and remain at 2. 5 percent throughout the forecast period. In the EU, the upswing will continue, and growth should reach 2. 8 percent and 3. 0 percent in 2000 and 2001, respectively. It is assumed that the momentum achieved by exports will also heat up internal demand (assuming further that the ECB will refrain from any marked rise in euro interest rates). After some cyclical downturn in 2002 - 2003, the EU growth rate should be back at 2. 5 percent by 2004. Throughout the forecast period, EU countries will see their economies expand by 2. 6 percent p. a. on average, i. e., significantly faster than in the 1990 s. The Japanese economy is expected to take time over its recovery and it should grow by just 2. 1 percent p. a. up to 2004. Altogether, the industrialised countries will raise their GDPs by 2. 4 percent p. a. over the next five years. Oil prices will decline from 25 $ to 21 $ per barrel in 2000. Subsequently, oil exporters should be able to avoid a substantial oil glut and attendant <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> as happened in 1997 - 98. Oil prices will average 22 $ throughout the forecast period, which is higher by 26 percent than the average of the past 15 years. The lower dollar exchange rate and global economic upturn will make for a rise in dollar prices for manufactured goods and raw materials other than oil. Altogether, world trade prices should increase by 2. 9 percent p. a. up to 2004. Assuming an average Eurodollar interest rate of 4. 6 percent, international dollar debts will bear just 1. 7 percent in real interest in 2000 - 2004 (in 1997 - 98, declining world trade prices boosted the real interest rate to over 11 percent, which {{played a major role in}} the eruption of international financial crises). With raw material prices recovering and the costs of financing their foreign debt declining, developing countries and former communist countries will be able to raise their imports substantially. Higher oil prices will enable oil exporters to expand their demand for particularly strongly imports (+ 10. 4 percent p. a.). Other developing countries should be able to increase their imports by 8. 5 percent, and Eastern European countries by 8. 3 percent. Imports into industrialised countries, on the other hand, will grow by just 5. 7 percent, due mainly to a marked deterioration of their terms of trade. Given these conditions, the global trade volume will expand by 6. 6 percent p. a. in 2000 - 2004. GDP will grow by 3. 5 percent p. a. in the oil-exporting countries, by 6. 0 percent in other developing countries and by 3. 9 percent in the former communist countries of Eastern Europe. The global economy in general would thus expand by 4. 0 percent annually in 2000 - 2004, i. e., at a noticeably faster pace than in the 1990 s. Mittelfristprognose Weltwirtschaft...|$|E
