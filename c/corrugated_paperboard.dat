50|$|The {{origin of}} GCLs {{can be traced}} back to 1962 when Arthur G.

Clem established Clem Environmental Corp to put his invention into production. The use of GCLs as a separate category of geosynthetics appears to have been in the United States in 1988 in solid waste containment as a backup to a geomembrane. The product was Claymax which is bentonite mixed with an adhesive so as to bond the clay between two geotextiles; one below (the carrier textile) and the other above (the cover textile) the bentonite in the center. About the same time a different product in Germany, Bentofix, was manufactured by placing bentonite powder between two geotextiles and then needle punching the three-components system together. The needle punching method of manufacture (US patent filed in 1989) gave the resulting composite material shear strength, a critical feature for installation on slopes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Beneficial Reuse of <b>Corrugated</b> <b>Paperboard</b> in Civil Engineering Applications Gregory Michael Stone An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} explore the potential for reuse of <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard.</b> <b>Corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> represents a large fraction of the municipal solid waste generated and discarded in the United States. Alternative applications for reuse can provide a significant benefit by reducing the volume of waste being disposed and by reducing the use of raw materials. Four civil engineering applications were examined for potential beneficial reuse of corrugated paperboard: slurry trench construction, vertical drilling, directional drilling, and controlled low strength materials (CLSM). For {{the purpose of this}} project, <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> was pulped and added to bentonite slurry or CLSM mixtures. Bentonite slurry mixtures were tested for viscosity, density, filtrate loss, and permeability. The behavior of the bentonite slurries was greatly influenced by interaction and interlocking of corrugate fibers; in general resulting in increased viscosity, filtrate loss, and permeability and decreased density. CLSM mixtures were tested for flow consistency, unit weight, air content, and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures prepared with <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> showed an increased water demand due to high absorption of the corrugate. The higher water content was a significant factor contributing to decreased unit weight and compressive strength. CLSM mixtures containing <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> also exhibited increased air contents, possibly due to entrapment of air within the corrugate pulp. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> was used to successfully replace up to 27 % of bentonite for slurry trench applications, 60 % of bentonite for vertical drilling applications, and 59 % of bentonite for directional drilling applications while maintaining acceptable engineering properties. For CLSM mixtures up to 1 % of fine aggregate was replaced with <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> while maintaining satisfactory engineering properties. Incorporation of corrugated paper board into bentonite slurry, CLSM, and drilling fluid applications provides a viable option for beneficial reuse...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The flat {{compression}} {{properties of}} corrugated sandwich structure {{are an important}} factor to evaluate their cushioning properties. At present, more research has been made on the mechanical properties in the cross direction (CD) and machine direction (MD), but less {{has been made in}} the flat compression direction. Selecting <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboards</b> as samples, we analyzed the flat compression properties of the corrugated sandwich structure and explored the critical stress which is a key element for evaluating the cushioning properties based on theory and experiment. It is convenient to evaluate the cushioning properties and optimize the corrugated sandwich structure. Simplifying the corrugated structure into the struts, and referring to the bending theory of the standard beam theory, we explored the evaluating equation of the critical stress for corrugated sandwich structure by the bending moment and Euler formulas. The critical stress is in direct proportion to the elastic modulus and the thickness of the basis material. It is also closely related to the length of the corrugated cell-wall and the pasted width between the corrugated cell-wall and the linerboard. Changing the above parameters, we can change the compression resistance of the corrugated sandwich structure. The theoretical value of the critical stress of the corrugated sandwich structure is higher than the experimental value, since the mechanical properties are lost when the basis material is manufactured into corrugated sandwiches and corrugated boards. Therefore, the lost coefficient is introduced into the theoretic equation which can not only help optimize and design the corrugated sandwich structure, but also find application in optimized design of cushioning pads of corrugated sandwich structure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} to using multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> to provide improved protection against severe mechanical shocks and drops. Conventionally, cushion design requires {{the determination of the}} maximum expected shock levels or drop heights as well as their probability of occurrence. These are usually determined from statistical analysis of original field measurements or published drop height distribution data. With this approach, it is acknowledged that the cushioning element will provide adequate protection for statistically likely events but not for extreme, statistically unusual, events. A multi-layer cushioning system made entirely of <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard,</b> designed to extend the cushioning protection range to include these extreme events, has been investigated. The main feature of the cushion is the inclusion of a <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> crumple element designed to provide the necessary energy absorption for high compression stress levels. The effect of the complex deceleration produced by the crumple element on the product is analysed by means of the shock response spectrum. Experiments have shown that the paperboard crumple insert dramatically extends the protection range of the cushioning system by generally lowering the shock response spectrum, thus extending the cushion curve static load range. This results in {{a significant increase in the}} allowable drop height for a limited number of extreme events. Although this approach may be extended to a combination of conventional cushioning materials, the benefits of providing product protection with recyclable paperboard material are significant...|$|E
40|$|The {{buckling}} and post-buckling behaviours of <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> packaging {{structures are}} the focus of this study. The motivations for this study are to improve understanding of post-buckling behaviour to better predict packaging performance and investigate reasons for the discrepancy between experimental and predicted results reported in literature. The research questions posed consider how post-buckling behaviour of <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> panels are affected by varying in-plane boundary conditions and using multi-term out-of-plane displacement functions in analytical Galerkin’s method models with symmetric and / or anti-symmetric geometric imperfections. The panels of varying in-plane boundary conditions and geometric imperfections were also modelled by the Finite Element (FE) method. The material properties of <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> obtained by different methods were compared, involving materials testing methods (edge compression, four-point bending and sonic vibration frequency tests) and equivalent single-layered and detailed geometric material models. Comparisons between experimental and predicted panel buckling results consider what boundary conditions best resemble experimental conditions and which displacement modes are dominant. Difference of in-plane boundary conditions were not the likely source of discrepancy between post-buckling behaviour in models and experiments. Instead, shortcomings in the equivalent single-layered material models used were thought to be the most significant source of discrepancy in the post-buckling results. The number of modes in the displacement function of the analytical Galerkin’s models influences the post-buckling results. A nine-term symmetric mode model with fundamental geometric imperfection had an increased panel central deflection of 16 % at a load ratio of 1. 8 times the critical load, compared to the single-term solution. Interactions between symmetric and anti-symmetric displacement modes were observed only for panels with both symmetric and anti-symmetric geometric imperfections, thought to be due to changes in the in-plane stress distribution. Equivalent single-layered material models for <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> did not give sufficient agreement in effective in-plane elastic moduli compared with materials tests indicating this modelling approach is inadequate for predicting the post-buckling behaviour. Detailed geometric or alternative homogenisation material models for <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> accounting for changes in humidity, viscoelastic and plastic behaviour, and transverse shear deformation should be considered for future studies. The equivalent single-layered analytical Galerkin’s models, and equivalent and detailed geometric FE models show that the in-plane boundary conditions case for which loaded edges are subjected to uniform displacement and unloaded edges are free of constraints, had the least disagreement with the panel buckling experiments in this study. Possible sources of the discrepancy were investigated, involving panel imperfection and material properties. The fundamental displacement mode was most dominant in the experimental results, but only four non-zero modes were given by fitting panel deflections into a Fourier series using the collocation method, due to limited deflection measurement points. The least squares method for estimating the experimental critical load had slightly better agreement than Southwell’s method in comparisons with analytical and FE model predictions, but caused difficulties with convergence in some cases. The in-plane and flexural material properties from the frequency testing of <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> were scaled to consider their impact on the analytical post-buckling model results. Calibration of the material properties from frequency tests to suit prediction of post-buckling behaviour may be possible if it can be justified in further experiments...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} some of {{the latest}} results of a research project aimed at using composite <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> structures for protection of products against mechanical shocks and vibration during transportation and handling. Specifically, the behaviour of multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>paperboard</b> (MCPB) under shock loading is investigated. Conventionally, packaging cushion design requires the determination of the maximum expected shock levels or equivalent drop which are usually determined from statistical analysis of original field measurements. With this approach, it is generally acknowledged that the cushioning element is engineered to provide adequate protection for statistically likely events but not for extreme events with low statistical likelihood. It is reluctantly accepted that, should it occur, the latter will result in damage to the product.

40|$|Paper is a {{fascinating}} material that we encounter every day in different variants: tissues, paper towels, packaging material, wall paper or even fillers of doors. Despite radical changes in production technology, the material, which {{has been known to}} mankind for almost two thousand years, still has a natural composition, being made up of fibres of plant origin (particularly wood fibres). Thanks to its unique properties, relatively high compression strength and bending stiffness, low production costs and ease of recycling, paper {{is becoming more and more}} popular in many types of industry. Mass-produced paper products such as special paper, <b>paperboard,</b> <b>corrugated</b> cardboard, honeycomb panels, tubes and L- and U-shapes are suitable for use as a building material in the broad sense of these words – i. e., in design and architecture. Objects for everyday use, furniture, interior design elements and partitions are just a few examples of things in which paper can be employed. Temporary events such as festivals, exhibitions or sporting events like the Olympics require structures that only need to last for a limited period of time. When they are demolished after a few days or months, their leftovers can have a significant impact on the local environment. In the context of growing awareness of environmental threats and the efforts undertaken by local and international organisations and governments to counter these threats, the use of natural materials that can be recycled after their lifespan is becoming increasingly widespread. Paper and its derivatives fascinate designers and architects, who are always looking for new challenges and trying to meet the market’s demands for innovative and proecological solutions. Being a low-cost and readily available material, paper is suited to the production of emergency shelters for victims of natural and man-made disasters, as well as homeless persons. In order to gain a better understanding of paper’s potential in terms of architecture, its material properties were researched on a micro, meso and macro level. This research of the possible applications of paper in architecture was informed by two main research questions: What is paper and to what extent can it be used in architecture? What is the most suitable way to use paper in emergency architecture? To answer the first research question, fundamental and material research on paper and paper products had to be conducted. The composition of the material, production methods and properties of paper were researched. Then paper products with the potential to be used in architecture were examined. The history of the development of paper and its influence on civilisation helped the author gain a better understanding of the nature of this material, which we encounter in our lives every day. Research on objects for everyday use, furniture, pavilions and architecture realised in the last 150 years allowed the author to distinguish various types of paper design and paper architecture. Analysis of realised buildings in which paper products were used as structural elements and parts of the building envelope resulted in a wide array of possible solutions. Structural systems, types of connections between the various elements, impregnation methods and the functionalities and lifespan of different types of buildings were systematised. The knowledge thus collected allowed the author to conduct a further exploration of paper architecture in the form of designs and prototypes. To answer the second research question, the analysed case studies were translated into designs and prototypes of emergency shelters. During the research-by-design, engineering and prototyping phases, more than a dozen prototypes were built. The prototypes differed in terms of structural systems, used materials, connections between structural elements, impregnation methods, functionality and types of building. The three versions of the Transportable Emergency Cardboard House project presented in the final chapter form the author’s final answer to the second research question. Paper will never replace traditional building materials such as timber, concrete, steel, glass or plastic. It can, however, complement them to a significant degree.
