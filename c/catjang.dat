500|$|Vigna unguiculata is {{a member}} of the Vigna (peas and beans) genus. Unguiculata is Latin for [...] "with a small claw", which {{reflects}} the small stalks on the flower petals. All cultivated cowpeas are found within the universally accepted V. unguiculata subspecies unguiculata classification, which is then commonly divided into four cultivar groups: Unguiculata, Biflora, Sesquipedalis, and Textilis. Some well-known common names for cultivated cowpeas include black-eye pea, southern pea, yardlong bean, <b>catjang,</b> and crowder pea. The classification of the wild relatives within V. unguiculata is more complicated, with over 20 different names having been used and between 3 and 10 subgroups described. The original subgroups of stenophylla, dekindtiana and tenuis appear to be common in all taxonomic treatments, while the variations pubescens and protractor were raised to sub-species level by a 1993 charactisation.|$|E

50|$|More than 90% of the {{population}} is employed in agriculture. The commune is located in a zone in which mainly rainfed agriculture is practiced. A number of crops are grown in Garhanga, such as the staples millet and sorghum, cowpeas, peanuts, corn, okra, sweet potatoes, <b>Catjang</b> and cassava. In the valleys, irrigation agriculture for vegetables and pimento is practiced. To the west of the commune there are three aquifers where fruit, especially bananas are cultivated, an important source of income. In addition, the fruits of desert dates and jujubes are eaten and gum arabic is obtained. The legumes harvested from acacia and Ana trees serve as fodder. Several factors provide unfavorable conditions for agricultural activities. These include, in particular, the high soil erosion and the uncertainty in the rainfall. Livestock are raised here, such as goats, sheep, cattle, donkeys, horses and camels.|$|E

50|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority {{of the population of the}} Bombay Presidency was rural and engaged in agriculture. The staple crops were Sorghum (jowar), and Pearl millet (bajra) in the Deccan and Khandesh. Rice was the chief product of the Konkan. Wheat, generally grown in the northern part of the Presidency, but specially in Sind and Gujarat, was exported to Europe in large quantities from Karachi, and on a smaller scale from Bombay. Barley was principally grown in the northern parts of the presidency. Finger millet (Nachani) and kodra furnished food to the Kolis, Bhils, Waralis, and other hill tribes. Of the pulses the most important are the chickpea or Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum), pigeon pea or tur (Cajanus cajan), <b>catjang</b> or kulti (Vigna unguiculata cylindrica), and urad bean (Vigna mungo). Principal oilseeds were sesame or til (Sesamum indicum), mustard, castor bean, safflower and linseed. Of fibres the most important were cotton, Deccan hemp (Hibiscus cannabinus), and sunn or tag (Crotalaria juncea). Much was done to improve the cotton of the presidency. American varieties were introduced with much advantage in the Dharwad collectorate and other parts of the southern Maratha country. In Khandesh the indigenous plant from which one of the lowest classes of cotton in the Bombay market takes its name has been almost entirely superseded by the superior Hinganghat variety. Miscellaneous crops: sugarcane, requiring a rich soil and a perennial water-supply, and only grown in favoured localities, chile peppers, potatoes, turmeric and tobacco.|$|E
40|$|Arginase was {{purified}} from Vigna <b>catjang</b> cotyledons {{and buffalo}} liver by chromatographic separations using Bio-Gel P- 150, DEAE-cellulose and arginine AH Sepharose 4 B affinity columns. The native molecular weight of an enzyme estimated on Bio-Gel P- 300 column for Vigna <b>catjang</b> was 210 kDa and 120 kDa of buffalo liver, while SDS-PAGE showed a single band of molecular weight 52 kDa for cotyledon and 43 kDa for buffalo liver arginase. The kinetic properties determined for the purified cotyledon and liver arginase showed an optimum pH of 10. 0 and pH 9. 2 respectively. Optimal cofactor Mn ++ ion concentration {{was found to}} be 0. 6 mM for cotyledon and 2 mM for liver arginase. The Michaelis-Menten constant for cotyledon arginase and hepatic arginase were found to be 42 mM and 2 mM respectively. The activity of guanidino compounds as alternate substrates for Vigna <b>catjang</b> cotyledon and buffalo liver arginase is critically dependent on the length of the amino acid side chain and the number of carbon atoms. In addition to L-arginine cotyledon arginase showed substrate specificity towards agmatine and L-canavanine, whereas the liver arginase showed substrate specificity towards only L-canavanine. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} the enzymatic changes during germination and possible improvements in nutritionalquality of some legume seeds. Mung bean (Phascolus aureus), cowpea (Vigna <b>catjang),</b> lentil (Lens culinaris) and chickpea(Cicer arietinum) {{were used as}} raw materials. Untreated, soaked and germinated samples for 24, 48 and 72 h were analysed for phytase, α-amylase and protease activities. Enzymes activities increased significantly (P< 0. 05) on pre germination soaking, except for phytase activity of chickpea, which {{the difference was not}} significant (P< 0. 05). Enzymaticactivities of all legumes tested, improved significantly (P< 0. 05) during the course of germination up to 72 h and reachedmaximum {{at the end of the}} period (0. 9 - 33. 5 folds depending on enzyme and the legume tested). Germination as a biotechnological technique improved enzymatic activities of legume seeds...|$|E
40|$|Eight whole legumes, namely Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum), {{broad beans}} (Vicia faba), Cowpea (Vigna <b>catjang),</b> field beans (Dolichos lablab), green gram (Phaseolus aureus Roxb), horse gram (Dolichos biflorus), lentils (Lens esculenta) and French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), were cooked under {{pressure}} or {{in a microwave}} oven and were analysed for nutrient composition. Raw legumes served as control. The range of nutrients analysed in 100 g cooked samples were as follows: moisture, 62. 8 - 69. 7 g; protein, 14. 7 - 24. 3 g; fat, 0. 9 - 5. 9 g; ash, 1. 7 - 4. 6 g; iron, 3. 3 - 8. 6 mg; calcium, 50 - 209 mg; phosphorus, 249 - 429 mg; and thiamin, 0. 14 - 0. 32 mg. Cooking methods {{did not affect the}} nutrient composition of legumes. However, thiamine decreased in cooked samples. Cooking altered the dietary fibre content of some legumes. The mean in vitro protein digestibility of pressure-cooked and microwaved samples was 79. 8 % and 74. 7 %, respectively. The in vitro starch and protein digestibility of pressure-cooked samples were higher...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} properties of flours derived from selected legumes were studied {{before and after}} dehulling of the germinated seeds. Ungerminated seeds were used as the control. The chosen legumes were green gram (Phaseolus aureus), cowpea (Vigna <b>catjang),</b> lentil (Lens culinaris) and bengal gram (Cicer arietinum). Dehulled samples had a higher protein solubility compared with germinated and control samples. The bulk densities of germinated and dehulled legume flours were lower compared to control. Germination increased water absorption capacities of legume flours from 1226, 1285, 974 and 1362 g kg(- 1) to 1481, 1433, 1448 and 15 17 g kg(- 1) in green gram, cowpea, lentil and bengal gram, respectively. Fat absorption capacities increased in germinated samples (1130, 1242, 920 and 837 g kg(- 1)) as against 900, 993, 857 and 788 g kg(- 1) at ambient conditions for green gram, cowpea, lentil and bengal gram, respectively. On dehulling, the fat absorption capacities of samples were reduced and the differences were statistically significant. The emulsification capacities of control samples ranged from 5 5 to 193 ml oil emulsified per gram of sample. On germination and dehulling, the emulsification capacities, activities and stabilities of samples increased significantly. There were increases in foaming capacities and reduction in foam stabilities of all the samples investigated on germination and dehulling. Thus, the study indicated that germination and dehulling improved the {{functional properties}} of legumes. (c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{vegetable}} production within high tunnels {{allows for}} an extended growing season, crop protection, and environmental control. The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) standards mandate evidence that the soil has been maintained and improved {{over the course of}} production. Previous studies have indicated the potential of cover crops for reducing competitive vegetation, and improving soil quality, thus resulting in greater plant growth, nutrient uptake, and yield. However, there has been limited work in the confines of high tunnels as part of a tunnel-system rotation. Ten nitrogen-fixing and ten non-legume cover crops were established under a high tunnel and evaluated for their effects on the yield of ‘De Cicco’ broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) and ‘Champion’ collards (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala), aboveground biomass, and plant C and N contents. All treatments received recommended levels of appropriate certified organic fertilizers, water status was maintained, and vegetables received standard organic maintenance for insects and disease. The cover crops hairy indigo (Indigofera hirsuta L.), <b>Catjang</b> cowpea (Viana unguicalata L.), and Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) consistently produced higher yields than Tifleaf III hybrid pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), Dairymaster brown midrib (BMR) hybrid grain sorghum (Sorghum spp.), and Wild Game Food sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). Nitrogenfixing legumes produced horticulturally significantly higher yields than the non-nitrogen-fixing grass species. This experiment demonstrated that not all cover crops are equal; they created variation in response. Cover crops provide a viable option for organic producers to maintain or improve soil quality over the course of production...|$|E
