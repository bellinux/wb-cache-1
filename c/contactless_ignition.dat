5000|$|Originally the Babetta was {{conceived}} as lightweight moped {{to compete with}} the Solex moped which was popular during the 1960s. The first Babetta mopeds to {{see the light of day}} in 1970 featured very large 23-inch wheels, but these were soon swapped out in favour of smaller 16-inch wheels. The Babetta was notable for its electronic ignition [...] - [...] the first time a transistorized <b>contactless</b> <b>ignition</b> had been used in a moped.|$|E
5000|$|VAZ-21213 (the {{original}} name of [...] "Taiga" [...] did not stick) - restyling model [...] "Niva" [...] in 1993 {{with the}} revised rear {{end with a}} low loading height (another form of the rear doors and rear lights), more powerful and high-torque engine VAZ-21213 (1.7 L, 81.8 hp, 125 Nm) with the carburetor [...] "Solex" [...] and <b>contactless</b> <b>ignition</b> system on the microcontroller (and that both reduces fuel consumption and improves the flow of oil), Silumin radiator, and many others. In 1993, the transition game was released with a standard engine VAZ-2121.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{mechanical}} upgrade, work {{began with the}} engine, in accordance to the new standard now known as ZMZ-402. This produced , but needed 92 octane petrol. The other option was the ZMZ 4021, which gave [...] but only needed the more common 76 octane. The main novelty of the ZMZ-4022 was stratified charge ignition. This was immediately ruled out, due to its complication for the mass-produced car. Other changes, however, were retained. These included fingerless crankshaft bearing caps, new cast iron camshaft supports with no bushings, inlet and outlet valves of increased diameter with double-wound-springs, a new water pump, vibration dampener on the crankshaft pulley, <b>contactless</b> <b>ignition</b> system with a new alternator, new spark plugs, and an upgraded K-126GM carburettor. Some cars would feature the K-151 carburettor with a paper air filter (as opposed to the traditional oil bath filters), and an idle fuel cutoff solenoid with exhaust gas recirculation. These would often carry the aluminium cylinder block from the ZMZ-4022. Power was now [...] 0 to 100 km/h took 19 seconds, top speed was 147 km/h, and fuel economy [...] The GAZ-3102's braking system was also improved, with atandem brake cylinder that featuring a dual-chambered vacuum servo and pressure regulator on the rear brakes; the 3102's front disk brakes were left out. The 3.9:1 rear axle, clutch and 205/70R14 radial tyres with [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub cups were also carried across. The dashboard and steering wheel were also from the 3102 parts bin.|$|E

40|$|There the {{theoretical}} foundation for design and for solution of problem {{to develop the}} <b>contactless</b> <b>ignition</b> systems for the motor vehicles of Defence Ministry, to develop the like and microprocessor ignition systems for the motor vehicles of national economy of country have been created for the first time. Number of contactless and microprocessor ignition systems for the motor vehicles has been developed and has been brought in the industry; the programs for personal computer, which allow to analyse the contactless and microprocessor ignition systems in non-linear character of processes in them, have been developed and have been brought in design practice. The study was introduced step by step at ATE- 2 works, at the Works of Motor-Vehicle and Tractor Electrical Equipment, Stary Oskol.
