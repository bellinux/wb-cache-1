40|$|Word {{frequency}} and lexical class distinction between function and <b>content</b> <b>words</b> {{have been shown}} to significantly influence word production. In this paper, we use real-time magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effect of word {{frequency and}} lexical class on articulatory characteristics (the articulator speed) as well as acoustic characteristics (F 0 and short-term en-ergy) in word production. Multiple regression analyses showed that word frequency exhibits significantly higher correlation with articulatory and acoustic factors for <b>content</b> <b>words</b> com-pared to function words. A Granger causality analysis uncov-ered a causal relationship from articulatory speed to F 0 /energy for low-frequency <b>content</b> <b>words.</b> We further observed, us-ing functional canonical correlation analysis, a tight coupling of articulatory and acoustic characteristics for low-frequency <b>content</b> <b>words.</b> These results support the view that word fre-quency distinctly influences the production of function and con-tent words as manifested in their articulation and acoustics, as well as the dynamic coupling of these temporal streams.

50|$|<b>Content</b> <b>words</b> {{are usually}} open class words, meaning new ones are easily {{added to the}} language.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} the DP-analysis {{came in the form}} of parallelism across phrase and clause. The DP-analysis provides a basis for viewing clauses and phrases as structurally parallel. The basic insight runs along the following lines: since clauses have functional categories above lexical categories, noun phrases should do the same. The traditional NP-analysis has the drawback that it positions the determiner, which is often a pure function word, below the lexical noun, which is usually a full <b>content</b> <b>word.</b> The traditional NP-analysis is therefore unlike the analysis of clauses, which positions the functional categories as heads over the lexical categories. The point is illustrated by drawing a parallel to the analysis of auxiliary verbs. Given a combination such as will understand, one views the modal auxiliary verb will, a function word, as head over the main verb understand, a <b>content</b> <b>word.</b> Extending this type of analysis to a phrase like the car, the determiner the, a function word, should be head over car, a <b>content</b> <b>word.</b> In so doing, the NP the car becomes a DP. The point is illustrated with simple dependency-based hierarchies: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the exchange of disfluencies from function <b>words</b> to <b>content</b> <b>words</b> with age in Brazilian Portuguese speakers who do and do not stutter. Ninety stuttering individuals and 90 controls, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, were divided into three age groups (children, adolescents and adults). The study method involved analyzing the occurrence of stuttering on <b>content</b> and function <b>words</b> based on spontaneous speech samples. Results indicated that children tend to be more disfluent on function words. With the increase in age, teenagers and adults who stutter presented a higher number of disfluencies on <b>content</b> <b>words.</b> These findings support the current literature, indicating that with the aging process, there is an exchange of disfluencies from function to <b>content</b> <b>words.</b> This shift in the disfluency pattern may account for a more advanced type of stuttering. The study also demonstrated that disfluencies in Portuguese speakers follow the same pattern of shifting from function to <b>content</b> <b>words</b> with age as for English speakers.

50|$|In linguistics, periphrasis (IPA British English /pᵻˈrɪfrəsɪs/, U.S. English /pəˈrɪfrəsɪs/) is {{a device}} by which {{grammatical}} meaning is expressed {{by one or}} more free morphemes (typically one or more function words accompanying a <b>content</b> <b>word),</b> instead of by inflectional affixes or derivation. Periphrastic forms are analytic, whereas the absence of periphrasis is a characteristic of synthesis. While periphrasis concerns all categories of syntax, it is most visible with verb catenae.

5000|$|An {{example of}} the {{information}} that can be obtained is the use of [...] "um" [...] or [...] "uh" [...] in a conversation. These might be meaningful words that tell different things, one of which is to hold a place in the conversation {{so as not to be}} interrupted. There seems to be a hesitant stage and fluent stage that suggest speech has different levels of production.

5000|$|In Old English, inflections {{increased}} {{the length of}} most <b>content</b> <b>words</b> in any case. Through to the seventeenth century, before English spelling was firmly settled, short forms for some <b>content</b> <b>words</b> did occur, such as eg (egg), ey (eye), lo (low), etc. Conversely, poets such as John Milton alternated between short and long forms for function words, depending on whether they occurred on or off the meter.

50|$|All {{words can}} be {{classified}} as either <b>content</b> or function <b>words,</b> {{although it is not}} always easy to make the distinction. With only around 150 function words, 99.9% of words in the English language are <b>content</b> <b>words.</b> Although small in numbers, function words are used at a disproportionately higher rate and make up about 50% of any English text. This is due to the conventional patterns of words usage which bind function <b>words</b> to <b>content</b> <b>words</b> almost every time they are used, creating an interdependence between the two word groups.|$|R
5000|$|Grammatical words, as a class, {{can have}} {{distinct}} phonological properties from <b>content</b> <b>words.</b> Grammatical words sometimes {{do not make}} full use of all the sounds in a language.

In English, very few words other than function words begin with voiced th [...] (see Pronunciation of English th); English function words may have fewer than three letters 'I', 'an', 'in' while non-function words usually have three or more 'eye', 'Ann', 'inn' (see three letter rule).|$|R
5000|$|The prepositions of the Spanish language—like prepositions {{in other}} languages—are {{a set of}} {{connecting}} words (such as con, de or para) that serve to indicate a relationship between a <b>content</b> <b>word</b> (noun, verb, or adjective) and a following noun phrase (or noun, or pronoun), called {{the object of the}} preposition. The relationship is typically spatial or temporal, but prepositions express other relationships as well. As implied by the name, Spanish [...] "pre-positions" [...] (like those of English) are positioned before their objects. Spanish does not place these function words after their objects; the language does not use postpositions.|$|E
50|$|Beck does concede, however, {{that the}} Lushootseed {{argument}} ti ʔux̌ʷ ('the one who goes', shown in example sentence (1b) above) does represent {{an example of}} an unmarked 'verb' used as an argument and that further research may potentially substantiate M. Dale Kinkade's 1983 position that all Salishan content words are essentially 'verbs' (such as ʔux̌ʷ 'goes' and sbiaw 'is a coyote') and that the use of any <b>content</b> <b>word</b> as an argument involves an underlying relative clause. For example, with the determiner ti translated as 'that which', the arguments ti ʔux̌ʷ and ti sbiaw would be most literally translated as 'that which goes' and 'that which is a coyote' respectively.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} of grammaticalization, an uninflected lexical word (or <b>content</b> <b>word)</b> is {{transformed}} into a grammar word (or function word). The process by which the word leaves its word class and enters another is not sudden, but occurs by a gradual series of individual shifts. The overlapping stages of grammaticalization form a chain, generally called a cline. These shifts generally follow similar patterns in different languages. Linguists do not agree on the precise definition of a cline or on its exact characteristics in given instances. It is believed that the stages on the cline do not always have a fixed position, but vary. However, Hopper and Traugott's famous pattern for the cline of grammaticalization illustrates the various stages of the form: ...|$|E
