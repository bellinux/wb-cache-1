40|$|To apply {{behavior}} {{analysis to}} normal adults in non institutional settings, {{we may have}} to encourage their participation in the design and implementation of behavioral technology. This study evaluates a technology by which the members of a student housing cooperative manage their own staff with a minimum of supervision by one of the program designers. This staff management system consisted of prompts, self-reports, spot checks, and <b>contingent</b> <b>rent</b> reductions. Six resident staff members performed substantially more of their assigned tasks when this system was used. In addition, the management system was acceptable to the members, was affordable, and maintained high levels of staff performance during a 5 -year follow-up. Participation by the members in the design and implementation of this system appears to have been useful in helping the behavior analysts to develop an unusually durable management system...|$|E
40|$|Some {{researchers}} have been convinced that welfare developments in East Asia, especially Japan and Korea, can be fitted into the existing three worlds of welfare model, while others have insisted that existing welfare regime theories {{are not able to}} explain East Asian welfare regimes. This article assumes that we need to go beyond both of these traditional explanations. In the welfare state research fields, welfare regime approaches tend to focus on specific contextual conditions and cross-national differences. As a result, they tend to overemphasize history at the expense of theory. This article tries to combine deductive causal modeling with an institutional–historical context by identifying the <b>contingent</b> <b>rent</b> political game model and deducing important characteristics of East Asian welfare regime from this model. This model opens out the possibility of change in East Asian welfare regimes following the processes of democratization and globalization. Details of this are given in the conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Some leases contain {{indemnification}} clauses that indemnify lessors, on an after-tax basis, {{for certain}} tax benefits that the lessor may lose if {{a change in}} the tax law precludes realization of those tax benefits. The issue is the appropriate accounting by the lessor and lessee for indemnification payments. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that, although the indemnification payments may appear to meet the definition of contingent rentals in Statement 13, as amended by Statement 29, such payments are not of the nature normally expected to arise under <b>contingent</b> <b>rent</b> provisions. Further, due to the close association of the payments to specific aspects of the tax law, the payments should be accounted for in a manner that recognizes the tax law association. The original lease classification should not be changed. Lessors receiving indemnification payments should allocate the payments into two parts: (1) that resulting from any investment tax credit (ITC) lost and (2) that relating to all other tax effects. The portion relating to ITC should be accounted for consistent with the lessor's Copyright © 1986, Financial Accounting Standards Boar...|$|E
5000|$|While {{the first}} Exposure Draft envisioned {{including}} rent judged [...] "more likely than not" [...] {{to be paid}} (<b>contingent</b> <b>rents</b> and options to renew) in addition to minimum required rent payments, subsequent decisions by the boards reversed these plans, making the proposed accounting for lessees {{similar to that of}} existing capital leases. Lessor accounting was largely reverted to the existing standard. Leases with a maximum term of 12 months or less would be treated in accordance with current operating lease rules.|$|R
50|$|REMICs {{are subject}} to federal income taxes at the highest {{corporate}} rate for foreclosure income and must file returns through Form 1066. The foreclosure income that is taxable {{is the same as}} that for a real estate investment trust (REIT) and may include <b>rents</b> <b>contingent</b> on making a profit, rents paid by a related party, rents from property to which the REMIC offers atypical services, and income from foreclosed property when the REMIC serves as dealer.|$|R
