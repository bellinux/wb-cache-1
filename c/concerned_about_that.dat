25|$|Askøy Municipal Council {{voted on}} 26 August 1982 that they {{preferred}} that connection {{from the bridge}} to the city center to run via a tunnel from Kjøkkelvik to Gravdalsvatnet. Bergen Municipality was <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> such a road would {{have a negative impact}} on the neighborhoods it would run through, and on 28 October 1985 voted for a tunnel from the bridge to Storavatnet and that a new highway would have to be built from there to the city center before the bridge be built. Specifically this involved the construction of two new tunnels, the Lyderhorn Tunnel and the Damsgård Tunnel. The latter was part of the existing plans for road construction and was scheduled for completion in 1992. However, the Lyderhorn Tunnel would have to be pushed forward, as it was planned completed in 1996. The toll company offered to advance NOK50 million of the necessary NOK70 million that the tunnel costs, on condition that it be refunded in 1994 and 1995 and that Bergen Municipality pay half the interest costs. The proposal was passed by both municipalities.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 2014, NATO criticized Russia for {{expanding}} its border deeper into Georgia's region of Abkhazia, a move Moscow had {{portrayed as a}} temporary step to expand a security zone around the Sochi Winter Olympics. [...] "We have noted the recent decision to temporarily extend the so-called border zone of Abkhazia further into Georgian territory without the Georgian government's consent," [...] NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said.

2500|$|Hellig Usvart was a seminal, highly {{influential}} album for the Christian {{black metal}} movement. The album spawned some imitators, especially in South America, with {{groups such as}} Poems of Shadows taking apparent influences from Horde's style on their album Nocturnal Blasphemous Chanting. [...] The raging lyrics of anti-satanism would dominate the unblack scene for years. <b>Concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Erasmus of Son of Man Records asked Sherlock in a 2006 interview: [...] "Do you feel that unblack metal {{will be able to}} efficiently continue its response to black metal if it does not grow beyond 'horn crushing'?" [...] Sherlock responded, [...] "No I do not. The lyrics on 'Hellig Usvart' were written 12 years ago. I'm sure that if another Horde album was written today, the themes would be quite different and much more mature, to counteract the poetic and intelligent (albeit misguided) lyrics of modern BM." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1951 {{until he}} was first slated for {{election}} in 1965, Washington worked {{in the offices of}} the 3rdWard Alderman, former Olympic athlete Ralph Metcalfe. Richard J. Daley was elected party chairman in 1952. Daley replaced C.C. Wimbush, an ally of William Dawson, on the party committee with Metcalfe. Under Metcalfe, the 3rd Ward was a critical factor in Mayor Daley's 1955 mayoral election victory and ranked first in the city in the size of its Democratic plurality in 1961. While working under Metcalfe, Washington began to organize the 3rd Ward's Young Democrats (YD) organization. At YD conventions, the 3rd Ward would push for numerous resolutions in the interest of blacks. Eventually, other black YD organizations would come to the 3rd Ward headquarters for advice on how to run their own organizations. Like he had at Roosevelt College, Washington avoided radicalism and preferred to work through the party to engender change. While working with the Young Democrats, Washington met Mary Ella Smith. They dated for the next 20 years, and in 1983 Washington proposed to Smith. In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Smith said that she never pressed Washington for marriage because she knew Washington's first love was politics, saying, [...] "He was a political animal. He thrived on it, and I knew any thoughts of marriage would have to wait. I wasn't <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I just knew the day would come." [...] In 1960, with Lemuel Bentley, Bennett Johnson, Luster Jackson and others, Washington founded the Chicago League of Negro Voters, one of the first African-American political organizations in the city. In its first election, Bentley drew 60,000votes for city clerk. After dropping out of view after the elections, it resurfaced as the group Protest at the Polls in 1963. Washington participated in the planning process to further the goals of 3rd Ward YDs. By 1967, the independent candidates had gained traction within the black community, winning several aldermanic seats; in 1983, the League of Negro Voters were instrumental in Washington's run for mayor. By then, the YDs were losing influence in the party, as more black voters supported independent candidates.|$|E

60|$|Embarking in the boat, he rowed {{towards a}} point of rocks jutting out into the sea, over which {{albatrosses}} had been seen hovering many times. On the way, Nellie, who had previously been taught what to do, fastened a small bit of wood {{to the end of}} the line she had spun. Hanging from this was a hook that the coxswain had made from a gull's breast-bone. It was baited with a piece of pork. Before arriving at the point of rocks, they saw that an albatross was soaring over it on its mighty outspread wings. On observing the boat, it flew away and disappeared in the distance; but Bob was not much <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hitherto he {{kept his}} word with me, and offered me nothing amiss. We came away in the coach again, and he brought me into the streets, and by {{this time it was}} near ten o'clock at night, and he stopped the coach at a house where, it seems, he was acquainted, and where they made no scruple to show us upstairs into a room with a bed in it. At first I seemed to be unwilling to go up, but after a few words I yielded to that too, being willing to see the end of it, and in hope to make {{something}} of it at last. As for the bed, etc., I was not much <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> part.|$|E

But the girl was not apparently much <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> or anything else. The truth is that she possessed in an eminent and enviable degree the spirit of entire trust in a leader. She was under orders, and awaited the word of command with perfect equanimity! She even smiled slightly--if such a mouth could be said to do anything slightly--when Mary left her to take fresh rifles to the defenders overhead.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was clear}} that in those days Willems lived on Almayer's charity. Yet on {{returning}} two months later to Sambir I heard that he had gone on an expedition up the river {{in charge of a}} steam-launch belonging to the Arabs, to make some discovery or other. On account of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about Willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that transaction. Moreover, I was a newcomer, the youngest of the company, and, I suspect, not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence. I was not much <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> exclusion. The faint suggestion of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching Almayer's affairs amused me vastly. Almayer was obviously very much affected. I believe he missed Willems immensely. He wore an air of sinister preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain. I could catch only snatches of mumbled sentences. Then one morning as I came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table Almayer checked himself in his low-toned discourse. My captain's face was perfectly impenetrable. There was a moment of profound silence and then as if unable to contain himself Almayer burst out in a loud vicious tone: ...|$|E

We {{asked him how he}} came to be so entirely abandoned of all concern for his safety? He answered, that to him, that had so often wished for death, life was not worth defending; and that, as he was entirely {{at the mercy of the}} negroes, they had much the more confidence in him, seeing he had no weapons to hurt them. As for wild beasts, he was not much <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> for he scarce ever went from his hut; but if he did, the negro king and his men went all with him, and they were all armed with bows and arrows, and lances, with which they would kill any of the ravenous creatures, lions as well as others; but that they seldom came abroad in the day; and if the negroes wander anywhere in the night, they always build a hut for themselves, and make a fire at the door of it, which is guard enough.|$|E

'What is it, then?' says he. With which I fell to tears, and could say nothing to him at all. He strove to pacify me all he could, but began at last to be very pressing upon me to tell what it was. At last I answered that I thought I ought to tell him too, and that he had some right to know it; besides, that I wanted his direction in the case, for I was in such perplexity that I knew not what course to take, and then I related the whole affair to him. I told him how imprudently his brother had managed himself, in making himself so public; for that if he had kept it a secret, as such a thing out to have been, I could but have denied him positively, without giving any reason for it, and he would in time have ceased his solicitations; but that he had the vanity, first, to depend upon it that I would not deny him, and then had taken the freedom to tell his resolution of having me to the whole house.|$|E
