50|$|At {{the lower}} end of a typical {{compound}} optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a <b>circular</b> <b>nose</b> piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.|$|R
5000|$|The chief {{structural}} {{difference between}} the two models, which shared the same span and length, was the D.25's second cockpit itself and the fuselage strengthening around it to allow a gun mounting.

Both the D.21 and D.25 had much in common with the Dewoitine D.12 of 1924. For example, the D.25's parasol wing was {{similar to that of the}} D.12, with the same span, a constant chord inner panel, outer sections tapered on both the leading and trailing edges but chiefly on the latter, ending in blunt tips. It was braced to the lower fuselage by a parallel pair of long struts on each side.

40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{it was found}} that the instability failure of curved sheet is nearly independent of the type of loading and is primarily a function of the maximum stress, radius-thickness ration and modulus of elasticity. A method of correlating the critical stress of thin sheet under several different types of loading is given. An explanation for the experimental critical stress of thin walled cylinders under bending being greater than that for pure compression is given. The strength of unstiffened thin walled <b>circular</b> <b>nose</b> sections under pure bending was found to be controlled by local instability of the section, rather than a large scale instability. The equation of local instability of curved sheet gives values which are in fair agreement with those found experimentally. The strength of elliptical cylinders supported at the minor axis under bending plus shear loads is governed primarily by the bending strength, and is little effected by the sheer force unless the amount of shear is quite large with respect to the moment. The effect of increasing the amount of elliptically greatly reduces the bending and shear strength of nose sections. Under torsional loads the stress at buckling falls off as the ration of the major to minor axis increases but the failure stress decreases at a slower rate than the buckling stress. The length effect of semi-circular sections under torsion is similar to that of a circular tube, and can be obtained by Donnell's theoretical equation. ...|$|R

In this paper, {{based on}} finite element {{software}} DEFORM, {{the model of}} a large cutting depth and quasi-high speeds milling of titanium alloys is built to study the cutting temperature and cutting force variation along with the change of cutting parameters. The simulation results show that: {{the location of the}} maximum cutting temperature appears in the cutting edges of the tool <b>nose</b> <b>circular</b> profile. Meanwhile, due to workpiece material rebound in the cutting process, the interface between workpiece and tool flank face occurs serious extrusion, which results in relatively high cutting temperature on the workpiece machined surface. In addition, cutting speed and feed rate per tooth {{play a key role in}} influencing the cutting temperature. However, the influence of cutting depth on the cutting temperature is less clear. With the increase in the feed rate and cutting depth, cutting force increased significantly. In particular, within the scope of the cutting speeds under the given conditions, the cutting force has a tendency to decrease with the cutting speed increasing over 120 m/min...|$|R
40|$|Each of the JLC/NLC main linacs {{will consist}} of 1 mil-lion complex 3 D {{accelerating}} cells {{that make up the}} 1. 8 -meter Rounded Damped Detuned Structures (RDDS) along its eight kilometer length. The RDDS is designed to pro-vide maximum accelerating gradient to the beam while be-ing able to suppress the long-range transverse wakefields to a satisfactory level. Using the 2 D finite element code, Omega 2, a 15 % improvement in shunt impedance is found by changing the basic cell shape from a straight cylin-der to a round outer wall contour that connects to slightly bulging <b>circular</b> disk <b>noses.</b> The HOM damping manifold is then designed around this optimal cell shape to improve the cell-to-manifold coupling for the dipole mode and the vacuum conductance under the frequency and minimal Q-reduction constraints for the fundamental mode. We use both MAFIA and the 3 D finite element Omega 3 code for this step to obtain a manifold geometry that consists of a round waveguide with additional narrow coupling slots that cut into the cell disks. As a time and cost saving measure for the JLC/NLC, the RDDS cell dimensions are being de-termined through computer modeling to within fabrication precision so that no tuning may be needed once the struc-tures are assembled. At the X-band operating frequency, this corresponds to an error of a few microns in the cell radius. Such a level of resolution requires highly accurate field solvers and vast amount of computer resources. We will present calculations with the parallel code Omega 3 P that utilizes massively parallel computers such as the Cray T 3 E at NERSC. The numerical results will be compared with coldtest measurements performed on RDDS proto-types that are diamond-turned with dimensions based on Omega 3 P simulations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} protect bridge piers and {{abutments}} against scour is critical to bridge safety. Excessive pier scour can cause high maintenance costs or even bridge collapse resulting in the interruption of traffic and possibly death. Up to now, various types of countermeasures have been recommended to reduce scouring around pier foundations. The countermeasures against pier scour can be broadly classified into two categories: (1) flow-altering and (2) bed-armouring countermeasures. This thesis focuses on the first category of countermeasures. Based on {{a comprehensive review of}} the up-to-date studies on various types of flow-altering countermeasures, these can be classified into four main groups based on their shapes and performances: (1) openings through piers, (2) pier attachments, (3) bed attachments and (4) other devices. After evaluation and considering all the countermeasures, a few countermeasures were recommended for further investigations. Among them, five countermeasures were selected for analysis in the present thesis. They are transverse sacrificial piles, collar, threading, pier slot and bed-sill. The first part of the experiments, were performed in clear-water scour condition, near threshold condition of sediment movement. In this part, countermeasures were tested individually. Afterwards, countermeasures that showed appropriate efficiency in scour depth reduction were combined one by one. Results of this part showed that a collar, pier slot and sacrificial piles may show efficiency of about 30 % in scour depth reduction; however, threading cannot be assumed as a reliable pier scour countermeasure. Results show that the blockage ratio of sacrificial piles is an important parameter, since by increasing the number of piles from three to five, the efficiency reduces. In this part also optimum size and location of a pier slot were criticised and best configuration based on previous and present studies was proposed. In fact, the best configuration can be suggested as a pier slot half as long as the flow depth plus maximum scour depth. In this case, the pier slot near the water surface may not significantly increase the efficiency. A combination of sacrificial piles with a collar and sacrificial piles with a slot showed that they cannot reduce the scour depth significantly with respect to each individual countermeasure. In particular, a combination of a collar and sacrificial piles increases the rate of scouring with respect to a single collar. At the end of this part, a combination of a bed-sill and cut-collar was selected as the best configuration. Two forms of this countermeasure were proposed for further studies. In the first proposed countermeasure, the use of a sill as wide as the channel width was recommended. This form, although reliable to prevent souring at the upstream part of the bed-sill, may not be applicable for some practical purposes. Therefore, in another attempt, a shorter bed-sill was also proposed, protected with two side-walls, {{in order to reduce the}} risk of scour intrusion in front of the bed-sill. These two proposed countermeasures showed efficiencies of 68. 5 % and 64. 5 % in scour depth reduction, however owing to the use of a border around the collar rim, the scour did not reach the pier body. In next part, the later form of proposed countermeasure that consists of a shorter bed-sill and seems to be more practical, was evaluated in unsteady flow tests with the peak flow intensity slightly greater than the threshold for the inception of sediment movement. In this section of the thesis, <b>circular</b> and round <b>nose</b> and tail rectangular piers were tested in both configurations of single and two in-line piers. The results of unsteady flow tests also show that the proposed combined countermeasure can protect pier foundation during a flood event. Specifically, it seems that the proposed countermeasure is more effective when it is applied to round nose and tail rectangular piers than circular onesScuola di Dottorato "Pitagora" in Scienzae Ingegneristiche, Ciclo I, a. a. 2007 - 2010 Università degli Studi della Calabri...|$|R
