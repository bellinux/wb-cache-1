5|$|In 1898 {{a friend}} of Watts {{suggested}} to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF {{it would make a}} suitable site for Watts's memorial. Watts was approached, and agreed to the suggestion. On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining £3,000 were raised, Watts would design and build a covered way, which in due <b>course</b> <b>would</b> be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people. Watts planned to build a covered way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported on stone or timber columns.|$|E

A month later, he announced that the company's first <b>course</b> <b>would</b> be in Dubai {{as part of a}} 25.3 million-square-foot development, The Tiger Woods Dubai. The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009. As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, The New York Times reported that the project had been shelved permanently.

5|$|Julian was now {{faced with}} a finely-balanced {{judgement}} call. The safer option was to ignore Chnodomar's challenge and to keep his forces in their fortified bases and request and await reinforcements, if necessary until the following year's campaign season. But the performance of Barbatio and the imperial comitatus in the recent campaign cast doubt on whether such reinforcements would be supplied and on their value if they were. Such a <b>course</b> <b>would</b> also expose Gaul to a massive Germanic invasion just when the harvest was due. Alternatively, he could fight Chnodomar alone. This offered {{the prospect of a}} decisive victory, since the Alamanni forces were now, unusually, concentrated and not divided into many disparate bands. This argument was strongly made by Florentius, the praefectus praetorio Galliarum (governor-general of Gaul), who had the crucial job of ensuring the army's recruits, pay and supplies. The Romans almost always won pitched battles with barbarians, because of their superior equipment, organisation and training. But in this case it was clearly a high-risk option because of the Germans' massive superiority in numbers.|$|E

25|$|In April 1900, {{surveyors}} {{began studying}} {{part of the}} park as a possible location for a golf course. Later that month, workers began construction at the northwest course location. It was expected that the <b>course</b> <b>would</b> open in June or July of that year, but that the work would not be fully complete until September. New York City greenskeeper Val Flood later stated that he thought the <b>course</b> <b>would</b> open by August; however, by September 1900, work on the course had hardly started {{due to a lack}} of workers. By the end of 1900, NYC Parks reported that seeds had been planted for nine greens, and two bunkers and one hazard had been created. The course opened in 1901, but did not gain popularity until 1903 when overcrowding at the Van Cortlandt course drove players to use the less crowded Pelham Bay course instead.|$|E

The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the accumulator by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the accumulator needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of <b>course,</b> <b>would</b> create wrong results).|$|E

25|$|Anquetil {{was fascinated}} by the British love of time-trialling and in 1964 {{discussed}} riding a British 25mile (40km) race. Gayfer and the British professional Tom Simpson explained that the <b>course</b> <b>would</b> be on flat roads and asked Anquetil how long the distance would take him. Anquetil, who had the talent to predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 minutes. That was eight minutes faster than the distance had ever been ridden, the record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23. It took until 1993 for the record to fall below Anquetil's estimation.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} break-in, Nixon's team (chiefly Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean) asked Helms in effect to assert a phony {{national}} security {{reason for the}} break-in and, under that rationale, {{to interfere with the}} ongoing FBI investigation of the Watergate burglaries. Such a <b>course</b> <b>would</b> also involve the CIA in posting bail for the arrested suspects. Initially Helms made some superficial accommodation that stalled for several weeks the FBI's progress. At several meetings attended by Helms and Walters, Nixon's team referred to the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco, using it as if a talisman of dark secrets, as an implied threat against the integrity of CIA. Immediately, sharply, Helms turned aside this gambit.|$|E
25|$|Tucker used William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England as {{the basis}} of his course at the College, but added {{discussion}} on how the Commentaries differed from U.S. law. Tucker also added lectures on principles of U.S. government, and told his students that the laws passed by U.S. legislatures, both state and federal, would be more important in his course than the authorities whose treatises were the traditional resources for learning about the English common law. Along those lines, Tucker's <b>course</b> <b>would</b> discuss how civil law principles had replaced common law ones in U.S. jurisprudence since the Revolution. Tucker's course also discussed other important topics of the day such as the abolition of slavery. Parts of Tucker's lectures showed that states' rights were an important principle to him.|$|E

Lil T and Brother T would hit their patented T Factor on both members of NJ2 before raising the Tag-Team Championships and signaling their intentions.

A lane also ran off a crossroads (now a 'T' junction of sorts) near Floors and ran down to the farm as shown on Ainslie's 1821 map. A lane ran from Mid Lamb. directly to Townhead of Lamb until the turnpike was constructed.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Grant faced a decision.

Unfortunately for Grant, such a <b>course</b> <b>would</b> put him {{under the command of}} the more senior major general and the credit for any success in the theater would go to Banks. Since Banks was occupied with operations on the Red River and had informed Grant that he was not ready to begin operations against Port Hudson within the next few days, Grant decided to move on his own against Vicksburg. He sent a message to Halleck about his intentions, knowing that it would take as many as eight days for Washington to receive the message and respond.|$|E

In Normal (Technical), students take subjects of a more technical nature, such as Design and Technology, and they generally proceed to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) after the N-level exam in the fourth year. In 2004, the Ministry of Education announced that selected students in the Normal <b>course</b> <b>would</b> have an opportunity to sit for the O-level exam directly without first taking the N-level exam.|$|E
25|$|Grove {{focused the}} College's {{attention}} on two main activities: practical training and examining. He {{was determined to}} raise the general standard of orchestral playing by replacing the existing ad hoc methods of apprentice-based training, private lessons, or study abroad. His second focus, examination, followed the Victorian trend to form professional bodies regulating and standardising the activity of members of each profession. An example is the Institution of Civil Engineers to which Grove had been admitted in 1839. When the Royal Charter establishing the College was being drawn up, Grove ensured that, unlike the Royal Academy, the College should have degree-awarding powers. Mackenzie, seeing the prospect that the new institution would overshadow the Academy, successfully proposed that both bodies should award qualifications jointly. Grove agreed, realising that this <b>course</b> <b>would</b> do much to dispel the damaging hostility that existed between the Academy and the College.|$|E
