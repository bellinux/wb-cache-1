40|$|Shortened] The 12 C + 12 C fusion {{reaction}} {{has been}} the subject of considerable experimental efforts to constrain uncertainties at temperatures relevant for stellar nucleosynthesis. In order to investigate the effect of an enhanced carbon burning rate on massive star structure and nucleosynthesis, new stellar evolution models and their yields are presented exploring the impact of three different 12 C + 12 C reaction rates. Non-rotating stellar models were generated using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code and were later post-processed with the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network tool. The enhanced rate causes <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> burning to be ignited more promptly and at lower temperature. This reduces the neutrino losses, which increases the <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> burning lifetime. An increased carbon burning rate also increases the upper initial mass limit for which a star exhibits a convective <b>carbon</b> <b>core.</b> <b>Carbon</b> shell burning is also affected, with fewer convective-shell episodes and convection zones that tend to be larger in mass. Consequently, the chance of an overlap between the ashes of <b>carbon</b> <b>core</b> burning and the following carbon shell convection zones is increased, which can cause a portion of the ashes of <b>carbon</b> <b>core</b> burning to be included in the carbon shell. Therefore, during the supernova explosion, the ejecta will be enriched by s-process nuclides synthesized from the <b>carbon</b> <b>core</b> s process. The yields were used to estimate the weak s-process component in order to compare with the solar system abundance distribution. The enhanced rate models were found to produce a significant proportion of Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Pd and Cd in the weak component, which is primarily the signature of the carbon-core s process. Consequently, it is shown that the production of isotopes in the Kr-Sr region can be used to constrain the 12 C + 12 C rate using the current branching ratio for a- and p-exit channels.

40|$|Differences in {{the carbon}} {{behavior}} between He and D plasmas during VH-mode, L-mode and L-mode with excess gas puffing are reported and inferences {{on the importance}} of the various carbon sources during these modes of operation are discussed. During a VH-mode phase, VUV and visible charge exchange spectroscopy indicates that for both He and D operation the carbon behavior is very similar. In the edge plasma, carbon build up is quite rapid, and the carbon influx represents a large fraction of the total plasma density increase until the termination of the VH phase. During cold divertor operation induced by puffing the primary fueling gas, D and He discharges show a difference in the <b>carbon</b> behavior. The <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> density is seen to be approximately constant during a D discharge as it transitions from an attached to a cold divertor. However in a He discharge, the <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> density disappears soon after the cold divertor transition. Arguments are made that the primary carbon source in the ELM free H-mode period is physical sputtering by ion impact at the divertor strike point.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the present}} article, we propose {{a method for}} {{determining}} optimal metabolic pathways {{in terms of the}} level of concentration of the enzymes catalyzing various reactions in the entire metabolic network. The method, first of all, generates data on reaction fluxes in a pathway based on steady state condition. A set of constraints is formulated incorporating weighting coefficients corresponding to concentration of enzymes catalyzing reactions in the pathway. Finally, the rate of yield of the target metabolite, starting with a given substrate, is maximized in order to identify an optimal pathway through these weighting coefficients. Results The effectiveness of the present method is demonstrated on two synthetic systems existing in the literature, two pentose phosphate, two glycolytic pathways, <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> metabolism and a large network of carotenoid biosynthesis pathway of various organisms belonging to different phylogeny. A comparative study with the existing extreme pathway analysis also forms a part of this investigation. Biological relevance and validation of the results are provided. Finally, the impact of the method on metabolic engineering is explained with a few examples. Conclusions The method may be viewed as determining an optimal set of enzymes that is required to get an optimal metabolic pathway. Although it is a simple one, it has been able to identify a carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and the optimal pathway of <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> metabolic network that is closer to some earlier investigations than that obtained by the extreme pathway analysis. Moreover, the present method has identified correctly optimal pathways for pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways.

40|$|Mixing {{processes}} in stars driven by composition gradients {{as a result}} of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability are not anticipated. They are supported only by hydrodynamic studies of stellar convection. We find that such mixing occurs below the bottom edge of convection zones in our multidimensional hydrodynamic shell convection models. It operates at interfaces created by off-center nuclear burning, where less dense gas with higher mean molecular weight is located above denser gas with a lower mean molecular weight. We discuss the mixing under various conditions with hydrodynamic convection models based on stellar evolutionary calculations of the core helium flash in a 1. 25 Msun star, the <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> flash in a 9. 3 Msun star, and of oxygen burning shell in a star with a mass of 23 Msun. We simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of shell convection during various phases of stellar evolution with the Eulerian hydrodynamics code HERAKLES in two and three spatial dimensions. Initial models for this purpose are obtained by state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes, namely GARSTEC, STAREVOL, and TYCHO for the core helium flash, <b>core</b> <b>carbon</b> flash, and oxygen shell burning, respectively. Most of our analysis is performed for two-dimensional hydrodynamic models of shell convection during the core helium flash at its peak covering approximately 250 convective turnover timescales. The mixing manifests itself in the form of overdense and cold fingers enriched with matter of higher mean molecular weight, originating from density fluctuations at the lower boundary of the convective shell, and "shooting" down into the core. They result from the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the lower convection zone boundary due to a negative mean molecular weight gradient. They do not appear when the mean molecular weight gradient is positive. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures, submitted to the Aa...|$|R
