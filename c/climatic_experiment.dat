50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Toowoomba Botanic Garden, a curator, Edward Way, was appointed and the gardens were well established in late 1875. The curator was essential {{to the success of the}} Botanic Gardens as a scientific research tool - Way was responsible for liaising with Walter Hill about the layout, planting projects and overseeing the construction of appropriate structures therein. The two local newspapers reported in October and November 1875 that the Queens Park and the Botanic Gardens had been lately improved with walks, borders, flower beds, nurseries of exotic trees, specimen grass plantings from the Acclimatization Society, and a bush house. The latter part of the 1870s saw the planting and testing of structure trees and fruit trees and in 1880 <b>climatic</b> <b>experiments</b> were carried out on the extant garden. Periodically trees were removed and replaced from the gardens to allow continual testing of various species and types, the results from these tests were published in local papers and forwarded to the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, thereby contributing to a rich volume of knowledge about Queensland botany.|$|R

Two large-scale experimental dikes have been built, one in Germany and one in Poland. Additionally, a large variety of laboratory tests and experiments have been performed and a considerable monitoring test programme will be followed. This paper contains a general description of the project as well as first results from a laboratory flume test, field investigations on seepage and the information about a planned <b>climatic</b> chamber <b>experiment,</b> all performed at the University of Rostock, where the focus is laid on fine-grained dredged materials in combination with geosynthetics solutions. The flume experiments showed a very high strength of the dredged materials samples with grass cover. The first seepage test at the large-scale test dike in Rostock showed good performance of the geosynthetic drainage solution applied {{as well as the}} stability of the dredged material with respect to rapid drawdown of the water level. The comparison of measurements inside the dike and a seepage model showed considerably higher hydraulic conductivity in the field compared to that determined in the laboratory, however still in the range suited for coastal dike cover materials. To investigate the cracking behaviour of the ripened fine-grained dredged material a <b>climatic</b> chamber <b>experiment</b> has been set up which is also discussed briefly...|$|R
40|$|The climatic and {{hydrological}} {{systems are}} tightly related and any induced changes cause chained interactions. In {{an attempt to}} adequately manage water resources in Greece, a series of experiments were conducted with different GCMs in selected study areas to understand this interplay. This paper is {{an overview of the}} studies carried out in the Aliakmon, the Upper Acheloos, the Portaikos, and the Pinios basins, where the regional hydrological cycle was evaluated on river basin spatial scale to assess regional impacts and variability. The impacts of climate change on the water resources are presented in a synthetic quantitative way, in order to draw general conclusions concerning the trends of the hydrological indicators. A good agreement was observed between the different <b>climatic</b> <b>experiments,</b> and the trends on the selected hydrological indicators demonstrate an increase in temperature and PET, reduction in the mean annual precipitation and runoff, and a shifting of the snowmelt period towards the winter, while the snowpack storage was proved to be a con-trolling factor. It is accentuated that relatively small decreases in the mean annual precipitation cause dramatic increase of reservoir risk levels of annual firm water supply and energy production. As a result, radical increases of reservoir storage volume are required to maintain firm water and energy yields at tolerable risk levels. The adaptive capacity of the country is not that high, and a series of serious actions need to be taken in order to mitigate the effects of climate change and assess its impacts...|$|R

A characterisation to qualify and quantify this moisture buffering effect is given in a complementary paper (Janssen and Roels, 2009 a, 2009 b). Starting from this methodology, this paper proposes a method to determine the hygric inertia of an entire room in situ. To do so, a humidifier {{is placed in the}} room and a moisture production scheme is imposed over an interval of some days.

40|$|Hexagonal ice {{crystal and}} {{equivalent}} ice spheres have significantly different single-scattering properties. Although the extinction cross-section for spheres with equivalent surface areas {{is about the}} same as that for nonspherical ice crystals randomly oriented in space, equivalent spheres produce more forward scattering and have smaller single-scattering albedos. On the basis of broad-band radiative transfer calculations, in this note we will illustrate that the assumption that ice particles are spheres with equivalent surface areas leads to an underestimate to the solar albedo of cirrus clouds. Furthermore, we show that, for a given optical thickness, small ice particles reflect more solar flux than large ice particles. This implies that the ice crystal size distribution could be extremely important in the determination of the solar albedo of cirrus clouds due to external radiative forcing in <b>climatic</b> perturbation <b>experiments.</b> In the thermal infrared region, absorption by ice crystals predominates and the effects of the nonsphericity and size distribution of ice crystals on infrared radiative transfer appear to be secondary...|$|R

Experiments showed that CYP epidemics was faster at higher temperatures and the model could replicate these observations with relatively high accuracy (correlation > 98. 03 % and residuals < 14. 5 %). The epidemics spreading rate increased linearly from 0. 2 plants infected per day at 15 °C to about 0. 7 plants per day at 30 °C, possibly due to: i) faster CYP multiplication in the host plants and ii) higher frequency of feeding bouts of M. quadripunctulatus at higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Both {{environmental}} and economic concerns have resulted in renewed interest in the potential for nitrogen loss under various <b>climatic</b> conditions. <b>Experiments</b> were conducted at three locations in Illinois to evaluate the effect of soil type, nitrogen rate, and excessive soil moisture levels on the potential for nitrogen loss. Addition of 10 cm of excessive water during {{the early part of}} the growing season resulted in N loss estimates of about 20 kg/ha on a silty clay loam at DeKalb and a sand at Havana. Increasing the excess water levels to 15 cm increased the N loss to 50 to 70 kg/ha at the same two locations, respectively. Since excessive rains in the fall prevented the collection of soil samples to use in monitoring nitrogen movement, conclusive results are not available to indicate the relative magnitude of loss from leaching and denitrification at these two locations. However, it is likely that a majority of the loss at the Havana site would have been through leaching, whereas at the DeKalb site most of the loss was probably due to denitrification...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the response of}} the Antarctic ice sheet to changes in environmental conditions, both on the longer palaeoclimatic time scale (104 - 105 y) as on the shorter time scale (102 y) associated with future greenhouse warming. The Antarctic ice sheet is of large interest because changes in its elevation andextent have an important role in modulating global atmospheric and oceanographic processes, and because these fluctuations contribute significantly toworld-wide sea levels. The possibility of a surge of the marine-based West Antarctic ice sheet is often mentioned as an important aspect. In a first part a qualitative description is given {{of the role of the}} ice sheet in the global environmental system and the possible modes of interaction arediscussed. An overview is also presented of the ice sheet's glacial history and of available field evidence of ice sheet expansion during the last glacial cycle. Subsequently, the Antarctic ice sheet is investigated using a high-resolution 3 -D flow model covering the entire ice domain. This model incorporates acoupled ice shelf, grounding-line dynamics, basal sliding and isostatic bed adjustment. It has a full coupling between thermal field and ice flow and the icesheet geometry is freely generated in response to specified environmental conditions. The model is driven by changes in sea level, surface temperature andmass balance. A simulation of the present ice sheet reveals that the model is able to yield realistic results. A series of <b>climatic</b> <b>experiments</b> are then performed, in which themodel is used to examine the ice sheet during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. This involves a sensitivity study with respect to changing environmentalconditions and a time-dependent simulation of the last glacial cycle. In line with glacial-geological evidence, the most pronounced changes occur in the WestAntarctic ice sheet configuration. These fluctuations are essentially controlled by variations in eustatic sea level, whereas typical glacial-interglacial changes intemperature and ice deposition rates tend to balance one another. On the shorter greenhouse warming time scale, the model's response is determined by changes in the mass balance. It is found that as long as the temperaturerise is below 5 ¡C, the Antarctic ice sheet will probably grow, because melting at the ice sheet edge can still be offset by higher deposition rates on the plateau. The hypothesis of a catastrophic collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is not supported by the model results presented in this thesis...|$|R

AGCM predictions of overall soil moisture change are in broad agreement but disagree sharply in some regions. Intercomparison projects have sought to evaluate the LSSs used by AGCMs for both accuracy and consistency. These {{studies have found that}} different LSSs can produce very different simulations even when supplied with identical atmospheric forcing. As well, LSSs that produce similar surface results from present-day or control climates often diverge when forced with climatic change data. Furthermore, no single LSS has been identified that produces an adequate simulation of all of temperature, moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff.

40|$|Continuous magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy made it {{possible}} to construct a detailed late Neogene record of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios of ocean water, as measured in the tests of planktonic foraminifers. Sediments recovered during Leg 117, in the western Arabian Sea, provide a continuous, high resolution sedimentary record from the early Miocene to present. The late Miocene to Recent is marked by rapidly increasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in seawater, which results in a chronostratigraphical resolution varying from 0. 2 Ma to 1. 5 Ma. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr seawater curve has a stepwise character similar to the one determined by DePaolo on Site 590 B, in the Tasman Sea, and to the one determined by McKenzie on Site 653 A, in the Mediterranean, confirming its use as a chronostratigraphic tool for this time span. Periods of rapid increase in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratio of seawater are correlated with important changes in tectonic and <b>climatic</b> conditions. <b>Experiments</b> showed that bulk carbonate sediment samples have differing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios from those of planktonic and benthic foraminifers from the same depth...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic eruptions affect peatlands {{around the}} world, {{depositing}} volcanic ash (tephra) {{and a variety}} of chemicals including compounds of sulphur. These volcanic impacts may be important for many reasons, in particular sulphur deposition has been shown to suppress peatland methane flux, potentially reinforcing <b>climatic</b> cooling. <b>Experiments</b> have shown that sulphur deposition also forces changes in testate amoeba communities, potentially relating to the reduced methane flux. Large volcanic eruptions in regions with extensive peatlands are relatively rare so it is difficult to assess the extent to which volcanic eruptions affect peatland microbial communities; palaeoecological analyses across tephra layers provide a means to resolve this uncertainty. In this study, testate amoebae were analysed across multiple monoliths from a peatland in southern Alaska containing two tephras, probably representing the 1883 eruption of Augustine Volcano and a 20 th Century eruption of Redoubt Volcano. Results showed relatively distinct and often statistically significant changes in testate amoeba community coincident with tephra layers which largely matched the response found in experimental studies of sulphur deposition. The results suggest volcanic impacts on peatland microbial communities which might relate to changes in methane flux...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{controversy}} exists {{surrounding the}} nature of the Antarctic ice sheet during the period of middle Pliocene warmth. This paper outlines the output from three sensitivity experiments for the middle Pliocene, using the UKMO GCM and the USGS PRISM 2 data set. Different East Antarctic ice sheet configurations were prescribed in each modelling experiment conforming to a dynamic (sea level 35 m higher than at present), intermediate (Pliocene ‘control’, sea level 25 m higher than at present) and stable (sea level 12 – 15 m higher than at present) scenario for {{the nature of}} the Antarctic ice sheet during the middle Pliocene. All three scenarios would have provided middle Pliocene sea levels across the spectrum of estimates provided by known geological data. Model outputs indicate that surface temperature increases are greatest in the Pliocene ‘dynamic’ <b>experiment.</b> <b>Climatic</b> conditions for the Pliocene ‘control’ and ‘stable’ experiments remain harsh over Antarctica with surface temperatures rising above freezing (mean + 4 °C) for a maximum of 2 months per year. In contrast, mean surface temperatures from the Pliocene ‘dynamic’ experiment rise above freezing (mean + 10 °C) for 4 months of the year. Climatic outputs from all of the Pliocene experiments were used in a biome model (BIOME 4). For the Pliocene ‘control’ and ‘stable’ experiments, BIOME 4 predicted the occurrence of exclusively tundra type vegetation on Antarctica. For the ‘dynamic’ <b>experiment,</b> <b>climatic</b> conditions ameliorated sufficiently to allow BIOME 4 to predict deciduous taiga montane forests on Antarctica. Thus the results from the ‘dynamic’ experiment are consistent with reported Pliocene Nothofagus occurrences on Antarctica. In the future, more sophisticated palaeoclimate modelling studies need to employ atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) coupled to dynamic ocean and ice sheet models. This will allow the GCM to predict rather than prescribe an Antarctic ice sheet configuration in equilibrium with reconstructed middle Pliocene sea surface temperatures. Such an approach may also shed light on how the Antarctic ice sheet responded to climate variability during the middle Pliocene...|$|R

Existing variation provides {{a window into the}} effects of climate on species and ecosystems, but in many places does not encompass the levels or timeframes of forcing expected under directional <b>climatic</b> change. <b>Experiments</b> help us to fill in these uncertainties, simulating directional shifts to examine outcomes of new levels and sustained changes in conditions. Here we explore the translation between short-term responses to climate variability and longer-term trajectories that emerge under directional climatic change. In a decade long experiment, we compare effects of short-term and long-term forcings across three trophic levels in grassland plots subjected to natural and experimental variation in precipitation. For some biological responses (plant productivity), responses to long-term extension of the rainy season were consistent with short-term responses, while for others (plant species richness, abundance of invertebrate herbivores and predators) there was pronounced divergence of long-term trajectories from short-term responses. These differences between biological responses mean that sustained directional changes in climate can restructure ecological relationships characterizing a system. Importantly, a positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity turned negative under one scenario of climate change, with a similar change in the relationship between plant productivity and consumer biomass. Inferences from experiments such as this form an important part of wider efforts to understand the complexities of climate change responses...|$|R

Changes in regulation were made based on experimental data obtained on a group of experimental individuals in a climatic chamber. One of the objectives of the <b>climatic</b> chamber <b>experiments</b> was to evaluate whether there was a possibility to use an alternative method, which utilizes a new value – stereotemperature, for the assessment. A group of 24 women was exposed to a non-uniform radiant-convective load in a climatic chamber for 1 hour during their computer work. Measurements were divided according to the globe temperature into 3 stages. The physical parameters of air were continuously measured: the air temperature, globe temperature, air velocity, radiant temperature, relative humidity, stereotemperature and physiological parameters. Thermal sensations of experimental subjects were expressed in the seven-point scale according to EN ISO 7730. The thermal sensation correlated very well with the difference of stereotemperature and the globe temperature. The stereotemperature correlated very well with the radiant temperature. In this work, the composed equations were used to develop the limit values for the thermal stress evaluation in the uniform and non-uniform thermal environment at workplaces.

Thirty open-pollinated families, randomly selected among the 58 families used in field progeny tests in Galicia, were cultivated for 30 weeks in a climatic chamber under controlled conditions. Two water regimes (high and low water supply) combined with two nutrient regimes (high and low nutrient supply) were applied by subirrigation. Several growth, branching and dry mass traits were assessed 30 weeks after sowing and compared with field performance (height, diameter and volume) of 4 -year-old progeny tests established at three different sites in Galicia (NW Spain). Both the irrigation and the fertilization treatments had a strong effect in all the assessed traits except irrigation {{for the number of}} branches. Heritabilities for growth and biomass traits were moderate to high (0. 13 – 0. 77) in individual treatments. However, when analyzing all treatments together, the impact of the family × treatment interactions led to a reduction (0. 20 – 0. 35) in the heritability estimates.

The <b>experiment</b> consisted of eight conditions: 1) Control, 2) Neck cooling scarf A with a cooling area of 68 cm 2, 3) Neck cooling scarf B (cooling area 154 cm 2), 4) Brimmed hat with a frozen gel pack, 5) Cooling vest (cooling area 606 cm 2), 6) Hat+Neck Scarf B, 7) Hat+Vest, and 8) Hat+Neck Scarf B+Vest. Twelve subjects worked a red pepper harvest simulated in a climatic chamber of WBGT 33 ˚C. The result showed that rectal temperature (T re) was effectively maintained under 38 ˚C by wearing PCE. Mean skin temperature (T¯ sk) and heart rate (HR) became more stable through wearing PCE. When wearing the ‘Hat+Scarf B+Vest’, particularly, T¯ sk and HR quickly decreased to the comfort level during the mid-rest stage. We confirmed that the vest with a cooling area of only 3. 3 % body surface area (BSA) was effective in alleviating heat strain in a simulated harvest work. Furthermore, the heat strain of farm workers can be considerably eliminated by the combination of the cooling vest, a scarf, and a brimmed hat, with the total cooling area of 4. 2 % BSA...|$|R
40|$|Cross-pollination, Natural and {{artificial}} self-pollination were performed {{in addition to}} open pollination in three Hungarian sour cherry cultivars (Erdi botermo, Erdi jubileum and Cigany meggy), planted under Mashhad, Iran <b>climatic</b> conditions. An <b>experiment</b> conducted using factorial based on randomized completely block design during 2005 and 2006, with 6 replications in 2005 and 4 replications in 2006. Flowers before anthesis and in balloon stages were isolated with paper bags from guest pollens and pollinated in appropriate time. Arc-sinus transformation was carried out on the data of final fruit set percentages obtained from cross pollination, open pollination, natural {{and artificial}} self pollination. The averages of final fruit set showed the advantage of open pollination (14. 6 %) in compare with natural self pollination (4. 4 %) and artificial self pollination (13. 0 %). Siah mashhad sweet cherry cultivar with more than 70 % overlap of flowering and 9. 8 % fruit set in 2005 and 17. 9 % in 2006 was the best among applied pollen donors for Erdi botermo sour cherry cultivar. Also, Siah mashhad with more than 50 % overlap of flowering time and 25. 8 % fruit set was the best polliniser for Cigany meggy sour cherry. Among the pollinisers, Siah mashhad was the best for Erdi jubileum with more than 50 % overlap and 15. 2 % fruit set...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} texture features for the classification of flower images. A flower image is segmented by eliminating the background using a threshold-based method. The texture features, namely the color texture moments, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and Gabor responses, are extracted, and combinations of these three are considered in the classification of flowers. In this work, a probabilistic neural network {{is used as a}} classifier. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed method, an experiment was conducted on our own data set of 35 classes of flowers, each with 50 samples. The data set has different flower species with similar appearance (small inter-class variations) across different classes and varying appearance (large intra-class variations) within a class. Also, the images of flowers are of different pose, with cluttered background under various lighting conditions and <b>climatic</b> conditions. The <b>experiment</b> was conducted for various sizes of the datasets, to study the effect of classification accuracy, and the results show that the combination of multiple features vastly improves the performance, from 35 % for the best single feature to 79 % for the combination of all features. A qualitative comparative analysis of the proposed method with other well-known existing state of the art flower classification methods is also given in this paper to highlight the superiority of the proposed method.

40|$|Similarly {{like today}} the animal {{behaviour}} {{has been a}} major concern for humans during the do-mestication process for many centuries. Research in animal behaviour has then begun to be focused on the main areas to improve the level of animal productivity. Animal behaviour can be studied systematically under the definition of nine main animal behaviour patterns (Craig, 1981). Within these patterns aggressiveness can be defined as running away and conflicts within animal groups (Lehner, 1996). The results from different studies imply that the grouping of animals especially in feedlots is a problem both when considering performance and production economics. Increased knowledge of grouping and social integration would make it possible to develop effective management tech-niques that would reduce the amount of problems such as aggressive behaviour occurring during the social integration of cattle (Bøe and Færevik, 2003). However there is not much information on the re-lationship between aggression and high-energy feeding level. Therefore, this experiment was designed to bring about an understanding of the relative role of high-energy feeding level on the possible occurrence of aggressive behaviour. MATERIAL AND METHODS Experimental location and <b>climatic</b> conditions The <b>experiment</b> was conducted at the University College Farm, Aber, Gwynedd, UK, (north latitude 53. 2, west longitude 4. 0, altitude 15 m).

40|$|The study aims at {{analyzing}} {{the performance of}} Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in residential housing for different climates. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experiment performed in the Concordia University Solar Simulator and Environmental Chamber research facility (SSEC, Montreal, Canada). PCM boards were embedded on the back wall of a test hut placed in the <b>climatic</b> chamber. Several <b>experiments</b> were performed to explore the potential for verification of the proposed analysis and to produce enough data to perform model calibrations. Results show a strong increase in the apparent thermal inertia of the room allowing for a reduction in daily temperature fluctuations in the test hut. Simulations were carried out by means of a calibrated EnergyPlus model to broaden the analysis in both a cold Canadian climate and in a Mediterranean temperate climate. Other configurations for the setup environment were studied to simulate the issues of very hot summers in Mediterranean climate. The different configurations ended up with mixed results for the two locations analyzed: the maximization of the solar gains and its storage in a high density multiple layer PCM wall is the better configuration for the cold climate analyzed, while its performance is non optimal for hot climates where the “emulation” of high thermal mass walls by PCM in lightweight structures requires a different positioning of the PCM panels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Five Romanian {{sweet corn}} hybrids (Prima, Dulcin, Estival, Deliciul verii and T 145) {{were tested in}} three years (2008 - 2010) in three {{locations}} of Central Transylvania with obviously different soil and <b>climatic</b> conditions. The <b>experiments</b> were organized in a split-plot design in which, on a general level of organic fertilization (40 t/ha manure), four levels of mineral N fertilization were applied: N 0, N 50, N 100 and N 150. Ear yield (with and without husk) was registered each year and location and a superiority index (Pi) was computed according to the procedure suggested by Lin and Binns (1988). The shares of G and G x E effects in {{the total value of}} Pi were also computed and thus the tested hybrids were classified {{on the basis of their}} yield stability expressed by P i index, ear yield level and the prevalence of G or G x E effects in the total value of Pi. Quite expectedly, the highest ear yields were recorded in all tested hybrids, when N 100 and N 150 were applied. Fertilization with N 50 had no significant effects on ear yield in either hybrid. Prima cv. reacted very poorly to increasing rates on mineral N, most probably due to its earliness. Dulcin and Estival were classified as most stable and high yielding hybrids in all experimental environments while Prima showed the lowest stability of its rather poor ear yield...|$|R
40|$|Eighty-six mixed-parity Large White sows {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of diets with reduced CP content or supplemented with essential AA on 28 -d lactation performance under humid tropical <b>climatic</b> conditions. This <b>experiment</b> was conducted in Guadeloupe (West French Indies, latitude 16 °N, longitude 61 °W) between February 2007 and January 2008. Two seasons were distinguished a posteriori from climatic measurement variables continuously recorded in the farrowing room. The average minimum and maximum ambient temperatures and average daily relative humidity for the warm season were 20. 5 and 28. 2 °C, and 93. 8 %, respectively. The corresponding values for the hot season were 22. 7 and 29. 4 °C, and 93. 7 %, respectively. The dietary experimental treatments were a normal protein diet (NP), a low protein diet (LP), and a NP diet (NP+) supplemented with essential AA. The NP and LP diets supplied the same levels of standardized digestible Lys (i. e., 0. 80 g/MJ of NE), and the NP+ diet supplied 0. 95 g/MJ of NE. No interaction between season and diet composition was noted on any response variable evaluated. The ADFI was decreased (P 0. 08). In conclusion, the hot season in humid tropical climates, which combines high levels of temperature and humidity, has a pronounced negative impact on performance of lactating sows. Diets with low CP content or supplemented with essential AA can attenuate the effects of hot and humid season by increasing ADFI in lactating sows...|$|R
40|$|Yield {{stability}} in sweet corn and {{its dependence on}} G x E interaction were investigated {{in a series of}} two way experiments. Five Romanian sweet corn hybrids were tested in three years (2008 - 2010) in three locations of Central Transylvania in different soils and <b>climatic</b> conditions. The <b>experiments</b> were organized in a split plot design in which, on a general level of organic fertilization (40 t/ha manure), four levels of mineral N fertilization were applied (kg/ha, active matter) : N 0, typical for organic technologies; N 50, corresponding to the low-input (sustainable) system; N 100 and N 150 customary with conventional system of agriculture. Based on ear yield data registered for hybrids in locations x years x cropping system, a phenotypic index (Pi) was computed for each sweet corn hybrid illustrating the stability of their cob yields, with and without husks. The share of genotypic and G x E effects in the total value of Pi have been estimated. In different agricultural systems the tested hybrids were classified differently based on their Pi values. It is concluded that, {{at least for the time}} being, the initiation of an organic breeding program for sweet corn, in Romania, is not economically justified since all semiearly and semilate tested hybrids yielded satisfactorily under organic agricultural practices. Moreover, among the recently released sweet corn hybrids one can find certain genotypes highly suitable to organic (i. e. ‘Deliciul verii’, ‘Estival’) or low input (‘Dulcin’, ‘Estival’) agricultural practices. These three hybrids recorded the highes ear yields (with and without husks) over years, locations and agricultural systems...|$|R
