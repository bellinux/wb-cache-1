40|$|<b>Connected</b> <b>Consumer</b> Electronics (CE) devices face an {{exponential}} growth in storage, processing capabilities and connectivity bandwidth. This increased complexity calls for new software architectures that naturally admit self-organization, resource management for efficient workload distribution, and a transparent cooperation of connected CE-terminals. The interconnected nature makes advanced applications feasible such as the smart distribution of complex multimedia content analysis algorithms, resulting in automatic semantic content-awareness creation. In this paper we describe a modular, self-aware, self-organizing, real-time and distributed multimedia content analysis system.

40|$|Pervasive {{multimedia}} devices require accurate video retar-geting, {{especially in}} <b>connected</b> <b>consumer</b> electronics plat-forms. In this paper, {{we present a}} context assisted spatial-temporal grid scheme for consumer video retargeting. First, we parse consumer videos from low-level features to high-level visual concepts, combining visual attention into a more accurate importance description. Then, a semantic impor-tance map is built up representing the spatial importance and temporal continuity, which is incorporated with a 3 D rectilinear grid scaleplate to map frames to the target dis-play, thereby keeping the aspect ratio of semantically salient objects {{as well as the}} perceptual coherency. Extensive eval-uations were done on two popular video genres, sports and advertisements. The comparison with state-of-the-art ap-proaches on both images and videos have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Visible Light Communication (VLC) with Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) as {{transmitters}} and receivers enables low bi-trate wireless adhoc networking. LED-to-LED VLC adhoc networks with VLC devices {{communicating with}} each other over free-space optical links typically achieve a throughput of less than a megabit per second at distances {{of no more than}} a few meters. LED-to-LED VLC adhoc networks are useful for combining a smart illumination with low-cost net-working. We present and evaluate a software-based VLC physical layer and a VLC medium access control layer that retain the simplicity of the LED-to-LED approach. The de-sign satisfies the requirement that LEDs should always be perceived as on with constant brightness. In each VLC de-vice, in addition to an LED, only a low-cost microcontroller is required for handling the software-based communication protocol. The results of our performance measurements con-firm recent claims about the potential of LED-to-LED VLC adhoc networks as a useful technology for sensor networks, smart and <b>connected</b> <b>consumer</b> devices, and the Internet-of...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is {{considered}} as {{the de facto}} standard for information processing and exchange on the Internet and in the enterprise services domain. It is widely regarded that XML {{has the potential of}} being an interoperable standard for interactive applications in the next generation <b>connected</b> <b>Consumer</b> Electronic devices. A key industry concern in using XML in CE devices is that how basic security requirements pertaining to the above said domain can be met. Notably, the standardization bodies of the Internet domain such as W 3 C and OASIS have defined specifications for cryptography-based security solutions using XML technology that is mainly aimed for web applications. This paper investigates and presents various scenarios where XML Security can be applied to markup based interactive applications {{in the context of a}} next generation Consumer Electronic Optical Disc Player. We conclude the paper by presenting a prototype establishing how these scenarios could be realized in practice. ...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{technologies}} pervade {{the higher}} education landscape {{as a way to}} build student engagement and enhance student learning and teaching. In practice, however, the ways in which these tools are implemented in marketing education appear to be ad hoc, rather than using a systematic approach to build engagement and provide students with the skill sets needed for 21 st-century employment (including meta-skills, e. g., communication skills, critical thinking, technical skills in analytics, and understanding of <b>connected</b> <b>consumer</b> behavior). The research to date has built on the educator–student dyad. This article argues that an industry practitioner perspective also adds insight into how digital technology can rationally and purposefully be integrated into the marketing classroom. Using exploratory depth interviews with undergraduate students, educators, and industry practitioners, this article seeks to explore the emerging pedagogical challenges of representing these tripartite views in marketing module development and to provide recommendations for higher education institutions as to how best to do so...|$|E
40|$|In the European Union {{the power}} {{generation}} from wind and photovoltaic, a very unpredictable and fluctuating energy source, has increased significantly {{over the last}} years. With a lack of storage capacity for power in the national grids, energy balance demand rises from year to year. As a matter of research Fraunhofer UMSICHT is exploring a concept of implementing high temperature storages (HTES), for example pebble bed storages (so-called Pebble-Heater), in biomass power plants for high temperature heat storage. In times of low energy demand {{a fraction of the}} flue gas is diverted and used in a HTES to buffer thermal energy on a high temperature level. In times of high energy use, the power plant operates in condensation mode and with the stored energy the heat supply of the <b>connected</b> <b>consumer</b> can be maintained, e. g. for supply of process heat or district heating systems. The decoupling of heat and power generation leads to more flexibility in the operation of the power plants...|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{have become}} always on and {{constantly}} connected. Search costs have plummeted, individuals’ abilities to digitally express {{themselves and their}} opinions increased, and the opportunities for superior business and market intelligence for companies have skyrocketed. This {{has given rise to}} more, richer, and new sources of consumer data that marketers can leverage, and has fueled the data-driven insights revolution in marketing. But there is more to come very soon. In marketing, we are quickly moving from the age of the <b>connected</b> <b>consumer</b> to the age of the augmented consumer. New technologies like wearable devices, smart sensors, consumer IoT devices, smart homes, and, critically, artificial intelligence ecosystems will not only connect, but will substantially and meaningfully augment the consumer in terms of their thoughts and behaviors. The biggest challenge for marketers will lie in how they approach marketing to this new type of consumer, particularly personal artificial intelligence ecosystems. This means marketing to algorithms, instead of people, and that is very different to how most marketing work is currently done...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the recommendation functionality inside a <b>connected</b> <b>consumer</b> electronics product in prototype stage. This evaluation is supported by a framework to access and analyze data about product usage and user experience. The strengths of this framework lie in the collection of both objective data (i. e., 2 ̆ 2 What is the user doing with the product? 2 ̆ 2) and subjective data (i. e., 2 ̆ 2 How is the user experiencing the product? 2 ̆ 2), which are linked together and analyzed in a combined way. The analysis of objective data provides insights into how the system is actually used in the field. Combined with the subjective data, personal opinions and evaluative judgments on the product quality can be then related to actual user behavior. In order to collect these data in a most natural context, remote data collection allows for extensive user testing within habitual environments. We have applied our framework to the case of an interactive TV recommender system application to illustrate that the user experience of recommender systems can be evaluated in real-life usage scenarios...|$|E
