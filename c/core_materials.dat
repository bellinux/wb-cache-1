Construction of the dams utilized nearby materials, and was one of the largest earthworks projects in the United States. Excavation of <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> for the dams resulted in many paleontological finds, all of which are displayed at the Western Science Center at the lake's East end. The lake is open to boating and fishing, along with hiking and other recreational activities around the lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E

Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as greenfield status. After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> are dismantled and {{cut into small pieces}} to be packed in containers for interim storage or transmutation experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive, but {{it has the potential to}} be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E

An adhesive is provided between the <b>core</b> <b>material</b> and the face sheets and the combined thickness of the <b>core</b> <b>material</b> and adhesive is a close fit within the opposed face sheets. A gas tight seal, such as an O-ring gasket, is provided between the frame and the face sheet members to form a gas tight cavity between the face sheet members and the frame.

The process containment vessel or crucible is heated so that only a portion of the coating material becomes molten, leaving a solid portion of material as the entrance port of, and seal around, the <b>core</b> <b>material.</b> The crucible can contain molten and solid metals and is especially useful when coating <b>core</b> <b>material</b> with reactive metals. The source block of coating material has been machined to include a close tolerance hole of a size and shape to closely fit the <b>core</b> <b>material.</b> The <b>core</b> <b>material</b> moves first through the solid portion of the source block of coating material where the close tolerance hole has been machined, then through a solid/molten interface, and finally through the molten phase where the diameter of the <b>core</b> <b>material</b> is increased.

25|$|Timpani are {{typically}} struck {{with a special}} type of drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head.

The head can be constructed {{from a number of}} different materials, though felt wrapped around a wooden core is the most common. Other <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> include compressed felt, cork, and leather, and other wrap materials include chamois. Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common. Wooden sticks are used as a special effect—specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era—and in authentic performances of Baroque music.|$|E
25|$|Zirconium from zircaloy, {{together}} with other metals, reacts with water and produces zirconium dioxide and hydrogen. The production of hydrogen is a major danger in reactor accidents. The balance between oxidizing and reducing chemical environments {{and the proportion of}} water and hydrogen influences the formation of chemical compounds. Variations in the volatility of <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> influence the ratio of released elements to unreleased elements. For instance, in an inert atmosphere, the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods releases almost only cadmium. In the presence of water, the indium forms volatile indium(I) oxide and indium(I) hydroxide, which can evaporate and form an aerosol of indium(III) oxide. The indium oxidation is inhibited by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, resulting in lower indium releases. Caesium and iodine from the fission products that can react to produce volatile caesium iodide, which condenses as an aerosol.|$|E

40|$|Herein we {{demonstrate}} how the volatdity of a Liquid {{can be manipulated}} by enclosing microdroplets of the Liquid into thin polymeric sheds. In this way, composite core-shed microparticles consisting of 80 wt% of a Liquid <b>core</b> <b>material</b> and 20 wt% of a polymer can be made 150 degrees C more stable than the individual core component.
