30|$|In general, the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> is not independent. Indeed, {{when the}} traffic load is high, {{whenever}} a SU is interrupted {{due to the}} arrival of a PU, it is highly probable that the next arrival of a PU also causes the interruption of another secondary session because resource occupancy conditions at the different time instants (primary arrival epochs) are not independent. Conversely, in a low traffic load scenario, if the arrival of a PU does not cause an interruption of a SU, {{it is unlikely that the}} arrival of another PU in the same conditions causes a SU interruption. Hence, a certain degree of correlation between the <b>interruption</b> <b>probabilities</b> is present, and therefore, the secondary users’ call interruption process actually is not a Poissonian one.|$|R

The RAU selection is used to provide high quality received signals for trains moving in DAS cells and the two HST antennas are employed on trains to realize seamless handover.

30|$|Several {{interesting}} observations can {{be extracted}} from Figs.  5, 6, and 7. For instance, from Fig.  5, {{it is observed}} that, when CDT and UST are modeled by the (unrealistic) exponential distribution and for any value of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability,</b> the corresponding mean, CoV, and Sk of both CHTn and CHTh have the same value (this scenario {{is represented by the}} solid-red and dashed-red lines in Fig.  5). This is an expected behavior that validates our mathematical formulation and can be explained as follows. Due to the memory-less property of the exponential distribution, when CDT (UST) is exponentially distributed, the residual CDT (residual UST) is also exponentially distributed with the same parameter [12]. Thus, the random variables that represent CHTn and CHTh (whose probability distributions are given by Eqs. (12) and (35), respectively) are also exponentially distributed with the same expected value, and therefore, the CoV and Sk are, respectively, 1 and 2 for both CHTn and CHTh. Also, from Figs.  5 a, 6 a, and 7 a, it is observed that the mean value of both CHTn and CHTh is a monotonically decreasing function of the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability.</b> It is an intuitively understandable behavior {{due to the fact that}} as the <b>probability</b> of <b>interruption</b> increases, more ongoing secondary calls are prematurely terminated in detrimental of the mean value of both CHTn and CHTh.|$|R

30|$|Now let us {{study the}} impact of the {{variability}} of both UST and CDT on CHT statistics. To this end, it is important to notice that the CoV of the Erlang, exponential, and hyper-exponential/hyper-Erlang distributions are, respectively, smaller than 1, equal to 1, and larger than 1. Thus, the variability of UST increases as its probability distribution moves from the Erlang to the exponential and from the exponential to the hyper-exponential/hyper-Erlang. The same observation applies for the CDT. Considering this fact, the following observation can be extracted from Figs.  5, 6, and 7. Figures  5, 6, and 7 show that, in general terms, as the variability of the UST (CDT) increases (decreases), the mean value of the CHTn decreases {{and at the same time}} the mean value of the CHTh increases. This behavior can be explained as follows. First, note that as the CoV of UST (CDT) increases, the variability of UST (CDT) increases; that is, the values of UST (CDT) spread out over a larger range with respect to its mean value. Consequently, the service time (cell residence time) of calls that end their service in the cell where they were originated is, in general, considerable smaller (greater) than the mean UST (CDT), resulting in a diminution (increase) on the mean value of the CHTn. On the other hand, the service time (cell residence time) of calls that are handed off to another cell is, in general, considerably greater (lower) than the mean UST (CDT), resulting in an augment (diminution) on the mean value of the CHTh. The combined effects of these facts lead us to the behavior explained above and observed in Figs.  5, 6, and 7. Many others interesting observations can be extracted from Figs.  5, 6, and 7; however, the most important ones are summarized as follows. The mean values of both CHTn and CHTh are strongly sensitive to the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability.</b> For instance, when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed and the CDT is exponential distributed (notice that this scenario corresponds to the green lines of Fig.  5 a), the mean value of CHTn (CHTh) decreases from 77.35 to 53.057  s (101 to 55.4  s) as the <b>interruption</b> <b>probability</b> goes from 0.001 to 0.1. Similar behaviors are observed when the CDT is modeled by either an Erlang or a hyper-exponential distribution. Also, from Figs.  5, 6, and 7, it is evident that the first three moments of both CHTn and CHTh are highly sensitive to the probability distribution of both CDT and UST. Thus, selecting a suitable model that effectively captures the realistic statistics of both CDT and UST is of paramount importance when analyzing the performance of mobile cognitive radio cellular networks.|$|R

From the observed fact that bipolar current loops do exist in quasi-equilibrium in the solar corona, a class of equilibria is deduced. It is shown that these configurations cannot be force-free. A simple model current loop is used to illustrate this mechanism. It is found that some equilibrium loops are unstable to major radius perturbations, resulting in expansion of the loops. The condition for instability is given in terms of a circuit parameter f. A critical current Ic, o 1011 A is found to exist such that a current loop with I>> Cr can attain high supersonic velocities producing strong shocks while a current loop with I < I,. expands at slower subsonic velocities. As the loop expands, the J X B force converts the magnetic energy into thermal and particle kinetic energy in the regions immediately outside the loop. The time scale of the energy release is found to be tens of minutes for the supersonic case, corresponding to solar flares, and much longer for the subsonic case, corresponding to corona heating...|$|R

Referring to the CoV {skewness} of the CHTn, Figs.  5 b, c, 6 b, c, and 7 b, c show important differences between the case when the UST is hyper-exponential and the case when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed (differences up to 12.75 and 15.20 % are observed for the CoV and Sk, respectively). Similar results are obtained when the CHTh is considered. Due {{to the fact that}} both distributions (i.e., hyper-exponential and hyper-Erlang) for modeling the UST have the same first three standardized moments, we conclude that the (not negligible) quantitative difference among the mean value, CoV, and Sk of both CHTn and CHTh when the UST is hyper-exponentially distributed compared to the case when the UST is hyper-Erlang distributed is due to moments higher than the third one. Analyzing the impact of moments of UST (and CDT) higher than the third one on channel holding time statistics represents a topic of our current research.|$|R
