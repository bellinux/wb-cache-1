5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon <b>crayfish</b> (73% of scats had <b>crayfish</b> remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, <b>crayfish</b> will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the <b>crayfish</b> have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E
5|$|In the Tosco-Emilian Apennines, P.fluviatile is {{only found}} {{south of the}} watershed, in {{contrast}} with the <b>crayfish</b> Austropotamobius pallipes, which occurs on both sides on the mountains. Although their ranges overlap, the two species do not inhabit the same water courses, apparently because the crab outcompetes the <b>crayfish,</b> which is therefore forced to live in less favourable locations where the crab cannot survive. Non-indigenous <b>crayfish</b> may pose a greater threat to P.fluviatile than native <b>crayfish,</b> although the greatest threats remain pollution, overfishing and the draining of wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Otters {{may prefer}} {{to feed on}} crustaceans, {{especially}} <b>crayfish</b> (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) more than fish where they are locally and seasonally plentiful. In Georgia, <b>crayfish</b> accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, <b>crayfish</b> made up one-third of the otter's diet. A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between <b>crayfish</b> consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{freshwater}} <b>crayfishes</b> {{are distributed}} across {{all but the}} Indian and Antarctic continents with centers of diversity in the southeastern Appalachian Mountains in the Northern Hemisphere and in south– east Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. There are currently over 640 described species of freshwater <b>crayfishes</b> {{with an average of}} 5 – 10 species still being described each year. Freshwater <b>crayfishes</b> can serve as keystone species in aquatic habitats, but a few species are also significantly invasive and can cause impressive damage to the fragile freshwater habitat. <b>Crayfishes</b> inhabit caves, burrows, streams, lakes and strong burrowers can even be found in terrestrial habitats where they have burrowed to the water table or where rainfall is sufficiently abundant to provide the needed moisture. The freshwater <b>crayfishes,</b> like the habitats in which they are encountered, are generally endangered to some degree and conservation efforts would do well to focus on them as key elements of the freshwater ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|The first {{reference}} to Ohio <b>crayfishes</b> of which I am aware {{was made by}} Girard (1852 : 88). Other references followed until by 1870 Hagen was able to include in his monograph several records from southeastern and central Ohio. About 1880 Faxon collected material from the Little Miami River {{during his visit to}} Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio. Near the turn of the century, Osburn and Williamson (1898 : 21) and Williamson (1899 : 47 - 48) collected <b>crayfishes</b> in many Ohio localities, and in recording their collections laid the foundation of the study of Ohio <b>crayfishes.</b> During 1920 - 1921 the Ohio Survey Party collected widely in Ohio and from the collections Turner (1926) published a well annotated •list of thirteen species and subspecies. This is the most complete publication on Ohio <b>crayfishes</b> to date. The present paper is intended as a supplement to Turner's work. In it are described a new subspecies from Ohio, Cambarus bartoni sciotensis; a species and a subspecies are added to the state list; and the distribution of several other species more clearly defined through the addition of about fifteen hundred new records. In this paper only the counties from which Turner has not recorded a species are given. The total number of <b>crayfishes</b> now known to occur in Ohio is seventeen...|$|R

5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat <b>crayfish</b> and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as {{abundance}} {{and types of}} prey depend on the both region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly <b>crayfish.</b> In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of <b>crayfish,</b> while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that <b>crayfish</b> make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although <b>crayfish</b> are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, fish are more agile than <b>crayfish</b> and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch <b>crayfish,</b> than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E

It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as <b>crayfish,</b> gurnard, weever, John Dory, monkfish, conger eel, whiting, sea bass, and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.|$|E

40|$|Branchiobdellids {{are found}} as epizoites on {{crustaceans}} of the orders Isopoda and Decapoda (cambarine <b>crayfishes)</b> in caves of eastern North America. Species {{that may be}} considered as troglobites, since they are not known from epigean waters, appear to be confirmed to truly troglobitic isopods and possibly a few troglobitic <b>crayfishes</b> from Florida and the Tennessee-Kentucky Highland Rim cave belt. The majority of the records of branchiobdellids from caves are of representatives of common epigean forms epizootic un <b>crayfishes.</b> Cross-referenced lists of branchiobdellids, their hosts and cave localities are presented. Some of the new species described are apparently troglobitic or troglophilic, but they present no consistent phylogenetic or geographical pattern and separate origins for them from primitive stocks of the genus Cambarincola are postulated...|$|R

5|$|Clatworthy Reservoir is an {{important}} wildlife habitat managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and its tributaries support populations of European water vole (Arvicola amphibius). There may also be populations of white-clawed <b>crayfish</b> (Austropotamobius pallipes) and northern crested newts (Triturus cristatus). The fish species in the river include: chub, carp, grayling, roach, tench, rudd, perch and pike.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (<b>crayfish),</b> where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated <b>crayfish</b> formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial <b>crayfish).</b> They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crayfishes</b> {{exposed to}} 14 C-naphthalene- 5 % of an aqueous {{fraction}} {{of crude oil}} in open non-aerated glass jars for 4 h at 25 0 C showed no significant differences (P > 0. 25) {{in the amount of}} naphthalene uptake. Different parts of the <b>crayfishes</b> were quantified for naphthalene uptake and cephalothorax containing hepatopancreas (a food absorption organ) was found to have greater uptake than the tail flesh or tail skeleton. Release of the oil from the <b>crayfishes</b> that were exposed for 1, 2, 3 or 4 h and later placed in open non-aerated jars containing oil-free water showed greater loss of most of the 14 C activity during the first 24 h, there was little losses at 48, 72 and 96 h.

5|$|North American river otters, {{like most}} predators, prey upon the most readily {{accessible}} species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, {{but they also}} consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and <b>crayfish.</b> The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{voracious}} {{adults have}} very broad diets, including insects such as crickets, larvae, mosquito wrigglers, dragonflies, earthworms, cockroaches, flies, and grasshoppers. They are also known to eat freshwater <b>crayfish</b> and slugs, and other frogs, {{even of the}} same species. They have a strong tendency for cannibalism, and frequently these in the same enclosure devour each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown cannibalism also occurs in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Their diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} small aquatic prey, such as insects and small fishes. <b>Crayfish</b> are its preferred food in most regions, {{but it can}} adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance.
