40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{introducing}} falling friction coefficients into curving simulations for studying curve squeal noise is presented. Generation of squeal {{at the wheel of}} a railway vehicle in a curve is caused by unstable vibration, caused in turn by a lateral wheel/rail force which reduces with increasing lateral creepage. To model vehicle curve squeal, the wheel/rail tangential force in the curving simulation is calculated by a modified version of FASTSIM, which uses a sliding velocity-dependent friction characteristic. Using the falling friction characteristics, a UK passenger vehicle is modelled with SIMPACK. Curving behaviour is simulated for a range of curve radii and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> The wheel/rail contact properties are then obtained to study the possibility of the occurrence of squeal using a frequency-domain method. The methodology in this paper allows various curves, wheel/rail profiles, vehicle speeds and friction characteristics to be taken into account...|$|R
5000|$|For {{reasons that}} will be {{mentioned}} below, passenger vehicles usually traverse a curve at a speed higher than the balance speed. The amount by which the actual speed exceeds the balance speed is conveniently expressed via the so-called <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> i.e., by the amount by which the superelevation {{would need to be}} increased to raise the balance speed to the speed at which the vehicles actually travel. Letting gaugese denote the rail gauge from low rail gauge side corner to high rail field side corner, letting super_el denote the actual superelevation, and letting Vact denote the actual speed, it follows from the definition that the <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> CD, is given by the formula ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1941-41 the Pacific Railway Equipment Company built three {{experimental}} pendulum-suspension [...] "chair" [...] cars (coach), {{which saw}} {{service on the}} San Diegan, among others. Mounted on high springs, the car tilted inwards on curves to counterbalance the <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> with the induced centrifugal force.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "cant deficiency" [...] {{is defined}} {{in the context of}} travel of a rail vehicle at {{constant}} speed on a constant radius curve. Cant itself is a British synonym for the superelevation of the curve, that is, the elevation of the outside rail minus the elevation of the inside rail. <b>Cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> is present when a vehicle's speed on a curve is greater than the speed at which the components of wheel to rail force are normal to the plane of the track. In that case, the resultant force (aggregated force of gravitational force and centrifugal force) exerts the outside rail more than the inside rails, in which it creates lateral acceleration toward outside of the curve. In order to reduce <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> the speed can be reduced or the superelevation can be increased. The amount of <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> is expressed in term of required superelevation to be added in order to bring the resultant force into balance between the two rails. In the contrary, it is said to be [...] "cant excess" [...] if the resultant force exerts more against the inside rail than the outside rail, for instance, a high superelevation curve with a train traveling at a low speed.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{maximum speed}} {{is subject to}} {{specific}} rules. When filling in , [...] and the conversion factors for US customary units, the maximum speed of a train on curved track for a given <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> or unbalanced superelevation {{is determined by the}} following formula: ...|$|E
50|$|If the {{superelevation}} determined for {{a dedicated}} passenger route curve on regulatory and safety bases is below 6 in {{it may be}} desirable to increase the superelevation and reduced the <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency.</b> However, if on such a curve some trains regularly travel at low speeds, then raising the superelevation may be inadvisable for passenger comfort reasons.|$|E
50|$|Track {{unbalanced}} superelevation (<b>cant</b> <b>deficiency)</b> in the United States {{is restricted}} to 75 mm, though 102 mm is permissible by waiver. The maximum value for European railways varies by country, {{some of which have}} curves with over 280 mm of unbalanced superelevation to permit high-speed transportation. The highest values are only for tilting trains, because it would be too uncomfortable for passengers in conventional train cars.|$|E
50|$|In {{a shared}} track {{configuration}} for trains with different operating speeds such as freight and higher-speed rail passenger services, the cant on a curve {{should be considered}} for both high and low speeds. The higher-speed trains would experience <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> and the lower-speed trains would experience cant excess. These parameters {{have a significant effect}} on curve performance which includes safety, passenger comfort, and wear and tear of equipment and rails.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 June 1931. Locomotive No 10, then still named Doctor Syn (the {{exchange}} of names with locomotive No 9 {{did not take}} place until later in the year), broke away from its tender, leaving its train near the Coastguard Cottages at Lade. The locomotive continued alone towards Dungeness where the combination of speed, curvature and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> caused it to derail on the loop and fall on its side. The locomotive was just over two weeks old at the time ...|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{trains are}} not running on {{equilibrium}} cants at curves. The situation is called unbalance, {{which can be}} {{in one of the}} two following ways. For a given speed, if the actual cant is less than the equilibrium cant, the amount of cant difference is called <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency.</b> In the other word, it is the amount of missing cant to achieve the balance. On the contrary, for a given speed, if the actual cant is higher than the equilibrium cant, the amount of over cant from the balance is called cant excess.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> is {{generally}} looked at {{with respect to}} ideal track geometry. As geometry of real track is never perfect it may be desirable to supplement the static considerations laid out above with simulations of vehicle motion over measured geometries of actual tracks. Simulations are also desirable for understanding vehicle behaviour traversing spirals, turnouts, and other track segments where curvature changes with distance by design. Where simulations or measurements show non-ideal behaviour traversing traditional linear spirals, results can be improved by using advanced spirals. Good track geometry including advanced spirals is likely to foster passenger acceptance of higher CD values.|$|E
50|$|Allowed CD is set {{below the}} value that would be allowed based on safety {{in order to reduce}} wheel and rail wear and to reduce the rate of {{degradation}} of geometry of ballasted track. Choice of design CD will be less constrained by passenger comfort in the case of vehicles that have tilting capability. One historical approach to determining safe <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> was the requirement that the projection to the plane of the track of the resultant of the centrifugal and gravitational forces acting on a vehicle fall within the middle third of the track gauge. Contemporary engineering studies would likely use vehicle motion simulation including cross wind conditions to determine margins relative to derailment and rollover.|$|E
50|$|One {{solution}} to this problem is to tilt the rails into the turns, an effect known as superelevation. This has the effect of making the lateral forces more inline with the floor, reducing sideways forces. The problem is that this approach only matches the forces perfectly at a single speed; traffic moving slower than the design speed would feel as if it is tipping over into the inside of the turn, while those moving faster than the design speed would still feel leftover centrifugal force. Long experience had shown that the maximum amount of cant applied to lines with mixed traffic was 6.5 degrees, which would be effective at speeds into the 100 mph range, but began to demonstrate <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> at speeds above 125 mph.|$|E
5000|$|For {{passenger}} traffic superelevations and authorized speeds {{can be set}} so that trains run with as much <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> as is allowed, based on safety, on relevant regulations and on passenger comfort. As of 2007 the US Federal Railroad Administration regulations limit CD to 7 in for tilting passenger vehicles, 3 in for conventional vehicles. [...] This FRA regulation is based on AAR standards based on a single study in the 1950s on a rail line in Connecticut. [...] In Germany, where axle loads are typically lower {{than those in the}} USA, tilting trains are allowed to operate with 12 in CD in some cases. CD above 6 in can be considered too uncomfortable for passengers (e.g. things on tables might slide off), except for tilting trains.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between speed and tilt {{can be calculated}} mathematically. We start with the formula for a balancing centripetal force: θ is the angle by which the train is tilted due to the cant, r is the curve radius in meters, v is the speed in meters per second, and g is the standard gravity, approximately equal to 9.80665 m/s²:Rearranging for r gives:Geometrically, tan θ can be expressed (approximately, for small angles) {{in terms of the}} track gauge G, the cant ha and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> hb, all in millimeters:This approximation for tan θ gives:This table shows examples of curve radii. The values used when building high-speed railways vary, and depend on desired wear and safety levels.Tramways typically do not exhibit cant, due to the low speeds involved.|$|E
5000|$|One {{solution}} is to place speed restrictions on curved sections of track; another is to bank the railbed on the curve, with the outer rail higher than the inner rail so the net force passes straight through {{the floor of the}} coach. Banking the track is known as [...] "cant" [...] or superelevation. These measures were gradually adopted on the railways between 1835 and 1860. The use of track cant can only be applied where the speed of the train is fixed in advance. Slower, or stationary, traffic sharing the same line will experience forces pulling inwards, and, conversely, faster traffic will still experience forces pulling outwards. Long experience has shown that, to avoid discomfort on slower trains, track cant should not exceed 6°; and, for trains moving more quickly, <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> should not exceed 4.5°.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s in the Soviet Union curve {{resistance}} {{was found by}} experiment [...] to be highly dependent on both the velocity and the banking of the curve, also known as superelevation or cant, as can bee seen in the graph above. If a train car rounds a curve at balancing speed such that the component of centrifugal force in the lateral direction (towards {{the outside of the}} curve and parallel with the plane of the track) is equal to the component of gravitational force in the opposite direction there is very little curve resistance. At such balancing speed there is zero <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> and results in a frictionless banked turn. But deviate from this speed (either higher or lower) and the curve resistance increases due to the unbalance in forces which tends to pull the vehicle sideways (and would be felt by a passenger in a passenger train). Note that for empty rail cars (low wheel loads) the specific curve resistance is higher, similar to the phenomena of higher rolling resistance for empty cars on a straight track.|$|E
40|$|Growing {{competition}} from other modes of transportation has forced railway companies throughout the world to search for increased performance. Travelling time is the most obvious performance indicator {{that may be improved}} by introducing high-speed trains. Trains with capability to tilt the bodies inwards the curve is a less costly alternative than building new lines with large curve radii, which is needed for the non-tilted high-speed trains. Today, tilting has become a mature technology accepted by most operators, but not favoured by many. Research has been conducted on areas with potential to improve the competitiveness of tilting trains. Track shift force may be critical for a high-speed tilting train and improved levels of track irregularities must be considered. The risk of overturning may give restriction on <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> at high speeds. Motion sickness in both non-tilting and tilting trains is still being reported. The sensory conflict is the most common explanation of motion sickness. The running times improve with increased <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> top speed and tractive performance; however the benefit of increased top speed and tractive performance is small above a certain level. Guidelines for installation of cant are given that optimize the counteracting requirements on good comfort in non-tilting trains and low risk of motion sickness in tilting trains...|$|E
40|$|Centre bearing {{forces and}} wear losses in three piece bogies have been {{simulated}} using VAMPIRE®. Bogie rotational resistance has been modelled at centre bearings and constant contact side bearers accounting for uneven loading during track transitions. The detailed model handles cylindrical centre bearings accounting for rim wall contact {{as well as}} the centre plate planar friction connections and uneven loading. The simulations have been performed for a range of curve radii assuming gauge face lubricated track. Wagons of moderate or high friction resistance to bogie rotation at centre bearings and side bearers have shown altered wheel wear, reducing maintenance cycle times in operations for rollingstock. In this paper, simulation studies have examined the effects of <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> / excess and transition curvature on the wear performance of wagons and individual wheelsets, in particular the high wearing leading wheelsets. Wheel wear is shown to be altered due to changes in bogie rotation friction moments retained through the curve when <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> of the curve is altered. The simulation results also show that transition curvature design can be used to reduce high wheel/rail wear in 3 piece bogies generated by high bogie rotation resistance. In the same way, transition curvature design can be used to alter the wheelset angle of attack during constant curving on 3 piece bogies...|$|E

Third- and it is related to the second problem- we shall examine the position of the truck frame and the wheelsets during curving.

A tilting railway vehicle is described via appropriate modelling and a frequency domain analysis illustrates the problems associated with straightforward feedback control. A Kalman-Bucy filter is developed based on 3 inertial measurements (body lateral acceleration, roll and yaw rate) to provide a more effective feedback signal. The filter is re-formulated to estimate not only the states but also the cant, cant rate and curve radius of the track on which the vehicle is travelling. Then a controller is developed based on the estimator `true' <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> output. The performance of the estimator and of the controller is assessed via appropriate computer simulations...|$|E
40|$|The Gautrain Rapid Rail Link (GRRL) is a {{rail transit}} system in South Africa that links Johannesburg and Pretoria, {{as well as}} Johannesburg and the O. R. Tambo International Airport. Travelling at speeds of up to 160 km/h, the Gautrain system {{is the first of}} its kind on the African continent. This {{dissertation}} covers an investigation into the relationship between the vertical and lateral forces, speed and superelevation in a GRRL curve. The research described in this dissertation is based on an experiment which involved running a test train through a curve at various speeds, changing the cant of the curve by tamping and repeating the train runs. The cant was changed due to high wheel wear rates. The curve already had a <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> and this <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> was subsequently increased by reducing the curve’s cant. Assessing the before and after tamping test data validated the existence of the expected relationships between the vertical and lateral rail forces, the speed and the cant. The change in cant had a minimal effect on the magnitude of the vertical forces, although a transfer of loading between the high and low legs did occur. The theory indicates that the 14 % reduction in cant in this curve given all of the other curve characteristics should have resulted in an increase in the lateral forces. There was however a roughly 50 % reduction in the maximum lateral forces after the cant was reduced that can be explained from a train dynamics point of view. In addition, there was an increase in safety due to a reduced derailment ratio at this curve’s normal operating speed of 85 km/h. It is not unreasonable to presume that a 50 % reduction in the maximum lateral forces could lead to a halving of the wear rate of the rail and wheels in this curve with similar results to be expected in other curves on the rail network.

40|$|Experimental evidence, as {{obtained}} from line tests, shows that, under some circumstances, {{the level of}} hunting motion experienced by a railway vehicle negotiating a curve can be higher than for the same vehicle running {{at the same speed}} on tangent track. Starting from this experimental observation, this paper aims to propose a physical explanation for the different hunting behaviour of a railway vehicle running in a curve. After presenting the available experimental evidence, a qualitative examination of the phenomenon is provided. A multi-body model of the vehicle running in a curve is defined and validated against line measurements. This model is then used to numerically evaluate the hunting behaviour of the vehicle {{in a wide range of}} curve radii relevant for high-speed lines. In this way, the experimental findings are extended to curve radius and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> values that were not observed in line tests, due to the use of a specific track section and to the range of speeds covered by the tests...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{is to increase the}} speed of railway. For increasing the speed of railway, the most important part is track geometry. Since the main things are protect the people and comfort of passengers are desired and also avoid the accident. The concerned from dangerous situation like accident is depends on the wheel rail forces in the track plane and comfort of passengers is depends on motions of passengers within the train. The overall dynamic structure of track geometry alignment decides the nature of high speed of railway. The track geometry, track interaction and simulation are three parts of work which deals for increasing the speed of train. In track geometry, the main part is gauges which are used for each high speed rails. The track interaction i. e. track plane acceleration, <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> cant excess, cant gradient, equilibrium cant needs for developing the high speed rail services in near future...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{a railway}} vehicle's speed on {{existing}} track, its dynamic performances are negatively affected. To {{compensate for the}} deteriorated dynamic behaviour, a re-design of the suspension system {{has been carried out}} in the years. For trains which are operated at very high speed in combination with high <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> a purely passive solution is not always sufficient. Thus, an active solution offering better possibilities of improving the vehicle’s dynamic performances are sought for. Active suspensions in trains have been studied for a number of years. Two general categories can be identified: one improving running stability and wheelset guidance and another improving passenger ride comfort. However, due to relatively high implementation and maintenance costs, only few applications are being used in service operation. One of these active suspensions has recently been tested on V 300 Zefiro train, the new Italian high speed train. In fact, V 300 Zefiro is being homologated up to a speed of 350 km/h with a high <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The main target of active lateral suspensions on V 300 Zefiro train is to improve passenger ride comfort. In a conventional bogie, the carbody’s inertia forces in curves are transferred through the suspension and eventually through the bumpstops to the bogie frame. With an active lateral suspension, these inertia forces are transferred to the bogie frame through the lateral actuators in order to avoid bumpstop contact, and finally to the wheelsets resulting in a change in wheel-rail contact forces. This force transfer, together with the passenger comfort, should carefully be addressed in order to evaluate all consequences of the developed control logic with respect to the track. The present paper focuses on the dynamic characterization of the active lateral suspensions (with particular focus on V 300 Zefiro) based on the measurement of displacement and transmitted force in real working conditions, {{as well as on the}} influence of the active lateral suspensions on the centring capabilities of the carbody with respect to the bogie and on the resulting wheel-rail contact force components (being the instrumented active lateral suspensions mounted on bogies having load measurement wheelsets) ...|$|E
40|$|Mechatronic {{technologies}} are increasingly adopted on railway vehicles, with particular reference to active secondary suspensions, {{as a means}} to improve vehicle performancein terms of ride safety and quality. This article presents the results of a theoretical and experimental research aimed at introducing active control capabilities in the pneumatic secondary suspension of a high-speed railway vehicle. The active airspring suspension is used, together with an active lateral suspension, to reduce passengers’ exposure to lateral acceleration in curves and to improve ride safety with respect to vehicle overturning in the presence of extreme crosswind. In this article, the active airspring concept is developed and suitable open- and closed-loop control strategies are proposed. Then, the results of an experimental characterization of the active suspension are reported, and based on these results a mathematical model of the vehicle with active suspension is defined. Finally, the active suspension performance is demonstrated by means of numerical experiments, showing the potential to bring substantial benefits in terms of both higher service speed for the same <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> sensed by the passengers and increased ride safety...|$|E
40|$|Track {{geometry}} {{quality has}} an important influence on the dynamic behaviour of the vehicles. Control of track geometry during the maintenance process and for the vehicle assessment (homologation) is necessary. Within the project, DYNOTRAIN methods for describing and assessing track geometry have been studied. Data from a comprehensive test campaign {{have been used to}} measure the effectiveness of different track geometry assessment methods. The vehicle behaviour has been studied by a multiple regression model with varying track geometry description methods. It had been shown that it is essential to include track geometry in the vehicle assessment process in a proper way. Depending on the assessment quantity and the vehicle type, the mostly used method in Europe (standard deviation in wavelength range 3 – 25 m) allows in combination with speed, <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> and curvature the explanation of 20 – 80 % of the total variation of the vehicle reaction.

40|$|This thesis covers both {{applications}} where simulation {{is used on}} {{parts of}} the Swedish rail networks and running time calculations for future high-speed trains with top speed improvements on existing lines. Calculations {{are part of a}} subproject within the Green Train research program (Gröna tåget). Higher speeds are possible with increased cant and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> in curves. Data for circular curve radii is used on existing lines combined with information on decided and on-going upgrades. Calculation of static speed profiles is made for a set of cant and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> values. Different train characteristics are used regarding top speed, starting acceleration and power to ton ratio. Running time calculations are made for these different train characteristics with the fictive speed profiles. In addition, different stopping patterns are applied. Results are presented together with running times for two reference train types, one with carbody tilting and one without. It is clear that carbody tilting, allowing a higher <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> is important on many of the existing lines considering achieved running times. The benefit of tilting is marginal on newly built and future lines designed with large curve radii. However, on many of the existing lines the over 20 year old reference train with carbody tilting achieves shorter running times compared to a future train without tilt but with higher top speed. The work presented here has contributed with input to other projects and applications within the research program. Simulation in RailSys is used to evaluate on-time performance for high-speed trains, between Stockholm and Göteborg in Sweden, and changes in timetable allowances and buffer times with respect to other trains. Results show that ontime performance can be improved with increased allowances or buffer times. In the case with increased buffers, other trains are pushed in the timetable with the intention of obtaining at least five minutes at critical places (e. g. conflicting train paths at stations) and as separation on line sections. On-time performance is evaluated both on aggregated (group) level and for trains individually. Some of the trains benefit significantly from the applied measures. Prior to a simulation some of the delays have to be defined. This includes dwell extensions and entry delays, i. e. extended exchange times at stations and delayed origin station departures inside or at the network border. Evaluation of observed data give insight on the performance of a real network. However, separating primary (exogenous) and secondary (knock-on) delays is not straightforward. Typically the probabilities and levels of primary delays are defined as input, thus secondary delays are created in the simulations. Although some classification of delays exist in observed data, it is not sufficient without further assumptions and preparation. A method for estimating primary running time extensions is presented and applied on a real timetable between Katrineholm and Hässleholm in Sweden. The approach consist of creating distributions based on deviations from scheduled running time. Since this represent total outcome, i. e. both primary and knock-on delays are included, the distributions are reduced by a certain percentage and applied in the simulations. Reduction is done in four steps, separately for passenger and freight trains. Root mean square error (RMSE) is used for comparing mean and standard deviation values between simulated and observed data. Results show that a reasonably good fit can be obtained. Freight services show a higher variation than passenger train evaluation groups. Some explanations for this are difficulties in capturing the variations in train weights and speeds and absence of shunting operations in the model. In reality, freight trains can also frequently depart ahead of schedule and this effect is not captured in the simulations. However, focus is mostly on passenger trains and their on-time performance. If a good enough agreement and operational behaviour is achieved for them, a lower agreement for freight trains may be accepted. QC 2012061...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the railway vehicle body roll and lateral dynamics substantially influences the tilting system performance in high-speed tilting trains, which results in a potential poor ride comfort and high risk of motion sickness. Integrating active lateral secondary suspension into the tilting control system {{is one of the}} solutions to provide a remedy to roll?lateral interaction. It improves the design trade-off for the local tilt control (based only upon local vehicle measurements) between straight track ride comfort and curving performance. Advanced system state estimation technology can be applied to further enhance the system performance, i. e. by using the estimated vehicle body lateral acceleration (relative to the track) and true <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the configuration of the tilt and lateral active suspension controllers, thus to further attenuate the system dynamics coupling. Robust H-inf filtering is investigated in this paper aiming to offer a robust estimation (i. e. estimation in the presence of uncertainty) for the required variables, In particular, it can minimise the maximum estimation error and thus be more robust to system parametric uncertainty. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} keys to improving track safety standards {{is to establish a}} strong correlation between track geometry variations and wheel-rail force parameters that are indicators of vehicle-track safety performance. In this study, wheel-rail forces were collected during field tests of a loaded lumber car and an empty tank car. Computer models of the two tested freight cars were built, and the models were calibrated using field test results. The computer models were then used to evaluate the impact of varying track geometry parameters on track safety using the maximum single wheel L/V ratio, maximum truck side L/V ratio, and minimum vertical wheel load ratio. It was confirmed again that the correlations between these force parameters and any individual geometry parameter were weak. With further investigation, it was found that much better correlation can be achieved using multiple regression techniques to define each wheel-rail force parameter as a function of all track geometry parameters combined together. Expressions of the maximum truck side L/V ratio, maximum single wheel L/V ratio, and minimum vertical wheel load ratio were obtained as functions of curvature, cross level, alignment, gauge, and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> using multiple regression analysis.
