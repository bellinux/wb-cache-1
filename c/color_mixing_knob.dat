40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} subtractive <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> widely used in color hardcopy applications and shows that a more realistic concept would be " spectral mixing " : the physical description of the coloration of light by printed surfaces comes from the mixing of light components selectively absorbed by inks or dyes during their patch within the printing materials. Some classical reflectance equations for continuous tone and halftone prints are reviewed and considered as spectral mixing laws. The challenge of extending these models to new inkless printing processes based on laser radiation is also addressed. <b>Color</b> <b>mixing</b> is a key-concept in color reproduction, either by painting, printing, or displaying. It refers to the observation that a large panel of colors (the color gamut) {{can be achieved by}} varying the amount of a limited set of base colors, called primaries. With light emitting systems, the primaries are light sources, often with red, green and blue color, that are either superposed or juxtaposed with a shorter period than the visual acuity. Since the tristimulus values of the produced colors is a linear, additive combination of the tristimulus values of the three primaries, this type of <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> has been called additive <b>color</b> <b>mixing.</b> This concept, based on Grassman's additivity law, enabled the color matching experiments at the basis of colorimetry [1]. In opposition to the light emitting systems, paintings and printed hardcopies selectively attenuate the incident white light in different proportions according to the wavelength. Layers of primaries, paints or inks, are coated on a reflecting support and play a role of spectral filtering of light. This type of <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> is improperly called subtractive <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> [2], by reference to the fact that part of the incident light is removed by filtering, but the tristimulus values of paint or ink mixtures cannot be obtained by combining the tristimulus values of the primaries; it is therefore not a <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> in the sense of colorimetry. However, the subtractive <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> is also related to a physical experience, which consists in producing many <b>colors</b> by <b>mixing</b> nonscattering dyes, usually of cyan, magenta and yellow color. According to the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law [1], the spectral absorption coefficient of the dye mixture, () K λ, is a linear, additive combi-The final publication is available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The current {{industry}} {{practice for}} producing jacquard fabrics uses computer-aided design (CAD) systems that provide visual simulations {{of the final}} color appearance of actual fabrics prior to production. This digital process is fundamentally based on the prediction of combined weave-color effects, which can be successfully achieved by accurate <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> models and the structural details of the fabrics. With the accurate models used in CAD systems, designers would see simulations more closely resembling fabrics to be produced. By checking the previews, the designers can easily modify, that is, recolor, the designs on the display monitor without doing repetitive physical sampling with the adjustment of the weaves and the yarn colors. However, there is no ready applicable accurate <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> model for woven structures and {{there has not been}} sufficient investigation of the color prediction despite its usefulness for the current digital CAD process. Our study investigated the, color prediction of jacquard woven fabrics designed based on the principle of optically subtractive <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> with the use of CMY colors. The color prediction was firstly done through the application of the six <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> models previously developed for various other applications including fiber blending and printing. The performance of each model was evaluated by calculating the difference between the predicted and the measured colorimetric data, using ΔECMC(2 : 1). The average color difference from the models was 11. 93 ΔECMC(2 : 1), which is hardly acceptable in textile industry. In order to increase the accuracy in color prediction, the six models were then optimized. As a result, substantial improvements for all models were obtained with a decrease in color difference to 4. 83 ΔECMC(2 : 1) on average after the optimizations. Among the six optimized <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> models, the optimized Warburton-Oliver model, that is, W-O model, was found to have the lowest average ΔECMC(2 : 1) value of approximately equaling to 2, which is considered potentially useful to be applied to the current digital fabric color prediction.
