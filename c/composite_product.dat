40|$|This Opinion {{reviews the}} factors that affect {{microbial}} survival and growth in <b>composite</b> <b>products,</b> and in foods in general. It concludes that the main factors to be considered are: water activity, pH, temperature and duration of storage, processing, and intensity and duration of other non-thermal physical processes applied. Prevalence and concentration of the pathogens in food are important to determine the risk for consumers. The opinion presents {{a review of the}} quantitative microbiology models and databases {{that can be used to}} provide quantitative estimations of the impact of the above factors on the survival and growth of the main bacterial pathogens. In <b>composite</b> <b>products,</b> migration and diffusion of moisture and substances among the ingredients may change their physico-chemical parameters, particularly at the interfaces. Therefore, the assessment of the risk posed by <b>composite</b> <b>products</b> needs to consider the combinations of parameters most permissive to survival and growth of pathogens. Two complementary approaches are proposed for the identification and profiling of microbiological hazards in different specific <b>composite</b> <b>products.</b> The first one is based on past outbreaks and prevalence of hazards in the products and leads to the conclusion that the most frequent hazard-composite product combinations are Salmonella in cakes and bakery products. The second one consists in decision tools based on the impact on the pathogens of food composition and food processing. Categorisation of the risk for <b>composite</b> <b>products</b> requires information on their composition, processing and further handling, which can largely differ for foods belonging to the same category. Further conditions may influence the risk and should be verified, i. e. hygienic conditions during preparation of the <b>composite</b> <b>products</b> and their ingredients, shelf-life conditions, and reliability of cooking by consumers to inactivate pathogens. The decision tools developed apply to all <b>composite</b> <b>products</b> considered by the mandate, as well as to all other foods. © European Food Safety Authority, 201...|$|R

5000|$|The {{dominant}} {{figure in}} 20th-century biblical archaeology, defining its scope and creating the mid-century {{consensus on the}} relationship between archaeology, the Bible, and the history of ancient Israel, was William F. Albright. An American with roots in the American Evangelical tradition (his parents were Methodist missionaries in Chile), Director of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), (now the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research) through the 1920s and 1930s, editor of ASOR's Bulletin until 1968, and author of over a thousand books and articles, Albright drew biblical archaeology into the contemporary debates over the origins and reliability of the Bible. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century this debate was dominated by the documentary hypothesis. This explained the Bible as the <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> of authors working between the 10th and 5th centuries BC, and raised the question of whether the books of the bible could be regarded as a reliable source of information for Solomon’s period or earlier." [...] European scholars such as Hermann Gunkel, Albrecht Alt and Martin Noth were suggesting that the books of the Old Testament rested on a body of oral tradition that reflected genuine history, but could not themselves be regarded as historically accurate. Albright saw archaeology as the a practical means to test these ideas. Biblical archaeology, for him, therefore embraced all lands and any finds that could [...] "throw some light, directly or indirectly, on the Bible." ...|$|E

The <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> system is first modeled {{with the help of a}} graph theory, then by a variable adjacency matrix and then by a multinomial known as a permanent function. The permanent function provides an opportunity to carry out structural analysis of the <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> in terms of strength, weakness, improvement, and optimization by correlating the properties of a composite with its structure. A physical meaning has been associated with each term of the permanent function. Different structural attributes of the <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> are identified to develop a graph theoretic model, a matrix model, and a multinomial permanent model of the composite. A top-down approach for complete analysis of any <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> system is also given.

40|$|In the paper, {{frameworks}} for electronic shopping of composite (modular) products are described: (a) multicriteria selection (product is {{considered as a}} whole system, it is a traditional approach), (b) combinatorial synthesis (composition) of the product from its components, (c) aggregation of the product from several selected products/prototypes. The following product model is examined: (i) general tree-like structure, (ii) set of system parts/components (leaf nodes), (iii) design alternatives (DAs) for each component, (iv) ordinal priorities for DAs, and (v) estimates of compatibility between DAs for different components. The combinatorial synthesis is realized as morphological design of a composite (modular) product or an extended <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> (e. g., product and support services as financial instruments). Here the solving process is based on Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD) : (i) multicriteria selection of alternatives for system parts, (ii) composing the selected alternatives into a resultant combination (while taking into account ordinal quality of the alternatives above and their compatibility). The aggregation framework is based on consideration of aggregation procedures, for example: (i) addition procedure: design of a products substructure or an extended substructure ('kernel') and addition of elements, and (ii) design procedure: design of the composite solution based on all elements of product superstructure.

For example, the use of high resolution MODIS SST composite [2] to initialize the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) (ARW) [3] has been shown to improve the prediction of sensible weather parameters in coastal regions [4][5 }. In an extend study, [6] compared the MODIS SST <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> to the RTG SST analysis and evaluated forecast differences for a 6 month period from March through August 2007 over the Florida coastal regions. In a comparison to buoy data, they found that that the MODIS SST composites reduced the bias and standard deviation over that of the RTG data. These improvements led to significant changes in the initial and forecasted heat fluxes and the resulting surface temperature fields, wind patterns, and cloud distributions. They also showed that the MODIS composite SST product, produced for the Terra and Aqua satellite overpass times, captured a component of the diurnal cycle in SSTs not represented in the RTG or other one-a-day SST analyses. Failure to properly incorporate these effects in the WRF initialization cycle led to temperature biases in the resulting short term forecasts. The forecast impact was limited in some situations however, due to <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> inaccuracies brought about by data latency during periods of long-term cloud cover.
