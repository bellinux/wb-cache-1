Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or <b>chuffing</b> many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E

This partial ossification was previously {{thought to be}} essential for allowing the big cats to roar, but new {{studies show that the}} ability to roar is due to other morphological features, especially of the larynx, which are absent in the snow leopard. Snow leopard vocalizations include hisses, <b>chuffing,</b> mews, growls, and wailing.|$|E

Both {{males and females}} show a flehmen response, a characteristic grimace, when sniffing urine markings but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses in oestrus. Like other Panthera, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season or when making a kill. There are two different roars: the [...] "true" [...] roar is made using the hyoid apparatus and forced through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher [...] "coughing" [...] roar is made with the mouth open and teeth exposed. The [...] "true" [...] roar can be heard at up to [...] away and is sometimes emitted {{three or four times}} in succession. When tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to a roar but more subdued and made when the mouth is partially or completely closed. Moaning can be heard [...] away. <b>Chuffing,</b> soft, low-frequency snorting similar to purring in smaller cats, is heard in more friendly situations. Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls.|$|E

50|$|Prusten is a vocalization made by {{only two}} members of the Panthera family, the tiger and the snow leopard. Prusten is also {{referred}} to as <b>chuffing</b> or chuffle (verb and noun). <b>Chuffing</b> is a non-threatening vocalization. It is often used between two cats who are greeting each other, during courting, or simply by a mother comforting her cubs. It is also common to see captive tigers and snow leopards exchange chuffs with their human keepers in a way to express a greeting or excitement. In order to vocalize a chuff, the animal's mouth is closed and it blows through the nostrils, producing a breathy snort.|$|E
