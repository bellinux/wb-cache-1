Posted to Britain {{at the end}} of the year, he {{attended}} the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London. On his return to Australia, in November 1947, he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. In November 1950, Headlam was appointed to take over command of No.90 (Composite) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Headquartered at RAF Changi, Singapore, No.90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency: No.1 (Bomber) Squadron, flying Avro Lincolns, and No.38 (Transport) Squadron, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The Lincolns conducted area bombing missions over communist-held territory, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights, VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia, and in Malaya with airlifting troops and <b>cargo,</b> <b>dropping</b> supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets. Headlam was slightly injured on 20December, when a No.38 Squadron Dakota he was co-piloting on a supply drop crash-landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang, following engine failure. In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah, Singapore, in addition to his post as commanding officer of No.90 Wing. Headlam handed over command of No.90 Wing in December 1951.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "missing" [...] rations {{have been}} the subject of {{investigation}} – both at the time and subsequently. [...] Dudley McCarthy, the Australian official historian, concluded that the reason most likely lay in [...] "faulty [...] work by inexperienced staff". Rowell's investigation, made at the time, determined that the rations had been dispatched. The second and much larger, dry lake bed, Myola 2, was discovered by a patrol on 21 August. At this time, maps showed and air crew expected only one. John Moremon hypothesises that drops were likely made at the wrong one. Rowell noted in his memoirs that [...] "all through the New Guinea Campaign <b>cargo</b> <b>dropping</b> remained notoriously unreliable".|$|E

50|$|On 1 April 1963 MATS {{required}} all {{units with}} airdrop capability to train formation flying, and the aerial delivery of personnel and equipment using CARP. This directive coupled with MATS’ desire to added realism {{led to the}} inclusion of formation flying, heavy <b>cargo</b> <b>drops,</b> and troop drops event in the 1963 CARP Rodeo. Because of the unavailability of a drop zone suitable for heavy cargo and paratroops near Scott Air Force Base the second competition was held at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware and took place 22 - 28 September. The same seven wings participated again with two crews and one C-124. However, both the 1501st and 1608th also entered a C-130 Hercules aircraft. Each crew flew a morning, afternoon, and night <b>cargo</b> <b>drop.</b> Additionally, each crew was required to drop a team from the 101st Airborne Division over Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

The PIV measurement planes were located at several {{positions in the}} wake of a generic transport aircraft model with an open ramp.

The first measured configuration consisted of only the wake of the transport aircraft. The cargo configurations consisted of a model of a cargo container, including a rigid parachute and a cargo with an airdrop support platform. A fixed haltering mechanism was used to keep the cargo at a fixed position behind the wind tunnel model for the PIV measurements. The resulting velocity fields (obtained at several chord wise positions) are used to discuss the flow topologies for these airdrop configurations...|$|R
