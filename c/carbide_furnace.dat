40|$|Abstract: To {{study the}} removal {{capacity}} of modified fly ash in wastewater containing mercury ions under different conditions, {{the dust from}} a calcium <b>carbide</b> <b>furnace</b> was added to fly ash, and the pyrogenic process was employed to modify the fly ash. The result indicated that the wastewater had a pH value of 9, the modified fly ash dosage was 0. 2 g, the adsorption equilibrium time was 40 minutes, the reaction temperature was 30 °C, and the removal rate could reach 91. 9 %. Using modified fly ash in polyvinyl chloride production via the calcium carbide method to remove mercury-containing wastewater can help meet the government-prescribed emission standard. This method has advantages such as positive treatment effect, simple operation, and low operating cost...|$|E
30|$|Ag nanohair-grown ACFs were {{prepared}} through self-assembly of AgNPs on VF surfaces and subsequent pre-oxidation and carbonization. HBPAA {{served as a}} “molecular glue” in adhering AgNPs to VF surfaces and in forming a monodispersive AgNP coating. The Ag nanohair-grown ACFs {{were prepared}} by sequential pre-oxidation and carbonization. The growth mechanism for Ag nanohair boils down to capillary and thermal expansion effects. To instantly reduce the temperature of ACFs, we designed an open-ended <b>carbide</b> <b>furnace.</b> ACFs are immediately transferrable {{to the outside of}} the furnace after completion of carbonization. Through thermal contraction, the Ag liquid squeezed out to form Ag nanowires. Ag nanohair stood on the ACF surface and grew from the ACF pores, as shown by FESEM. XPS and XRD characterization showed that Ag had successfully self-assembled to fiber surfaces and retained their metallic state even after high-temperature carbonization, owing to the gaseous reductants generated during carbonization. TG analysis suggested that Ag nanohair-grown ACFs maintained their excellent thermal stability. Finally, the fabricated ACFs showed excellent and durable antibacterial activities {{as a result of their}} strong binding.|$|E
30|$|The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Directorate at the NASA Johnson Space Center has {{developed}} {{state of the}} art thermal analysis testbeds to simulate instrumental conditions of the TEGA and SAM instruments. Samples were run in a Netzsch STA 449  F 1 Jupiter with simultaneous TG/DSC capability. This instrument consists of a furnace to heat the sample at rates up to 50 °C/min (this particular instrument is equipped with a silicon <b>carbide</b> <b>furnace</b> capable of heating samples to 1550 °C), a balance chamber that measures changes in sample mass during heating (TG), and a sample carrier that holds the sample and reference crucibles and measures the temperature of each to compute the difference in heat flow into the two cups (DSC). The instrument can be configured to use a variety of carrier gases, necessary to sweep evolved gases out of the oven and balance chamber for further analysis and instrument safety reasons (e.g. to remove corrosive gases). Helium and nitrogen were used as carrier gases for this work. A Pfeiffer Thermostar GSD 320 with a 1 - 200 AMU range PrismaPlus quadrupole mass spectrometer is coupled to the gas output of the TG/DSC for evolved gas analysis via a 500  μm inner diameter glass-lined stainless steel capillary. The entire path-length of the gas is heated to ≥ 200 °C to prevent gas condensation in the line before analysis. The Pfeiffer mass spectrometer was used in a mode that measures the peak value at each mass number from 1 - 100 AMU. One complete scan takes from 5 - 7  seconds to complete and experience has shown that this is sufficiently good time resolution to catch evolved gas peaks as one run takes on the order of an hour to complete. The SEM (secondary electron multiplier) detector was used during analysis due to its high sensitivity. The carrier gas signal was between 10 - 6 and 10 - 8 A (ion current) and the noise floor of the SEM is ~ 10 - 13 resulting in a sensitivity of 1 part in 107 or 1 in 105, depending on the instrument oven pressure.|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} oxidation causes {{degradation of}} materials in aircraft, marine, industrial and land base gas turbines. To obviate this problem, oxidation behavior of Ni and Co based superalloys viz superni 600 and superco 605 (Midhani grade) {{has been studied}} in air at 900 ºC. Both superalloys go through cyclic oxidation which consists of 1 hr heating in silicon <b>carbide</b> tube <b>furnace</b> followed by 20 min cooling in ambient air. Weight change was taken by a digital electronic weighing balance having accuracy of 1 mg after each cycle. Exposed alloys were characterized by XRD, FESEM and EDS. Result shows that the Co base superalloy superco 605 shows less weight gain as compare to superni 600. The oxide layer mainly contains oxides of Cr 2 O 3, NiO and spinel NiCr 2 O 4...|$|R

Tarte showing the limit is 3 CaOAl 1. 80 Fe 0. 20 O 3 at 1310 ℃. In addition, A. J. Majumdar reported that the replacement of Al 3 + ions by Fe ions in 3 CaO・Al 2 O 3 is 6 ～ 8 mol. % at 1325 ℃. A. E. Moore 0 reexamied this experiment and mentioned that the disagreement of the limit of composition {{is related to the}} temperature at which the preparation were symthesized; the higher the temperature the lower the " 3 CaO・Fe 2 O 3 " comcentration. And she suggested that this fact is owing to the unstableness of " 3 CaO・Fe 2 O 3 " at high temperature although the phase diagram obtained by C. M. Schlaudt and D. m. Roy did not agree with it. All experiments mentioned above are supposed to e carried out in the system 3 CaO・Al 2 O 3 - " 3 CaO・Fe 2 O 3 ". The present study aims to charify the influence of the preparating temperature and the mixing syxtem to the limit of solid solution. The system employed in this experiments were 3 CaO・Al 2 O 3 - " 3 CaO・Fe 2 O 3 ", 3 CaO・Al 2 O 3 - 2 CaO・Fe 2 O 3, 3 CaO・Al 2 O 3 -CaO・Fe 2 O 3 and 3 CaO・Al 2 O 3 -Fe 2 O 3. Both mechanical mixing method and liguid mising method were used to prepare raw mixtures. The mixtures were pressed into pellets, hung by Pt chains in a silicon <b>carbide</b> resistance <b>furnace</b> on by one, heated at a definite temperature (1250 ° and 1370 ℃) and the quenched. Samples thus prepared were tested by X-ray powder diffracion method and the lattice parameters were obtained as shown in Fig. 4. The limits of solid solutions were abtained as shown in Fig. 5. These resutes shows the normal temperature-dependent solubility, the higher the temperature the higher the Fe 2 O 3 concentration, and also shows that the limit of solid solution is much variable according to a kind of the systems in CaO-Al 2 O 3 -Fe 2 O 3 ternary.

40|$|Seven {{iron ore}} pellets, two sinters, and one lump ore were studied in CO-CO₂-H₂-N₂ atmospheres from 350 °C to 750 °C, {{simulating}} the upper stack of the ironmaking blast furnace. Experiments were {{performed in a}} flowing gas reactor on single specimens of each type of substrate. Two different measurements were made: (1) the carbon deposition and concurrent iron oxide reduction rate at 550 °C in 30 %CO, 10 %CO₂, 2 %H₂, and 58 %N₂; and (2) {{the amount of carbon}} deposited during a programmed increase in temperature and change in CO-CO₂ ratio simulating the descent of an ore specimen in the blast furnace stack. The rates of the concurrent reaction were determined from mass balances based on gas chromatographic analyses of the CO, CO₂H₂, and N₂ in both the inlet and outlet gases and the continuously recorded mass of the specimen. The materials were examined as to chemical composition, internal structure, porosity, and surface area. Elemental analyses of single iron oxide grains were made by electron microprobe. Slag materials and composition, and crystallinity were determined by microprobe and X-ray diffraction. The results of the experiments show that carbon deposition occurs only in the presence of metallic iron which is produced from the concurrent reduction of Fe₃O₄. The degree of reduction is controlled largely by the structure of the substrate, but the carbon deposition is controlled only by the chemical composition of the substrate [...] specifically, silicon in the iron and the CaO to MgO ratio. In the blast furnace simulation, the carbon deposition increases for pellets fluxed with dolomite to a maximum with lime-fluxed pellets. The effects of H₂ and CO₂ on the reactions were investigated in the isothermal experiments using an Empire pellet. The CO₂ controlled only the reduction, and this by diffusion of the CO₂. The hydrogen in very small amounts enhanced the deposition of carbon, probably by eliminating the presence of the inactive iron <b>carbides.</b> Under blast <b>furnace</b> conditions, the changes in the operation when the chemistry of the ore feed is changed to fluxed pellets will be due more to the shifts in the available heat within the stack from carbon deposition than to the low temperature reduction of the ores, which does not change with the addition of the flux materials...|$|R
40|$|Aims The {{main purpose}} of the study was to assess and {{characterize}} the exposure to dust and selected dust constituents in the Norwegian silicon carbide industry from 1913 to 2005 and construct a retrospective job-exposure matrix for use in epidemiological studies. The dust constituents were selected based on their known or suspected lung carcinogenicity and presence in the SiC industry. Materials and methods An exposure assessment based on repeated random personal sampling within a priori defined job groups was performed in the three Norwegian silicon carbide plants in 2001 - 2003. Total dust was sampled in parallel with respirable dust or fiber. Total dust and respirable dust was analysed gravimetrically and fibers were counted by phase contrast microscopy. The respirable dust was analysed for the content of quartz, cristobalite and silicon carbide by X-ray diffractometry. To characterize the morphology and chemical composition of the fibers, additional samples were analysed using a scanning electron microscope. Information on tasks performed and other possible determinants of exposure was collected and linear mixed effect models were used to identify predictors of reduced or increased exposure. Exposure measurements and information on process and technological changes for the retrospective exposure estimation were obtained from available sources. As the majority of exposure measurements were of total dust, these were used as the basis for the retrospective exposure assessment. Linear regression models were developed to estimate total dust exposure for the time periods with exposure measurements (1967 - 2005). The exposure estimates were extrapolated backwards to periods without total dust measurements by applying multiplicators for relative changes in exposure due to process related changes and changes in working hours. The parallel sampling from the current study enabled us to construct linear mixed effect models to estimate the content of respirable dust, fiber, quartz, cristobalite and silicon carbide in total dust for the job groups and plants. These models were then applied to the total dust JEM. The performance of the models was evaluated with available historical exposure measurements of crystalline silica and fibers. PAH exposure was assessed semi-quantitatively and asbestos qualitatively. Results The fiber characterization in the furnace department showed that the silicon carbide fibers could be divided into eight groups based on morphology, in addition to cleavage fragments of silicon carbide. More than 90 % of the fibers in the furnace department were silicon carbide fibers, with less than two percent of cleavage fragments. In the processing department 82 % were silicon carbide fibers, of which cleavage fragments constituted 57 %. Exposure to sulphur dioxide, fiber, quartz and cristobalite was mainly restricted to job groups in the furnace department. Exposure to silicon carbide and total dust was significantly higher in the processing department than in the furnace and maintenance departments. The cleaner operator, charger and charger/mix operators were generally the highest exposed job groups in the furnace department, and the refinery crusher operator was the highest exposed job group in the processing department. More than 3300 historical total dust exposure measurements were available from 1967 - 2005 and the current study added another 702 total dust measurements. The linear regression models of total dust described historical exposure best in the furnace department (R 2 adj = 0. 49 - 0. 74). Models in the other departments explained less variance (R 2 adj = 0. 12 - 0. 32). Exposure determinants and total dust exposure explained a substantial portion of the between- (70 - 100 %) and within-worker (8. 0 - 54 %) variance in the mixedeffect models. The relative bias between the available historical dust measurements and the estimated exposure to dust components varied between - 39 % (fiber) and 40 % (quartz). However corrections were not considered necessary due to limitations in the historical data. The rPearson correlation coefficient for the exposure estimates were below 0. 7 for all pairs with the exception of total dust and respirable dust (rPearson = 0. 84) and total dust and cristobalite (rPearson = 0. 72). Job group was a strong determinant of exposure for all agents, explaining between 43 - 74 % of the between-worker variance. Determinants associated with increased exposure in the furnace department were performing the sorting of the crude silicon <b>carbide</b> inside the <b>furnace</b> hall, and the tasks cleaning, assisting in assembling and filling of furnaces and manual sorting. Filling and changing pallet boxes were important tasks related to increased exposure to total dust, respirable dust and silicon carbide in the processing department. Work in control rooms, laboratories, fresh air ventilated crane cabins, offices and maintenance outside the furnace hall and processing department were predictors of decreased dusts exposure. For maintenance workers, increased exposure to fiber was associated with maintenance in the furnace department and increased exposure to SiC was related to maintenance in the processing department. Conclusion Workers in the silicon carbide industry are exposed to a mixture of several agents, including silicon carbide fibers, quartz, cristobalite, non-fibrous SiC and sulphur dioxide. The current exposure levels are generally below the current Norwegian OELs, however, high exposure to fibers and respirable dust still occur in the furnace department. The increased number of total dust measurements and the comparative exposure study using parallel sampling of total dust, fibers and respirable dust with consecutive statistical modeling, made it possible to develop a new and improved JEM. Uncertainties remain in the exposure estimates, especially earlier than 1967 and for certain job groups without exposure measurements. The component specific metrices were sufficient different from each other to be used in component specific epidemiolocial analysis with the exception of total dust and respirable dust and total dust and cristobalite. Job group was a strong determinant of exposure for all agents. Several tasks were associated with increased exposure, indicating possibilities for exposure control measures. Recommendations for exposure reduction based on this study are to (1) separate the sorting area from the furnace hall, (2) minimize manual work on furnaces and in the sorting process, (3) use remote controlled sanders/grinders with ventilated cabins, (4) use closed systems for filling pallet boxes, and (5) improve cleaning procedures by using methods that minimize dust generation...|$|R
