5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) <b>clenching</b> and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E
25|$|Tooth wear may {{be brought}} to the person's {{attention}} during routine dental examination. With awake bruxism, most people will often initially deny <b>clenching</b> and grinding because they are unaware of the habit. Often, the person may re-attend soon after the first visit and report that they have now become aware of such a habit.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a wide}} {{variation}} in reported epidemiologic data for bruxism, and this {{is largely due to}} differences in the definition, diagnosis and research methodologies of these studies. E.g. several studies use self-reported bruxism as a measure of bruxism, and since many people with bruxism are not aware of their habit, self-reported tooth grinding and <b>clenching</b> habits may be a poor measure of the true prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Women {{can stimulate}} {{themselves}} sexually by crossing their legs tightly and <b>clenching</b> {{the muscles in}} their legs, creating pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Thoughts, fantasies, and memories of previous instances of arousal and orgasm can produce sexual excitation. Some women can orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, although this may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.|$|E
25|$|Bruxism is {{excessive}} {{teeth grinding}} or jaw <b>clenching.</b> It is an oral parafunctional activity; i.e., it is unrelated to normal function such as eating or talking. Bruxism {{is a common}} behavior; reports of prevalence range from 8–31% in the general population. Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and fillings) to teeth. But symptoms may be minimal, without patient awareness of the condition.|$|E

25|$|Most {{people with}} bruxism will {{experience}} no pain. The presence or degree of pain {{does not necessarily}} correlate with the severity of grinding or <b>clenching.</b> The pain in the muscles of mastication caused by bruxism can be likened to muscle pain after exercise. The pain may be felt over {{the angle of the}} jaw (masseter) or in the temple (temporalis), and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw. Most (but not all) bruxism includes <b>clenching</b> force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only, which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles. The temporomandibular joints themselves may also become painful, which is usually felt {{just in front of the}} ear, or inside the ear itself. Clicking of the jaw joint may also develop. The forces exerted on the teeth are more than the periodontal ligament is biologically designed to handle, and so inflammation may result. A tooth may become sore to bite on, and further, tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity, e.g. to cold stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Stretches and {{isometric}} exercises {{will aid}} in prevention for persons at risk. Stretching before the activity and during breaks will aid in alleviating tension at the wrist. Place the hand firmly {{on a flat}} surface and gently press for a few seconds to stretch the wrist and fingers. An example for an isometric exercise of the wrist is done by <b>clenching</b> the fist tightly, releasing and fanning out fingers. None of these stretches or exercises should cause pain or discomfort.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{dentistry}} (bruxism, snoring {{and sleep}} apnea), while not {{recognized as one}} of the nine dental specialties, qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The resulting Diplomate status is recognized by the AASM, and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA). The qualified dentists collaborate with sleep doctors at accredited sleep centers and can provide several types of oral appliances or upper airway surgery to treat or manage sleep-related breathing disorders as well as tooth-grinding and <b>clenching.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some bruxism {{activity}} is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths {{of a second}} (like chewing), and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds (<b>clenching).</b> Some individuals clench without significant lateral movements. Bruxism can also {{be regarded as a}} disorder of repetitive, unconscious contraction of muscles. This typically involves the masseter muscle and the anterior portion of the temporalis (the large outer muscles that clench), and the lateral pterygoids, relatively small bilateral muscles that act together to perform sideways grinding.|$|E
25|$|An {{accurate}} diagnosis may {{be difficult}} {{because of the way}} the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, carpal tunnel syndrome, TMD, Tourette's syndrome, conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington's disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist <b>clenching,</b> knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington's disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication.|$|E
25|$|Aggression can be {{the result}} of both {{internal}} and external factors that create a measurable activation in the autonomic nervous system. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the <b>clenching</b> of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency service settings are homicidal in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide. Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, paranoid personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc. Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.|$|E

25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since exercise can cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist <b>clenching</b> can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other hand, processing of heparinised, unclot blood does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|E

500|$|Flexion {{describes}} a bending movement that decreases the angle between a segment and its proximal segment. [...] For example, bending the elbow, or <b>clenching</b> a {{hand into a}} fist, are examples of flexion. When sitting down, the knees are flexed. When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, flexion refers to movement in the anterior direction. Flexion of the shoulder or hip refers to movement of the arm or leg forward.|$|E

500|$|Meth {{mouth is}} severe tooth decay and tooth loss, {{as well as}} tooth fracture, acid erosion, and other oral problems, {{potentially}} symptomatic of extended use of the drug methamphetamine. [...] The condition {{is thought to be}} caused by a combination of side effects of the drug (<b>clenching</b> and grinding of teeth, dry mouth) and lifestyle factors (infrequent oral hygiene, frequent consumption of sugary drinks, as well as neglecting regular dental cleanings and preventative care), which may be present in long term users. However, the legitimacy of meth mouth as a unique condition has been questioned because of the similar effects of some other drugs on teeth. Images of diseased mouths are often used in anti-drug campaigns.|$|E
500|$|Sandi Mann concludes {{from her}} {{research}} that the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture will prevail, becoming used by more companies and countries.

Thus, the sole way for companies to distinguish themselves is to have better customer service. She notes that there are positive and negative effects. A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays. A negative effect is that emotions incompatible with the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture are repressed, leading to what Mann terms the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome. [...] In an interview for the Wall Street Journal, an employee of a telemarketing company, was called a son of a bitch. <b>Clenching</b> his teeth, he responded [...] "Thank you very much, you have a nice day." [...] The stress of suppressing their feelings and faking cheerfulness caused people like the telemarketer to feel insincere and phony. Individuals affected by the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome must carry out emotional labor, which could lead to diminished self-esteem, depression, and cynicism.|$|E
