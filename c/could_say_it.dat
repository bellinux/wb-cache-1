25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In {{the press}} statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt {{explained}} the decision, saying, [...] "Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I {{came to the}} decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this {{came as no surprise}} to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that." ...|$|E

[...] "I happened to be lucky enough to discover a really shiny book cover in a book store." [...] Turner stated, [...] "I wish I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was like, 'Well, I've been on this intellectual quest.' I picked it up, read it and went mental." [...] Becoming fascinated by the futuristic ideology of the book, he proceeded {{to share it with}} the other band members, reading them passages on their tour bus over the next several months.|$|E

500|$|In summer 2014, Allardyce signed midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté, left-back Aaron Cresswell, {{attacker}} Enner Valencia, right-back (on {{loan from}} Arsenal) Carl Jenkinson, striker Diafra Sakho, defensive midfielder Alex Song (on loan from Barcelona), midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, and forward Mauro Zárate. In October 2014, pundits like BBC's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team's [...] "more attractive and attacking playing style" [...] or [...] "the statistics [...] show {{the progress that}} West Ham have {{made in the last}} few months." [...] Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month. Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, {{the final day of the}} season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that [...] "I didn't want to stay. I suppose you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either". His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014–15 season, one place higher than in the 2013–14 season.|$|E
500|$|That month, Clinton {{implemented}} a Department of Defense directive known as [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", which allowed {{gay men and}} women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation. The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that [...] "the President should lift the ban... even though [...] was sure to be overridden by the Congress". Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was not [...] "out of whack". The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{code name}} for the project was [...] "GameCom", but Masayuki Uemura's wife {{proposed}} the name [...] "Famicom", arguing that [...] "In Japan, 'pasokon' is used to mean a personal computer, but it is neither a home or personal computer. Perhaps we <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is a family computer." [...] Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna which used those colors.|$|E

2500|$|On November 19, 2007, Saigon {{posted a}} blog entry on his MySpace {{entitled}} [...] "I QUIT" [...] announcing his retirement {{from the music}} industry.

On November 26, 2007, Just Blaze posted a blog stating he was putting the final touches on The Greatest Story Never Told. He continued to hint that the album may in fact be released. On December 19, 2007, exactly one month from the first blog, Saigon posted another blog stating that he had reconsidered retiring. He also said that the album would indeed be released saying, [...] "My album WILL be released VERY soon". The album's executive producer stated that The Greatest Story Never Told had undergone its final mastering on January 8.|$|E
2500|$|Pete's catchphrase was [...] "alright treacle?" [...] {{pronounced}} [...] "awight treacle", {{often used}} when addressing female characters. Peter Dean has discussed why the catchphrase came into existence: [...] "I had this saying - treacle. There was this long scene with Den and his mistress and I {{had to ask}} her for a drink, but I completely forgot her name, so said 'Give us a drink, treacle'. And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was in the script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea. And it just means someone sweet and nice. I always said it and my granddad said it. Even now {{people come up to}} me and ask if I'll say 'awight treacle' down their mobile phone to someone." ...|$|E

[...] "In I Honestly Love You (No Not You)", Miley {{believes}} that Oliver {{is in love}} with her when she overhears him (while asleep in the hospital because of a broken ankle) say [...] "I love you". However, after a talk with her dad she thinks that Oliver will move on and so will Lilly but when Lilly announces that she {{is in love with}} Oliver, Miley ends up telling her the truth. Lilly and Miley hatch a plan to get Oliver back but only to find out that he was practicing saying [...] "I love you" [...] so he <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> to Lilly. They both say that they love each other in the end of the episode. (It is mentioned in this episode that neither Oliver nor Miley have romantic feelings for each other). However, Oliver did used to have romantic feelings towards Hannah Montana before he knew she was Miley. Miley,at first, didn't want to tell him who she was, just in case he had romantic feelings for her as Miley, but when she eventually told him, he saw her as just a friend.|$|E

2500|$|Drift {{was first}} sent out in June 1876 under Acting Master Robert Platt, USN, Assistant Coast Survey, to the Gulf of Maine to anchor in depths {{of up to}} 140 fathoms (840 feet/256 meters) to measure currents. The value of such {{measurements}} became immediately obvious as the Drift took advantage of her own observations in sailing and in a cited incident observed another ship struggling while she used currents effectively. During October–November the ship attempted further work but anchoring and effective measurements were obstructed by weather so the vessel returned to New York {{at the end of}} November. During this season, and subsequent work in the area the presence and location of tide rips was noted. There, while undertaking some hydrographic investigations in the entrance to New York harbor Drift was slightly damaged in a winter [...] "hurricane" [...] with temperature at 10°F (-12°C) during which she had to be towed away from the shore by two tugs. The report of the incident noted three other schooners and a steamboat were [...] "thrown on the beach by the hurricane." [...] After refit the Drift returned to the Gulf of Maine for current measurements. The schooner continued to occupy stations between Cape Sable and Nantucket observing currents and tide rips as well as incidental hydrography. Also noted as observed was [...] "what seemed to be a very large round spar projecting twelve to fifteen feet out of the sea" [...] that appeared on one side and then the other of the vessel while becalmed off Race Point, Cape Cod and [...] "near it an object having the form of an enormous dorsal fin" [...] that was observed with [...] "good glasses." [...] It was noted that none <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was a creature, yet all on board agreed no [...] "floating wreck was anywhere in sight." ...|$|E
