5|$|The Supreme Court had other, limited {{sources of}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The Court could hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and mandamus, as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a <b>civil</b> <b>action)</b> in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{fighting}} {{during the}} Battle of Dak To took a heavy human {{toll on the}} 173rd. While several of its units, including the 2-503rd and A/3-319th were ordered to Tuy Hòa to repair and refit, the 173rd was transferred to Camp Radcliff in An Khê and Bong Son areas during 1968, seeing very little action while the combat ineffective elements of the brigade were rebuilt. Company D, 16th Armor was engaged in a battle that took place on 4 March 1968 at North Tuy Hòa. During the day, the company lost 8 men killed and 21 wounded. The enemy took a much greater loss. An estimated 2 enemy battalions, 85th Main Force (VC) and the 95th NVA Regiment, were rendered ineffective as they had 297 KIA's, with D/16 Armor receiving credit for killing 218. The company commander, Captain Robert Helmick, was awarded the DSC. One of few combat operations that brigade conducted during this time was an amphibious assault against North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong forces {{as part of an}} operation to clear the rice-growing lowlands along the Bong Song littoral. The unit then served in An Khê until mid-1969, seeing {{little in the way of}} heavy fighting. From April 1969 until its withdrawal from Vietnam in 1971, the brigade served in Bình Định Province. From April until August 1971, the unit underwent the process of redeployment to Fort Campbell, Kentucky in the United States, the first time that the 173rd Airborne Brigade in name had returned to the country since 1942. During more than six years of continuous combat, the brigade earned 14 campaign streamers and four unit citations, the Presidential Unit Citation, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, a Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, and a Republic of Vietnam <b>Civil</b> <b>Action</b> Honor Medal. Sky Soldiers serving in Vietnam received 13 Medals of Honor, 32 Distinguished Service Crosses, 1,736 Silver Stars and more than 6,000 Purple Hearts. The 173rd incurred 1,533 deaths and around 6,000 wounded.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and examine motivating factors for why public and private actors initiate costly and risky <b>civil</b> <b>actions</b> to recover loss due to corruption in an era of increasing multilateral consensus and cooperation against corruption and organised crime. Design/methodology/approach – Research into recent global trends and types of civil lawsuits against corruption is conducted. Several cases, particularly from Canada, Hong Kong, the USA and the UK, are used to illustrate the attractions and difficulties of civil litigation. The implications of the recent international treaties on corruption are analyzed. Qualitative findings are made on a range of motivational factors that lie behind different types of <b>civil</b> <b>actions</b> against corruption. Findings – The paper notes an apparent rise in interest in <b>civil</b> <b>actions</b> against corruption and describes five types of actions brought by governments and companies. <b>Civil</b> <b>actions</b> are indicative of the want of better alternatives to recovery. While recent anti-corruption treaties help to remove barriers to <b>civil</b> <b>actions,</b> the treaties themselves cannot explain the increased interest in civil lawsuits. Full explanation lies in the empowering effect of suing, the political significance of these lawsuits particularly for a new regime suing to recover plundered property from the old regime, and the ease by which a lawsuit can be launched. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature in identifying types of <b>civil</b> <b>actions</b> against corruption, the practical and political motivations behind <b>civil</b> <b>actions,</b> and the positive relationship between international cooperation regimes and <b>civil</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

A movie screen would be erected nearby {{and those in the}} queue for treatment, and other villagers, would watch the films that were chosen to promote the South Vietnamese government {{at the expense of the}} Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces. Dental <b>Civil</b> <b>Action</b> Programs (DENTCAPS) were also carried out by 1 ATF units other than 1 ACAU.
