A numerical model {{is used to}} quantify the role of cold-air-pooling processes in the dispersion of air pollution in a developing <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> within an alpine valley under decoupled stable conditions. Results indicate that the negatively buoyant downslope flows transport and mix pollutants into the valley to depths that depend on the temperature deficit of the flow and the ambient temperature structure inside the valley. Along the slopes, pollutants are generally entrained above the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> and detrained within the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool,</b> largely above the ground-based inversion layer. The ability of the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> to dilute pollutants is quantified. The analysis shows that the downslope flows fill the valley with air from above, which is then largely trapped within the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool,</b> and that dilution depends on where the pollutants are emitted {{with respect to the}} positions of the top of the ground-based inversion layer and <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool,</b> and on the slope wind speeds. Over {{the lower part of the}} slopes, the cold-air-pool-averaged concentrations are proportional to the slope wind speeds where the pollutants are emitted, and diminish as the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> deepens. Pollutants emitted within the ground-based inversion layer are largely trapped there. Pollutants emitted farther up the slopes detrain within the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> above the ground-based inversion layer, although some fraction, increasing with distance from the top of the slopes, penetrates into the ground-based inversion layer...|$|E

The uniqueness {{of the present study}} is a detection of seasonal differences in the formation processes based on a 3 -year observation. The maximum inversion (maximum difference of nighttime air temperature between the bottom and summit of the hollow) is used to determine the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> formation, which frequently occurred on {{more than half of the}} observational days, and to examine its seasonal variation and intensity. The classification of the type of pressure pattern under which the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> is formed reveals that the North Pacific anticyclone (Type 5) and migratory anticyclone (Type 3) are closely associated with remarkable <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> formation. The <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> exhibits a seasonal variability and can be categorized into two types: the summer and the autumn types. As for the summer type, cold-air pools are formed gradually, from sunset to midnight, and the intensity of the inversion is relatively weak. This weak inversion may be due to increased downward long-wave radiation, which is inferred from the increased cloud amounts and water vapour content. The high content of water vapour, associated with cloud formation, is advected by the thermally induced winds. On the other hand, the autumn type is characterized by conditions favourable for <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> formation, with fine weather and dry air conditions throughout the day. In brief, <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> formation is governed by both the effects of local humidity and synoptic weather conditions in central Japan. Copyright © 2000 Royal Meteorological Society.

Results for a three-dimensional (3 D) valley, which allows for the formation of a down-valley flow, and for a two-dimensional (2 D) valley, where the formation of a down-valley flow is inhibited, are analyzed and compared. A key result is that advection leads to a net cooling in the 2 D valley and to a warming in the 3 D valley, once the down-valley flow is fully developed. This difference stems from the suppression of the slope-flow induced upward motions over the valley centre in the 3 D valley. As a result, the downslope flows develop a cross-valley circulation within the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool,</b> the growth of the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> is reduced and the valley atmosphere is generally warmer than in the 2 D valley. A quasi-steady state is reached for which the divergence of the down-valley flow along the valley is balanced by the convergence of the downslope flows {{at the top of the}} <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool,</b> with no net contribution of subsiding motions far from the slope layer. More precisely, the inflow of air at the top of the <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> is found to be driven by an interplay between the return flow from the plain region and subsidence over the plateaux.

We use the wolverine (Gulo gulo) as an example species and investigate potential habitat based on the depth and extent of spring snowpack within four National Park units with proposed wolverine reintroduction programs. Our estimates of change in spring snowpack conditions under current and future climates are consistent with recent studies that generally predict declining snowpack.

40|$|Key message Extreme {{temperatures}} are causing forest dieback in a Mediterranean-type forest. Topography and <b>cold-air</b> <b>pooling</b> explain the geographic distribution of frost dieback in susceptible tree species. Alterations {{to the frequency}} and intensity of extreme temperatures, predicted with climate change, {{pose a threat to}} the health of many forests. Some Mediterranean climate regions are experiencing higher temperature variability, including more extreme low and high temperature events. Following one such low-temperature event in autumn 2012, we conducted landscape- and site-level studies to examine the impact of frost on trees and the interaction between topography, temperature, and dieback in a forest ecosystem in the Mediterranean climate region of southwest Australia. Canopy damage was widespread across the survey area and occurred in distinct patches, with sizes ranging between 4. 1 and 2, 518. 0 ha. In affected forest, Eucalyptus marginata and Corymbia calophylla experienced nearly complete crown dieback, while E. patens and E. wandoo were undamaged. Canopy damage was found more frequently in valleys and lower to mid-slope positions, and site-level studies confirmed that crown dieback generally increased with decreasing elevation. Low temperatures were strongly correlated with elevation along damaged forest transects and <b>cold-air</b> <b>pooling</b> explained the pattern of forest damage. By regressing temperatures from damaged sites against those collected from the nearest meteorological station, projected minimum air temperatures ranged from - 0. 1 to - 2. 7 °C at valley bottom when the dieback occurred. Insufficient tissue hardening is suspected to have predisposed trees to this autumn frost. The interaction between shifting temperature regimes with climate change and frost damage is discussed. With continued increases in temperature variability, we can expect to see more temperature-driven disturbance events and associated reductions in forest health...|$|R

The sensitivity of the boundary layer structure to snow cover variations and cloud microphysics are also examined. Snow cover increases boundary layer stability by enhancing the surface albedo, reducing the absorbed solar insolation at the surface, and lowering near-surface air temperatures.

Air temperature observations obtained from a vertically oriented fibre optics array of approximate dimensions 8 m x 8 m and sonic anemometer data from two levels were collected over a short grass field located in the flat bottom of a wide valley with moderate surface heterogeneity. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the potential of the DTS technique to study small-scale processes in the surface layer over a wide range of atmospheric stability, and to analyse the space-time dynamics of transient cold-air pools in the calm boundary layer. The time response and precision of the fibre temperatures were adequate to resolve individual sub-metre sized turbulent and non-turbulent structures of time scales of seconds in the convective, neutral, and stable surface layer. Meaningful sensible heat fluxes were computed using the eddy covariance technique when combined with vertical wind observations. We present a framework that determines the optimal environmental conditions for applying the fibre optics technique in the surface layer and identifies areas for potentially significant improvements of the DTS performance. The top of the transient <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> was highly non-stationary indicating a superposition of perturbations of different time and length scales. Vertical eddy scales in the strongly stratified transient <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> derived from the DTS data agreed well with the buoyancy length scale computed using the vertical velocity variance and the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, while scales for weak stratification disagreed.

The valley heat deficit was highly correlated with PM 10 concentration on a daily time scale.

40|$|Early {{climate change}} ideas warned of {{widespread}} species extinctions. As scientists have probed {{more deeply into}} species responses, a more nuanced perspective emerged indicating that some species may persist in microrefugia (refugia), including in mountainous terrain. Refugia are habitats that buffer climate changes and allow species to persist in—and to potentially expand under—changing environmental conditions. While climate and species interactions in refugia have been noted as sources of uncertainty, land management practices and disturbances, such as wildland fire, should also be considered when assessing any given refugium. Our landscape scale study suggests that cold-air pools, an important type of small-scale refugia, have unique fire occurrence, frequency, and severity patterns in frequent-fire mixed conifer forests of California’s Sierra Nevada: <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> refugia have less fire and if it occurs, it is lower severity.

The foliage temperature {{is used as a}} proxy for air temperature and can be used to study and map the dynamics of the nocturnal, weak-wind boundary layer in this valley. All radiative flux not originating from the forest canopy must be filtered out of the captured imagery. Once the image has been filtered it must be georeferenced and orthorectified before useful analyses can be performed. After geoprocessing is complete, a spatially explicit time series of temperatures for an entire forested mountain valley will be available for further exploitation. The geoprocessed thermal imagery can, when combined with various data recorded in situ, yield data sets such as sensible heat flux at the canopy surface, potential temperature profiles, the adiabatic lapse rate in the watershed, the state of static stability in the watershed, and to map <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool</b> dynamics. Evidence was established that two concepts underlying the Bright Air study are valid for this study site. The first is that a TIR camera can accurately record foliage canopy temperature. The second is that on clear nights, foliage canopy temperature can be a proxy for the temperature of air immediately adjacent to the canopy. This study indicates that a TIR camera can accurately measure foliage canopy temperature on clear nights. Furthermore, the study indicates that on clear or intermittently cloudy nights, foliage canopy temperatures as measured by a TIR camera can be a proxy for the temperature of air immediately adjacent to the canopy. A process to georeference and orthorectify thermal imagery was selected and a tool to geoprocess the thermal imagery was created.

The {{evolution of}} cold-pool characteristics depended {{on the strength of}} prevailing flows above the basin. On an undisturbed day, a 308 C diurnal temperature range and a strong nocturnal potential temperature inversion (22 K in 100 m) were observed in the basin.

Observations were compared against a weighted average of nearby private-weather-station readings and Rapid Refresh [RAP]-model gridpoint forecasts for the corresponding time periods. Local nowcasts or forecasts for locations along the transects — generated from a similarity analysis of station and transect-location metadata — showed generally poor skill, though the consistently greater errors at higher elevations suggest the potential for fruitful additional adjustments {{beyond the scope of this}} study.

To better account for these findings, a new forecast scheme was then implemented, combining regressions of observed along-transect lapse rates on upslope winds, modeled open-sky lapse rates, and region-wide temperature trends; it demonstrated improved skill over the station-based one, suggesting that further work to enable standardization of microclimatic forecasts based on a simple set of externally measured variables would be both possible and productive...|$|E
40|$|During interglacial stages, microrefugia are {{sites that}} support locally {{favorable}} climates within larger areas with unfavorable warmer climates. Despite recent theoretical representations of microrefugia, an appropriate ecological characterization is still lacking, mostly for warm periods. Across mountain/alpine areas, cold-adapted plant species could adopt different strategies {{to manage the}} effects of climate warming: (A) migration toward higher elevations and summits; (B) in situ resilience of communities and species populations within microrefugia; and C) adaptation and evolution by genetic differentiation. This review aims to distinguish and characterize from an ecological perspective glacial, nival, periglacial and composite landforms and deposits that may function as potential microrefugia during interglacial warm periods. We conducted a literature screening related to the geomorphological processes and landforms associated with vegetation and plant communities in alpine/mountain environments of Europe. They include glacial deposits rock glaciers, debris-covered glaciers, composite cones and channels. In Alpine regions, geomorphologic niches that constantly maintain <b>cold-air</b> <b>pooling</b> and temperature inversions are the main candidates for microrefugia. Within such microrefugia, microhabitat diversity modulates the responses of plants to disturbances caused by geomorphologic processes and supports their aptitude for surviving under extreme conditions on unstable surfaces in isolated patches. Currently, European marginal mountain chains may be considered as examples of macrorefugia where relict boreo-alpine species persist within peculiar geomorphological niches that act as microrefugia. This review contributes to identifying potential warm-stage microrefugia areas across alpine and mountain regions and determining certain landforms that play or may play such role under global- change scenarios. The occurrence of warm-stage microrefugia within these locations may be of great importance for the modeling of future distributions of species and assessing the risk of extinction for alpine species. Microrefugia may have important implications in micro-evolutionary processes that occur across alternating climatic phases...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} and climatology of Pfänderwind, a largely unknown downslope windstorm {{near the town}} of Bregenz (Austria) at the entrance of the Rhine Valley, are investigated based on an eleven-year dataset of weather station observations and ERA-Interim reanalyses. The goal is to clarify the inconsistency in the definition of this phenomenon, to illuminate its dynamics, and to quantify its frequency of occurrence. It is shown that Pfänderwind has similarities to foehn but does occur for different synoptic-scale conditions. Moreover, two types of Pfänderwind have to be distinguished: Type  1, or classical Pfänderwind, is associated with easterly to northeasterly large-scale flow that crosses the Pfänder mountain range, descends in a foehn-like manner and causes moderate to strong winds in the town of Bregenz and its vicinity. The temperature anomaly induced at the surface by adiabatic warming is small as a result of weak low-level stability. Type- 1 events occur on average 12 times per year, preferentially in spring, and most frequently between the afternoon and midnight. Type  2, or southeast Pfänderwind, is associated with westerly to southwesterly ambient winds near the main Alpine crest level. The Rhine valley is filled with cold air and in most cases south foehn is not present. However, the synoptic and meso-scale pressure gradient favours southerly ageostrophic flow in the Rhine Valley especially {{near the top of the}} <b>cold-air</b> <b>pool.</b> This flow passes the Gebhardsberg, the southwestern extension of the Pfänder mountain range, descends on its leeward side and causes strong foehn-like warming at the surface. However, southerly to southeasterly near-surface winds at Bregenz are rather weak. Type- 2 events occur on average 40 times per year, most frequently between the evening and the early morning, and exhibit a weak seasonal dependence. More than half of all type- 1 and type- 2 events last only one or two hours...|$|E
