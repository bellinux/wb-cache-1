The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that [...] "one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300mg, didn't perform {{the same as the}} brand-name pill in the lab." [...] The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that [...] "Budeprion XL 300mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300mg." [...] The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.|$|E

The conversion had also reduced the water capacity of R707's tender such that there was insufficient margin for delays or bad weather running on many routes, confining the locomotive to the shorter Melbourne to Geelong and Seymour lines.
