50|$|PICMG 2.10 is a {{specification}} by PICMG {{that defines}} {{the use of the}} keying mechanisms defined in IEC 1076-4-101 for the J4/P4 connector and in IEEE 1101.10 for handle and cardguide hardware. Backplanes can be designed for 3.3V VIO or 5V VIO operation. These are differentiated by having 'Cadmium Yellow' colored keys for 3.3V or 'Brilliant Blue' color for 5V operation. If the cPCI card operates on a particular VIO voltage the card shall have the respective colored coding key. If the card is compatible with both voltages then it may not have any coding key. Other <b>coding</b> <b>keys</b> exists for use of backplanes and cards that support PICMG 2.5.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{complementary}} <b>code</b> <b>keying</b> modulation (SCCKM) {{is proposed}} as a novel block coding modulation scheme. An input binary sequence is modulated {{based on the}} different lengths of complementary <b>code</b> <b>keying</b> (CCK) modulation and then spread across the transmit antennas (spatial domain) in a {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system exploiting orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). At the receiver side, zero forcing equalization is applied to the OFDM modulated data to mitigate the effect of the multipath fast fading channel and then followed by maximum likelihood (ML) detection to retrieve the input sequence. The performance of SCCKM in different MIMO systems is compared to that of spatial modulation (SM) as a baseline scheme. Simulation results show that for the same spectral efficiency, SCCKM is able to substantially improve the bit error rate (BER). Comment: IEEE VTC Fall 201...|$|R
