5|$|One of Girdap's notable {{enterprises}} was {{the international}} transport company Transbalkania {{which had a}} capital of 100,000 leva. Of the company's 500 shares, 200 were owned by Girdap and another 170 were owned by three of the bank's managers or employees. Liquidated after World War I, Transbalkania was active as a carrier from Bulgaria to Edirne, Alexandroupoli, Thessaloniki and Niš and along the Danube. During the wars, Girdap was involved in tobacco trade and had warehouses in modern Dupnitsa, Blagoevgrad and Xanthi. This led {{to the establishment of}} another Girdap venture, the Bulgarian Macedonian Bank (Balgarska makedonska banka), on 21 May 1916. The Bulgarian Macedonian Bank was mostly active as a commercial bank, which is indicated by its capital of 46.95 million leva as opposed to only 13.31 million leva of deposits. Other banks more or less related to Girdap included the Sofia Bank (Sofiyska banka, established in 1906), the Bulgarian Forest Commercial Bank (Balgarska gorsko-targovska banka, established in 1917), and the Bulgarian Surety Bank (Balgarska garantsionna banka, established in 1912). The Pleven-based Lev cement factory was founded in 1917 with Girdap board of managers member Ivan Kovachev as <b>chief</b> <b>shareholder.</b> Ninety percent of the capital of the Kurilo mine in the Iskar Gorge was controlled by Girdap or its head figures Ivan Kovachev and Boncho Boev.

The corporation and its affiliates opposed extension of Rural Electrification Administration (REA)-generated electrical power to rural areas, which its directors and <b>chief</b> <b>shareholders</b> {{saw as a}} captive territory for AP&L's own eventual expansion. Fewer than half of Arkansas farm homes had electricity in 1948. REA-affiliated cooperatives, however, guided by Harry L.

Mr. Lucullus Fyshe traded off a quarter of his stock to an unwary member of the Mausoleum Club at a drop of thirty per cent, and being too prudent to hold the rest on any terms, he conveyed it at once as a benefaction in trust to the Plutorian Orphans' and Foundlings' Home; while the purchaser of Mr. Fyshe's stock, learning too late of his folly, rushed for his lawyers to have the shares conveyed as a gift to the Home for Incurables.|$|R

60|$|There {{are seven}} {{different}} grades in the service. First, the labourer, who {{is ready to}} turn his hand to anything; to become a trapper, fisherman, or rough carpenter at the shortest notice. He is generally employed in cutting firewood for the consumption of the establishment at which he is stationed, shovelling snow from before the doors, mending all sorts of damages {{to all sorts of}} things, and, during the summer months, in transporting furs and goods between his post and the nearest depot. Next in rank is the interpreter. He is, for the most part, an intelligent labourer, of pretty long standing in the service, who, having picked up a smattering of Indian, is consequently very useful in trading with the natives. After the interpreter comes the postmaster; usually a promoted labourer, who, for good behaviour or valuable services, has been put upon a footing with the gentlemen of the service, in the same manner that a private soldier in the army is sometimes raised to the rank of a commissioned officer. At whatever station a postmaster may happen to be placed, he is generally the most useful and active man there. He is often placed in charge of one of the many small stations, or outposts, throughout the country. Next are the apprentice clerks--raw lads, who come out fresh from school, with their mouths agape at the wonders they behold in Hudson Bay. They generally, for the purpose of appearing manly, acquire all the bad habits of the country as quickly as possible, and are stuffed full of what they call fun, with a strong spice of mischief. They become more sensible and sedate before they get through {{the first five years of}} their apprenticeship, after which they attain to the rank of clerks. The clerk, after a number of years' service (averaging from thirteen to twenty), becomes a chief trader (or half-shareholder), and in a few years more he attains the highest rank to which any one can rise in the service, that of <b>chief</b> factor (or <b>shareholder).</b>|$|R
40|$|Because {{environmental}} information reporting remains voluntary {{on an international}} scale, there are major {{difference in terms of}} quality and quantity of {{environmental information}}, reported by entities from varied sectors and countries. Within this study, I have focused on internal characteristics, consisting mainly in how the entity is managed, in order to identify the existence of certain associations between the characteristics of corporate governance and the existence of environmental reporting. The literature in the field suggests various results related to the correspondence between corporate governance characteristics and environmental reporting. Within the factors suggested by the literature are the board structure, presence of the board committee, the separation between the Chairman of the Board and the <b>Chief</b> Executive Officer, <b>shareholder</b> structure. The paper represent an empirical analyze on how corporate governance characteristics might explain the level of environmental reporting. I suggest a model comprising corporate governance characteristics like: board independence, board size, existence of a Social Responsibility Committee that could explain environmental reporting. The sample comprises 48 companies listed at London Stock Exchange FTSE 100. From FTSE 100 I select only the companies that activates in sectors of activity that may {{have an impact on the}} environment such as Aerospace & Defence, Automobiles & Parts, Beverages, Chemicals, Electricity, Food & Drug Retailers, Food Producers, Gas, Water & Multiutilities, General Industrials, Health Care Equipment & Services, Household Goods, Industrial Engineering, Mining, Oil & Gas Producers, Oil Equipment, Services & Distribution, Personal Goods, Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology, Tobacco. My results show that, from the point of view of the London Stock Exchange FTSE 100 listed companies, the presence of an environmental committee in the board help reduce the conflict of interests between the stakeholders and the company's management regarding the disclosure of environmental information. The environmental committee monitors the companyâ€™s activity regarding the impact on the environmental, bringing about increasing transparency, and independence inside the board regarding environmental aspects. For assuring a high transparency level of environmental performance within a company, the board should ensure a sufficiently large number of members able to exercise an independent reasoning in order to solve potential conflict of interest. The directors represent the interests of the stakeholders and have more influence on reporting information regarding environmental aspects...|$|R

Although attempts were made to raise the necessary finance, and two Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1772 and 1774, to give additional powers to local commissioners, no real progress was made, and in 1779, the 'Company of Undertakers of the Lagan Navigation' was formed.
