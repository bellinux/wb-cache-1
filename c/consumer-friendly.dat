25|$|These <b>consumer-friendly</b> {{policies}} {{helped to}} make Oriole Park at Camden Yards the fastest ballpark to welcome 50 million fans, just 17 years after it opened. During that time, Oriole Park trailed only Dodger Stadium and Yankee Stadium in attendance. In 2008, the Orioles welcomed their 100 millionth fan in franchise history.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the club}} was founded before amateur {{photography}} was widespread, many early members were more advanced practitioners, a handful even making modest advances in photo technology. Even after more <b>consumer-friendly</b> processes came online in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some club members continued to attract notice. Starting no later than the early 1890s, the Boston Camera Club has awarded honorary life membership on two classes of deserving individuals: its own members having given extraordinary service to the club, and outside personalities in the Boston area for signal photographic achievement.|$|E

25|$|In July 2007, the European Commission accused Intel of {{anti-competitive}} practices, mostly against AMD. The allegations, {{going back}} to 2003, include giving preferential prices to computer makers buying {{most or all of}} their chips from Intel, paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips, and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions. Intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as <b>consumer-friendly.</b> General counsel Bruce Sewell responded that the Commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions as to pricing and manufacturing costs.|$|E
25|$|Under Angelos' leadership, the Orioles {{adopted a}} wide range of <b>consumer-friendly</b> {{policies}} at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The franchise's Fan Cost Index metric consistently ranks among the best values in Major League Baseball for tickets, food, beverages and parking for a family of four. The franchise allows fans to bring food and beverages into the park to save on costs. In 2009, the team created a “Birdland Stimulus Package” with discounts and affordable entertainment options for families and the team's refund and exchange policy is one of the league's most liberal, allowing fans a great deal of scheduling flexibility. The club also received strong reviews for relaxing its refund policy during a bizarre rainout in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|As of October 16, 2008, Arizona {{has one of}} {{the most}} <b>consumer-friendly</b> net {{metering}} laws in the country. Excess generation is rolled over month to month, and any surplus is returned annually to the consumer at the avoided cost rate. IREC best practices, based on experience, recommends perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Arizona had 642 MW of rooftop solar in 2015. [...] Historically, the states' utilities have led repeated, failed efforts to eliminate net metering. [...] But after a year of wrangling with the solar industry, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) decided in December 2016 to lower net-metering reimbursement rates significantly, leading to a temporary lull in rooftop solar installations because the lower rates made solar installations less economical for most residential and commercial installations.|$|E
2500|$|US {{distribution}} {{was handled}} by Universal, whose executives felt the ending tested poorly. Universal chairman Sid Sheinberg {{insisted on a}} dramatic re-edit of the film {{to give it a}} happy ending, cutting out the reveal that it was all in Sam's mind, a decision that Gilliam resisted vigorously. At one point, there were two editing teams working on the film, one without Gilliam's knowledge. As with the cult science fiction film Blade Runner (1982), which had been released three years earlier, a version of Brazil was created by the studio with a more <b>consumer-friendly</b> ending. After a lengthy delay with no sign of the film being released, Gilliam took out a full-page ad in the trade magazine Variety urging Sheinberg to release Brazil in its intended version. Gilliam soon conducted private screenings of Brazil (without the studio's approval) for film schools and local critics. On the same night Universal's award contender Out of Africa premiered in New York, Brazil was awarded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for [...] "Best Picture". This prompted Universal to finally agree to release a modified 132-minute version supervised by Gilliam, in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|AT Mobility v. Concepcion, , is a {{legal dispute}} that was decided by the United States Supreme Court. [...] On April 27, 2011, the Court ruled, by a 5–4 margin, that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 preempts state laws that {{prohibit}} contracts from disallowing class-wide arbitration, such as the law previously upheld by the California Supreme Court {{in the case of}} Discover Bank v. Superior Court. [...] As a result, businesses that include arbitration agreements with class action waivers can require consumers to bring claims only in individual arbitrations, rather than in court as part of a class action. [...] The decision was described by Jean Sternlight as a [...] "tsunami that is wiping out existing and potential consumer and employment class actions" [...] and by law professor Myriam Gilles as [...] "the real game-changer for class action litigation". [...] By April 2012, Concepcion was cited in at least 76 decisions sending putative class actions to individual arbitration. [...] After the decision, several major businesses introduced or changed arbitration terms in their consumer contracts (some of which were based on the <b>consumer-friendly</b> terms found in the AT Mobility agreement), although the hypothesis of massive adoption of consumer arbitration clauses following the decision has been disputed.|$|E
2500|$|CarMax is a {{used car}} auto superstore concept {{developed}} in 1991 at Circuit City by Austin Ligon, then Circuit City's Senior VP of Planning, and Rick Sharp, then Circuit City CEO. The goal of CarMax was to revolutionize used car retailing {{through a combination of}} large selection (400+ used cars at each store); low, no-haggle pricing; guaranteed quality; and a <b>consumer-friendly</b> shopping experience. The first location opened in Richmond, Virginia in September 1993. CarMax grew slowly for its first four years as the team refined the basic concept, then went public through an IPO as a [...] "tracking stock" [...] (KMX) of Circuit City in February 1997. The offering was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and raised more than $400mm for a 20% interest in the company, with Circuit City retaining the remaining 80% ownership. CarMax used the proceeds to repay Circuit City's initial $170mm investment in the company, then used the remainder to grow rapidly, adding 27 more stores from 1997 to 2000, and turning its first profit in FY2001. Circuit City sold a further 10% of its interest in CarMax in July 2001 for $140mm, with proceeds going to Circuit City. CarMax was spun off from Circuit City in a tax free distribution to shareholders in October 2002 to allow both companies to grow and be valued independently. The stock distribution provided Circuit City shareholders with KMX stock valued at over $1.2bn {{at the time of the}} spin off in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Mosel {{is one of}} 13 German wine regions (Weinbaugebiete) {{for quality}} wines (Qualitätswein, {{formerly}} QbA and Prädikatswein), and {{takes its name from}} the Mosel River (. Luxembourgish: Musel.). Before 1 August 2007 the region was called Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, but changed to a name that was considered more <b>consumer-friendly.</b> The wine region is Germany's third largest in terms of production but some consider it the leading region in terms of international prestige. The region covers the valleys of the rivers Mosel, Saar, and Ruwer from near the mouth of the Mosel at Koblenz and upstream to the vicinity of Trier in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The area is known for the steep slopes of the region's vineyards overlooking the river. At 65° degrees incline, the steepest recorded vineyard in the world is the Calmont vineyard located on the Mosel and belonging to the village of Bremm, and therefore referred to as Bremmer Calmont. The Mosel is mainly famous for its wines made from the Riesling grape, but Elbling and Müller-Thurgau also contribute to the production, among others. In the past two decades red wine production, especially from the Spätburgunder (Pinot noir), has increased in the Mosel and throughout the German vignoble and has become of increasing interest to the international wine community. Because of the northerly location of the Mosel, the Riesling wines are often light, tending to lower alcohol, crisp and high in acidity, and often exhibit [...] "flowery" [...] rather than or in addition to [...] "fruity" [...] aromas. Its most common vineyard soil is derived in the main from various kinds of slate deposits, which tend to give the wines a transparent, mineralic aspect, that often exhibit great depth of flavor. In the current era of climate change much work has been done to improve and gain acceptance for completely dry ("Trocken") Rieslings in this region, so that most of the more famous makers have found acceptance for such wines, particularlly in Europe.|$|E
