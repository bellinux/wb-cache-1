40|$|Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs any {{transaction}} {{which creates}} a security interest in personal property or fixtures. Generally {{when there is}} a conflict between secured parties in the same collateral, the UCC’s default priority rule declares the first secured party to file a financing statement or perfect its interest to have priority. However, section 9 - 308 creates an exception to this default rule when the security interest is claimed in <b>chattel</b> <b>paper.</b> <b>Chattel</b> <b>paper</b> is a group of writings taken together that evidence both a monetary obligation and a security interest in or a lease of specific goods. Section 9 - 308 gives priority to a purchaser of <b>chattel</b> <b>paper</b> that perfects its interest in the <b>chattel</b> <b>paper</b> by taking possession. This thesis reviews Article 9 ’s “first-to-file” rule and critiques the exception to this rule found in section 9 - 308, with the author suggesting section 9 - 308 is unnecessary and should be deleted...|$|E
40|$|Are {{investors in}} securitized {{receivables}} {{to be treated}} as the owners of an asset whose sale has taken it {{beyond the reach of the}} trustee in bankruptcy of their sellers? O are they {{to be treated as}} holders of a security interest in the transferred asset who have left behind an interest in the sellers 2 ̆ 7 hands that would cause the asset to be subject to claims and interference by the sellers 2 ̆ 7 grasping trustee? By adopting contrasting-arguably conflicting-statements in two subsections of a single section, the drafters of 1999 Article 9 have thrust this issue in the faces of courts and commentators. They did this by adopting section 9 - 318 which reads in full as follows: Section 9 - 318. No interest retained in right to payment that is sold; rights and title of seller of account or <b>chattel</b> <b>paper</b> with respect to creditors and purchasers. (a) [Seller retains no interest. ] A debtor that has sold an account, <b>chattel</b> <b>paper,</b> payment intangible, or promissory note does not retain a legal or equitable interest in the collateral sold. (b) [Deemed rights of debtor if buyer 2 ̆ 7 s security interest unperfected. ] For purposes of determining the rights of creditors of, and purchasers for value of an account or <b>chattel</b> <b>paper</b> from, a debtor that has sold an account or <b>chattel</b> <b>paper,</b> while the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s security interest is unperfected, the debtor is deemed to have rights and title to the account or <b>chattel</b> <b>paper</b> identical to those the debtor sold. Subsection (a) embraces the securitizers 2 ̆ 7 position; it unequivocally indorses the form of the transaction. Upon 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 everything is gone: all is beyond the grasp of the trustee. There are no qualifications; neither perfection, nor notice, nor any other act is required. This 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 of receivables is as much a 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 as the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s sale of inventory to a buyer for value would be a 2 ̆ 2 sale. 2 ̆ 2 But subsection (b) looks to the substance of the transaction and rejects the form. Here a 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 of certain covered receivables is the grant of a 2 ̆ 2 security interest. 2 ̆ 2 Like the grant of a security interest, this sale without perfection leaves behind fragments of title large enough to give purchase to the sellers 2 ̆ 7 creditors. Of course lawyers are accustomed to ignoring form and following substance, and of doing the opposite. What is different here is that the drafters ask us-with respect to the same transaction-to do one in subsection (a) (respect form) and the other in subsection (b) (ignore form). It may be possible to make the two subsections get along with one another, but it requires work. On their face, they appear inconsistent. I am not the first to see the apparent inconsistency between the two subsections. Members of the drafting committee saw it, 2 ̆ 7 and the use of the verb 2 ̆ 2 deemed 2 ̆ 2 in subsection (b) shows that the drafters anticipated this claim. In this article I consider how we came to this place and whether the drafters have successfully found a path through this thicket that will allow them to satisfy the securitizers (all is gone with a sale) and the creditors of a seller whose buyer has not perfected (enough is left behind despite a sale to give the creditors a hold) without, at the same time, giving purchase to the trustee in bankruptcy of a seller of perfected, securitized receivables...|$|E

40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, temperance {{movements}} provided {{the occasion for}} a transnational discourse. These conversations possessed an intensity throughout Britain and the United States. In America temperance often became associated with strongly nationalistic Euro-American forms of identity and internal purity. Nonetheless, African American reformers and abolitionists bound themselves to temperance ideals in forming civil societies that would heal persons and provide communal modes of democratic freedom in the aftermath and recovery from <b>chattel</b> slavery. This <b>paper</b> explores the possibilities of temperance as a transnational discourse by considering its meaning in the life and work of the African American author and activist, William Wells Brown. Brown expressed a “creole civilization” that employed the stylistics of the trickster as a unique mode of restraint that revealed a peculiar power of passivity that was able to claim efficacy over one’s life and community. This meaning of temperance diverges from and dovetails with certain European meanings of civilization that were being forged in the nineteenth century. Brown was in conversation with temperance reformers in America, Britain, and Europe. He imagined the possible meaning of temperance in African, Egyptian, Christian, and Islamic civilizations. He speculated upon the possibility of temperance as a defining characteristic of a transnational civilization and culture that would provide spaces {{for the expression of}} democratic freedom. Brown reimagined temperance as a form of corporeal restraint that offered a direct and sacred relation to the land, space, people that appeared in between an ethnic nationalist ethos and the European imperialistic civilization. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although leases, consignments, {{and sales}} of {{accounts}} and <b>chattel</b> <b>paper</b> annually result in commercial transactions involving many billions of dollars, the Uniform Commercial Code, which establishes the legal framework for these transactions, provides only a few sentences of guidance for the practitioner or judge seeking {{to determine whether a}} transaction denominated as a lease, consignment, or sale of accounts or <b>chattel</b> <b>paper</b> is in fact a secured transaction subject to all provisions of article 9 of the Code. In this Article, Mr. Peter F. Coogan, a consultant to the Committee To Review Article 9, examines in detail the provisions of section 1 - 201 (37), which defines a security interest, and develops the history of this section. Concluding that the standards established by section 1 - 201 (37) are lacking in the precision and clarity needed to make the difficult decision of when a transaction is indeed a true lease as opposed to a disguised secured transaction, Mr. Coogan considers whether leases-like sales of account and chattel paper-should be subjected to {{some or all of the}} provisions of article 9 in order to make this determination. The author finds the application of these provisions to leases unsatisfactory; and he consequently turns to the standards of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act, the tax bar, and the accounting profession in an effort to establish useful standards in this area. Finally, Mr. Coogan recommends that, at a minimum, a more direct treatment of this problem should be incorporated into the Code, indicating that the standards and precedents of the UCSA provide the best guidelines for determining whether a transaction is a true lease or a secured transaction...|$|E
40|$|The Act is principally {{aimed at}} {{fine-tuning}} the central indexing system for article 9 filings {{created by the}} General Assembly in 1993. It amends article 9 of title 11, relating to secured transactions, sales of accounts, and <b>chattel</b> <b>paper,</b> to define further what is required on a financing statement, amendment, continuance, assignment, release, or termination. It also provides for the transmission of that information to the central indexing system and specifies what information that system is to maintain. The act defines notice filing and renders ineffective terms in contracts which prohibit assignment, prohibits filing under a trade name if that filing would be misleading to those searching the central index, and strikes former provisions dealing with effective dates and {{the transition to the}} central indexing system...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{focus of}} Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) has always dealt with transactions intended {{by the parties}} to create security interests in personal property. In 1998, the sponsors of the UCC approved a sweeping revision of Article 9; however, {{the main focus of}} the Article was not changed. § 9 - 109 (a) (1) of revised Article 9 provides: 2 ̆ 2 [e]xcept as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and (d), this Article applies to (1) a transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or fixtures by contract, 2 ̆ 2 and § 1 - 201 (37) of the Code, although modified to conform to some changes made in Article 9, retained the general definition of security interest quoted above without change. Nevertheless, Article 9 continues to apply to some transactions that are not intended to create security interests. Revised § 9 - 109 (a) (3) provides that, subject to exceptions in subsections (c) and (d), the Article applies to 2 ̆ 2 a sale of accounts, <b>chattel</b> <b>paper,</b> payment intangibles, or promissory notes. 2 ̆ 2 This Article has two objectives: (1) to explore the reasons for including some outright sales of personal property within the scope of Article 9 and the effect of such inclusions on the status of buyers and sellers of such property, and (2) to identify {{the difference between the two}} versions of the Article in their treatment of sales of personal property as secured transactions...|$|E
