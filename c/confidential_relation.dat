40|$|Recent {{discussion}} of euthanasia {{in the field}} of medical ethics reveals two major features. First, it is clear that there are many academics in opposition to a distinction being made between active euthanasia, which is the act of killing a patient on request through the administration of drugs, and passive euthanasia, which is primarily the withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment. Second, there are also many people in the field who are focusing on the subject from a human relations viewpoint. Namely, they note that reciprocal relations among patients, their family members and health care providers are influenced by euthanasia policies. Much of the present study examines this latter point. In this study, I first examine the two features from a perspective representative of Japanese moral philosophers. Additionally, I clarify the similarities and　distinctions inherent in them. Next, I consider the noteworthy views prevalent in German literature. In recent years, German researchers have placed a greater emphasis on respecting the wishes of patients. Similarly, they have taken into consideration the importance of developing <b>confidential</b> <b>relations</b> between doctors and patients. They not only discuss the influence that permission to conduct active euthanasia may have on human relations, but also consider the conditions necessary for <b>confidential</b> <b>relations</b> among medical staff, patients and family members. 安楽死を巡る医療倫理における近年の議論では、次のような二つの主要な特徴を指摘できる。第一は、致死薬投与による積極的安楽死と延命治療停止等による消極的安楽死との旧来の区別立てを否定する、というものである。第二は、安楽死に関して人間関係という側面からの検討がなされていることである。すなわち、安楽死政策が医療者と患者及び家族との相互的な関係性に対して及ぼす影響、そして、医療者と患者間の信頼関係構築という観点からの考察である。本稿では、とくに二つ目の特徴に注目したい。まず、第一の特徴と第二の特徴を示している日本の代表的論者による論述を検討する。そして、そこにある共通点と相違点、さらには注目すべき指摘を提示する。次に、終末期医療のあり方を人間関係という観点からの考察を深めることで、いくつかの有意義な視点を提示したい。この目的のために、本稿では、終末期医療を巡るドイツ語圏における論考を分析する。なぜなら、ドイツは近年、終末期医療の決定に関して、可能な限り患者本人の意思を反映させようとすると同時に、医療者と患者及び家族の相互的な人間関係のあり方を模索し続けてきたからである。そのためドイツでは、積極的臨死介助（積極的安楽死）容認が医者・患者間の人間関係に影響を及ぼすという観点からの検討だけでなく、医師・患者間の信頼関係が育まれる場面についての掘り下げられた考察がなされている...|$|R

50|$|The first intimation of her protégé's growing favour {{with the}} Queen {{came to the}} Duchess {{in the summer of}} 1707, when she learned that Abigail Hill had been privately married to a gentleman of the Queen's Household named Samuel Masham, and that the Queen herself had been present at the marriage. Churchill then found that Abigail had, for some time, enjoyed {{considerable}} intimacy with her Royal mistress, no hint of which had previously reached the Duchess. Abigail was also on her father's side a cousin of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford (his mother Abigail Stephens was a niece of her grandmother, also Abigail Stephens), and after Oxford's dismissal from office in February 1708, she assisted him in maintaining <b>confidential</b> <b>relations</b> with the Queen. The completeness of her ascendancy was seen in 1710 when the Queen compelled Marlborough, much against his will, to give an important command to Colonel John Hill, Abigail's brother.

I replied--and I beg you will give your best attention to what I am now going to say--I replied to that, 'It is not fair to charge me with suspecting her.

I claim it as my right to be satisfied on both those points--in the character of the man who is to marry her.' There was my answer. I spare you all that followed. I only repeat what I said to Lady Janet. She has commanded you to be silent. If you obey her commands, I owe it to myself and I owe it to my family to release you from your engagement.

The entente with France is all right in its way, but I {{came to the conclusion that}} the greatest and broadest stroke of diplomacy possible to Englishmen to-day was to cultivate more benevolent and more <b>confidential</b> <b>relations</b> with Germany. That same feeling has been spreading through the Cabinet during the last two years. I am ready to take my share of the blame or praise, whichever in the future shall be allotted to the inspirer of that idea. It is our hope that when the present Government goes out of office, one of its chief claims to public approval and to historical praise will be the improvement of our relations with Germany. We certainly do not wish to disturb the growing confidence which exists between the two countries by any maladroit or unnecessary investigations. We believe, in short, that Germany's attitude towards us is friendly, and we intend to treat her in the same spirit." ...|$|R

In 1783, when the Brilliant was paid off, Wright was sent to a school at Wandsworth, where he remained for two years.

He was introduced to Sir Sidney Smith, and at his request joined the [...] in the spring of 1794 with the rating of midshipman, and apparently doing duty as captain's clerk for Smith; Wright seems to have described himself as ‘the secretary of his friend.’ After nearly two years on the coast of France, he was with Smith on the night of 18-19 April 1796, when both were taken prisoner. His <b>confidential</b> <b>relations</b> to Smith secured him the particular attentions of the French government; he was sent with Smith to Paris, was confined in the Temple as a close prisoner, was repeatedly examined as to Smith's designs, and finally effected his escape with Smith in May 1798.

60|$|Mrs. Bolton made no {{advances}} with Annie {{toward the}} discussion of her friends; but when Annie asked about their families, she answered with the incisive directness of a country-bred woman. She delivered her judgments as she went about her work, {{the morning after the}} ladies' visit, while Annie sat before the breakfast-table, which she had given her leave to clear. As she passed in and out from the dining-room to the kitchen she kept talking; she raised her voice in the further room, and lowered it when she drew near again. She wore a dismal calico wrapper, which made no compromise with the gauntness of her figure; her reddish-brown hair, which grew in a fringe below her crown, was plaited into small tags or tails, pulled up and tied across the top of her head, the bare surfaces of which were curiously mottled with the dye which she sometimes put on her hair. Behind, this was gathered up into a small knob pierced with a single hair-pin; the arrangement left Mrs. Bolton's visage to the unrestricted expression of character. She did not let it express toward Annie any expectation of the <b>confidential</b> <b>relations</b> that are supposed to exist between people who have been a long time master and servant. She had never recognised her relations with the Kilburns in these terms. She was a mature Yankee single woman, of confirmed self-respect, when she first came as house-keeper to Judge Kilburn, twenty years ago, and she had not changed her nature in changing her condition by her marriage with Oliver Bolton; she was childless, unless his comparative youth conferred a sort of adoptive maternity upon her.|$|R

Anything that was enormous usually found favor with Newman, and the multitudinous energies and industries of England stirred within him a dull vivacity of contemplation. It is on record that the weather, at that moment, was of the finest English quality; he took long walks and explored London in every direction; he sat by the hour in Kensington Gardens and beside the adjoining Drive, watching the people and the horses and the carriages; the rosy English beauties, the wonderful English dandies, and the splendid flunkies. He went to the opera and found it better than in Paris; he went to the theatre and found a surprising charm in listening to dialogue the finest points of which came within the range of his comprehension. He made several excursions into the country, recommended by the waiter at his hotel, with whom, on this and similar points, he had established <b>confidential</b> <b>relations.</b> He watched the deer in Windsor Forest and admired the Thames from Richmond Hill; he ate white-bait and brown-bread and butter at Greenwich, and strolled in the grassy shadow of the cathedral of Canterbury. He also visited the Tower of London and Madame Tussaud's exhibition. One day he thought he would go to Sheffield, and then, thinking again, he gave it up. Why should he go to Sheffield? He had a feeling that the link which bound him to a possible interest in the manufacture of cutlery was broken. He had no desire for an [...] "inside view" [...] of any successful enterprise whatever, and he would not have given the smallest sum for the privilege of talking over the details of the most [...] "splendid" [...] business with the shrewdest of overseers.|$|R
