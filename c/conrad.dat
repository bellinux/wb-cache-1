50|$|As <b>Conrad's</b> {{earliest}} novel, Almayer's Folly {{is often}} seen by critics as inferior to the author's later work because of its repetitive and at times awkward language.

40|$|Published {{a century}} after <b>Conrad’s</b> Heart of Darkness, Pauline Melville’s The Ventriloquist’s Tale (1997) raises the {{question}} of how interpretations of alterity and hybridity have developed. Reading Melville’s provocative text as a creative response to <b>Conrad’s</b> portrayal of the “uncouth sounds” of babbling Africans, I investigate how Melville both complicates <b>Conrad’s</b> tale of imperial incursions and reverses the Conradian journey into mysterious darkness, revealing a visionary approach reminiscent of Wilson Harris’s cross‐cultural imagination. Finally, I argue that Melville challenges both <b>Conrad’s</b> vision of the site of darkness as well as recent critical interpretations of hybridity...|$|R

[...] "Do you speak English?... I never wished you to become naturalized in France, {{mainly because of the}} compulsory military service...

5|$|In Asia Minor, <b>Conrad</b> {{decided not}} {{to wait for the}} French, and marched towards Iconium, capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm. <b>Conrad</b> split his army into two divisions. Much of the {{authority}} of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads. <b>Conrad</b> underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case. <b>Conrad</b> took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road. The king led one of these, which was almost totally destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} argues {{the priority}} of politics {{in the interpretation of}} <b>Conrad's</b> fiction. It does so by establishing a critical dialogue with, and around, Fredric Jameson's Marxist classic, The Political Unconscious (1981). Jameson's proposition that <b>Conrad's</b> fiction is to be understood as a """"Political Unconscious"""" - that is, that <b>Conrad's</b> works produce political meanings {{in the same way that}} Freud suggested thwarted human instincts produce neuroses or psychopathologies - is put to the test here. This dissertaion seeks to extend the application of Jameson's hypothesis into some of the areas of <b>Conrad's</b> oeuvre that Jameson himself did not treat, or treated only briefly...|$|R

He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, Henry, as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, Emeric {{had a strong}} claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother. Emperor <b>Conrad</b> planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop Werner of Strasbourg, to Constantinople. In the autumn of 1027, the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country. <b>Conrad</b> II's biographer Wipo of Burgundy narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in {{relations between the two}} countries.|$|E
