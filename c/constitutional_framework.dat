5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus {{restored}} the outward fa√ßade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting <b>constitutional</b> <b>framework</b> became known as the Principate, {{the first phase of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E

A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution.

40|$|This {{research}} {{reflects on}} the debt management problem in Zimbabwe. Like any other country Zimbabwe has a <b>Constitutional</b> legal <b>framework</b> that touches on debt management. The major issue at hand is why Zimbabwe is failing to sustain its external debt stock whilst it has a <b>Constitutional</b> legal <b>framework</b> that focuses on debt management. The study hypothesized that inadequacy of the <b>Constitutional</b> legal <b>frameworks</b> has led to unsustainable debt. The research utilized purposive and snowball sampling in selecting the key respondents. Data was gathered through document study, questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires were administered to key respondents {{and in some cases}} interviews were concurrently held. Though the <b>Constitutional</b> legal <b>frameworks</b> provide for the institutional set up to undertake debt management and provide for the legality of loan contraction, the research revealed that the <b>Constitutional</b> legal <b>frameworks</b> are inadequate in other matters relating to debt management. Research findings demonstrated that the <b>Constitutional</b> legal <b>frameworks</b> do not specify the loan contraction process, void on external borrowing ceiling and does not clearly provide for the circumstances under which borrowing is permissible and makes loan contraction exclusive. It is in light of these lacunas that the recommendations were premised on. The study promotes the strengthening of <b>Constitutional</b> legal <b>frameworks</b> relating to debt management...|$|R

In 1931, Friedrich Granier was the first to propose that by the time of Philip II's reign, Macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups, especially to its citizen soldiers, although the majority of evidence for the army's alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from the reign of Alexander III of Macedon. Pietro de Francisci was the first to refute these ideas and advance the theory that the Macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by the whim of the monarch, although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{international}} studies, specifically a study of <b>constitutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> in Africa {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century, focussing on a statistical correlation between <b>constitutional</b> <b>frameworks,</b> party systems, electoral systems and the Index of Democracy. The struggle to consolidate new democracies - especially those in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia - has given rise to a wide-ranging debate about the hard choices concerning democratic political institutions and political markets. According to Stepan and Skach " this literature has produced provocative hypotheses about the effects of institutions on democracy" (Stepan and Skach, 1993 : 1). It forms part of the' new institutionalism I literature in comparative politics that'holds as a premise that political democracy depends not only on economic and social conditions but also on the design of political institutions (Koelble, 1995 : 231 - 243). " One fundamental political-institutional question that has only received serious scholarly attention concerns the impact of different <b>constitutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> on democratic consolidation. Although the topic has been increasingly debated and discussed, little systematic cross-regional evidence [especially for our field of research: Africa] has been brought to bear on it " (Stepan and Skach, 1993 : 1 - 2). So far, only the book"on regime transitions in Africa written by Bratton and Van De Walle seeks to fill this empirical gap (Bratton and Van De Walle, 1997, preface xiii). In this thesis, we paid particular attention to the dichotomy between (pure) parliamentarism and (pure) presidentialism. Each type has fundamental characteristics, and for the purposes of classification these characteristics are necessary and sufficient. It was not our purpose to weigh the benefits a~d drawbacks of parliamentarism and presidentialism. Our intention was to report and analyse different sources of data, and we based our case exclusively on statistic correlatiohs between regime type and the record of democratic success and failure. We collected a data set about <b>constitutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> (matrix 1), democracy indices (matrix 2), party systems (matrix 3) and election systems (matrix 4). The basis for matrix 1 was the constitutions of the African countries (over time) and relevant literature. The basis for matrix 2 was the annual Freedom House ratings made by Raymond D. Gastil and others. The basis for matrix 3 and 4 was relevant literature. Once these matrices had been composed, we compared them and calculated statistic correlations. This long-dyration model allowed us to estimate whether African <b>constitutional</b> <b>frameworks,</b> party systems and electoral systems exhibit positive or negative correlation with the index of democracy. ...|$|R

The chapter sets off with the problem, objective, and motivation of the study. The chapter sets out the hypotheses of the study, the methodology used, and the review of the available literature. The chapter concludes with the clarifications of concepts used in the study. Chapter two makes a brief background legislative history by looking at the past <b>constitutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> and the political systems that might have influenced the Legislatures of the two countries. The chapter continues with the current <b>constitutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> of both countries and examines the Legislatures established under them. Chapter three starts with the crux of the study - the roles of both Legislatures and delves into their representation and participation roles. The chapter assesses the medium of representation and extent to which the general public gets involved and participates in the deliberations of the LG and LSA. Chapter four looks at the law-making role. The chapter looks into how through legislaiton both Legislatures flesh out their constituitonal values to create more tangible boundaries within which their citizens conduct their lives. Chapter five looks into the oversight role over the executive. The chapter looks into the mechanisms in place to oversee the executive, and to hold them to account on their performances. Chapter six concludes the study with a summary. It makes a comparative analysis of the LG and LSA. The chapter tests the hypotheses of the study. It looks also at the challenges of both Legislatures. The chapter concludes with recommendations aimed at effective performance of the Legislature in Ghana and South Africa. " [...] Chapter 1.

After defining the research topic and the geographical area relevant to this study, the author points out a series of methodological options available to those who intend to approach the matters under discussion. Such methodological options all focus on the concept of form of State, both in a diachronic and synchronic perspective; indeed, this analysis shows the inadequacy of the traditionally Self-centred method of comparison, which implies that the circulation of models develops exclusively: horizontally and homogeneously (with regard to types, e. g. the States). In conclusion, the author argues in favour of reconsidering a number of presumptions typical of comparative studies, with the aim of re-orienting them toward the supranational dimension of contemporary constitutionalism...|$|R
