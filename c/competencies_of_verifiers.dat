The population of research was all of the 8 th grade of the State Junior High School in Puworejo Regency on the second semester of 2014 / 2015 academic year. The hypothesis testing of research were conducted using a two-ways multivariate analysis of variance with different cells. The conclusions of {{this research}} were as follows. (1) DL provided better knowledge competency than PBL and TPS, while PBL and TPS was same. (2) DL and TPS provided same social attitude competency, and both provided better social attitude competency than PBL. (3) The knowledge <b>competency</b> <b>of</b> visual students was better than auditory and kinesthetic, and the knowledge <b>competency</b> <b>of</b> students in those types was same. (4) The social attitude <b>competency</b> <b>of</b> visual and auditory students was same, the social attitude <b>competency</b> <b>of</b> visual students was better than kinesthetic, the social attitude <b>competency</b> <b>of</b> auditory and kinesthetic students was same.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{objective}} of this research were to investigate Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and to study the influence of Knowledge Management (KM) on the core <b>competencies</b> <b>of</b> supervisors in the electricity generation process. The paper focuses in particular {{on the relationship between}} the KM process and the core <b>competencies</b> <b>of</b> supervisors. The paper is based on personal interviews. Data was collected from 635 supervisors involved in operation and maintenance of power plants utilizing a case study done in Thailand. A framework of the SEM of KM influencing the core <b>competencies</b> <b>of</b> supervisors was developed from a detailed literature review in an attempt to define the relationship between the KM process and the core <b>competencies</b> <b>of</b> supervisors in the electricity generation process. The applicability and validity of the framework were verified by quantitative research methods. Findings-The paper finds that hypotheses were tested using the SEM. Test of hypotheses revealed that the KM process positively and significantly influenced the core <b>competencies</b> <b>of</b> supervisors in the electricity generation process. These findings tend to corroborate our conceptual model and are also in line with the existing literature. The KM process was found to significantly affect the core <b>competencies</b> <b>of</b> supervisors, indicating the importance of the context and background of the KM process performing together in cases that affect the core competency.
