40|$|Background: The use {{of digital}} {{marketing}} channels {{during the last}} years has increased significantly, especially the use of marketing on the Internet. Hence the <b>communication</b> <b>chart</b> of marketing has been redrawn. The technological development has had {{a major impact on}} the marketing discipline. The integration of information technology and marketing has resulted in {{the emergence of a new}} field, namely e-marketing. Hence the need for further research is desirable. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine alternative marketing procedures that a company can apply to increase the digital awareness and manage their customer relationships. Theoretical framework: Theories regarding digital marketing cycle, SEO and customer relationship. Method: This research is based on data collected through a primary semi-structured interview with a company active in the corporate information industry which also provides a RFQ service. We have also conducted ten structured interviews with companies who have used the services provided by the primary company. Furthermore a content analysis regarding SEO has been completed. Conclusions: We have identified several alternative marketing procedures that can increase a company´s digital awareness and enable a successful managing of their customer relationships. These alternative marketing procedures have been concluded by use of the theoretical framework and then adapted toward our empiricism. Furthermore we have constructed distinct guidelines that create favorable conditions for the initiation and completion of the model digital marketing cycle...|$|E

40|$|Today {{development}} of national tax systems takes {{place under the}} decisive influence of tax competition. That is why there is no necessity in developing of theoretical and methodical vehicle for studying this phenomenon. Topicality of this subject is conditioned {{by the fact that}} understanding of character and features of tax competition are impossible without determination of its types. The {{purpose of this article is}} to define types of tax competition under conditions of globalization of world economy. Definition of forms and types of tax competition is debatable in economics literature; therefore today general approach is absent. Besides in most cases scientists lack unified approach when selecting and examining descriptions of tax competition classifications. Often researchers make no difference between such concepts as "type" and "form" of tax competition. Authors offer logical <b>communication</b> <b>chart</b> for such categories as "maintenance", "form", "type", and on this basis necessity to examine tax competition as form of economic competition is grounded and it is proposed to identify certain displays of tax competition that have general signs as well as its types but not as forms. On the basis of analogies method in relation to the signs of classifications of economic competition and taking into account works of economists in the field of tax competition authors suggest classification of types of tax competition based on the list of entries in accordance with their functions and status; territory of action; particular branch sign; instruments; methods of competitive activities; on the objects of tax competition; actions of participants in accordance with which fourteen types of tax competition are selected. Practical application of this classification will be necessary for deep understanding of the phenomenon of tax competition in all its variety. The prospect of subsequent scientific researches in this direction is the detailed analysis of certain displays of types of tax competition in Ukraine...|$|E

The approach began in the 1970 s with the recognition that mass media has its limitations in fostering national development; a more participatory development theory emerged stressing the importance of community involvement, interactive two-way communication, and small media. However, lately, with the globalization of media, the rise in entertainment programming, and questions about media's ubiquitous influence, entertainment-education represents the one specific trend for development that shows promise.

40|$|In a rapid {{changing}} technology environment, {{companies have}} to monitor and identify alternative relevant technologies which could either create an opportunity for future businesses or could be a barrier for growth of business. The right technologyplanning will ensure the very early identification and evaluation of technologies - which could be applied within products or production in future - leading to sustainable growth of companies in terms of responding to threats and gaining advantage in competition. Technology management processes are described in literature as a composition of five basic sub-processes: identification, selection, acquisition, exploitation and protection. Although many management tools {{have been developed for}} technology acquisition and protection there are f ew alternative tools for the identification sub-process. The management of that early phase is very difficult since decision makers are in a fuzzy environment with a lack of information. The approach of technology radar has been identified as an appropriate solution ensuring a structured and target-oriented identification and prioritization of technologies ensuring a profound decision making and knowledge management. The paper is about implementing the technology radar at a large R&D intensive company from white goods sector, namely Arcelik A. S. Therefore the method of technology radar needed to be adapted to company specific pre-conditions, like existing technology management processes, organizational structures and incorporated brands. Workshops were held to define requirement s and set up the appropriate boundaries for introducing the methodology. With the help of gained requirements the technology radar approach was adapted to specific needs and the whole technology radar process was defined including single knowledge flows, process steps, methods, roles and responsibilities. For testing defined technology radarp rocesses and methods like evaluation schemes or visual <b>communication</b> <b>charts</b> three search fields with corresponding pilot teams were implemented.

40|$|During {{its prime}} mission, Mars Exploration Rover (MER) had many shift handovers in its surface operations. Because of the {{increased}} rates of accidents and errors historically associated with shift handovers, MER Mission management paid close attention to shift handovers and, when possible, developed them in accordance with best handover practices. We review {{the most important of}} these best practices, and include a generic “Checklist for Effective Handovers ” to aid in the development of handovers. We present charts that depict structured information transfer across shifts. These charts show personnel schedules, meetings attended, handovers, and hand-offs on both the MER and on the earlier Mars Pathfinder Mission (MPF). It is apparent from these charts that although the MER Mission had a much larger number of surface operations personnel than MPF (approximately 300 vs. 178), and had three shifts instead of two, that it used many of the successful MPF <b>communication</b> strategies. <b>Charts</b> such as these can be helpful to those designing complicated and unique mission surface operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose and}} thesis of this {{dissertation}} {{project is to}} develop a resource manual which will facilitate the effective administration and management of small membership and Ethnic Minority congregations in the United Methodist denomination. The manual is significant in that it is designed specifically to address the need of small membership and Ethnic Minority Local Churches’ congregations. The manual provides the basic steps in the administrative process, and outlines keys for effective mission and ministry. The dissertation is divided into the following sections: an acknowledgement, preface, glossary, introduction, six chapters, a bibliography, and statistical tables. The introduction defines the designs and aims of the project. The rationale for small membership church administration is also included in the introduction. Chapter I, “Theological Foundation of Church Administration,” outlines the foundational understanding of theological and biblically—based church administration. The goals of church administration, ecclesiology, history and practical aspects of small membership church administration are delineated. The fundamental question of why, what, who and how of administration are addressed. Also, a brief look at liberation theology and its relation to the small membership church and Ethnic Minority Local Church is highlighted. The chapter concludes by listing what effective churches do. Chapter II looks at the basic characteristics of the small membership church and Ethnic Minority Local Church. The several ways in which these churches are unique are listed. Analyses of these churches are offered, with descriptions. In Chapter III, ‘~Organization for Administration,” specific guidelines in organizing for the administrative task are spelled out. Chapter IV gives the “Keys” of administration. Three (3) key ways to vital and effective churches are highlighted in this important chapter. Chapter V, a “nuts and bolts” approach is taken, which includes several practical ways to effective church administration. If these ways and suggestions are carefully followed, assurance of accomplishment is apparent. This chapter is important to the day—by—day, week—by—week, month—by—month administration of the church, its program, mission and outreach. Included in this chapter are the important concerns of time management and blocks to administration. Chapter VI “conclusion” describes in summary fashion the appropriateness of administration within small membership churches and Ethnic Minority Churches. A future projection for administration and a challenge to all to become more efficient in administration is offered. The monumental challenge of church administration is presented in the manual. The appendix includes examples of a way to contemporary administration and <b>communication.</b> <b>Charts,</b> graphics and tables have been included to aid the reader in ascertaining the information presented. Included in the overall project is the writer’s theory of ministry. The focus of the dissertation is the equipping of pastors and leaders for the effective execution of their responsibilities and duties, as servants of God...|$|R
