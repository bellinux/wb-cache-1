2500|$|Arizona is {{currently}} the most important producer of turquoise by value. Several mines exist in the state, two of them famous for their unique colour and quality and considered {{the best in the}} industry: the Sleeping Beauty Mine in Globe ceased turquoise mining in August 2012. The mine chose to send all ore to the crusher and to concentrate on copper production due to the rising price of copper on the world market. The price of natural untreated Sleeping Beauty turquoise has risen dramatically since the mine's closing. The Kingman Mine as of 2015 still operates alongside a copper mine outside of the city. Other mines include the Blue Bird mine, Castle Dome, and Ithaca Peak, but they are mostly inactive due to the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> and federal regulations [...] The Phelps Dodge Lavender Pit mine at Bisbee ceased operations in 1974 and never had a turquoise contractor. All Bisbee turquoise was [...] "lunch pail" [...] mined. It came out of the copper ore mine in miners' lunch pails. Morenci and Turquoise Peak are either inactive or depleted.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} multiple mobile robots navigating in a common workspace. Initially, {{based on the premise}} that the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the robots can be ignored, results regarding the probability of collision of two point robots in the workspace are derived. Obviously, these results depend on the geometry of the workspace, and hence they are derived for workspaces with various geometries. The results are then extended for two robots of finite dimensions. The question “Are k + 1 robots better than k? ” is then considered. Based on two modes <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> namely, the batch-scheduled mode and the list-scheduled mode, various theoretical results are derived. If the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the robots can be ignored, based on various computational results obtained, we conjecture that the answer to the question is in the affirmative in both modes <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Finally, by using the model of computation which includes the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the robots, the problem is revisited. We have shown that for various geometries and revenue to cost ratios, there are optimal finite values for the number of robots that can operate within the workspace. Expressions for these optimal values have been derived...|$|R
