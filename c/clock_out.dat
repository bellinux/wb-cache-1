5|$|Dallas {{opened the}} game with a 12-play, 75-yard drive ending with Tony Romo's 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Dez Bryant. The Bears scored the final touchdown of the first quarter on Josh McCown's 4-yard pass to Earl Bennett, the result of a 78-yard drive. With 8:58 left in the first half, McCown scored on a 7-yard run to take the lead 14–7, which the Cowboys answered with Romo's 10-yard pass to Jason Witten. After Robbie Gould kicked a 27-yard field goal, the Bears scored again after McCown threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, who caught the ball over B. W. Webb {{in the back of the}} endzone with 0:17 left in the half. On the first drive of the third quarter, Gould kicked a 34-yard field goal, which was bolstered by Matt Forté's 5-yard touchdown catch and Brandon Marshall scoring on a 2-point conversion to increase the score to 35–14. In the fourth quarter, Michael Bush scored on a 17-yard touchdown reception, and the Cowboys responded with a 9-yard touchdown catch by Cole Beasley. Gould eventually kicked a 23-yarder, while the Cowboys scored Joseph Randle's 1-yard run with six seconds to go. On the ensuing onside kick, the ball was recovered by Marshall, and McCown ran the <b>clock</b> <b>out</b> to seal the 45–28 win.|$|E
25|$|With 4:13 left in {{the fourth}} quarter, the Cardinals ended a 16-play, 87-yard drive with a 9-yard Edgerrin James run for a {{touchdown}} cutting the Rams lead 16–14. With 1:58 left to play, Bulger fumbled the ball at the Saint Louis 30. It was recovered by Arizona's Antonio Smith. Yet, on the third play of the drive, Warner fumbled the snap and the Rams' Will Witherspoon recovered the ball. The Rams ran the <b>clock</b> <b>out</b> and won the game 16–14.|$|E

25|$|In {{his great}} career Walter Payton rushed for an all-time career record 16,726 yards. The Bears earned a Divisional Playoff rematch with Redskins at Soldier Field. The Bears jumped {{out to a}} 14–0 lead early on only to see the Redskins storm {{back and take a}} 21–17 lead late in the game. As time was winding down on the season and Payton's career, the Bears need to score a {{touchdown}} late. The ball was in the hands of Payton who tried to extend his career, but on fourth down he was shoved out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker allowing the Redskins to run the <b>clock</b> <b>out.</b> Payton watched the rest of the game as he sat alone on the bench.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd, Tony Romo found Terrell Owens for a 12-yard {{touchdown}} pass {{that broke the}} tie. Then, a 33-yard field goal by Nick Folk sent the Cowboys into the 4th quarter with a 13–3 lead. Midway through the 4th, Jeff Reed connected on a 41-yard field goal to cut the Cowboys' lead to 13–6. Then, Ben Roethlisberger and Tight End Heath Miller hooked up for a 6-yard Steelers touchdown that tied the game at 13. On the ensuing Dallas possession, Tony Romo was intercepted by Deshea Townsend who returned it 25 yards for a touchdown, and Pittsburgh led 20–13. After the kickoff, the Cowboys failed to convert on a 4th-and-10 and the Steelers got the ball back. They were then able to run the <b>clock</b> <b>out</b> and seal the victory.|$|E
25|$|Leading 21–20 with 4 minutes {{remaining}} in the game, Saints punter Steve Weatherford made a successful coffin corner punt which pinned the Buccaneers at their own 2-yard line. Two plays later, Delaware Will Smith sacked McCown for a safety. After the safety kick, New Orleans looked to run the <b>clock</b> <b>out</b> and seal the victory. However, in an unexpected and perhaps season-altering mistake, Reggie Bush fumbled a double reverse intended for WR Devery Henderson and Jovan Haye recovered for Tampa Bay at the New Orleans 37-yard line. Three plays later, the Buccaneers {{found themselves in a}} predicament as they faced a fourth down and 1 at the New Orleans 28. Instead of attempting a game-tying field goal, however, coach Jon Gruden went for it on fourth down, calling a run around right tackle which Graham converted for a first down.

The drive was closed out by a James White 2-yard touchdown run but kicker Kyle French missed the extra point, the Badgers lead to 34–0. Punt by Tech, punt by Wisconsin and punt by Tech again. The Badgers took over at their own 20-yard line and got to Tech's 42-yard line as the third quarter came to a close. Wisconsin then turned the ball over on downs. The Badgers just looking to run the clock down, true freshman running back Corey Clement eight times on the next drive and scored on a 1-yard touchdown run extending the Wisconsin led to 41–0. On the next Tech drive, Badgers redshirt freshman safety Leo Musso got his first career interception. On the very next play, Corey Clement scampered 75 yards for his second touchdown of the game.

West was assisted by Baylor, who was a self-estimated [...] "75 percent" [...] of his pre-injury self, The two long-standing rivals split the first six games, with West's usual scoring dominance countered by Celtics forward John Havlicek, whose size and speed created serious mismatch problems for the Lakers. In Game 7, West and Baylor shot a combined three of 18 in the first half, and the Lakers fell far behind; L.A. willed themselves back to a close 95–93 with four seconds left, but the Celtics ran the <b>clock</b> <b>out</b> and the Lakers were denied yet again.|$|E
500|$|The final {{quarter of}} play began with A still moving the ball. [...] Stephen McGee threw a 44-yard pass to Mike Goodson for a {{touchdown}} to put the Aggies ahead by the score of 31–17. The Longhorns again went three and out and were forced to punt. The Aggies went down the field quickly and scored another touchdown on a 66-yard pass completion to Earvin Taylor, putting Texas A up by 21points. Colt McCoy fumbled the ball twoplays later, but A was forced to punt the ball away threeplays after recovering the fumble. McCoy and the Longhorn offense drove {{the length of the}} field to score a touchdown, taking only 99seconds off the clock in the process. The Aggies lost sevenyards over the next threeplays and were forced again to punt. The Longhorns drove 73yards from their own 27, converted twofourthdowns, and scored a touchdown. Ryan Bailey missed the extra point, but left the Longhorns only down by eightpoints. The Aggies took possession on their own 33 and ran the <b>clock</b> <b>out</b> to win the game, 38–30.|$|E

The Bears, now only trailing by six points, took the lead when rookie punt returner Devin Hester returned a punt for an 83-yard touchdown. The Cardinals had one final attempt to win the game, but Rackers missed a 40-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Bears to kneel the <b>clock</b> <b>out.</b> After the game's conclusion, Dennis Green, who was the Cardinal's coach at the time, threw his infamous [...] "They are who we thought they were!"

2500|$|Georgia Tech drew first blood when quarterback Reggie Ball {{connected}} on a four-yard {{touchdown pass}} with receiver Calvin Johnson {{at the end}} of the first quarter. [...] Georgia Tech's defense continued to menace 3rd-ranked Notre Dame's offense, while a Travis Bell field goal increased Tech's lead to 10-0. [...] It was the last time Georgia Tech would score, however. [...] Notre Dame orchestrated a 14-play, 80-yard drive right before the half, punctuated by a five-yard rushing touchdown from Brady Quinn, to close the score to 10-7 at the half. [...] Coach Charlie Weis adjusted at halftime and began the second half determined to establish the Irish running game. [...] The move paid off when running back Darius Walker hit paydirt on Notre Dame's first drive of the second half, scoring on a 13-yard touchdown run to put the Irish ahead for the first time in 2006, 14-10. [...] Both defenses tightened, as the teams traded punts. [...] With Notre Dame facing a 4th-and-1 at the Georgia Tech 47-yard line with 1:10 left to play in the game, Georgia Tech appeared to be on the verge of getting the ball back with a chance to win the game. [...] However, Weis gambled and elected to go for the first down rather than punt. [...] Weis' gamble was rewarded when Quinn picked up the yard on a quarterback sneak, giving Notre Dame the first down and enabling them to run the <b>clock</b> <b>out</b> for the 14-10 victory.|$|E
2500|$|For {{almost the}} entire third quarter, both teams {{struggled}} to move the ball. A couple of punts, a turnover on downs by Ohio State and a Wisconsin interception thrown by Joel Stave. Finally, Ohio State scored on a 1-yard touchdown pass to Corey Brown from Braxton Miller with 2:18 left in the third. The Badgers then took over and putting a nice drive together as the third quarter came to an end. On the last play of the third quarter, Badger RB Melvin Gordon was hurt and unable {{to return to the}} game. The Badgers would continue driving into Buckeyes territory {{at the start of the}} fourth quarter. Wisconsin would score on a 17-yard run by RB James White and getting the Badgers within 10. Three drives and three punts later, the Badgers got the ball back 4:38 left in the game. Wisconsin drove down to the Ohio State 24-yard line but the drive stalled there. On fourth and ten, the Badgers decided to kick a field to try to get within one score. Badgers kicker Kyle French then drilled a 42-yard field goal making the score 31–24. Wisconsin would try a [...] "pooch" [...] onside kick that went out of bounds at the Ohio State 34-yard line. With 2:03 left on the clock, Ohio State was trying to run the <b>clock</b> <b>out.</b> Wisconsin had all three of their timeouts left. Wisconsin stopped Ohio State on three straight runs and forced a punt. The Badgers would get the ball back at their own 10-yard line with 1:29 left in the game and no timeouts. After an incomplete pass on first down, Joel Stave threw a screen pass to James White. White fumbled but Stave would recover the ball for a seven-yard loss. Without any timeouts, the clock ticked down to 43 seconds before the Badgers could get lined up for third and 17. Stave then completed a 13-yard pass to James White bringing up fourth and four. White did not get out of bounds but an Ohio State player was injured stopping the clock. When play resumed, Stave's pass was incomplete on fourth down turning the ball over on downs to Ohio State and giving the Buckeyes a 31–24 victory.|$|E

[...] This set up the Rebels in {{excellent}} field position at the Florida 34-yard line. [...] Ole Miss would capitalize on the turnover by scoring with a 33-yard field goal. [...] Florida's turnover woes continued shortly after the Rebels' kickoff when Tim Tebow fumbled the ball at the Gators' 18-yard line.

[...] Florida's next two possessions on offense went only -3 yards and 19 yards, respectively, and required punts. [...] After having obtained possession with 4:34 left in the third, Jevan Snead and Ole Miss put together a 3:42 drive that went 72 yards down the field resulting in a rushing touchdown by RB Dexter McCluster. [...] This brought Ole Miss's lead back up to 7 as it was early in the 1st quarter. [...] After a 25-yard kickoff return by Brandon James, Florida put together a 49-yard drive ending with touchdown off of a Tim Tebow rush, tying the game at 24 a piece.
