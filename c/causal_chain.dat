A model of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance. This theory utilizes only three of Aristotle's four causes: formal, material, and final.|$|E
25|$|The {{point about}} {{remoteness}} of damages under s 2(1) was {{treated in the}} controversial case of Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson. Here Mr Rogerson bought a car on hire purchase, from a Honda dealer, financed by Royscot Trust Ltd. When Mr Rogerson fell behind in his repayments and sold away the car, Royscot Trust Ltd sued the Honda dealer, because they found it had misrepresented {{the proportion of the}} deposit Mr Rogerson had put down for the car. On this basis they argued that Honda was liable for them not being able to recover the cost of the loan (Mr Rogerson had no money). Royscot Ltd argued that the loss was too remote, or that Mr Rogerson's wrongful sale was a break in the <b>causal</b> <b>chain.</b> But the Court of Appeal held that in any event the test under s 2(1) was the same as in the tort of deceit, that one should be liable for all consequences. Balcombe LJ said this followed from the clear wording of the Act.|$|E

2500|$|According to Strawson, {{if one is}} {{responsible}} for what one does in a given situation, then one must {{be responsible for the}} way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation S, one must have been responsible for the way one was at S−1. To be responsible for the way one was at S−1, one must have been responsible for the way one was at S−2, and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new <b>causal</b> <b>chain.</b> But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ex nihilo. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view [...] "pessimism" [...] but it can be classified as hard incompatibilism.|$|E
2500|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{accepts the}} linear causal sets of sequential events with adequate consistency yet also suggests constant forking of causal chains creating [...] "multiple universes" [...] {{to account for}} multiple outcomes from single events.

[...] Under this model causal sets are still [...] "consistent" [...] yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes. [...] The interpretation side steps the exclusive retrospective <b>causal</b> <b>chain</b> problem of [...] "could not have done otherwise" [...] by suggesting [...] "the other outcome does exist" [...] {{in a set of}} parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred. [...] This theory is sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that recursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play.

2500|$|Causal {{determinism}} is [...] "the {{idea that}} every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions {{together with the}} laws of nature". However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that [...] "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the <b>causal</b> <b>chain</b> that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, {{it is still the}} case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way". Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that {{there is nothing in the}} universe that is uncaused or self-caused. Historical determinism (a sort of path dependence) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions. In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding eventsa combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature. Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).|$|E

In it, I argue that to {{approach}} society and culture in a naturalistic way, the domain of the social sciences must be reconceptualised by recognising only entities and processes of which we have a naturalistic understanding. These are mental representations and public productions, the processes that causally link them, the <b>causal</b> <b>chains</b> that bond these links, and the complex webs of such <b>causal</b> <b>chains</b> that criss-cross human populations over time and space.

40|$|The {{problem of}} deviant <b>causal</b> <b>chains</b> is endemic to any theory {{of action that}} makes definitional or {{explanatory}} use of a causal connection between an agent’s beliefs and pro-attitudes and his bodily movements.

In his treatment of deviant <b>causal</b> <b>chains,</b> Davidson makes use of the clause “in the right way” to rule out causal waywardness, but he regards any attempt at specifying ‘right’ sorts of causal histories as hopeless and even harmful.
