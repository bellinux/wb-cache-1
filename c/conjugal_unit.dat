50|$|Freedom and Destiny: Gender, Family and Popular Culture in India {{is a book}} {{consisting}} of eight essays by Indian feminist and sociologist Patricia Uberoi. The book, which was published by Oxford University Press in New Delhi in 2006 looks {{at the site of}} popular culture to examine institutions such as the Indian Family, the <b>conjugal</b> <b>unit,</b> the symbol of the woman as well as the iconography of the baby and child in the Indian imagination. The essays in the book, {{with the exception of the}} introduction, had previously appeared in various books and journals. The disparate essays were collected into a volume. Patricia Uberoi begins the volume by reflecting on the wider implications of the misspelled epithet 'Beautiful Wife, Denger Life' seen at the back of a New Delhi truck. These reflections form a starting point for the essays that follow in the volume.|$|E
40|$|By {{focusing}} on the value differentiation of spouses, this article complements a prevalent approach to Akan marriage studies stressing autonomy. Dumont's notion of "encompassment of the contrary" is used {{to show that the}} husband is viewed both as an element of the <b>conjugal</b> <b>unit,</b> in opposition to his wife, and as the representative of the marital union in its entireness. This is exemplified with reference to budgets. The husband's budget is both personal and collective as incomes derive from a joint effort and are redistributed to the wife. The autonomy of spouses and the encompassing role of the husband are examined with reference to the dialectics between ideals and practice...|$|E
40|$|This letter {{tells the}} story of a young woman and a man I met during {{fieldwork}} with some university students in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 2007 / 08. Here, Hiranthi – the narrator – writes a letter to her boyfriend of nine months Anish, interpreting the twists and turns of their relationship and highlights the ways in which the relationship fails to meet her expectations. Describing her expectations of romantic relationships and the efforts exerted in the making of it, this letter highlights that my interlocutors aspired towards a particular kind of romantic relationship – a ‘serious’ relationship. In this piece of writing, I use authorial and creative license to contextualise and interpret Hiranthi’s and Anish’s story within a frame of contemporary life in Sri Lanka, which I put together with the stories of others I met during fieldwork. I use the letter to highlight that romantic relationships of my interlocutors are embedded within particular discourses about the normative <b>conjugal</b> <b>unit,</b> which is essentially heterosexual. It illustrates that romantic relationships consist of a process of investment, a way of embedding one’s sense of self. The article highlights the relational aspect of self, pointing out that one’s life’s worthiness could be tied to the people who are around them...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Using {{the concept}} of "operational {{cultural}} ideals, " the study examines household formation in the Asturian mountain village of Escobines and argues that such ideals are not a set of preexisting perfectly compatible norms against which countrymen and women can easily measure their actions and achievements. Rather, what is seen {{is a series of}} negotiated understandings of incompatible ideals &mdash; between man and wife, parents and children, lineal and collateral relatives, and between villagers and external powers such as aristocratic landowners and the government. These understandings repose {{in the sense of the}} appropriate relationship between building structures and family structures, between the desire to gather "under one roof " and the impulse toward separation of individual <b>conjugal</b> <b>units.</b> El casmientu quier apartamientu (A bride and groom need room) I NTRODUCTION In this article we will examine some of the dilemmas involved in the study of househol...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} individualization of farm units in Mali {{in the sense}} of a {{transformation}} of purely collective farms into mixed units in which private plots coexist with collective fields. While a moral-hazard-in-team problem plagues production on the latter, a dilemma arises insofar as the household head extracts his income form it. The head thus faces a trade-off between efficiency and capture. We show, within the framework of a patriarchal farm household model, that the choice is tilted toward private plot as land becomes more scarce. On the basis of first hand data collected in Southern Mali, we test and confirm the above prediction. Moreover, the relationship between land scarcity and the presence of individual plots holds only when there are at least one married couple (besides the head) within the household. The explanation we put forward is that the presence or suspicion of labour-shirking on the collective field arise only when there are interferences by in-laws and differences in the size of <b>conjugal</b> <b>units.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|If archaeologists are {{to discern}} social facts from the {{material}} remains of extinct societies, they must develop explicit methodologies for relating material culture to social behavior. Ethnoarchaeological research is one means of generating and testing such analytic principles. The Syrian village of Darnaj {{in the context}} of comparative materials from elsewhere in Western Asia is used as a case study for examining the relationships between domestic architecture and three socioeconomic household attributes: household size, number of coresiding <b>conjugal</b> family <b>units,</b> and household wealth. To allow an assessment of the relative effectiveness of architecture for predicting socioeconomic variability, data on some household belongings were collected and analyzed as well. In all cases, domestic architecture proves at least as accurate as movable possessions for predicting the socioeconomic attributes tested. In Darnaj the total area of rooms designed for people is the best indicator of household size. The number of sitting and goods storage rooms and the presence of redundant dowry sets are the most accurate predictors of the number of co-residing <b>conjugal</b> family <b>units,</b> and wealth is most highly correlated with total compound area. These and other compound features are discussed and probable reasons for the association or lack of association of each attribute with the socioeconomic characteristics are presented. In conclusion, some statements about (1) the nature of the rules relating domestic architecture to household socioeconomic characteristics, (2) ways that domestic architecture can be used to discern socioeconomic variability in the archaeological record, and (3) means of excavating, recording, and publishing architectural data to maximize its utility as a socioeconomic indicator are offered...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on Alfred Cell's 'art nexus' theory, this {{dissertation}} considers cooking {{as a kind}} {{of artistic}} practice. The focus of this study is the culinary culture of barbacoa-makers in the community of Barrio San Mateo, Milpa Alta in Mexico City. Mexican cuisine is analysed at three levels - the social and culinary contexts of the production and consumption of barbacoa; the daily life of women and especially their domestic cooking tasks; and the dynamics of hospitality, as expressed in the cycle of fiestas. Barbacoa is pit-roast lamb, and the production of it is an important means of livelihood in San Mateo (along with the cultivation of nopales, and other agricultural activities). Barbacoa - which is served during fiestas, and also eaten in the market on Sundays and holidays - is produced by married couples whose social environment both creates and is created by the practices surrounding the preparation of the dish. The division of labour observed in making barbacoa is directly related to normative gender roles, i. e. those performed in the normal domestic context. Women are associated with cooking, which includes making salsas and other foods which require laborious culinary input. They appear to be restricted both by the expectations of men and by the demands of the kitchen. But male and female gender roles are shown, in this dissertation, to be complementary, and they are not in general characterized by the hierarchy of men over women. Examination of the fiesta cycle further reveals that the basis of social interaction is the <b>conjugal</b> <b>unit,</b> both at the level of families (through links of compadrazgo, co-parenthood), and {{at the level of the}} community (through the mayordomia, the 'cargo system'). Women may be viewed as culinary artists whose body of work is the corpus of Mexican cuisine. The source of their culinary mastery is located in the individual's hand or sazon de amor, a touch of love. The development of 'traditional' cuisine is therefore born of the domestic realm as a product of artistic innovation and technical skill, both in a culinary and a social sense. Counter to Goody's theory, this high cuisine is not the product of a hierarchical society, as such, but rather develops from the highly-valued work of women as wives, mothers, and family cooks...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much, mostly inconclusive, {{discussion}} {{about how to}} define the household in a manner suitable for comparative purposes. Certain conventional criteria are not very useful in the Icelandic context, where it appears that a person could be attached {{to more than one}} household, where the laws suggest it was possible for more than one household to be resident in the same uncompartmentalised farmhouse; and where headship might often be shared. Definitions, for example, based on co residence or on commensalism do not jibe all that well with the pastoral transhumance practised by the Icelanders. Sheep were tended and milked in summer in high pasture at shieldings by servants and other household members who slept and ate there during the summer but who were still understood to be attached to the main lowland farm in which other household members lived the entire year. Still, both coresidence and commensalism are a big part of what an Icelandic household was about, but a certain definitional roughness and subjectivity is needed in order to accommodate native categories and conceptions. For {{the purpose of this study}} I consider a person 2 ̆ 7 s household to be where sjhe eats and sleeps most of the time and where, even when not sleeping or eating there, he or she is perceived to have some right or duty to do so. This kind of looseness will cause trouble in marginal cases, but it is fairly serviceable nevertheless. It also allows for the possibility of multiple-household membership; something the ethnographic evidence suggests should not be totally precluded by definitions all too often adopted, without much refinement from the census taker, and it takes better account of the demands of the native style of pastoralism. Although qualifications and modifications will emerge when we consider the sources, I adopt for convenience the terminology of household type settled on by the Cambridge Group. Households are either simple or complex. A simple household has as its base the <b>conjugal</b> family <b>unit,</b> that is, a married couple and their unmarried children, but it also includes households headed by a single parent with children as well as married couples without children. Complex households, on the other hand, are said to be extended if they include other relatives who do not form <b>conjugal</b> <b>units</b> of their own. They are joint or multiple 1 if they are comprised of two or more related married couples, although to make sense in the Icelandic context, the class of married couples must include those living in 2 ̆ 7 loose marriages 2 ̆ 7, i. e. open and regularised concubinage. Also, native classifications of multiple householding need not depend on the kinship connection between the married couples. I thus consider, contrary to the Cambridge typology, that a farmstead run as a unified economic enterprise can constitute a single household even if some of its members are not related or do not recite kinship as the reason they are housed together...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} explores how individual {{women in}} Qing (1644 - 1911) and Republican (1912 - 1949) Quanzhou, a port {{city in the}} Fujian province, preserved the male-centered family system yet empowered themselves within it by negotiating with Confucian family ethics. Focusing on gender and family, this study explores how Quanzhou women utilized legal powers, concepts of morality, family status, and community connections as cultural and social capital in pursuit of their own interests.; Chapter 1 presents {{the historical development of}} Chinese family ethics. The gap between orthodox principles of patrilineality and local practices gave women an opportunity to wield power in their families. Chapters 2 and 3 describe women's engagement with the contractual tradition. They show the decreasing influence of agnates and the growing independence of women and their <b>conjugal</b> <b>units.</b> Women used their legal powers and parental authority to further their self interests and that of their families. Chapter 4 uses public notices in newspapers in the 1930 s and 1940 s to analyze disputes between men and women, and older and younger generations. In these notices, women claimed to be virtuous and appealed to public opinion among the readers to guarantee their economic security in the family. Meanwhile, husbands and in-laws displayed their anxiety about women's loss of female virtue and used the 1931 Family Law to evict young widows from households and take their property. Chapter 5 details how women created fictive family ties outside of their kin organizations. Many women entered local monastic orders or justified their marriage-resisting practices by highlighting their filiality, chastity, and by conceptualizing a form of social motherhood. They maintained strong ties with their natal families and developed fictive mother-daughter bonds between religious instructors and disciples.; Quanzhou women did not abandon Confucian family ethics, but they manipulated concepts of virtue to benefit their own practical kin groups and legitimized unorthodox religious practices. They thus enhanced both their family status and their own authority. The process of negotiation reveals an interconversion of their female virtues, family status, property rights, and social reputation. Most women chose to stay within the family system and acted as the protectresses of Confucian patrilineality and patriarchy...|$|R
40|$|The Dagaaba of Northern Ghana are a patrilineal {{people who}} {{traditionally}} live in domestic groups comprising {{a core of}} agnatically related males and married women and their children. The concept of family (yir) for the Dagaaba includes all who are descended from the same ancestor and all {{are members of the}} lineage (yir-dem) (Bekye, 1991). Nukunya (2001) sees the lineage as a network of relations that connects an individual to relatives beyond the small close-knit <b>conjugal</b> family <b>unit.</b> However, as a result of change, {{more and more people are}} leaving the influence of this residential system resulting in the waning of their feelings of responsibility to their extended family members. Over the years, education, travel, contact with the cultures of other ethnic groups as well as many other factors of change have began to alter the traditional way of life of the Dagaaba. Not many researches have however been conducted into the extent of the changes that have occurred and their implications for the Dagaaba. What is noticeable however is the gradual erosion of the strong bonds of the lineage and the network of care that is associated with the system. An effect of the changing conditions of the family system is the strengthening of conjugal ties to the detriment of wider kinship ties (Nukunya, 2001 : 156). Oppong (1981) documented (among Akan dwellers in Accra) the conflict that may exist between kin and relatives who try to renege on their obligations...|$|R
5000|$|Kent M. Elbow {{described}} the socioeconomic system of Hausa farm villages extensively in 1994. He {{wrote about the}} Gandu:"Gandu refers to the set of relations that collectively define the basic production unit in traditional Hausaland. Most often these relations express themselves {{among the members of}} the gida, the basic household unit of rural Hausaland. The gida corresponds roughly to the common understanding of the extended family. Thus the nucleus of a gandu is an extended family, but accounts such as the classic Baba of Karo (M. Smith 1954) make it clear that the nineteenth century gandu also included slaves and descendants of slaves. Sutter's (1982) review of the literature points out that some writers stress the gandu's importance as a hedge against famine and food insecurity, while other writers emphasize its role as a defense against the slave-raiding parties prevalent during the pre-colonial era—and especially menacing in the nineteenth century under the Sokoto caliphate. Ega (1980) suggests that the traditional gandu probably consisted mostly of slaves, but stresses that the gandu was a work unit in which the owner and the slaves had mutual obligations. The owner had the right to a certain number of hours of labor from his slaves each day, and in return he was expected to provide them with land and the time to cultivate it. The slaves had full rights over the product of their [...] "private" [...] plots. It is thought that the elaborate and detailed mutual rights and duties between the gandu head and his younger brothers and sons—such as those enumerated by Hill (1970)—have evolved from the traditional mutual duties characteristic of master/slave relationships in the nineteenth century. For example, in most gandu arrangements the father assumes the responsibility of paying the taxes charged to his sons and may even be obligated to pay his sons' brideprice"."The gandu system dictates that holdings are inherited in their entirety by the eldest son who will assume the role as gandu head", also wrote Kent M. Elbow. He argued that the gandu system had been on the decline for many years, and most scholars agree with this opinion. However, Poly Hill, researching a Hausa village in 1973, found that eldest sons or elder sons were still favored over younger sons in matters of land inheritance at that time. This greater transfer of property occurred during the father's lifetime:"But although many of the sons of rich farmers may be badly situated following their father's death, there are some who will be exceptionally well placed. As under systems of primogeniture, it may be that one son (or perhaps two or more) is effectively the father's heir and successor, while his brothers are not. This is not because of any blatant inequality in the division of physical property {{at the time of his}} father's death, but because a man's eldest son (or elder sons) may have had special opportunities ... of establishing a secure position in life, while under his father".Eric J. Arnould {{described the}} social organization of Hausa farm villages as follows in [...] "Marketing and Social Reproduction in Zinder, Niger Republic":"Each hausa farm village was built up around a core family group (dengi) composed of agnatic kinfolk. The fundamental unit of residence, production, distribution, transmission, and reproduction was the gida. At a mature stage of the domestic cycle the gida was a patrilocal multiple family household of at least two generations depth and comprising the <b>conjugal</b> family <b>units</b> (iyali) of the household head (mai gida) and his married sons and their children. Some wealthier gida contained farm slaves. The gida was essentially a family farming unit (FFU) distinguished from other FFU by usufructory rights of tenure to dune (jigawa) and marsh (fadama) lands, control of its own granary, and disposition of the labor power of its active members. The household hhead (mai gida) partitioned the household land into gandu (collective) and gamana (individual) parcels. Men worked together on the gandu five days a week. The mai gida held the fruits of gandu production in trust and was obliged to feed, clothe, and pay taxes and ceremonial expenses of his household from the gandu produce during the agricultural season. With the help of the extended agnatic kin group the mai gida ensured that his sons and daughters would marry. Individual and junior iyali fed themselves during the dry season from the fruits of the gandu produce during the agricultural season. With the help of the exntended agnatic kin group the mai gida ensured tha his sons and daughters would marry. Individuals and junior iyali fed themselves during the dry season from the fruits of the gamana and, in addition, used gamana produce to participate in ceremonial events and exchanges (baptisms, marriages, funerals). Gandu produce could never be sold; gamana produce could be, but the bulk of production took place on gandu plots. On the death of the mai gida the inheriting sons did not immediately divide the land and slaves but continued to work together, the eldest brother assuming the role of mai gida. At this stage of the developmental cycle the gida became a frereche. As the families of the brothers grew, they divided the patrimony. Usually junior brothers were compelled to clear new bush lands".The British thought that the Hausa Law of Primogeniture was bad because it encouraged usury and mortgage.|$|R
