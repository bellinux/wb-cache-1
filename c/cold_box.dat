2500|$|Another type of binder {{process is}} called the hot-box process, which uses a {{thermoset}} and catalyst for a binder. The sand with the binder is packed into a core box that is heated to approximately [...] (which is where the name originated from).

Cores produced using this method are sometimes referred to as [...] "shell-core" [...] because often, only the outside layer of the core is hardened when in contact with the hot corebox.

5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional <b>cold</b> <b>boxes</b> {{to solve the}} problem of how to take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, taking advantage of the growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|R

50|$|When {{processed}} into finished by-products (see Natural gas processing), these heavier hydrocarbons are collectively {{referred to}} as NGL (natural gas liquids).

The inlet gas to the demethanizer is first cooled to about −51 °C in a heat exchanger ({{referred to as}} a <b>cold</b> <b>box)</b> which partially condenses the inlet gas.

Both cycle models achieve optimum power and maximum refrigeration load at nearly the same refrigeration temperature, but only the coefficient of performance of the irreversible refrigeration cycle reaches a maximum. Moreover, its prediction of heat conductance allocation between evaporator and condenser appears to be not only more conservative, but also more realistic for actual design considerations of refrigeration cycles...|$|R

40|$|Mercury Embrittlement is a {{significant}} problem in natural gas facilities using aluminum <b>cold</b> <b>boxes</b> and {{has led to a}} number of major plant incidents. It has been postulated that the natural passive layer on aluminum provides an effective barrier between droplets of mercury and the underlying aluminum and this prevents mercury embrittlement. However, under certain circumstances this barrier is breached and embrittlement can occur. In this paper the condition of the mercury-aluminum interface is measured using ac impedance techniques and the effects of film aging conditions on the stability of the interface are studied. The film was modeled as a constant phase element and resistor in parallel and {{it was found that the}} resistance of the film increased with aging, although the effective film thickness only changed slightly. The paper finds that galvanic corrosion between the mercury droplet and underlying aluminum is likely to be a major cause of the breakdown of the mercury-aluminum interface...|$|R
