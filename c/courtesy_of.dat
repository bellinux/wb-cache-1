40|$|The {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> was <b>of</b> {{the utmost}} importance in Renaissance England; courtesy was tied to social standing, virtue, and civility. Spenser joins in a rich tradition <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> literature by including the Book <b>of</b> <b>Courtesy</b> in The Faerie Queene. His presentation <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> goes far beyond the limited discussion of the concept by his predecessors and peers; instead of limiting his depiction <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> to “courteous” behavior, Spenser includes every aspect <b>of</b> <b>courtesy,</b> including courteous and completely discourteous behavior and effective and ineffective expressions <b>of</b> courtliness. Spenser’s <b>courtesy</b> involves layers <b>of</b> complexity that exist in various social spheres throughout The Faerie Queene. The wide-ranging nature of the poem enables Spenser to explore virtue in varied physical and allegorical contexts, thus allowing the reader to view courtesy in multiple contexts. Spenser’s conception <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> may be viewed in four discreet types of characters: moral courtiers, unrhetorical but inwardly courteous individuals, artful courtiers, and discourteous individuals. A close analysis of each type of courteous or discourteous character leads to a more nuanced and fuller understanding of Spenser’s portrayal <b>of</b> <b>courtesy.</b> This study reaches outside the Legend <b>of</b> <b>Courtesy</b> and views the virtue <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> throughout the entirety of The Faerie Queene. Focal characters include, {{but are not limited}} to, Arthur, Britomart, Florimell, Redcrosse, Salvage Man, Satyrs, the Salvage Nation and Brigands, Duessa, Archimago, and Malecasta. An analysis of each of these widely differing characters contributes to the reader’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> and the relationship between courtesy and rhetoric in Spenser’s work...|$|R
