40|$|A {{flotation}} column {{could be}} considered {{as one of the}} major breakthroughs in the field of mineral processing in the last decades. Due to an increase in the trend of the use of these type of cells in the mineral processing plants, an investigation regarding the performance of these cells was initiated. The flotation column at the Sarcheshmeh pilot plant with some modifications was restarted. When all necessary measures were taken, the possibility of using the flotation cell in the cleaner and recleaner stages was investigated. Replacing the <b>cleaner</b> <b>cells</b> by the column flotation increased the separation efficiency by 7 %. When the column cell was used as recleaner and both cleaner and recleaner, an improvement of 10 % was observed. It was found that using a column cell instead of mechanical cells in addition to a decrease in repair and maintenance costs could result in 76 % and 83 % reduction in energy cost of cleaner and cleaner‐recleaner stages, respectively, at the pilot plant...|$|E
40|$|Froth {{flotation}} is {{a widely}} used and versatile mineral processing method for concentrating metal ores. A finely ground ore feed is processed through a flotation circuit consisting of interlinked cells where mineral particles are separated from waste material by using their differences in surface properties. The layout of the circuit {{has been found to}} greatly affect the overall flotation performance. While industrial flotation circuit design has in the past relied on experience, due to the complex nature of the process, only small scale circuit optimisations using simple flotation models were reported in literature. This work proposes a new system capable of automatic generation of optimal circuit designs for any given feed. The system combines a circuit simulator containing detailed froth-phase flotation models with a robust genetic algorithm to search through possible layouts and to produce the global optimal result. An empirical model to predict the pulp phase flotation rate constant was developed, which was used together with physics-based models describing the froth recovery and entrainment factor to simulate the flotation process. Three feed models with different complexities were also developed. Comparable flotation performance was observed between a modelled 10 -cell rougher circuit and the experimental results from Northparkes copper concentration plant. Through the genetic algorithm, optimal layouts were obtained for circuits consisted of 3 to 10 cells. Layouts containing only rougher cells were able to recover a maximum amount of mineral and were found optimal for smaller circuits, whilst inclusion of <b>cleaner</b> <b>cells</b> in the optimal layouts was found more beneficial for larger circuits. This circuit modelling and optimisation system was used to study the sensitivity of flotation performance and optimal layouts to variations in feed particle size and grade. The results showed strong correlations between the variables and froth phase behaviours which determined the concentrate recovery and grade, the optimal layouts were, however, robust and relatively resilient to the changes in feed conditions.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{measurement}} of particle loading on bubbles in the collection zone during flotation. Existing methods and instruments are critically reviewed to form a basis for developing a new bubble load meter. The new bubble load measuring device {{which is based on}} the Dyer (1995) and Seaman et al., (2004) concept is presented. It was noted that the Dyer (1995) concept as improved by Moys et al. (2010) had advantages that with refinement could yield a more robust working instrument. The device had to meet the following objectives: It must measure bubble loads accurately without particle losses as a result of bubble coalescence, or break up. Secondly the instrument should also be capable of collecting a solid sample in excess of 200 grams which is the minimum mass required for PGM analysis as function of particle size. Results of applying this newly designed bubble load meter in the laboratory and industrial plant are presented. It was shown at laboratory level through salt tracer experiments that the 20 mm and 30 mm riser worked well for the bubble load meter without sampling unattached particles. The intensity of the axial mixing in the 50 mm riser resulted in some salt transport up the riser, to an extent that would compromise the bubble load quality. An axial mixing model with 16 tanks in series was developed for the bubble load meter riser and parameters were estimated using Matlab’s Simulink toolbox. A satisfactory fit was obtained after the inclusion of an additional parameter that accounts for salt transport as a result of mechanical push by bubble swarms and the salt adsorbed on the bubble lamella. Industrial work at Lonmin’s EPC plant yielded a maximum sample mass of 35. 5 grams with the 20 mm ID riser instead of the target mass of 200 grams. This was attributed to a number of factors which include that the sample was taken using small diameter riser (20 mm ID) which meant that fewer bubbles were collected per unit cross sectional area and also the occasional breakage of the filter paper due to blinding which reduced sampling times. A froth recovery parameter fR of 0. 68 was obtained on the primary <b>cleaner</b> <b>cells</b> while a froth flow number) (fnR of 1. 55 was obtained on the primary rougher cell, this value of froth flow number in the primary rougher cell indicated high entrainment. A froth flow number was calculated for the primary rougher cell data instead of a froth recovery parameter because of the unavailability assays due to low sample masses. While the froth recovery parameter was defined as the fraction of particles that are recovered by true flotation that reports to the concentrate, the froth flow number was defined as the ratio between the total mass of solids recovered in concentrate (by true flotation +entrainment) and the mass of solids entering the froth by true flotation, i. e. collected mineral (particle-bubble aggregates). A froth flow number can assume any value less than, equal to or greater than one depending on the contribution of entrainment and true flotation. It was also demonstrated that bubble load values in conjunction with certain assumptions can be used to estimate entrainment. Results of applying bubble load data revealed that chromite recovery in the concentrate is a contribution of both true flotation and entrainment. The results also indicated that 2. 4...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of fin primary cell cultures for [i]in vitro[/i] cellular and physiological studies is hampered by slow cell outgrowth, low proliferation rate, poor viability, and sparse cell characterization. Here, we investigated whether the recycling of fresh explants after a first conventional culture could improve physiological stability and sustainability of the culture. The recycled explants {{were able to}} give a supplementary cell culture showing faster outgrowth, <b>cleaner</b> <b>cell</b> layers and higher net cell production. The cells exhibited a highly stabilized profile for marker gene expression including a low cytokeratin 49 (epithelial marker) and a high collagen 1 a 1 (mesenchymal marker) expression. Added to the cell spindle-shaped morphology, motility behavior, and actin organization, {{this suggests that the}} cells bore stable mesenchymal characteristics. This contrast with the time-evolving expression pattern observed in the control fresh explants during the first 2 weeks of culture: a sharp decrease in cytokeratin 49 expression was concomitant with a gradual increase in col 1 a 1. We surmise that such loss of epithelial features for the benefit of mesenchymal ones was triggered by an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process or by way of a progressive population replacement process. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive characterization of this new primary culture model bearing mesenchymal features and whose stability over culture time makes those cells good candidates for cell reprogramming prior to nuclear transfer, in a context of fish genome preservation...|$|R

40|$|The {{computerized}} scanning {{electron microscope}} system (QEM*SEM) as developed for characterizing whole mineral particles by the CSIRO Division of Mineral Chemistry, Institute of Energy and Earth Resources, {{has proved to be}} a very useful tool in the analysis of products and intermediate samples in the Lead-Zinc Concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited. Two examples of the application of the method are given in the present paper. The analysis of final cleaner concentrates from two distinct ore blends has indicated that in each case most of the galena in the 10 – 37 μm size range is fully or nearly fully liberated. This proportion decreased down the third <b>cleaner</b> <b>cell</b> bank. Coarser particles, in the 37 – 53 μm size range, were shown to have smaller proportions of galena in the highly liberated galena classes. The remainder of the galena in each case is spread over the lower galena classes, which become increasingly interlocked with gangue. Significant proportions of gangue, both sulphide and non-sulphide were also found to be free or almost free from interlocking with galena, especially in the 10 – 37 μm size fraction. Thus lack of selectivity, as well as composite particle flotation, is seen to be responsible for downgrading of lead third cleaner concentrates. In addition, the QEM*SEM technique has shown that the distribution of galena intergrowth in lead first cleaner tailings is spread over most composite classes, more akin to regrind/retreat particles than to lead primary rougher tail particles. Thus QEM*SEM provides a valuable method in the mineral industry of today of measuring the relative degree of liberation of ground ore or flotation products, and the extent of dilution of concentrates by non-selective flotation of liberated gangue. Full liberation is not always desirable because of the cost of grinding to the finest sizes and because non-selective dilution of concentrates by fine liberated gangue often increases. QEM*SEM can also play a useful role in deciding the best destination for intermediate concentrator streams...|$|R

These are known as ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ stickies ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and their handling and re- moval requires process equipment such as screens and cleaners as well as chemical additives. In the preceding phase of the project we demonstrated that firing an underwater spark in a tank of stock reduces the tack of the stickies and reduces their impact.

Trials were run at the Appleton papers mill in West Carrollton, OH, the Graphics Packag- ing mill at Kalamazoo, MI, Stora Enso mills at Duluth, MN, and Wisconsin Rapids, WI, and the Jackson Paper mill at Sylva, NC.

40|$|Ok Tedi Mining Limited {{generates a}} copper and gold {{concentrate}} from its porphyry and skarn ore deposits located at Mt. Fublian, Western Province, PNG. The predominant porphyry ore-type is blended with high grade skarn ores to optimize copper and gold feed grades to the concentrator. Current operation (2003) is to blend 80 % porphyry with 20 % skarn ores, {{resulting in an}} acceptable concentrate grade and recovery. However, when the proportion of skarn ore in the plant feed exceeds 20 %, low flotation recovery is often observed. Approximately 20 % of the copper and 30 % gold losses occur through the rougher flotation circuit. However, losses via the cleaner tailing stream are 8 % and 9 % for copper and gold, respectively, and augment value mineral losses to the final tailing. It may {{be noted that the}} cleaner tailing stream contains value minerals which have already been successfully floated in the rougher section of the concentrator, and are therefore recoverable. This study has the objective of determining the reasons for copper and gold loss in the cleaner tailing. The focus is therefore on the cleaner flotation bank and related streams. The project strategy commenced with characterization of the cleaner circuit performance under various operating conditions. This would provide evidence for any proposed mechanisms to explain the losses of valuable minerals to the cleaner tailing. The second part of the project strategy was to evaluate potential methods for improvement of cleaner flotation performance via laboratory flotation tests. To complete the work, plant trials of methods showing benefit in the laboratory were conducted. Characterisation surveys of the cleaner flotation bank were conducted as a function of ore blend, pulp and surface chemistry, mineralogy, flotation kinetics, particle size distribution, <b>cleaner</b> flotation <b>cell</b> hydrodynamic characterisation and residence time. These studies indicated that for greater than 20 % pyrite skarn in the concentrator feed blend, lower than expected gold and copper recoveries were achieved in the cleaner bank. Pulp and surface chemical analytical techniques indicated layers of oxide coatings existed on all particles, depressing flotation. Oxide coatings had also resulted in the copper activation of pyrite (CuS rimming), making separation from copper sulfides difficult. Losses included coarse composite particles, also suggesting possible liberation issues. However, liberated copper sulfides were also lost, supporting the notion of depression via oxide coatings. Residence time calculations for the cleaner flotation bank suggested that the flotation capacity was less than adequate, particularly at high mill throughput rates. Hydrodynamic characterisation indicated improvements in cell hydrodynamics were warranted. In contrast to the oxidised ore feed blend described above, when less than 20 % pyrite skarn was contained in the ore blend, high copper and gold recoveries were achieved in the cleaner bank. Laboratory tests suggested that increasing cleaner feed pH from 10. 5 to 11. 5, and 1 or collector addition to the cleaner feed, would result in improved cleaner flotation performance. These changes were trialed in the plant, with the pH adjustment being successful. High cleaner feed pH continues as a permanent modification to plant operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{has gained}} {{interest}} as fuel {{recently as the}} harmful effects of fossil fuels on the environment can no longer be ignored. Hydrogen, which produces no pollutants, forms the feed for <b>cleaner</b> fuel <b>cells</b> systems currently in use. Fuel cells, although not as economically viable as fossil fuels, have found a foothold in the energy market in various markets like power backup and use in remote locations. Production of hydrogen is still largely done via fossil fuel reforming and this technology has received renewed interest for use with fuel cells in the form of micro- reformers or fuel processors. This study entailed the performance benchmarking of a so called Best-in-Class commercial micro reformer (as available in 2010), the 1 kW WS FLOX Reformer, and was undertaken {{under the auspices of the}} national HySA programme. The study’s focus was primarily on reformate output quality (carbon monoxide concentration), and start up time, thermal efficiency and hydrogen output (15 SCLM). The reformer consisted of a combustion section encased in an outer reforming section consisting of three reactors in series, steam reforming, water gas shift and selective methanation. As-provided temperature control is simplified though the use of only one temperature setpoint in the combustion chamber and temperature control in the CO clean up stages obtained through means of heat transfer with incoming water being evaporated. Combustion takes place through flame combustion or by means of the supplier’s patented FLOX (flameless oxidation) combustion. The purchased FLOX Reformer assembly was integrated into a fully automated unit with all balance of plant components as well as microGC and flue gas analysis for measurement of outlet conditions. The FLOX Reformer was tested at multiple combustion temperatures, combustion flowrates, reforming loads and steam-to-carbon ratios to obtain a wide set of benchmark data. From the testing it was found that the reformer was able to produce the necessary 15 SCLM hydrogen with a carbon monoxide purity of less than 10 ppm as required in fuel cells for all testing if the reaction temperatures were within the recommended limits. Intermediary water gas shift analysis showed methane and carbon monoxide conversion in the reforming and water gas shift stages to be identical to thermodynamic equilibrium conversion – 95 % and higher for all temperatures. iii Selective methanation conversion obtained was 99 %, but not always at equilibrium conversion due to increased selective methanation temperatures, where carbon dioxide methanation was also observed at the higher temperatures. Temperature control through heat exchange with incoming water in the CO removal stages was found to be less than ideal as the temperature inside these stages fluctuated dramatically due to inaccuracies in the water pump and a lagged response to flowrate changes. Startup times of less than an hour was observed for multiple combustion flowrates and the reformer boasts a standby function to reduce this to less than half an hour. The thermal efficiency was independently confirmed and tested and found to be higher than 70 % for flame combustion and on par with other commercially available fuel processors. The suppliers trademark FLOX combustion only reaching 65 % due to decreased combustion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory General notes: The same {{procedures}} {{are used to}} fix and stain cells for SEM and for TEM. Cells can be fixed using conventional [glutaraldehyde-osmium fixation]([URL] described for transmission electron microscopy. To preserve ciliary orientation, use the "instant fixation" protocol described here. With this method, the cortex and ciliary beat form is well preserved but the cytoplasm is poorly preserved and membrane breakage and blebbing on the cell surface is evident. To suspend cells, use a wide bore pipette and gentle flow to avoid damaging cells. Polypropylene disposable Pasteur pipettes work very well for all procedures. Carry out all fixation procedures in a properly vented fume hood. Supplies and most EM chemicals {{can be obtained from}} Electron Microscope Sciences, Ernest F. Fullum, Ladd Research Industries, Polysciences, Ted Pella, and Bio-Rad. ### Instant fixation **Materials:** - Polypropylene conical centrifuge tube (Falcon 35 - 2097 or equivalent) - Ice in ice bucket **Solutions:** - 200 mM stock solution of sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7. 2 - 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate (allow a few hours to dissolve) - Deionized water Glutaraldehyde - 10 % or 25 % stocks in sealed ampoules - Osmium tetroxide - 4 % solution in deionized water. To prepare, score and break an ampoule containing crystalline OsO 4 and drop the open ampoule into a small amber jar. Add appropriate amount of deionized water and let dissolve at room temperature for several days. Store in a second jar at 4 degrees C. OsO 4 tends to evaporate and blacken surfaces, so the second jar is highly recommended. It is best to use a separate refrigerator for fixatives. OsO 4 solutions also can be frozen in small aliquots and stored at - 20 degrees C. Fix: 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde, 2 % OsO 4, 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7. 2 Mix glutaraldehyde and cacodylate. Add OsO 4 and mix immediately before adding to cells. ### Procedure: 1. Harvest cells in a clinical or appropriate low speed centrifuge. Centrifuge to obtain a loose pellet of cells (setting # 3, 5 min with a clinical centrifuge). - (Optional, but produces <b>cleaner</b> <b>cell</b> surface) Gently pellet cells from the culture medium and suspend in room temperature HNMK (50 mM HEPES, pH 6. 9, 36 mM NaCl, 0. 1 mM Mg acetate, 1 mM KCl) at a concentration of 106 - 108 cells/ml. Put in a shallow container and gently agitate for 10 - 30 min at room temperature to aerate cells. - Decant most of the medium/HNMK and suspend cells in a slurry (< 1 ml of remaining medium or HNMK). Transfer to a 16 ml polypropylene conical centrifuge tube. - Rapidly add the freshly prepared glutaraldehyde-OsO 4, mixture, mix well, and immediately put the tube in ice. Fix for 30 - 60 min. If the solution turns black, pellet the cells, remove the fix, and add a fresh aliquot of a freshly prepared mixture of glutaraldehyde-OsO 4. - Wash cells at least 3 times with deionized water at room temperature. If necessary, gently pellet cells during each wash. - Suspend cells in 0. 5 - 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate and leave at room temperature for at least 1 hr. Cells can be stored for weeks in uranyl acetate. - Proceed to ethanol dehydration and critical point drying (SEM) or acetone dehydration and embedding (TEM), below. ### Critical point drying We use one of two methods. **Method 1 :** This is preferred but requires microporous specimen capsules (# 4620; Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), which cost ~$ 2. 00 each. 1. Dehydrate uranyl acetate-treated cells in a series of ethanol-water washes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, two 95 %, and three 100 % ethanol). If possible, use ethanol dried over molecular sieve pellets (Sigma Chemical Corp. #M 2260). Dehydrate in polypropylene conical centrifuge tubes and let cells settle between washes. - Place specimen capsule in a shallow dish (ex: glass petri dish) containing 100 % dry ethanol and transfer dehydrated cells into the capsule. Do not fill the capsule more than about one third full with cells or they will cake during the drying procedure. Firmly fit the lid to the capsule and transfer to the critical point dryer. - If more than one sample capsule will be dried at the same time, label the outside of each capsule with pencil and/or insert a tiny piece of paper (marked with pencil) into the capsule before capping. - Critical point dry cells using a critical point drying apparatus and CO 2. - Dust the dried cells on a SEM specimen stub covered with a piece of double stick tape. Spreading is easier if cells are brushed on the tape with a fine camel hair brush while observing spreading with a dissecting microscope. - Coat specimens on the stubs with gold/palladium using a sputter coater. - Store specimens in a dry container. **Method 2 :** This method is simple but requires that cells or organelles stick to a coated glass coverslip. Many cells are lost during the dehydration procedure but, usually, more than enough cells will stick for SEM observation. 1. Place a 12 mm circular coverslip on a piece of Parafilm or in a small plastic or glass petri dish. - Apply a drop of an 0. 5 % aqueous solution of polyethylenimine (Sigma P- 3143) to the coverslip. Let sit for 10 - 20 min. - Remove the drop of polyethylenimine and rinse with one or two drops of deionized water. - Put a drop of fixed cells in water or uranyl acetate on the coverslip and let settle for 5 - 10 min. - Dehydrate samples with a series of ethanol-water washes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, two 95 %, and three 100 % ethanol). For the last, washes, use ethanol dried by molecular sieve pellets (Sigma Chemical Corporation, Cat #M 2260). Many cells will detach from the coverslips during the dehydration procedure. This can be minimized if solutions are removed with a pipette held vertically over the specimens. - Dry cells using a critical point drying apparatus and CO 2. Use a cover-slip holder designed for the dryer or prop the coverslips on a plastic separator removed from a typical microscope slide box. - Remove the coverslips from the dryer and attach them to SEM specimen stubs using double stick tape or adhesive tabs (# 76760 from Electron Microscopy Sciences). - Coat specimens with gold/palladium (60 - 40) using a [sputter coater]([URL] - Store specimens in a dry container...|$|R
40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory ### Method: 1. Pellet Tetrahymena {{cells in}} a {{clinical}} centrifuge. *OPTIONAL: Suspend cells in HNMK (50 mM HEPES, pH 6. 9, 36 mM NaCl, 0. 1 mM Mg acetate, 1 mM KCl) for 10 - 20 min at room temperture. This will remove precipitates present in the proteose peptone and provide <b>cleaner</b> surfaces if <b>cells</b> are processed for SEM*. - Pour off most of the medium and suspend cells in a slurry (< 1 ml of remaining medium) {{at the bottom of}} the tube (be gentle). - Fix by adding 5 - 10 ml of 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7. 2. Mix gently and let sit at room temperture for 1 hr. - Gently pellet cells in the clinical centrifuge (don't pack cells). Suspend gently in 100 mM NaCacodylate, pH 7. 2. - Repeat step 4 three times. - Prepare 0. 5 - 1 % OsO 4 in NaCacodylate, pH 7. 2 and add to the fixed cells - suspend gently and incubate on ice for 30 - 60 min. - Rinse 3 X, ~ 5 min/rinse, with water (gently pelleting each time, if necessary). - Suspend final washed cells in 0. 5 - 1 % uranyl acetate (aqueous). Incubate from 30 min to overnight. - Dehydrate cells in acetone (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 3 X 100 %; 3 - 10 min/change). - Embed in [epon resin]([URL] I mix dehydrated cells with 1 / 3 plastic and 2 / 3 acetone and let them sit on a rotator for a few hours or, uncovered, overnight in the hood (on the rotator). The next day, I pellet the cells and suspend them in 100 % plastic. Suspend cells in a small amount of plastic and then underlay the suspension with 100 % plastic. Let the cells sit for several hours and place in house vacuum for ~ 1 hr. For final embedding, pellet cells, remove all plastic. Cut the tops off BEEM capsules, drop the capsules in a plastic conical centrifuge tube, and fill BEEM capsules ~half full with plastic. Suspend pelleted cells and lay over fresh plastic. Centrifuge the cells through the plastic. Remove the plastic and add additional plastic to the pelleted cells. Stirr them up a bit. Then centrifuge again (clinical centrifuge, # 7, 30 min) to pellet the cells very well. Put tubes at 40 degrees C overnight and raise to 70 - 80 degrees C for ~ 24 hrs. Polymerize at 40 degrees C overnight and raise to 65 - 80 degrees for a second day. [![DOI]([URL]...|$|R
