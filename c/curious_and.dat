5|$|Chloe Sullivan {{has been}} {{characterized}} as independent, intelligent, <b>curious</b> <b>and</b> impulsive by both the writers and the actress that portrays her.

Mack has been recognized with multiple award nominations and wins for her portrayal of Chloe.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, {{the man and}} {{one woman}} walk into the woods {{together}} and masturbate each other while standing. The other woman, left at the car, becomes <b>curious</b> <b>and</b> follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was <b>curious</b> <b>and</b> interested in learning.|$|E

5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, <b>curious,</b> <b>and</b> especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|Western gunslinger {{heroes are}} portrayed as local lawmen or {{enforcement}} officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle - courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking). They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering {{from place to place}} with no particular direction, often facing <b>curious</b> <b>and</b> hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly <b>curious,</b> <b>and</b> her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

25|$|As of 2006, {{scientists}} had minimal success satellite tagging North Pacific right whales. Observations total probably less than 50 hours {{over the last}} 50 years. What {{little is known about}} North Pacific right whale behavior suggests that it is similar to the behavior of right whales in other oceans, except in its choice of wintering grounds. The individual which was observed during a whale-watching tour off the Kii Peninsula, Japan breached six times in a row in 2006. The same whale watching operator had two different sightings in 2006 and again had a very close encounter with a right whale in 2011. This animal was very <b>curious</b> <b>and</b> active; it swam around the vessel for more than 2 hours, breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, and pec-slapping close to the boat. The ship had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following them. Another <b>curious</b> <b>and</b> playful individual was encountered during a whale-watching trip off Bonin Islands in March 2014.|$|E

25|$|Indian merchants {{involved}} in spice trade took Indian cuisine to Southeast Asia, notably present day Malaysia and Indonesia, where spice mixtures and curries became popular. European people intermarried with the Indians, and popularized valuable culinary skills, such as baking, in India.

25|$|With new {{financial}} backing, Goddard eventually relocated to Roswell, New Mexico, in summer of 1930, {{where he worked}} with his team of technicians in near-isolation and relative secrecy for years. He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the <b>curious,</b> <b>and</b> would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard's health). The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard's facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.|$|E
25|$|Wolf-dog hybrids are {{a mixture}} of genetic traits, which results in less {{predictable}} behavior patterns compared to either the wolf or dog. The adult behavior of hybrid pups also cannot be predicted with comparable certainty to dog pups, even in third-generation pups produced by wolfdog mating with dogs or from {{the behavior of the}} parent animals. Thus, though the behavior of a single individual wolf hybrid may be predictable, the behavior of the type as a whole is not. The majority of high wolf-content hybrids are very <b>curious</b> <b>and</b> are generally no more destructive than any other curious or active dogs.|$|E
