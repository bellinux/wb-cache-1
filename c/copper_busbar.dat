Samples of “failed” windshield material were characterized using optical and electron microscopy, as well as surface analysis methods. These were compared to corresponding samples of “good” coatings. The primary failure mechanism of the coated windshield appears {{to be related to}} electrical discharges that originate where air-filled gaps are present between the <b>copper</b> <b>busbar</b> and the conductive coating.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{the influence of}} tightness or contacts pressure on <b>copper</b> <b>busbar</b> joints to determine changes {{in the value of}} the initial contact resistance and the maximum temperature at the joint due to high current load. The test sample using <b>copper</b> <b>busbar</b> 3 x 30 mm with configuration of bolted overlapping joint. Increasing contact pressure at the joint was measured to find out its effect on the value of contact resistance. The applied pressure was 6 to 36 MPa. Procedure of contact resistance measurement refer to the ASTM B 539 standard using four-wire method. The sample subsequently loaded with the current of 350 A for 60 minutes and the maximum temperature at the joint was measured. The result show that increasing contact pressure at the busbar joint will reduce the contact resistance and maximum temperature. The increasing of contact pressure from 6 to 30 MPa causes decreasing contact resistance from 16 μΩ to 11 μΩ. Further increasing of contact pressure more than 30 MPa didn’t affect the contact resistance significantly. The lowest temperatur of busbar joint of 54 °C was reached at a contact pressure of 36 Mpa. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>busbar</b> {{conductors}} are {{an integral}} part of any high current switchboard. A suitable switchboard design must be capable of withstanding the mechanical, electrical and thermal stresses which are likely to be encountered in normal service. The aim of the project is to simulate and model, in Matlab, the operating temperature of various current carrying <b>copper</b> <b>busbar</b> conductor arrangements in a specific bus zone and to assist with design selection to Australian Standards. The project objectives, detailed in the dissertation, list several milestones to achieve the project aim. The objectives can be summarised into three categories: 1. Research 2. Matlab Script Development 3. Testing Although three distinct categories, a continuous cycle of all three was implemented throughout the project to generate acceptable results. The developed Matlab Script is able to produce plots that contain operating temperature curves for a given current and ambient temperature. This provides another method for switchboard manufactures to determine busbar current carrying capacities within the specific enclosure. The accuracy of the curves are within ± 8 % when compared with the AS 3000 : 1991 method, which is also an approximation, and within 1 % error when compared with the real test results (Type Tested) for the specified enclosure at a single point. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} coupled electromagnetic {{and thermal}} field analysis of busbar system (of rectangular cross-section geometry) submitted to short circuit conditions. The laboratory model was validated against both analytical solution and experimental observations. The considered problem required the computation of the detailed {{distribution of the}} power losses and the heat transfer modes. In this electromagnetic and thermal analysis, different definitions of electric busbar heating were considered and compared. The busbar system is a three phase one and consists of aluminum, painted aluminum and <b>copper</b> <b>busbar.</b> The solution to the coupled field problem is obtained using the finite element method and the QuickField ™ program.

40|$|AbstractA screen-printable copper paste {{has been}} {{developed}} by Dow Corning to replace the standard screen-printable silver paste for use in front busbars for solar cells. Solar cells produced with these ‘passivated copper busbars’ have shown increased conversion efficiency due to an improved device operating voltage and current while maintaining a similar fill factor when compared to cells with standard ‘fired-through’ silver busbars. In addition to the improved cell efficiency, the use of copper paste may provide major cost savings {{compared to the use}} of silver, potentially giving a very significant reduction in cost per Watt. 60 -cell modules have been produced at Trina Solar with passivated <b>copper</b> <b>busbars,</b> showing similar performance to the reference modules with silver busbars.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{metal welding}} {{is widely used}} for joining {{multiple}} layers of dissimilar metals, such as aluminum/copper battery tabs welding onto <b>copper</b> <b>busbars.</b> It is therefore {{important to have a}} robust product/process design using ultrasonic metal welding that ensures consistent welds with desired quality. In this work, the effects of longitudinal and flexural vibrations of the battery tab during ultrasonic welding on the development of axial normal stresses that occasionally cause cracks near the weld area are studied by applying a one-dimensional continuous vibration model for the battery tab. Analysis results indicate that fracture could occur near the weld area, due to low cycle fatigue as a result of large dynamic stresses induced by resonant flexural vibration of the battery tab during welding. This study provides a fundamental understanding of battery tab dynamics during ultrasonic welding and its effects on weld quality, and can be used to develop guidelines for product/process design of ultrasonically welded battery tabs...|$|R
40|$|A high {{proportion}} of the faults in electrical substations are due to the overheating of busbar joints. Surface contamination due to atmospheric corrosion is a main cause. Laser surface treatments have previously been applied by the authors to improve the surface hardness and corrosion resistance of aluminium alloys. Similarly, a chromium protective coating can be produced on copper by laser-alloying. This should allow more reliable bolt-together busbar joints to be made up on site with less attention to surface cleanliness. In this study experimental investigations were made into the mechanical and electrical properties of laser-treated <b>copper</b> <b>busbar</b> joints under various conditions of applied torque and current flow. It {{was found that the}} maximum hardness of the laser-alloyed layer could reach HV 95, which is almost 50 % higher than that of the original sample. There were insignificant differences between the temperature distribution associated with the laser-alloyed and the untreated samples. The corrosion resistance of the laser-alloyed sample is slightly better than that of the original sample in the salt spray corrosion test. The electric conductivity of the uncorroded laser-alloyed joints was only slightly lower than that of the uncorroded untreated joints.

40|$|International audienceFluorine is {{produced}} from electrolysis of KF/HF mixtures at around 95 °C. In the cell configuration, carbon anodes are screwed onto a <b>copper</b> <b>busbar.</b> Much {{attention has been}} paid to the stability of copper since the corrosion and re-deposition of this metal on the cathodes is one of the main factors (side reaction) which limit the production yield of fluorine gas, the lifetime of the cells and the development of new electrolyzers. Therefore, in the frame of this study, various experiments were carried out to determine the corrosion rate of copper for a wide range of HF ratio and temperature. A statistics approach of the electrochemical data allowed us to predict the corrosion rate for many the operating conditions. At OCV, copper shows a good corrosion resistance even for high HF ratios. However, under a 6 V anodic polarization, copper corrosion rate raises drastically with an increase of the temperature and / or the HF ratio. Characterization techniques have shown that only a thin copper fluoride layer has been detected on copper at OCV. By contrast, two types of copper fluorides were evidenced at the electrode surface (CuF 2 and KCuF 3) when a potential was applied to Cu. Under anodic polarization, a thin CuF 2 layer is formed at the copper surface whereas KCuF 3 is detected at on the electrode surface resulting from the precipitation of Cu 2 +. For a better interpretation of the results, erosion-corrosion phenomenon issued from the fluorine bubbles impacts and electrolyte movements has been highlighted by weight losses of copper pieces. The breakdown of the passivation layer on copper and the exposition of the surface to the corrosive medium imply a quicker degradation of the metallic pieces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} use of a screen-printable copper paste to form the front busbars on high {{efficiency}} photovoltaic cell structures in combination with copper fingers formed by light induced plating. Such a process route offers economic benefits relative to the fully plated front metallization due to the reduced requirement for laser ablation and increased cell performance. We demonstrate improved open circuit voltage and fill factor compared to cells that used plating for both the fingers and the busbars. These result from reduced contact between the semiconductor and the metal and from reduced shunting compared to the laser ablated and plated electrodes. p-type ‘PERC’ cells have been fabricated with copper plated fingers and screen-printed <b>copper</b> <b>busbars</b> with a median cell efficiency of 20. 4 %, compared to 20. 3 % for those with fully plated busbars. n-type ‘PERT’ cells reached a cell efficiency of 20. 9 % for both front metallization schemes. The screen-printed busbars gave a ∼ 5 mV advantage over the plated busbars in both cases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandia Laboratories is {{performing}} modeling and {{analysis on the}} causes of solar arc fault failures and fires. As part of this work, recent module failures (modules ~ 6 years in service) at a large photovoltaic power plant in the southwest United States have been documented, and the failure modes determined through physics based analysis. The analysis and modeling indicates that arc faults within the module are likely {{the cause of the}} observed failures. Failed or failing solder connections between the busbars and connector ribbons, and connector ribbons and the backside contacts are the common theme in these failures. Electrical modeling shows that an interconnect ribbon to busbar connection that has separated by 5 microns (through either diurnal cycling or corrosion) can experience a sufficient electric field driven by just the module voltage, to cause an arc flash. Further thermo-mechanical modeling shows that a mere 0. 4 mm 2 arc region can generate heat energy sufficient to shatter the glass, burn off (volatilize or boil) the <b>copper</b> <b>busbar’s</b> tin coating, as well as char the other materials used in a solar module stack, all within the millisecond to 2 second time frame...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{drive systems}} which provide a high power density at low costs {{are a major}} success factor for the {{competitiveness}} of future electric vehicles. This paper de-scribes a drive inverter that is deeply integrated into the electric motor, {{as well as the}} innovative modular power electronics concepts that are substantial for creating more compact and more cost effective electric power trains. The central components of the presented approach towards higher integration are so-called Smart Stator Teeth (SST). The SST concept blurs the borders between the inverter and the motor by connecting each individual stator winding with its own electronic module. Thus, the current in every tooth can be optimally controlled with respect to efficiency, independently from the other teeth. Furthermore, research is done on the construction of a novel power module based on SiC semiconductor de-vices. In this concept, the semiconductors are directly bonded onto <b>copper</b> <b>busbars</b> by silver sintering. The increased degree of design freedom created by this method is used to realize commutations cells with inductances below 1 nH. At the same time, the module volume is reduced by 30 % compared to DCB based modules...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{concerns}} over {{the environmental impacts of}} buildings have led to increasing demands for more environmental friendly buildings and building materials. Hitherto, there are not any comprehensive studies that show the overall environmental impact profiles of building materials and building services components for buildings. This paper intends to bridge this gap by reporting overall lifecycle environmental profiles of buildings as well as the ranking orders of environmental impacts of all the building materials and building services materials and components for commercial buildings. Twenty-five commercial buildings in Hong Kong, which include three Grade A office buildings, four Grade B office buildings, one Grade C office buildings, four retail centers and three hotels, have been selected for our study. Based upon these collected samples, no statistical differences were found in the average lifecycle environmental impacts for different building types despite some minor variations were detected. Subsequently, 10 types of building materials and 10 types of building services components have been identified for their significant lifecycle environmental impacts on commercial buildings. Among all, concrete, reinforcement bar, copper power cables, and <b>copper</b> <b>busbars</b> were ranked to be the four most significant materials or components to the total lifecycle environmental impacts. These should form the major targets for improvements in environmental performance of commercial buildings. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Encapsulation of {{components}} and assemblies has become {{widespread in the}} design of electronic products, providing protection from the environment and enhancing reliability. In this thesis, computational simulations are used to parametrically investigate the thermomechanical role played by the encapsulant when a beam-lead component is welded to slender <b>copper</b> <b>busbars,</b> encapsulated in a polymeric encapsulant, and subjected to temperature cycling. The parametric studies are conducted in two phases, using simplified two-dimensional finite element models. In the first phase, a parametric design space is generated to systematically vary the encapsulant's thermomechanical properties, namely the Young's modulus and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion. A gull wing geometry is introduced into the lead of the component as a stress relief feature. In this case, a ramp thermal loading profile is used to understand the physics of this design and to provide relative comparisons between different combinations of the encapsulant's material properties within the design space. Response surface models are generated over the design space. In the second phase, a Taguchi Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, based on orthogonal arrays, is used to analyze the effects of multiple design parameters under cyclic thermal loading. This includes encapsulant properties (a subset of the properties investigated in the first phase), encapsulant dimensions, lead geometry and dimensions, and busbar dimensions. Lead geometry is considered with and without stress relief features. The loading used in this phase is three temperature cycles between - 40 oC and 90 oC. The primary areas of concern (response variables) in both studies are the component lead and interconnect regions. Deformation and stress states in these critical regions are compared. Main factor effects and selected parameter interactions are computed in accordance with the Taguchi orthogonal arrays, to understand the dominant parameters and parameter interactions for cyclic thermomechanical stresses in this encapsulated assembly...|$|R
2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops.

For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened <b>copper</b> tubing or <b>busbars)</b> and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|R
