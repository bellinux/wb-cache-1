5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) {{drafted a}} Qualitative Material Requirement (QMR) for an interim, {{commercial}} off-the-shelf (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{guidance}} from the Secretary of the Army, CDC established Qualitative Material Development Objectives (QMDO) for a rotary-wing aircraft with 195-knot (224mph, 361km/h) <b>cruise</b> <b>speed,</b> 220-knot (253mph, 407km/h) dash speed, and {{the capability to}} hover out-of-ground-effect (OGE) at 6,000feet (1,830m) on a 95°F (35°C) day. The speed requirements were derived from the speed of aircraft the helicopter would escort. The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDRE) conditionally approved the changes to the development objectives, pending his review of the proposed program. He also directed the Army {{to determine whether or}} not any other helicopter could offer an improvement in performance over the UH-1B in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|The 747 {{line was}} further {{developed}} with {{the launch of}} the 747-300 in 1980. The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747, during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over {{the entire length of the}} fuselage were rejected. The first 747-300, completed in 1983, included a stretched upper deck, increased <b>cruise</b> <b>speed,</b> and increased seating capacity. The -300 variant was previously designated 747SUD for stretched upper deck, then 747-200 SUD, followed by 747EUD, before the 747-300 designation was used. Passenger, short range and combination freighter-passenger versions of the 300 series were produced.|$|E
40|$|Speed of {{locomotion}} {{plays an}} important role in an animal’s biology and ecology and is of particular interest in aquatic animals. Determining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of shark—for which such data are scarce—may help to better understand their interactions with prey, the size of the home ranges they maintain, their energetic costs and how they interact with their environment through sensory perception. In this study, the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of a range of different shark species were measured using stereo-baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS). The relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> and fork length, species, order, habitat, trophic level, temperature and tail shape was then modelled. Fork length and species best explained the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of the eight species of shark studied: Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus albimarginatus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Furgaleus macki, Carcharhinus obesus, Mustelus antarcticus, Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Parascyllium variolatum. This linear model had a slope that did not differ statistically from that of the theoretical model proposed by Weihs (Scale effects in animal locomotion, Academic Press, New York, pp 333 – 338, 1977), which suggests that the relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> and length appears to be dominated by energetics. The results suggest that existing allometric estimates of <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> can be improved by defining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> for each species as a function of length. Currently, literature presents <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> data for only a few species of shark; therefore, we provide a second, generalised model, which predicts <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> as a function of length and tail shape. The length + tail shape model was selected based on its generality and accuracy in estimating shark <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> obtained from acoustic tags. This length + tail shape model was significantly better than a length only model; it explained a further 76  % of the variation in <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> derived from stereo-BRUVS and acoustic tagging data than a length only model. The more accurate prediction of the length + tail shape model is most likely because tail shape is correlated with a number of ecological factors. 12 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475km/h (295mph) at 5,000m (16,400ft) and a <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> of 370km/h (230mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300km/h (190mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.|$|E
5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high <b>cruise</b> <b>speed.</b> Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
5|$|This work {{led to an}} {{interesting}} discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical <b>cruise</b> <b>speed,</b> in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied {{that there was no}} point in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-performance}} glider {{is defined}} as a glider which has been designed to carry the pilot in a minimum of time a given distance, taking into account conditions which are as conveniently as possible. The present investigation has the objective to show approaches for enhancing the cross-country flight <b>cruising</b> <b>speed,</b> giving attention to the difficulties which the design engineer will have to overcome. The characteristics of the cross-country flight and their relation to the <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> are discussed, and a description is provided of mathematical expressions concerning the <b>cruising</b> <b>speed,</b> the sinking speed, and the optimum gliding speed. The effect of aspect ratio and wing loading on the <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> is illustrated {{with the aid of a}} graph. Trends in glider development are explored, taking into consideration the design of laminar profiles, the reduction of profile-related drag by plain flaps, and the variation of wing loading during the flight. A number of suggestions are made for obtaining gliders with improved performance...|$|R
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} {{delivery}} of its propeller, the first prototype was rolled out at Brough in February 1947 and then taken by road to RAF Leconfield where it made its maiden flight on 1 April that year. All three prototypes were completed {{by the end of}} September and the third prototype had been modified to reduce the outer-wing dihedral to 3 degrees. Both the second and third prototypes remained unflown when the Ministry of Supply ordered that flying be ceased and work on the aircraft be stopped. Later in the month, however, the third prototype was allocated to tests of powered aileron controls, as testing of the first prototype had shown that while adequate at <b>cruise</b> <b>speed,</b> the ailerons were heavy both at low and high speed. The second prototype was allocated to structural testing.|$|E
5|$|A new {{programme}} {{was initiated}} subsequently, called Joint European Transport (JET). This {{was set up}} in June 1977, and was based at the then British Aerospace (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus. This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s. It would have a <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> of Mach 0.84 (faster than Boeing 737). The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up {{to the creation of the}} Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of JET programme, Derek Brown. The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3. Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively. The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa. However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase <b>cruise</b> <b>speed,</b> climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E
