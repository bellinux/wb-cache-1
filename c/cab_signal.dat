25|$|Many of {{the class}} were fitted with <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> equipment, the {{electronics}} for which were largely contained in a wood box affixed to the right-hand side running board {{in front of the}} reversing gear and aft of the smokebox.|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Supervision {{sub-system}} {{provides for}} headway management and proper interleaving of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains. The system works via {{a series of}} track mounted balises, which function as information beacons transmitting a speed code to the train as it passes overhead. Its designers intended its function to be non-vital, and for this reason, the design is not fail-safe. At no point can the ATC system override the maximum speed limit enforced by the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> system.|$|E
25|$|On {{portions}} of the railroad equipped with ASC, Engineers consult the speed display unit, which is capable of displaying 7 speed indications. They are 80,70,60,40,30,15 on electric trains while some diesel locomotives have slightly lower speed-steps {{when compared to the}} electrics. As a result of a December 1, 2013, train derailment in the Bronx on the Metro-North Railroad, railroads with similar <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> systems to Metro-North, such as the LIRR, were ordered to modify the systems to enforce certain speed limit changes, which has resulted in lower average speeds and actual speed limits across the LIRR.|$|E
50|$|In 1923 US&S {{developed}} the first inductive train control system. (See also pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling.)</b> The company developed coded track circuits, supporting bi-directional <b>cab</b> <b>signalling,</b> in 1934.|$|R
50|$|All <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems {{must have}} a {{continuous}} in-cab indication to inform the driver of track condition ahead; however, these fall into two main categories. Intermittent <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> are updated at discrete points along the rail line and between these points the display will reflect information from the last update. Continuous <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> receive a continuous flow {{of information about the}} state of the track ahead and can have the cab indication change at any time to reflect any updates. The majority of <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems, including those that use coded track circuits, are continuous.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} {{considered}} to equip {{some of the}} newer engines with <b>cab</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{to allow them to}} run on <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> only-routes. This was tentatively done on the 11512 «Horgen».|$|R

5000|$|Finally, the cab {{signals are}} {{considered}} a completely independent system that transmits a continuous stream of codes through the rails instead of via wireless transmission. Any fault in the ACSES overlay will not affect the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> system and moreover a <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> failure will not affect the ACSES system. Without cab signals ACSES will continue to enforce positive stops at absolute signals, all permanent and temporary speed restrictions and a positive stop at any signal {{at the entrance to}} <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> without fixed wayside signal territory that is not displaying [...] "Clear to Next Interlocking." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>Signaling</b> <b>Signals</b> - Where <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{employed}} without fixed trackside automatic signals, special signal aspects are required at absolute signals. These include {{some sort of}} absolute block [...] "Super Clear" [...] signal that allows passage to the next interlocking with a fixed signal and also the [...] "Cab Speed" [...] signal that informs the engineer to proceed under direction of <b>cab</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> {{is a form}} of <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> {{technology}} {{developed in}} the United States by the Union Switch and Signal corporation for the Pennsylvania Railroad in the 1920s. The 4-aspect system widely adopted by the PRR and its successor railroads has become the dominant railroad <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> system in North America with versions of the technology also being adopted in Europe and rapid transit systems. In its home territory on former PRR successor Conrail owned lines and on railroads operating under the NORAC Rulebook it is known simply as <b>Cab</b> <b>Signaling</b> System or CSS.|$|R
5000|$|PATCO {{trains are}} governed by a Pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> system which transmits signal codes to the trains via the running rails. Wayside signals are located only at {{interlockings}} and consist of two lamps on a single signal head, one lunar white, the other red. There are three typical signal indications, Red for [...] "Stop", Lunar for [...] "proceed under <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> on main route" [...] and flashing lunar for [...] "proceed under <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> on diverging route".|$|R

50|$|Cab {{signals are}} {{presented}} to the locomotive {{by means of a}} <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> display unit. The earliest CDUs consisted of miniature signals of the type visible along the track, back lit by light bulbs. These could be found in both color light and position light varieties depending on the railroad's native signaling system. Modern CDUs on passenger trains are often integrated with the speedometer, as cab signals now serve a speed control function. On trains equipped with automatic train control functionality failure to properly acknowledge a restrictive <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> change results in a 'penalty brake application', as does failure to observe the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> speed limit.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1920s, the PRR {{installed}} Pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> along certain tracks used by high-speed passenger trains. Information traveled through the rails using track circuits, {{was picked up by}} a sensor on the locomotive, and displayed in the engineer's cab. PRR ultimately installed <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> on its New York-Washington, Philadelphia-Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh-Indianapolis lines (the latter which was later downgraded by PC and ultimately abandoned by Conrail). PRR also experimented with <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> without wayside signals, an approach later expanded by Conrail (Conemaugh line) and Norfolk Southern Railway (Cleveland line). <b>Cab</b> <b>signals</b> were subsequently adopted by several other U.S. railroads, especially on passenger lines. This technology, advanced for its time, is still used by Amtrak.|$|R
50|$|The variant KLUB-P (КЛУБ-П) is {{restricted}} to <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> without track safety equipment. It is only used in category-II trains (including special cars and shunting movements). The variant KLUB-UP (КЛУБ-УП) is allowed for category-I trains (including passenger transport) where it replaces the <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> of ALSN.|$|R
50|$|Some {{locomotives}} {{are equipped}} to display <b>cab</b> <b>signals.</b> These can display signal indications through patterns of {{lights in the}} locomotive cab, or in simple systems merely produce an audible sound to warn the driver of a restrictive aspect. Occasionally, <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> are used by themselves, but more commonly {{they are used to}} supplement signals placed at lineside. <b>Cab</b> <b>signalling</b> is particularly useful on high speed railways. In the absence of lineside signals, fixed markers may be provided at those places where signals would otherwise exist, to mark the limit of a movement authority.|$|R
50|$|Over {{time the}} PRR {{installed}} cab signals {{over much of}} its eastern system from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, New York to Washington. This system was then inherited by Conrail and Amtrak and various commuter agencies running on former PRR territory such as SEPTA and New Jersey Transit. Because all trains running in <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> territory had to be equipped with cab signals, most locomotives of the aforementioned roads were equipped with <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> equipment. Due {{to the effect of}} interoperability lock in, the 4-aspect PRR <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> system has become a de facto standard and almost all new cab signaling installations have been of this type or a compatible type.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the wreck, all {{locomotives}} operating on the Northeast Corridor are now required to have automatic <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> with an automatic train stop feature. Although common on passenger trains up until that time, <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> combined with train stop and speed control had never been installed on freight locomotives due to potential train handling issues at high speed. Conrail subsequently developed a device called a locomotive speed limiter (LSL), a computerized device that is designed to monitor and control the rate of deceleration for restrictive signals in conjunction with <b>cab</b> <b>signals.</b> All freight locomotives operated on the Northeast Corridor must now be equipped with an operating LSL which also limits top speed to 50 mph. Previously, freight locomotives were only required to have automatic <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> without an automatic train stop feature.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>signaling</b> A more {{significant}} {{difference is the}} extensive use of <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> and enforced signal systems, such as ETMS and ATS in Europe. Implementation of automatic systems is limited in the U.S., despite the current effort to introduce the positive train control (PTC) on {{a large portion of}} corridors [11].|$|R

50|$|The Hudson, Harlem and New Haven {{lines and}} the New Canaan branch and all {{passenger}} rolling stock is equipped with cab signalling, which displays the appropriate block signal in the engineer’s cab. All rolling stock is equipped with Automatic Train Control (ATC), which enforces the speed dictated by the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> by a penalty brake application should the engineer fail to obey it. There are no intermediate wayside signals between interlockings: operation is solely by <b>cab</b> <b>signal.</b> Wayside signals remain at interlockings. These are a special type of signal, a go or a stop signal. They do not convey information about traffic in the blocks ahead - the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> conveys block information.|$|E

50|$|All tramlines run on {{standard}} gauge track {{and use the}} same overhead voltage, 750 V DC. But there are three different <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems, one for Lidingöbanan, one for Tvärbanan Alvik-Sickla and a third for Tvärbanan Solna-Alvik. This makes rolling stock incompatible. The other tramlines (Nockeby and City/Djurgården) have no <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> requirement.|$|R
50|$|Wireless <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems {{dispense}} with all track-based communications infrastructure and instead rely on fixed wireless transmitters to send trains signalling information.

50|$|The {{system is}} {{failsafe}} {{in that the}} lack of code would display a Restricting signal. The codes would be transmitted to the train from the block limit in front of it. This way if the rail was broken or another train entered the block, any codes would not reach the onrushing train and the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> would again display Restricting. Trains with an insufficient number of axles will not short out all of the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> current so that following trains might receive an incorrect aspect. Trains of this type must be given absolute block protection to the rear.|$|E

50|$|While {{train speed}} {{optimization}} needs some technical infrastructure, {{it is more}} of an operational concept than a technical installation.
