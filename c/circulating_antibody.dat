50|$|Arthus {{reactions}} {{have been}} infrequently reported after vaccinations containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoid. The CDC's description:Arthus reactions (type III hypersensitivity reactions) are rarely reported after vaccination and can occur after tetanus toxoid-containing or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines. An Arthus reaction {{is a local}} vasculitis associated with deposition of immune complexes and activation of complement. Immune complexes form {{in the setting of}} high local concentration of vaccine antigens and high <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> concentration. Arthus reactions are characterized by severe pain, swelling, induration, edema, hemorrhage, and occasionally by necrosis. These symptoms and signs usually occur 4-12 hours after vaccination. ACIP has recommended that persons who experienced an Arthus reaction after a dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should not receive Td more frequently than every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of wound management.|$|E
50|$|The Arthus {{reaction}} {{involves the}} in situ formation of antigen/antibody complexes after the intradermal injection of an antigen. If the animal/patient was previously sensitized (has <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody),</b> an Arthus reaction occurs. Typical of most mechanisms {{of the type}} III hypersensitivity, Arthus manifests as local vasculitis due to deposition of IgG-based immune complexes in dermal blood vessels. Activation of complement primarily results in cleavage of soluble complement proteins forming C5a and C3a, which activate recruitment of PMNs and local mast cell degranulation (requiring the binding of the immune complex onto FcγRIII), resulting in an inflammatory response. Further aggregation of immune complex-related processes induce a local fibrinoid necrosis with ischemia-aggravating thrombosis in the tissue vessel walls. The end result is a localized area of redness and induration that typically lasts a day or so.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{effect on}} {{spermatogenesis}} of intratesticular and subcutaneous immunization with genital tract fluids of bulls was studied in sexually mature guinea-pigs, rabbits and sheep. Immunization with bovine seminal vesicle fluid produced {{a decrease in}} the index weight of the testes, a disturbance of spermatogenesis and, in more severe cases, a distortion and contraction of the seminiferous tubules. In all animals immunized subcutaneously, identical <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies</b> were found in animals with damaged testes and in animals with normal testes.

5000|$|Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), {{also known}} as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, {{is a type of}} cancer {{affecting}} two types of B cells, lymphoplasmacytoid cells and plasma cells. Both cell types are white blood cells. WM is characterized by having high levels of a <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody,</b> immunoglobulin M (IgM), which is made and secreted by the cells involved in the disease. WM is an [...] "indolent lymphoma" [...] (i.e., one that tends to grow and spread slowly) and a type of lymphoproliferative disease which shares clinical characteristics with the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. WM is commonly classified as a form of plasma cell dyscrasia. Similar to other plasma cell dyscrasias that, for example, lead to multiple myeloma, WM is commonly preceded by two clinically asymptomatic but progressively more pre-malignant phases, IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (i.e. IgM MGUS) and smoldering Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. The WM spectrum of dysplasias differs from other spectrums of plasma cell dyscrasias in that it involves not only aberrant plasma cells but also aberrant lymphpplasmacytoid cells and that it involves IgM while other plasma dyscrasias involve other antibody isoforms.|$|E
50|$|It {{is quite}} {{possible}} to immunize a person directly with small and graded doses of venom rather than an animal. According to Greek history, King Mithridates did this {{in order to protect}} himself against attempts of poisoning, therefore this procedure is often called mithridatization. However, unlike a vaccination against disease which must only produce a latent immunity that can be roused in case of infection, to neutralize a sudden and large dose of venom requires maintaining a high level of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> (a hyperimmunized state), through repeated venom injections (typically every 21 days). The long-term health effects of this process have not been studied. Further, cytotoxic venom components can cause pain and scarring at the immunization site. Finally, the resistance is specific to the particular venom used; maintaining resistance to a variety of venoms requires multiple monthly venom injections. Thus, there is no practical purpose or favorable cost/benefit ratio for this, except for people like zoo handlers, researchers, and circus artists who deal closely with venomous animals. Mithridatization has been tried with success in Australia and Brazil and total immunity has been achieved even to multiple bites of extremely venomous cobras and pit vipers.|$|E
40|$|Injection {{of foreign}} protein into a guinea pig may induce delayed hypersensitivity, {{followed}} by <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and Arthus-type hypersensitivity (1, 2). If the antigenic dose is sufficiently minute, delayed hypersensitivity is not {{followed by the}} appearance of detectable amounts of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> (3). If a guinea pig with delayed hypersensitivity is, however, again stimulated with the specific homologous antigen, an anamnestic response appears, wherein <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and Arthus-type hypersensitivity develop. The suggestion has been made that delayed hypersensitivity {{is a step in the}} formation of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> (2). The question then arises whether delayed hypersensitivity has a more primitive type of specificity than Arthus reactions and <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> The present paper describes experiments which indicate that the specificity governing delayed hypersensitivity is different from that governing <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> The delayed response, as illustrated by experiments with protein conjugates and avian albumins as antigens, is produced in response to a broad general area of the antigen molecule, whereas the reactions of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> are controlled by small, specific groupings of the antigen. These studies also indicate that delayed hypersensitivity is an intermediate stage in the formation of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody...</b>|$|E
40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify specific <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against tryptophan derivatives (TD), NO and NO 2 - modified amino acid residues in patient sera of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer disease (AD), remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis form (RR-MS) and secondary progressive form (SP-MS). The second objective was to determine immunoglobulin classes of identified <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies.</b> For the antibody evaluation, we synthesized TD conjugates, NO- and NO 2 -conjugates in order to mimic metabolites induced during the pathogenic processes. The TD antigens were: tryptophan, kynurenin, 3 OH-kynurenin, kynurenic acid, picolinic acid, xanthurenic acid, anthranilic acid, 3 OH-anthranilic acid, quinolinic acid and quinaldic acid, linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using carbodiimide coupling reaction. Then, conjugates were purified and the coupling ratios were evaluated. NO- and NO 2 -conjugates were the following amino acid residues: nitrotyrosine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, citrulline, tryptophan, asparagine, creatin, cysteine, methionine, histidine, arginine, linked to BSA via glutaraldehyde reaction. After a reduction step and purification, a nitrosylation with NaNO 2 was done, except for nitrotyrosine conjugate. All conjugates were coated on well plates for identification of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies.</b> High levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies</b> to TD conjugates, NO- and NO 2 -conjugates were found in ALS, AD, RR-MS, SP-MS in comparison of healthy control sera, using ELISA assays. Immunodetection of IgG, IgM and IgA classes directed against TD conjugates, NO- and NO 2 - amino acid residue conjugates was done. These studies shown that: 1) specific <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against TD, NO- and NO 2 - modified components were found for each pathology with a specific pattern. The identification of specific antibodies indirectly reveals the stimulation of enzymatic and immunologic mechanism disorders associated with these diseases; 2) specific profiles of immunoglobulins were also observed for each disease. The identification of differential isotype classes to these neoantigens opens new perspectives for a better understanding of these autoimmune and neurodegenerative processe...|$|R

40|$|Intracutaneous {{administration}} {{of a small}} quantity of soluble antigen into guinea pigs produces a characteristic delayed hypersensitivity, which is ultimately followed {{by the appearance of}} <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and Arthus type hypersensitivity (1, 2). Guinea pigs sensitized intracutaneously with 1 Lf purified diphtheria toxoid in Freund adjuvant (without mycobacteria) developed delayed hypersensitivity detectable from the 4 th to 5 th day after sensitization to the llth or 12 th day; after the 12 th day Arthus reactions could be induced and <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> detected (2). This sequence of events suggests that delayed hypersensitivity {{is a step in the}} formation of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> Delayed hypersensitivity following {{administration of}} this purified soluble antigen is characteristic in that <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> cannot be detected (< 0. 0024 #g. antibody nitrogen) and hypersensitivity can be transferred to normal guinea pigs with leucocytes from sensitized donors.

40|$|Six {{different}} proteins varying {{widely in}} molecular weight, ribonuclease, lysostaphin, ovalbumin, penicillinase, collagenase, and Varidase were tested {{for their ability}} to induce <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> formation in rabbits after repeated topical application of the proteins in a water-soluble gel vehicle. After a 12 -week exposure period, significant hemagglutinin titers were noted in rabbits treated with ovalbumin, lysostaphin, or ribonuclease; markedly elevated, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis-reacting sera were obtained only from collagenase- or lysostaphin-treated animals. Precipitin antibodies as evidenced by gel diffusion were also found in sera from collagenas- and lysostaphin-treated animals. Topical application of penicillinase was only marginally effective and Varidase was totally ineffective in elicting a positive <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> response.

40|$|The {{concurrent}} {{administration of}} compound E at a daily dosage of 2 mg. per kg. to rabbits receiving daily intracutaneous injections of crystalline egg albumin markedly inhibited {{the development of}} anaphylactic hypersensitivity of the Arthus type. ACTH, when given at a similar dosage, produced a much less marked effect. Both hormones suppressed <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and as with the Arthus reaction, the suppression produced by compound E was much greater than that obtained with ACTH. When treatment with compound E was started following sensitization, there was a rapid decline in <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and, if the pretreatment serum antibody was low, {{there was also a}} progressive decrease in skin reactivity, becoming negative after 5 days of treatment. When the pretreatment serum antibody concentration was great, so that by the termination of treatment the antibody concentration was still above the level ordinarily sufficient for a maximal skin response, the Arthus reaction was unaffected by treatment. These considerations as well as the failure of compound E to inhibit the systemic passive Arthus reaction suggest that the inhibitory effect of compound E and ACTH on the development of experimental hypersensitivity results from the hormonal reduction of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> Treatment with compound E had no effect on the rate of disappearance of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> in the passively immunized rabbit. This finding suggests that ACTH and compound E reduce <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> by inhibiting antibody formation rather than by promoting antibody destruction. The question is raised as to whether the marked lymphoid atrophy produced by these hormones {{may be related to the}} interference with antibody production...|$|E

40|$|Injection of rabbits with arsanil-sulfanil-thyroglobulin without {{adjuvant}} {{resulted in}} the production of hemagglutinating and precipitating antibody to native thyroglobulin and thyroiditis. Following a latent period of 1 month, these same rabbits responded to an injection of native thyroglobulin with an increase in both <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> to native thyroglobulin and severity and frequency of thyroid lesions. Some rabbits initially immunized with arsanil-sulfanil-thyroglobulin also responded to a second and third monthly injection of native thyroglobulin, but the response to the third injection was usually not as good as the response to the first injection. A few of the rabbits showed a transient production of 19 S antibody after the injection of native thyroglobulin was initiated.

40|$|Periodic {{injections}} of aqueous preparations of thyroglobulin coupled to the diazonium derivatives of arsanilic and sulphanilic acids (arsanil–sulphanil thyroglobulin) resulted in perpetuation {{of both the}} synthesis of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> to native thyroglobulin and thyroiditis. Two months after the last injection, the rabbits made a strong immune response to a subsequent injection of native thyroglobulin.

The level of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and the incidence and severity of lesions were considerably greater in rabbits receiving periodic injections over a 6 -month period of time than in rabbits given a series of injections during a period of 1 month. The relation of these findings to the progressive nature of some autoimmune diseases is discussed. Complex-induced renal injury, secondary to the immune response to arsanil–sulphanil thyroglobulin, was observed in the rabbits given the periodic injections over a 6 -month period of time.

40|$|Conjugates of {{horseradish}} peroxidase with myelin basic protein (BP) of guinea pig or Lewis rat {{were used to}} identify antibody-containing cells in draining lymph nodes during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Peroxidase activity was revealed for light and electron microscopic preparations with the diaminobenzidine reaction of Graham and Karnovsky. Basic proteins (BP) were also iodinated with 125 I for determination of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> against BP by radio-immunoassay of 125 I BP using coprecipitation with antirat IgG or with antirat serum proteins. Encephalitogenicity was lost after conjugation of guinea pig BP or Lewis rat BP with peroxidase, whereas iodination {{did not affect the}} encephalitogenicity of guinea pig or Lewis rat BPs. EAE was induced in Lewis rats with guinea pig or Lewis rat spinal cord BPs in complete Freund's adjuvant. Draining lymph nodes were studied by light and electron microscopy {{during the course of the}} immune reaction, and cells with specific antibody against BP were identified with the use of BP-{{horseradish peroxidase}} conjugates. Lymph node sections from animals immunized with high antigen doses (500 μg) showed numerous plasma cells with intracellular antibody against BP in medullary cords 10 days after immunization and 4 days prior to histologic appearance of EAE. Numbers of positive cells correlated with levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> against BP. Immunization with a low antigen dose (5 μg) resulted in EAE, few or no antibody-containing cells, and significantly lower levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> Brown Norwegian rats, a strain resistant to EAE, immunized with 500 μg of BP had positive cells in draining lymph nodes and high levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> against BP in the absence of histologic evidence of EAE. Lewis rats injected with Lewis rat small BP failed to develop EAE. Nevertheless, these animals showed levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and antibody-containing cells similar to those of animals which developed EAE after injection of the mixture of Lewis rat large and small BP. It is concluded that although the BP-peroxidase labeling method reveals cells with specific anti-BP antibody, these cells are probably unrelated to EAE. The lack of correlation between EAE induced by low antigen doses and levels of circulating anti-BP antibody (determined with the use of highly encephalitogenic 125 I-BP) suggests that effector cells can be stimulated at low antigen doses, but higher antigen doses are required to induce the production of levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> detectable by the method of immune coprecipitation...|$|E
