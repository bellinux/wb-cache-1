5000|$|<b>Cilnidipine</b> (INN) is a {{calcium channel}} blocker. It is the novel calcium {{antagonist}} accompanied with L-type and N-type calcium channel blocking functions. It was jointly developed by Fuji Viscera Pharmaceutical Company and Ajinomoto, and was approved {{to enter the}} market and {{be used as an}} anti-hypertensive in 1995. Unlike other calcium antagonists, <b>Cilnidipine</b> can act on the N-type calcium channel in addition to acting on the L-type calcium channel. <b>Cilnidipine</b> is approved for use in Japan, China, India, Korea, and some European countries to treat hypertension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cilnidipine</b> {{decreases}} {{blood pressure}} and, therefore, {{is used to}} treat hypertension and its comorbidities. Due to its blocking action at the N-type and L type calcium channel, <b>cilnidipine</b> dilates both arterioles and venules, reducing the pressure in the capillary bed. <b>Cilnidipine</b> is vasoselective and has a weak direct dromotropic effect, a strong vasodepressor effect, and an arrhythmia-inhibiting effect. The side effects could be severe diziness, fast heartbeat, swelling of face, lips, tongue, eyelids, hands and feet. Other side effects to name would be stomach pain, diarrhea and hypotension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cilnidipine</b> has {{enhanced}} lipophilicity, {{leading to}} prolonged anti-hypertensive effects, correlated with occupancy of the binding site. In a 24-hour clinical assessment, once-daily administration of <b>cilnidipine</b> reduced blood pressure. The inhibitory {{effect on the}} N-type Ca2+ channel may bestow an additional clinical advantage {{for the treatment of}} hypertension, such as suppression of reflex tachycardia.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{therapeutics}} used clinically {{which can}} effect {{the activity of}} P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, <b>cilnidipine,</b> nicardipine, and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another calcium antagonist {{which is used to}} treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the [...] "cacna1a" [...] gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cilnidipine,</b> a dual L-/N-type {{calcium channel}} blocker, dilates both efferent and afferent arterioles and is renoprotective. Our multi-center, open-labeled, and {{randomized}} trial compared the antiproteinuric effect of <b>cilnidipine</b> {{with that of}} amlodipine in hypertensive patients with kidney disease. A group of 339 patients, already receiving renin–angiotensin system inhibitor treatment, {{were randomly assigned to}} <b>cilnidipine</b> or amlodipine.

After 1 -year of treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in both groups which did not differ between them. The urinary protein to creatinine ratio significantly decreased in the <b>cilnidipine</b> compared to the amlodipine group. <b>Cilnidipine</b> exerted a greater antiproteinuric effect than amlodipine even in the subgroup whose blood pressure fell below the target level.

40|$|<b>Cilnidipine</b> is a dual blocker of L-type {{voltage-gated}} Ca 2 + {{channels in}} vascular smooth muscle and N-type Ca 2 + channels in sympathetic nerve terminals that supply blood vessels. However, the clinical benefits of <b>cilnidipine</b> and underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. This {{study was designed}} to compare the time course of relaxant responses to <b>cilnidipine</b> and nifedipine, and to examine the role of endothelial NO and [Ca 2 +]i in the vasorelaxation. Porcine left circumflex coronary arteries were isolated and isometric tension was measured with Grass force transducers. Endothelial [Ca 2 +]i in intact arteries was determined by a calcium fluorescence imaging technique. The free radical scavenging capacity was also assayed. <b>Cilnidipine</b> and nifedipine induced concentration-dependent relaxations in high KCl-precontracted artery rings, while the former-induced relaxation was slower as compared to the latter. Treatment with L-NAME or ODQ reduced relaxations to <b>cilnidipine</b> or nifedipine to the same extent as in rings without endothelium. Indomethacin or ω-conotoxin had no effects. L-Arginine antagonized the effect of L-NAME on cilnidipine-induced relaxations. <b>Cilnidipine</b> did not affect sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation in rings with and without endothelium. <b>Cilnidipine</b> and nifedipine caused extracellular Ca 2 +-dependent increases in endothelial [Ca 2 +]i in intact arteries and cilnidipine's action had a slower onset, similar to that of cilnidipine-induced relaxation. Neither <b>cilnidipine</b> nor nifedipine exhibited a free radical scavenging property. The present results demonstrate that <b>cilnidipine</b> can produce endothelium-dependent relaxation in porcine coronary arteries in vitro in addition to blocking Ca 2 + channels. Like short-acting nifedipine, cilnidipine-dependent relaxation, albeit to a slower onset, is partly mediated by endothelial NO but not by prostacyclin. The increased release or bioavailability of NO may causally result from elevated endothelial [Ca 2 +]i in arteries. The Ca 2 + channel-independent effect suggests the usefulness of <b>cilnidipine</b> in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with diminished NO release, such as atherosclerosis...|$|E

Because hypertension {{is the main}} risk factor for cerebral infarction and most patients with hyper- tension take antihypertensive drugs daily, the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of anti-hypertensive drugs need to be investigated. <b>Cilnidipine,</b> a long-acting, new generation 1, 4 - dihydropyridine inhibitor of both L- and N-type calcium channels, was reported to reduce oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated whether <b>cilnidipine</b> has therapeutic effects in an animal model of cerebral infarction.

The L/N-type Calcium (Ca) channel blocker <b>cilnidipine</b> has unique inhibitory action to inhibit sympathetic nerve activity and in a canine model ameliorates QT prolongation. In this study, we investigated whether <b>cilnidipine</b> has inhibitory effects on heart rate, an index of sympathetic nerve activity, and QT prolongation in patients undergoing dialysis. Methods: An L-type Ca channel blocker amlodipine was administered for 4 weeks followed by <b>cilnidipine</b> treatment for 4 weeks. On the last day of each period, heart rate and corrected QT interval were estimated and compared between the two periods. Results: <b>Cilnidipine</b> showed greater suppression of heart rate during dialysis than did amlodipine.

One hundred patients were randomly assigned to either a <b>cilnidipine</b> group or a telmisartan group. The extent of vascular damage was assessed before and after treatment by measuring urinary albumin excretion (UAE), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid arteries in each patient. Both drugs similarly decreased BP without altering plasma markers for oxidative stress or inflammation. Both UAE and PWV were significantly improved in both groups, but IMT was significantly reduced only in the <b>cilnidipine</b> group. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the UAE may have decreased {{as a result of a}} reduction in intraglomerular pressure caused by telmisartan or by efferent arteriolar dilation caused by <b>cilnidipine.</b> In addition, the PWV may have decreased as a result of the improvement in lipid metabolism caused by telmisartan or the reduction in plasma levels of aldosterone caused by <b>cilnidipine.</b> However, the analyses could not identify any definitive causal relationships or suggest the mechanism responsible for the improvement in IMT caused by <b>cilnidipine.</b> Thus, telmisartan and <b>cilnidipine</b> have unique properties for inhibiting vascular complications...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hypertension is a {{widespread}} public health problem and a major risk factor. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker is frequently used {{in the treatment of}} hypertension. Since Amlodipine primarily L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) and thus reduces blood pressure, it stimulates sympathetic nerve activity leading to reflex increase in heart rate. <b>Cilnidipine,</b> a new type of CCB which can inhibit L- type calcium channels but also N-type calcium channels. We compare the clinical effectiveness of Amlodipine and <b>Cilnidipine</b> on blood pressure, heart rate, proteinuria and lipid profile in hypertensive patients. Methods: The study was a prospective, randomized, open label comparison, total ninety five patients were recruited for study in which 45 patients received 5 - 10 mg Amlodipine and other 55 patients of same age groups received 10 - 20 mg <b>Cilnidipine.</b> 15 patients in Amlodipine group and 18 patients in <b>Cilnidipine</b> group were diabetic, whereas 12 and 14 patients were proteinuric in Amlodipine and <b>Cilnidipine</b> group respectively. Results: Both the groups were well matched in term of age, weight, clinical findings and laboratory values. Both the drug significantly reduced both systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DSP).

40|$|ObjectiveCilnidipine is a novel, long-action L/N-type {{dihydropyridine}} {{calcium channel}} blocker that has recently been used for antihypertensive therapy. We investigated the vasorelaxation effect of <b>cilnidipine</b> with regard to its calcium channel blockage and nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent mechanism in human internal thoracic artery. MethodsFresh human internal thoracic arteries taken from discarded tissues of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were studied. Concentration-relaxation curves for <b>cilnidipine</b> in comparison with nifedipine were studied. The expression level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA was assayed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase at Ser 1177 was determined by Western blotting analysis. ResultsCilnidipine and nifedipine caused nearly full relaxation in potassium-precontracted internal thoracic artery. Pretreatment with <b>cilnidipine</b> at the clinical plasma concentration significantly depressed the maximal contraction. Endothelium denudation (47. 7 % ± 7. 0 %, P < . 05) and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (48. 6 % ± 6. 1 %, P < . 05) or guanylate cyclase (41. 6 % ± 3. 8 %, P < . 01) significantly reduced the cilnidipine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (73. 9 % ± 6. 4 %). <b>Cilnidipine</b> increased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA by 42. 4 % (P < . 05) and enhanced phosphorylation level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase at Ser 1177 by 37. 0 % (P < . 05).

HVA IBa was classified into three different current components with subtype selective peptide Ca 2 + channel blockers. No ω-Agatoxin IVA-sensitive (P-type) or ω-conotoxin MVIIC-sensitive (Q-type) current components were observed. Most (> 85 %) IBa was found to consist of ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive N-type components. The application of <b>cilnidipine</b> inhibited HVA IBa in a concentration-dependent manner. The Kd value for <b>cilnidipine</b> was 0. 8 [*]μM. <b>Cilnidipine</b> did not shift the current-voltage (I-V) relationship for HVA IBa, as regards the threshold potential and peak potential where the amplitude reached a maximum.

The principle for dual wavelength method is “the absorbance difference between two points on the overlain spectra is directly proportional to the concentration of the component of interest”. From the UV absorption spectrum of <b>Cilnidipine,</b> three wavelengths were selected, which were 282. 99, 337. 85 and 352. 92 nm. At 352. 92 nm only <b>Cilnidipine</b> has reasonable absorbance, so it was selected for the estimation of it from combination drug product. At these two wavelengths absorbance for <b>Cilnidipine</b> {{was found to be}} same i. e. absorbance difference was zero for any concentration, while for Olmesartan Medoxomil concomitantly increase in absorbance difference with increase in its concentration. So, 282. 99 and 337. 85 nm wavelengths were selected for the estimation of Olmesartan Medoxomil from its combination drug product. The method involved solving of an equation based on measurement of absorbances at two wavelengths 282. 99 and 337. 85 nm. Regression analysi...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLeft {{ventricular}} (LV) diastolic dysfunction {{is related}} to increased cardiac sympathetic activity. We investigated the effect of <b>cilnidipine,</b> an L/N-type calcium channel blocker, on LV diastolic function and cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with hypertensive heart disease (HHD) using radionuclide myocardial imaging. Methods and resultsThirty-two frame electrocardiography (ECG) -gated 99 mTc-sestamibi (MIBI) myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging were performed before and 6 months after drug administration in 32 outpatients with HHD. Sixteen of the patients were treated with <b>cilnidipine</b> and the other 16 were treated with nifedipine retard. The parameters for assessing LV diastolic function evaluated using ECG-gated 99 mTc-MIBI SPECT were peak filling rate (PFR), first-third filling rate (1 / 3 FR), and time to peak filling (TPF). Cardiac sympathetic activity was assessed as early and delayed heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratios and a washout rate (WR), using 123 I-MIBG imaging. The PFR and 1 / 3 FR significantly increased after 6 months of treatment with <b>cilnidipine</b> (p< 0. 05 for both), but did not with nifedipine retard. The H/M ratios significantly increased (p< 0. 05 for both) {{in conjunction with a}} decreased WR (p< 0. 05) in the <b>cilnidipine</b> group. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was seen between the rate of change in PFR and the rate of change in early and delayed H/M ratios in the <b>cilnidipine</b> group (p< 0. 05 for both). The same results were obtained for the relationship between the rate of change in 1 / 3 FR and the rate of change in H/M ratios (p< 0. 05 for both). However, no such relationship was seen in the nifedipine group. ConclusionThese data indicate that <b>cilnidipine</b> seems to suppress cardiac sympathetic overactivity via blockade of N-type calcium channels and improves LV diastolic function in patients with HHD...|$|E
40|$|Background: At the {{intervention}} for cardiovascular disease (CVD), albuminuria {{is a new}} pivotal target. Calcium channel blocker (CCB) {{is one of the}} most expected agents. Currently CCBs have been classified by delivery system, half-life and channel types. We tested anti-albuminuric effect among 4 types of CCBs. Methods: Subjects were 50 hypertensives (SBP/DBP 164. 7 ± 17. 1 / 92. 3 ± 12. 2 mm Hg, s-Cr 0. 81 ± 0. 37 mg/dl, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) 69. 4 (33. 5 - 142. 6) mg/gCr). Four CCBs were administered in a crossover setting: nifedipine CR, a long biological half-life L type by controlled release; <b>cilnidipine,</b> an N/L type; efonidipine, a T/L type; and amlodipine, a long biological half-life L type. Results: Comparable BP reductions were obtained. UAE at endpoints ware as follows (mg/gCr,*P < 0. 01) : nifedipine CR 30. 8 (17. 3 - 81. 1),* <b>cilnidipine</b> 33. 9 (18. 0 - 67. 7),* efonidipine 51. 0 (21. 2 - 129. 8), amlodipine 40. 6 (18. 7 - 94. 7). By all agents, significant augmentations were observed in PRA, angiotensin I and angiotensin II (AngII). AngII at <b>cilnidipine</b> was significantly lower than that at amlodipine. PAC at <b>cilnidipine</b> and efonidipine was significantly lower than that at amlodipine. Nifedipine CR significantly reduced ANP concentration. Conclusions: It is revealed that only nifedipine CR and <b>cilnidipine</b> could reduce albuminuria statistically. Thus, it is suggested that the 2 CCBs might be favorable for organ protection in hypertensives. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Sympathetic {{neurotransmission}} in tissues with intact {{sympathetic nerve}} arborization is extensively dependent on calcium influx via N-type calcium-channels. It was {{the objective of}} the present study to assess and compare the claimed sympatholytic effect of the 1. 4 -dihydropyridine compound <b>cilnidipine</b> with other voltage-dependent calcium-channel (VDCC) antagonists. We studied these compounds by means of three different models. In the rabbit isolated thoracic aorta, the alleged sympatholytic properties displayed by these compounds were evaluated in the noradrenaline spillover model. Additionally, the influence of <b>cilnidipine</b> on stimulation-induced constrictor responses was studied in the rat isolated tail artery (male Wistar rats, 250 - 300 g) in addition to its effect on noradrenaline-induced contractions. Finally, we studied the influence of <b>cilnidipine</b> and other calcium-channel blockers on stimulation-induced chronotropic responses, in order to address N- or L-type selectivity, in the pithed rat model (male Wistar rats. 260 - 320 g). Furthermore, we evaluated their effect on noradrenaline-induced tachycardia. In the isolated rabbit thoracic aorta preparation omega-conotoxin GVIA (0. 1 muM) nearly abolished the sympathetic outflow caused by stimulation, whereas nifedipine (0. 1 muM) and amlodipine (1 muM) did not influence the evoked noradrenaline release. <b>Cilnidipine</b> (1 muM) significantly attenuated the response by nearly 18 % and mibefradil (1 muM) by c. 42 %, The stimulation-induced constrictor response (prejunctional effect) in the rat isolated tail artery could be blocked by omega-conotoxin GVIA (0. 5 and 1 muM). <b>Cilnidipine</b> (10 nM and 0. 1 muM) significantly attenuated responses to stimulation by maximally 20 %, whereas it did not influence the constrictor response to noradrenaline (postjunctional effect). The mean heart rate in the pithed rat model amounted to 309. 3 +/- 3. 6 beats/min (bpm). Electrical stimulation of the cardio-accelerator nerves (C 7 -Th 1) resulted in an increase by 106. 7 +/- 2. 2 bpm. All antagonists studied, except for nifedipine, attenuated the chronotropic response to stimulation (P < 0. 05). The rank order of sympatholytic efficacy was: omega-conotoxin GVIA (84. 8 %), mibefradil (75. 1 %), <b>cilnidipine</b> (43. 0 %) and amlodipine (34. 8 %). Noradrenaline (10 nmol/kg) increased the heart rate by 117. 8 +/- 2. 7 bpm. This chronotropic response was influenced equally well by the calcium-channels blockers as observed in the stimulation (prejunctional) experiment. In conclusion, the N-type channel blocking properties and thus sympatholytic effect of <b>cilnidipine</b> could be demonstrated in some (vascular) but not all (cardiac) models studied. At the level of the vasculature <b>cilnidipine</b> reduced the neurotransmitter release to electrical stimulation in both the noradrenaline spillover model and in the model of the rat isolated tail artery. respectively. For amlodipine and nifedipine no sympatholytic activity could be demonstrated. In the pithed rat model, we were unable to demonstrate a selective N-type blocking effect for the VDCC-antagonist...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was {{to find out the}} antiproteinuric effect of {{enalapril}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE inhibitor) alone or in combination with <b>cilnidipine</b> in patients with type- 2 diabetes mellitus. The study was conducted on 71 patients with type- 2 diabetes mellitus patients with hypertension and microalbuminuria. They were divided into two groups randomly as follows: Group I (enalaprilalone, n = 36) and Group II (enalapril with <b>cilnidipine,</b> n = 35). In both the groups, baseline 24 h urinary albumin was estimated and was repeated every 3 months upto 1 -year. After 1 -year follow-up, reduction in microalbuminuria was found to be greater in Group II. In Group I microalbuminuria came down by 25. 68 ± 21. 40 while in Group II it reduced by 54. 88 ± 13. 84 (P < 0. 001).

40|$|<b>Cilnidipine,</b> an L-/N-type {{calcium channel}} blocker, dilates the efferent glomerular arterioles in an {{experimental}} model and shows a renoprotective effect, but its clinical benefits and safety {{have not yet}} been assessed in type II diabetics with albuminuria. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of reducing albuminuria in type II diabetic patients with a combination therapy consisting of valsartan plus <b>cilnidipine</b> versus monotherapy with valsartan. An open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted from April 2002 to October 2003 in 87 Japanese patients aged 31 – 90 years with type II diabetes showing albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio: 10 – 300 mg/g). The patients were randomized to receive either valsartan (n= 41) or valsartan plus <b>cilnidipine</b> (n= 46) once daily for 1 year. The primary end point was the percent change in the albumin/creatinine ratio. The secondary end points were the progression/regression of albuminuria, blood pressure (BP), renal function, and safety. After 1 year, the albumin/creatinine ratio was found to have decreased more markedly in the valsartan plus <b>cilnidipine</b> group than in the valsartan group (reduction rate - 44 ± 11 % (s. e.) versus - 9 ± 7 % (s. e.); P= 0. 014 by analysis of covariance). Although a significant reduction was observed in the systolic and diastolic BP of both groups from baseline to 1 year (P< 0. 0001, respectively), {{there was no significant difference}} in the change in the BP between the two groups (systolic BP, P= 0. 066; diastolic BP, P= 0. 391). There were also no significant differences in the side effects between the two groups. <b>Cilnidipine</b> was thus found to show an additive effect with valsartan and thereby caused a reduction in albuminuria in type II diabetics...|$|E
