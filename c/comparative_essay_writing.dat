40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{and compares}} theme positioned poetic devices in effective school essays in English and German. It reveals that themes in English {{as well as}} in German school essays contain poetic devices. Subsequent to an initial discussion on the school essay writer/reader relationship in chapter 1, a theoretical framework has been developed in chapter 2 that draws upon theories and literature from three distinct areas: the history of the school essay, rhetoric and systemic functional theory. The main research question presupposed the idea that effective school essays in English and German have persuasive power, which was confirmed in chapter 4 and defined as new markedness. The research method itself is divided into two parts: whereby the initial method of analysis is based on the Hallidayan concept of Theme identification, the second step identifies poetic devices in the theme position of English and German school essays. A consequent quantitative analysis is used as a <b>comparative</b> tool between <b>essays</b> <b>written</b> in the two languages. The data analysis shows clearly that poetic devices are positioned in Themes in effective school essays in English and German, which can be regarded as conscious or subconscious strategies to persuade examiners of the effectiveness of students' arguments in their essays. Most importantly though, what emerges from the thesis is that student culture and the classroom are tightly interlinked and this observation has to be taken into consideration when designing <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> skills programmes, which focus on new markedness.

50|$|Italian-Canadian {{literature}} {{emerged in}} the 1970s as young Italian immigrants began to complete university degrees across Canada. This creative writing exists in English, French, or Italian. Some writers like Antonio D'Alfonso, Marco Micone, Alexandre Amprimoz and Filippo Salvatore are bilingual and publish in two languages. The older generation of authors like Maria Ardizzi, Romano Perticarini, Giovanni Costa and Tonino Caticchio publish in Italian or in bilingual volumes. In English the most notable names are novelists Frank G. Paci, Nino Ricci, Caterina Edwards, Michael Mirolla and Darlene Madott. Poets who write in English include Mary di Michele, Pier Giorgio DiCicco and Gianna Patriarca. In 1986 these authors established the Association of Italian-Canadian Writers, and by 2001 there were over 100 active writers publishing books of poetry, fiction, drama and anthologies. With the 1985 publication of Contrasts: <b>Comparative</b> <b>Essays</b> on Italian-Canadian <b>Writing</b> by Joseph Pivato, the academic study of this literature started, leading to the exploration of other ethnic minority writing in Canada and inspiring other scholars such as Licia Canton, Pasquale Verdicchio and George Elliott Clarke. The important collections of literary works are: The Anthology of Italian-Canadian Writing (1998) edited by Joseph Pivato and Pillars of Lace: The Anthology of Italian-Canadian Women Writers (1998) edited by Marisa De Franceschi.

40|$|The {{current study}} is {{conducted}} {{with the aim of}} investigating the <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties of Egyptian student teachers of English. More specifically, it attempts to fulfil the following three aims: explore the focuses of teaching <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> at one of the pioneering faculties of education in Egypt; investigate the different <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> practices used by Egyptian <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> teachers from teachers as well as their students’ perspectives; and identify the <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties encountered by Egyptian student teachers of English at the concerned faculty of education from both students and their teachers’ perspectives. The current study adopts an interpretive methodology that uses a sequential mixed methods approach to data collection and analysis. Therefore, I administered a questionnaire to 165 student teachers of English and 7 <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> teachers, conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 14 student teachers of English and 7 <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> teachers, and observed nine <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> sessions of different teachers. Data is analysed quantitatively using SPSS descriptive statistics and qualitatively using exploratory content analysis. Findings of the current study reveal that there are eleven focuses of teaching <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> at the concerned faculty of education. These focuses have been classified into four main categories: Mechanics/Language, Content, Structure/Layout and Practising Writing. Findings also shed light on the <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> teachers’ practices in relation to planning, teaching, feedback and assessment. Finally, findings show that student teachers of English encounter the following difficulties in their essay writing: planning difficulties, organisational difficulties including coherence, cohesion, and stylistic difficulties, lexical problems, and technical difficulties including grammar, punctuation, spelling and revision and editing. According to the above mentioned findings, a theoretical writing model has been devised and a pedagogical process genre approach to teaching EFL <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> in Egypt has been proposed. Implications for <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> curriculum planning and instruction are also included. Finally, suggestions for further research are provided.

40|$|Practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> {{is one of}} the {{compulsory}} learning {{elements that}} a secondary school student needs to learn and is also commonly used in daily life. In order to manipulate the practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> skills, students could not only focus on memorizing the format and neglect the importance of the content. The neglect of this practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> skills results in many students getting fair marks in practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> paper, and especially they perform poorly in public examinations. Hence, having an effective way of teaching to improve students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability and to enhance their way of thinking is important. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effectiveness of the use of group discussion in lessons on improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability. A sampled class with 32 S. 2 students from a band two local school was invited to participate in this study. The effectiveness of group discussion on improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability would be assessed by the comparison of the pre-test and post-test results, as well as the analysis of the content in pre-test and post-test. Besides, questionnaires were distributed and individual interviews were carried out in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the study. Analysis shows that group discussion is effective in improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability and in enhancing students’ content consciousness. As reflected from students’ improved marks in the post-test compared with the pre-test, group discussion teaching methodology is effective in improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability. The improved content in the post-test also shows that it has aroused students’ content consciousness. Besides, the data collected from the questionnaires and the individual interviews reflect that students enjoy learning how to <b>write</b> a practical <b>essay</b> through group discussion, and they do acquire the skills of writing a good practical essay through this means. Therefore, the use of group discussion in lessons does not only improve students’ ability to <b>write</b> practical <b>essay,</b> but also arouses their interest. Thus, it is effective and practical to use group discussion to improve students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability in mainstream schools. 實用文寫作是中學生必須學習的元素，亦是生活上常見的文體，學生要掌握實用文寫作的方法，並不可只是注重格式，而不注重內容。很多學生的實用文寫作表現一般，尤其在公開考試中成績表現遜色，這都是因為他們對實用文寫作的忽視。 因此，運用有效的實用文教學法以提升學生的寫作能力及思維模式是不可缺乏的。 本研究旨在探討小組討論於課堂上的使用對提升學生實用文寫作的成效。是次研究有 32 名就讀第二組別學校的中二級學生參與。研究通過比較學生前測及後測成績變化、檢視前測及後測文句上的改變，以及透過問卷及個人訪談等方式以試驗研究成效。 研究結果顯示，小組討論教學法對提升學生實用文寫作能力及語境意識皆有明顯的成效，為實用文教學提供一個有效的教學法。學生的後測成績有明顯的進步，證明學生在小組討論教學法後實用文寫作能力有所提升。從前、後測的文句分析亦可見學生的語境意識有所提高。另外，問卷調查及個人訪談中反映學生喜歡以小組討論的形式進行實用文教學，小組討論教學法能令學生掌握實用文寫作的方法及享受課節。 由此可見，在課堂上使用小組討論教學法能提升學生的實用文寫作能力及興趣，是有效的教學法，在主流學校的中國語文課節上使用是可行的。published_or_final_versionEducationBachelorBachelor of Education in Language Educatio...|$|R
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record: 10026. 1 / 566 on 01. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) Higher {{education has}} undergone a massive expansion particularly over the last twenty years. However,the value of this expansion is difficult to as certain. Despite a growing field of research in to adult learning in higher education {{little is known about}} the type of learning developed in this system. Biggs (1996) expressed concern that university learning is represented by increased knowledge and assessment requiring students to reproduce content, not demonstrate critical thinking. He claimed that this type of learning exists even in course-work <b>essay</b> <b>writing.</b> These concerns formed the theoretical framework for the current research, which explored the development of approaches to studying (using the ASI) and course-work <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> in highere ducation. Students were not examined as homogeneous but as traditional and non-traditional entrants with different experiences of learning. Students' approaches to <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> were measured using the <b>Essay</b> <b>Writing</b> Process Questionnaire (EWPQ) and the <b>Essay</b> <b>Writing</b> Orientation Questionnaire (EWOQ). The development of these tools was informed by a Grounded Theory of course-work <b>essay</b> <b>writing,</b> developed in the current research using focus group data. Results revealed that the meaning orientation of the ASI and understanding orientation of the EWOQ increased systematically across all age groups. Deadline motivationin <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> and a generic reproducing orientation decreased across a ll age groups. This indicates that traditional aged students' previous experience of learning may have predisposed them to less sophisticated le rning styles. Few changes were observed in students' writing processes across the year sof a degree. Approaches to studying and <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> orientations did not become less sophisticated with exposure to higher education but neither did sophistication increase. Fligher education did not compensate for traditional students' previous experience. Their learning styles remain the same across the three years of a degree. These findings fail to support Biggs' concerns that surface type approaches increase with exposure to university. However, neither do they indicate that higher education, specifically <b>essay</b> <b>writing,</b> encourage critical thinking and understanding. Rather university maintains the level of deep and surface approaches to studying and <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> with which students enter university.

In Toronto he edited his first book, Contrasts: <b>Comparative</b> <b>Essays</b> on Italian-Canadian <b>Writing</b> (1985) which became a seminal volume for the promotion of ethnic minority literature in Canada. He conceived and co-edited the “Italian-Canadian Connections” issue of Canadian Literature 106 (1985). Pivato spent the year 1987-88 at York University in the Mariano Elia Chair in Italian-Canadian Studies where he developed and taught the first course on Italian-Canadian writers. The Research Institute for Comparative Literature in Edmonton invited him to edit Literatures of Lesser Diffusion (1990), the first collection of studies of writing by 20 different ethnic groups in Canada. In 1991 he was Canadian Visiting Fellow at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. This sojourn resulted in the publication of Echo: Essays on Other Literatures (1994), a collection of original critical studies on Comparative Literature and minority writing, translation, oral influences on writing, ethnic women writers, and other topics. The critical foreword is by feminist scholar, Sneja Gunew (Deakin & U.B.C.). He returned to Canadian Ethnic Studies in 1996 by editing a special issue on “Literary Theory and Ethnic Minority Writing.” The major volume Pivato edited was The Anthology of Italian-Canadian Writing (1998) which included 53 authors working in English, French or Italian and which {{has been used as a}} text in many college and university courses. Among the authors included are F.G. Paci, Linda Hutcheon, Nino Ricci, Pasquale Verdicchio, Mary di Michele, Fulvio Caccia and Marco Micone.
