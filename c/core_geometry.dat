50|$|The {{shape of}} the fissile gas core can be either cylindrical, toroidal, or counter flow toroidal. Since there are issues {{regarding}} the loss of fissile fuel with the cylindrical and toroidal designs, the counter-flow toroidal gas <b>core</b> <b>geometry</b> is {{the primary source of}} research. The counter flow toroid is the most promising because it has the best stability and theoretically prevents mixing of the fissile fuel and propellant more effectively than the aforementioned concepts. In this design, the fissile fuel is kept mostly in a base injection stabilized recirculation bubble by hydrodynamic confinement. Most designs utilize a cylindrical gas core wall for ease of modeling. However, previous cold flow tests have shown that hydrodynamic containment is more easily achieved with a spherical internal wall geometry design.|$|E

The present work is carried out in the framework of the European FP- 7 project EVOL (Evaluation and Viability Of Liquid fuel fast reactor system). One of the project tasks is to report on safety analyses: calculations of reactor transients using various numerical codes for the molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) under different boundary conditions, assumptions, and for different selected scenarios. Based on the original reference <b>core</b> <b>geometry,</b> an optimized geometry was proposed by Rouch et al. (2014. Ann. Nucl.

40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} such as wind, solar, {{geothermal}} and tides have increasingly been used to generate electricity. Among these energy sources wind power has gained enormous attention {{in many parts of}} the world where no fossil fuels exist and energy requirements are highly demanded. The efficiency of wind power mainly depends on wind produced and a generator converting wind power to electricity. The efficiency of a typical wind power generator are usually related with its magnetic performance based on magnetic <b>core</b> <b>geometry.</b> Furthermore, this geometry usually has an effect on flux density distribution hence in some cases the flux overlaps in regions near the corners of the stator and the rotor cores; thereby leading to an increase of magnetic losses and decrease of magnetic performance.

While the literature on the subject is voluminous, the complexity of the problem justifies continued research. This thesis in particular represents a continuation of previous experimental, analytical, and finite element modeling at the University of Delaware. With a panel typology utilizing horizontal facesheets separated by a core comprised of rows of stiffeners perpendicular to the facesheets established as optimal in previous papers, this research seeks to both perfect the previous finite element model and use it to glean some optimized geometric parameters.

40|$|Honeycomb {{sandwich}} core is typically modeled as an equivalent continuum for both static and dynamic analysis. The orthotropic material properties {{for such a}} continuum representation are difficult to predict. The objective of this work is to examine material and geometric parameters that affect the elastic and harmonic responses of honeycomb cores. A 3 D shell FEA approach is adopted to model the <b>core</b> <b>geometry.</b> The model is compared to a typical homogeneous core finite-element representation in vibratory response. It is found that adhesive filleting can {{play a significant role}} in the response of honeycomb sandwich structure. Additionally, finite-element models using homogenized core approximations are shown to yield erroneous predictions for higher modes of vibration. Only through the modeling of actual honeycomb <b>core</b> <b>geometry</b> through finiteelement methods is it possible to predict higher modes. Vibration occurring strictly in the honeycomb cells can be observed by a tight band of resonances. This band occurs at different frequency ranges depending on the modeling technique. Achieving accurate homogeneous core model dynamic response for higher modes is restricted by computational inefficiency. Steady state harmonic analysis was only possible using the 3 D shell core representation. The homogeneous core models were accurate in static shear and early modal response only. When it becomes necessary to predict shorter wavelengths of vibration, the homogeneous core models are either too computationally expensive or produce incorrect responses specifically with regard to modes isolated in the core. ...|$|E
