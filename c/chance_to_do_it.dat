It holds that all who have a [...] "genuine opportunity to become qualified" [...] be given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

A major {{proposal}} {{for the future of}} MARS, new uses of technology to connect members in Boston with those at home, lively discussions, and good fellowship – MARS at MidWinter 2010 in Boston featured them all! If you love being a ―Martian, ‖ but cringe when trying to explain to colleagues the meaning of the increasingly outdated acronym for MARS (Machine Assisted Reference Section), now is your <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about <b>it.</b> The spring ballot will give MARS members the opportunity to vote on amendments to the MARS Bylaws, which, if approved, would make MARS a branding name, rather than an acronym. Under this proposal, the new name of the Section would be MARS: Emerging Technologies in Reference Section, and the letters of MARS would no longer represent specific words; rather, the words following MARS would convey the essence of the Section's focus. Also, on the ballot is a proposal to sharpen the Section‘s focus on emerging technologies for reference and align it with the proposed revision of the Section name. For more information on these proposed changes, please see the report from the Planning Committee in this issue of Messages. The full text of the proposed changes and the rationale for them are also available in Connect and from the MARS web site. In the spring election, MARS members will also have the difficult task of choosing among an excellent slate of candidates for MARS offices. Running for the three year Memberat-Large position are Stephanie Graves and Sam Stormont; for the two year Secretary position, Jim Langan and Erin Rushton; and for Vice Chair/Chair Elect, Ann Houston and Dianna McKellar.

He would have {{forgotten}} himself, sure, and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree, and so I always got him well out of the road in time. Then he would stand and look with all his eyes; and a proud light would flash from them, and his nostrils would inflate like a war-horse's, and I knew he was longing for a brush with them. But about noon of the third day I had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the whip-stroke that had fallen to my share two days before; a precaution which I had afterward decided to leave untaken, I was so loath to institute it; but now I had just had a fresh reminder: while striding heedlessly along, with jaw spread and intellect at rest, for I was prophesying, I stubbed my toe and fell sprawling. I was so pale I couldn't think for a moment; then I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack. I had that dynamite bomb in it, done up in wool in a box. It was a good thing to have along; the time would come when I could do a valuable miracle with it, maybe, but it was a nervous thing to have about me, and I didn't like to ask the king to carry it. Yet I must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society. I got it out and slipped it into my scrip, and just then here came a couple of knights. The king stood, stately as a statue, gazing toward them--had forgotten himself again, of course--and before I could get a word of warning out, it was time for him to skip, and well that he did it, too. He supposed they would turn aside. Turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot? When had he ever turned aside himself--or ever had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble?
