It is mainly used in mining, chemical industry, road and bridge construction, building, etc. As for VSC series cone crusher, {{there are four}} crushing cavities (coarse, medium, fine and superfine) to choose. Compared with the same type, VSC series cone crusher, whose combination of crushing frequency and eccentricity is the best, can make materials have higher <b>comminution</b> degree and higher yield. In addition, VSC series cone crusher’s enhanced laminating crushing effect on material particles makes the cubic shape of crushed materials better, which increases the selling point.|$|E

2500|$|Near London in 1853, Captain Shrapnel {{demonstrated}} {{a method for}} crushing gold-bearing ores by firing them from a cannon into an iron chamber, and [...] "much satisfaction was expressed by all present".

2500|$|The {{water was}} {{stored in the}} tanks and then {{released}} suddenly, the wave of water sweeping away the soil to reveal the bedrock and any gold-bearing veins beneath. Pliny the Elder gives a dramatic account in his Naturalis Historia of the method, possibly derived from his experiences in Spain. The method is known as hushing and survived in use until the 19th century in Britain, and into the 20th century in the goldfields of Africa. A not dissimilar method is used today in exploiting alluvial tin deposits, and is known as hydraulic mining. A smaller scale {{version of the same}} method is placer mining, and both may have been used to work alluvial placer deposits next to the river Cothi itself, judging by a large aqueduct which tapped the river a mile or so upstream, and enters the site at a low level compared with the other known aqueducts on the site. The water supply of the aqueducts was also used for washing crushed gold ore, and also possibly driving stamping mills for <b>comminution</b> of the ore (Lewis and Jones, 1969). One of the first aqueducts was built at a high level on the east slope of Allt Cwmhenog and tapped a small stream about [...] away. There is a large tank at its end, where it sweeps around the brow of the hill onto {{the west side of the}} ridge. A gold vein must have been discovered here, because there is a large opencast below the tank. Yet the larger and longer aqueduct (with a gradient of 1 in 800) taps the river Cothi about [...] to the north-east and traverses the same opencast, so must be later in date.|$|E

6000|$|He {{pointed a}} finger at me. He had struck {{to the heart of}} my shame. I made the only {{possible}} reply by a rush at him. [...] "Hello!" [...] he cried, at my blackavised attack. He dropped back into an attitude that had some style in it, parried my blow, got back at my cheek, and laughed with surprise and relief at his own success. Whereupon I became a thing of murderous rage. He could box as well or better than I--he had yet to realise I knew anything of that at all--but I had fought once or twice to a finish with bare fists. I was used to inflicting and enduring savage hurting, and I doubt if he had ever fought. I hadn't fought ten seconds before I felt this softness in him, realised all that quality of modern upper-class England that never goes to the quick, that hedges about rules and those petty points of honour that are the ultimate <b>comminution</b> of honour, that claims credit for things demonstrably half done. He seemed to think that first hit of his and one or two others were going to matter, that I ought to give in when presently my lip bled and dripped blood upon my clothes. So before we had been at it a minute he had ceased to be aggressive except in momentary spurts, and I was knocking him about almost as I wanted to do; and demanding breathlessly and fiercely, after our school manner, whether he had had enough, not knowing that by his high code and his soft training it was equally impossible for him to either buck-up and beat me, or give in.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Comminution</b> is {{particle}} size reduction of materials. <b>Comminution</b> may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. Crushing and grinding are the two primary <b>comminution</b> processes. Crushing is normally carried out on [...] "run-of-mine" [...] ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In <b>comminution,</b> the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition. Compression and impact forces are extensively used in crushing operations while attrition is the dominant force in grinding. The primarily used equipment in crushing are-jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills, closed circuited with a classifier unit, are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant. Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy intensive.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of <b>comminution.</b> <b>Comminution</b> of solid {{materials}} requires {{different types of}} crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the <b>comminution</b> of coarse feed material are the jaw crusher (1m > P80 > 100 mm), cone crusher (P80 > 20 mm) and hammer crusher. Primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For <b>comminution</b> of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as [...] "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the IsaMillTM are used.|$|E

50|$|The {{extraction}} of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining, which uses water and gravity to concentrate the valuable minerals, or hard rock mining, which pulverizes the rock containing the ore and then relies on chemical reactions to concentrate the sought-after material. In the latter, the {{extraction of}} minerals from ore requires <b>comminution,</b> i.e., grinding the ore into fine particles to facilitate extraction of the target element(s). Because of this <b>comminution,</b> tailings consist of a slurry of fine particles, ranging from {{the size of a}} grain of sand to a few micrometres. Mine tailings are usually produced from the mill in slurry form, which is a mixture of fine mineral particles and water.|$|E
