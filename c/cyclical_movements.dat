50|$|Observe the {{difference}} between this growth component and the jerkier data. Economists refer to these <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> about the trend as business cycles. Figure 3 explicitly captures such deviations. Note the horizontal axis at 0. A point on this line indicates at that year, there is no deviation from the trend. All other points {{above and below the}} line imply deviations. By using log real GNP the distance between any point and the 0 line roughly equals the percentage deviation from the long run growth trend. Also note that the Y-axis uses very small values. This indicates that the deviations in real GNP are very small comparatively, and might be attributable to measurement errors rather than real deviations.|$|E

50|$|Asymmetric {{vision of}} Russia is nothing new. In fact, the Western meta-narrative of {{relations}} with Russia is a 'super-story' of engagement driven by the ideological notions of liberty, freedom and, recently, democratisation. It emerged in the early 19th century and, since, has alternated between an Orientalist search for a Russian civilisational 'black box', and missionary visions oscillating between two poles: a determination to recreate Russia in the Western image; or the 'abandonment' of Russia, {{on the basis of}} 'essentialist incompatibility'. This means that the meta-narrative does not move in a straight functional line, but unfolds in <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> that vary between indifference, engagement and disengagement. During the Cold War era this discourse was enriched by the new scientific narratives of 'path dependency' and 'patrimonialism', of which Richard Pipes is the most significant proponent. The recent 'New Cold War' strain belongs into this tradition.|$|E
5000|$|Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association defined {{this class}} in January 2005 as, [...] "Athetoid or Ataxic - Moderate {{involvement}} The athlete ambulates without assistive devices. Athetosis {{is the most}} prevalent factor, although some ambulant spastic quadriplegics (i.e. more arm involvement than in ambulant diplegics), may fit this Class. Athetosis means unsteady (writhing), not having the capability to remain still. All four limbs will usually show functional involvement in sports movements. Class 6 athletes have more control problems in upper limbs than Class 5 athletes, although the former usually have better function in lower limbs particularly when running. Lower Extremities-Function can vary considerably depending on the sports skill involved, from poor, laboured, slow walking to a running gait, which often shows better mechanics. There can be a marked contrast between the walking athetoid with inco-ordinated gait and the smooth even paced co-ordinated running/cycling action. <b>Cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> however are much better performed like cycling, running and free-style swimming Balance-May have good dynamic balance compared with static balance.

5000|$|These curves {{showed the}} {{variations}} in insolation which correlated with the series of ice ages. Köppen felt that Milanković’s theoretical approach to solar energy was a logical approach to the problem. His solar curve was introduced in a work entitled [...] "Climates of the geological past", published by Wladimir Köppen and his son-in-law Alfred Wegener in 1924.Milanković put the sun {{at the center of}} his theory, as the only source of heat and light in the solar system. He considered three <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> of the Earth: eccentricity (100,000-year cycle - Johannes Kepler, 1609), axial tilt (41,000-year cycle - from 22,1° to 24,5°; Presently, the Earth's tilt is 23.5° - Ludwig Pilgrim, 1904), and precession (23,000-year cycle - Hipparchus, 130 BC). Each cycle works on a different time-scale and each affects the amount of solar energy received by the planets. Such changes in the geometry of an orbit lead to the changes in the insolation - the quantity of heat received by any spot at the surface of a planet. These orbital variations, which are influenced by gravity of the Moon, Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn, form the basis of the Milankovitch cycle. His original contribution to celestial mechanics is called Milanković's system of vector elements of planetary orbits. He reduced six Lagrangean-Laplacian elliptical elements to two vectors determining the mechanics of planetary movements. The first specifies the planet’s orbital plane, the sense of revolution of the planet, and the orbital ellipse parameter; the second specifies the axis of the orbit in its plane and the orbital eccentricity. By applying those vectors he significantly simplified the calculation and directly obtained all the formulas of the classical theory of secular perturbations. Milanković, in a simple but original manner, first deduced Newton’s law of gravitation from Kepler’s laws. Then Milankovich treated the two-body and the many-body problems of celestial mechanics. He accepted but corrected the Leverrier and Stockwell computation by using newer and more accurate values for the masses of the planets in the solar system.|$|E

40|$|The American economy {{underwent}} a dramatic boom-bust cycle {{during the years}} 1995 – 2002. The height of the boom was characterized by enormous increases in stock prices, and especially the prices of Internet-related assets (with the necessary degree of “relatedness ” declining as the boom progressed).

40|$|In the {{literature}} on motor control, three theoretical perspectives on the relation between discrete and <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> may be discerned: (a) <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> are concatenated discrete movements; (b) discrete movements are a limiting case of <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements,</b> and (c) discrete and <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> are motor primitives that may be combined but are irreducible to each other. To examine the tenability of these perspectives, 16 participants performed cyclical and discrete (flexion and extension) reaching movements of various amplitudes to differently sized targets. The kinematic properties of the recorded movements were analyzed and compared in detail. The cyclical, ongoing movements differed markedly from the discrete movements {{as well as from}} the first and last half-cycles of a bout of <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements,</b> especially in terms of their symmetry ratio. These effects were largely independent of amplitude, target size and movement direction (flexion-extension). The results obtained ruled out perspective (a) and, in principle, left open perspectives (b) and (c). However, the observed kinematic features were not readily accounted for by the specific dynamical models that have been proposed under perspectives (b) and (c).

I show that reasonable volatility in the driving force and a reasonable elasticity of labor supply provide a believable account of the observed <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements</b> in hours per worker. I define and estimate an employment-rate function, analogous to the supply function for hours per worker.

40|$|During {{the second}} quarter of 2001 German overall {{production}} stagnated. Weak global development muddied the economic prospects of firms and prevented them from rising their output and their investment activities. In 2001 gross national product will only increase by 1 %; the number of unemployed will be higher than expected. Nevertheless, we advise against an increase in public expenditure that aims at stimulating the economy. Anyhow, growing public deficits, caused by <b>cyclical</b> <b>movements,</b> should be accepted. In order to increase employment labour market reforms become more urgent. In East Germany, currently even a decline in gross national product cannot be excluded.

In addition, economic stagnation burdens labour markets. Nonetheless trying to stimulate the East German economy by government spending programmes {{does not seem to be}} a viable strategy.
