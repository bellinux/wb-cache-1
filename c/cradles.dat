40|$|The {{positive}} agenda of <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> establishes {{a new paradigm}} for redesigning in the built environment. <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> consists of a philosophy, quantifiable principles, and implementation tools that together comprise an innovation platform for enhancing the quality of materials, energy and biodiversity. This platform generates social, economic and eco-effective benefits, which go beyond the conventional sustainability approach of using eco-efficiency to minimize environmental impacts. <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> is well known through earlier published works but most practitioners in the built environment are still unfamiliar with how to apply its principles. The framework here provides {{an introduction to the}} philosophy then translates the three basic <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> principles into criteria that can be quantifiably applied and evaluated. It further describes implementation criteria, which allow the innovative integration of defined financial, contract, and design application tools.

5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in <b>cradles</b> from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E

The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human sacrifice, and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, births typically {{take place}} in May or June in the northern hemisphere while births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species give birth {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. In most bat species, female carry and give birth to one pup per litter. For bat embryos, apoptosis only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits which form into the wing membranes. At birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and hence the pelvic girdle of the female expands during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically give birth in a heads-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make birthing easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the females <b>cradles</b> it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females give birth and raise their young in maternity colonies and individuals may assist others in their birthing process.|$|E

Angrily, the father reveals the sordid past of his family: Laura and her father {{are part of a}} bloodline of cannibalistic vampires, dating back to the infamous Dracula. Driven by her vampiric urges, Laura had killed and eaten her mother years ago, but it was erased from her memory by her father. As Dr. Harris demands Laura to leave one last time, he begins to transform into a vampire. If the player approaches Dr. Harris at this point, he will consume Laura's flesh and fully transform. However, if the player shoots Dr. Harris with a revolver that can be found earlier in the game, the bullet will kill him and stop his transformation. As Laura tearfully <b>cradles</b> her dying father in her arms, he confesses that he allowed the transformation to occur out of scientific curiosity and thanks her for stopping him. With his death, the realm created by his mind fades and is replaced by the normal surroundings of the hospital.|$|E

In his rescue attempt, Guybrush {{inadvertently}} releases a voodoo pox over Gulf of Melange, which turns LeChuck into a human. While events separate Guybrush and Elaine, she befriends the now seemingly unmalicious LeChuck, and helps him return monkeys used for his voodoo spells to their homes. Elaine also attempts, without success, to arbitrate between merpeople with access to a cure for the pox and infected pirates. When negotiations break down, Elaine participates in a battle around the Jerkbait Islands to drive off the pirates. However, Elaine becomes infected with the pox and loses control, travelling to Flotsam Island to sack the town and kill Morgan LeFlay, a bounty hunter who she sees as a rival for Guybrush's love.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects that}} <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy principles can have on business models in Denmark. More specifically, the paper investigates how companies that works with <b>Cradle</b> to <b>cradle</b> and Circular Economy, can think in new ways {{in regards to the}} development of their business models. The thesis uses a hermeneutical framework for the analysis of two companies from the Danish construction business which is used as case examples. One of the companies is Troldtekt that is already <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> Certified and the other is Novopan who is working with the Circular Economy principles and {{is on its way to}} become <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> certified. The findings are that the <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy principles can have an effect on business models in Denmark. <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy has a focus and an effect on the ownership of the materials of the products, the relations to customers and suppliers, the local environment and inward oriented consumption in regards to costumers being environmentally friendly. With increasing prizes on raw materials and a planet that is under great stress from an increasing population, and higher demands for products, there is good reason to look further into the possibilities of <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy. Although the <b>Cradle</b> to <b>Cradle</b> and Circular Economy has big potential, there is still work to be done in getting the construction business and the political scene in Denmark to help accelerate the transition. The above mentioned aspects, are aspects that concerns the different building blocks in the business model and therefore has important effects on the business model on an higher level. This is of paramount importance to the way the companies can think about running their business in the future...|$|R
