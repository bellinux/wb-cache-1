40|$|In {{an attempt}} to study the {{influence}} of varying distances between bipolar atrial pacemaker electrodes on ventricular far-field oversensing, we have chosen to analyse signals recorded directly from the patients <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker,</b> via its <b>programmer</b> unit, to a digital acquisition board under several test conditions. This data is analysed by a GUI-driven Matlab program for their near- and far-field parameters spike amplitude and width, frequency of occurrence, and average potential shape. Far-field events are displayed together with their preceding near-field over the whole recording period by a raster-plot display. Our Matlab routines were tested on several patients with a DDDR type pacemaker, but an extensive study under controlled conditions is pending...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and sources of {{electronic}} interference. The project partly follows another thesis made in the same field of interest (Ing. Kulík, Dept. of Control, Measurement and Instrumentation) and uses similar methodics of measurement. In the theoretical part of the work, the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging are briefly explained and most common methods used in MRI are described, {{as well as the}} definition of a <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker,</b> main events in pacemaker history and development. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> as a system is described in more detail, including construction, control, most common sensors and the ways of use. Electromagnetic interference of <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and implantable cardioverter defibrillators is processed via a complete review since the oldest scientific paper from December 1991 till May 2009. In the second part, measuring of magnetic field is described, as well as the possibilities of monitoring of its effects on <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> In fact, there are two possible ways of measuring. off-line exposition of the sample to the magnetic field followed by data acquisition via <b>pacemaker</b> <b>programmer</b> or the continuous on-line monitoring of the pacemaker activity by the means of measuring PC card. While the first method is reliable in cases where the is no sign of malfunction and makes the experiments with a dynamic exposition of sample possible, in some cases it detects a virtual malfunction also in cases where in reality the devices works perfectly. The second method enables a reliable continuous monitoring of pacemaker activity during the whole experiment and its only problem is a higher level of signal noise caused by the sample movement...|$|R

40|$|Bradycardia {{and rarely}} cardiac arrest as a {{complication}} of cervical spine injury due to reduced sympathetic activity is well known, which usually settles down in 4 – 6  weeks of injury. There are few case reports in literature of high cervical {{spinal cord injury}} requiring permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> due to this complication, but an injury as low as cervico-dorsal junction requiring permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> has never been reported.

This study included patients enrolled in 3 multicenter trials, who received a leadless <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> implant and who subsequently underwent a device removal attempt. The overall leadless pacemaker retrieval success rate was 94 %: for patients whose leadless <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> had been implanted for 6 months before the retrieval attempt.

40|$|Batteries used in Implantable cardiac pacemakers-present unique {{challenges}} to their developers and manufacturers {{in terms of}} high levels of safety and reliability. In addition, the batteries must have longevity to avoid frequent replacements. Technological advances in leads/electrodes have reduced energy requirements by two orders of magnitude. Microelectronics advances sharply reduce internal current drain concurrently decreasing size and increasing functionality, reliability, and longevity. It is reported that about 600, 000 pacemakers are implanted each year worldwide and {{the total number of}} people with various types of implanted pacemaker has already crossed 3 million. A <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> uses half of its battery power for cardiac stimulation and the other half for housekeeping tasks such as monitoring and data logging. The first implanted <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> used nickel-cadmium rechargeable battery, later on zinc-mercury battery was developed and used which lasted for over 2 years.

Methods: descriptive, exploratory and bibliographic study that used journals nationals listed in LILACS, BDENF, SciELO e CEPEnb - Center of Studies and Researches in Nursing data bases. It was looked for the expression “pacemaker” in the nursing studies titles and “orientations to <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> patients” in the other journals. Results: it was identified two dissertations and one thesis written by nurses in the Brazil.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the possible effect of cellular radio on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in elevators. We previously investigated pacemaker EMI in elevator by examining the E-field distribution of horizontal plane at the height of expected for implanted pacemakers inside elevators. In this paper, we introduce our method for estimating EMI impact to implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> using EMF distributions inside the region of the human body in which pacemakers are implanted. Simulations of a human phantom in an elevator are performed and histograms are derived from the resulting EMF distributions. The computed results of field strengths are compared with a certain reference level determined from experimentally obtained maximum interference distance of implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> This enables us to carry out a quantitative evaluation of the EMI impact to pacemakers by cellular radio transmission. This paper uses a numerical phantom model developed based on an European adult male. The simulations evaluate EMI on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in three frequency bands. As a result, calculated E-field strengths are sufficiently low to cause the pacemaker to malfunction in the region examined...|$|R

40|$|When pluripotency {{factors are}} removed, {{embryonic}} stem cells (ESCs) undergo spontaneous differentiation, which, among other lineages, also gives rise to cardiac sublineages, including chamber cardiomyocytes and pacemaker cells.

We sought to direct ESCs to differentiate specifically into <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> cells by overexpressing a transcription factor critical for embryonic patterning of the native <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> (the sinoatrial node). Overexpression of SHOX 2 during ESC differentiation upregulated the pacemaker gene program, resulting in enhanced automaticity in vitro and induced biological pacing upon transplantation in vivo. The accentuated automaticity is accompanied by temporally evolving changes in the effectors and regulators of Wnt signaling.
