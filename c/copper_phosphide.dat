50|$|A blue-black film of <b>copper</b> <b>phosphide</b> {{forms on}} white {{phosphorus}} when {{subjected to a}} solution of copper salt; wounds containing particles of phosphorus therefore have to be washed with 1% solution of copper sulfate.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of model}} pressure vessel steels {{has been characterized}} after neutron irradiation and thermal aging by atom probe field-ion microscopy. A high density of small, roughly spherical or disc shaped copper clusters/precipitates were observed in the neutron irradiated alloys that contained copper. Small spherical phosphorus clusters were observed in the irradiated copper-free alloys, and <b>copper</b> <b>phosphides</b> were observed in a high phosphorus Fe-Cu-Ni-P alloy. None of these clusters/precipitates were observed in the thermally aged materials. The increases in the tensile and yield strengths that were observed after neutron irradiation resulted from the formation of these clusters and other lattice defects...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of a diamonds containing coating {{on the surface of}} tools is a way of increasing hardness and wearability of the working surfaces. We have developed a new process to prepare these composite coating. The surface is initially wetted with copper sulphate solution and then diamonds powder is sprayed onto the surface. Upon subsequent exposure to gaseous phosphine, a surface layer of solid <b>copper</b> <b>phosphide,</b> firmly holding the diamond particles, is formed. <b>Copper</b> <b>phosphide</b> has sufficient electrical conductivity, allowing conventional metal electro-plating. The effect of process parameters such as duration of the exposure to phosphine gas, concentration of the CuSO 4 solution and thickness of the electro-deposited copper layer have been investigated and the surface roughness of the prepared samples increased about 50 BHN (Brinell hardness number) ...|$|E

BaCu 10 P 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C 2 /m, with unit cell dimensions a = 23. 288 (4) b = 3. 9070 (10), and c = 9. 534 (2) Å and β = 92. 26 (2) ° (Z = 4).

40|$|Air stable <b>copper</b> <b>phosphide</b> of {{thicknesses}} (0. 2, 0. 4 mu m) was synthesized over copper plates (of 10 mm diameter) by hybrid {{electrochemical deposition}} and low temperature solid-state reaction. Stoichiometric amount of red phosphorus (P) were sprayed over electrodeposited copper {{and followed by}} annealing at 250 degrees C under inert gas atmosphere for different durations (5 h, 7 h and 12 h). During this process, phosphorus particles diffuse by excavating into the copper deposits, producing holes, where the Cu 3 P crystallites nucleate and lead to conglomeration of several agglomerates and hence resulted in non-homogeneous morphology. A small extend of Cu 3 P oxidation occurs over the film's top surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm that the layer to be pure Cu 3 P. Scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) reveals a porous microstructure consisting of agglomerated particles with similar to 10 mu m size. The as-prepared carbon-free Cu 3 P electrodes exhibited significantly improved capacity retention and rate capability characteristics over 40 cycles when electrochemically tested against lithium at constant 20 mu A/cm(2) rendering it as possible negative electrode for high energy density lithium-ion battery (LiB) applications.

40|$|We {{describe}} two synthesis {{approaches to}} colloidal Cu(3) P nanocrystals using trioctylphosphine (TOP) as phosphorus precursor. One approach {{is based on}} the homogeneous nucleation of small Cu(3) P nanocrystals with hexagonal plate-like morphology and with sizes that can be tuned from 5 to 50 nm depending on the reaction time. In the other approach, metallic Cu nanocrystals are nucleated first and then they are progressively phosphorized to Cu(3) P. In this case, intermediate Janus-like dimeric nanoparticles can be isolated, which are made of two domains of different materials, Cu and Cu(3) P, sharing a flat epitaxial interface. The Janus-like nanoparticles can be transformed back to single-crystalline copper particles if they are annealed at high temperature under high vacuum conditions, which makes them an interesting source of phosphorus. The features of the Cu-Cu(3) P Janus-like nanoparticles are compared with those of the striped microstructure discovered more than two decades ago in the rapidly quenched Cu-Cu(3) P eutectic of the Cu-P alloy, suggesting that other alloy/eutectic systems that display similar behavior might give origin to nanostructures with flat, epitaxial interface between domains of two diverse materials. Finally, the electrochemical properties of the <b>copper</b> <b>phosphide</b> plates are studied, and they are found to be capable of undergoing lithiation/delithiation through a displacement reaction, while the Janus-like Cu-Cu(3) P particles do not display an electrochemical behavior that would make them suitable for applications in batteries.
