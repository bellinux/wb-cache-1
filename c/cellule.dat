25|$|Race decoratus {{is found}} in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and is very similar to the typical form, from which it can be {{distinguished}} as follows: Upperside green spots smaller, especially the discal series on the forewing. Underside hindwing: the red postcostal spot is relatively small but the red part has much increased against the black part; besides the large red anal mark and the mark before the first disco-cellular veinlet, there is a large red spot in the lower median <b>cellule</b> (interspace 2), a smaller red spot {{in each of the three}} preceding cellules (interspaces 3, 4, 5) and a streak-like spot at the base of the lower median <b>cellule.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{short and}} broad hull {{accommodating}} {{the flight crew}} supported the engine nacelles and the wing centre section on a frame-work of struts, in similar fashion to the later version of the Rs.II. The high set fuselage had several tasks, providing gun positions for defence, ensuring that the tail unit was as high as possible to reduce damage from spray and {{to act as a}} king-post for the wings landing-wire bracing. Constructed of steel longerons riveted to Duralumin frames and covered with Duralumin sheet over the forward portion and fabric aft it supported the tail unit which consisted of a biplane tail <b>cellule</b> with elevators and a large central rudder, initially with a long central fin, but later with two smaller fixed fins in the tail <b>cellule.</b> At approximately the mid-wing chord position the fuselage had a cockpit with provision for two machine guns and also housed a sound-proof wireless cabin in the nose.|$|E
25|$|The Ca.1 had an {{uncovered}} rectangular truss as a fuselage; its two-bay wing <b>cellule</b> featured unstaggered mainplanes {{of equal}} span. Although {{the engine was}} mounted in the nose, it drove propellers mounted {{in front of the}} wings on long struts. The landing gear consisted of a dual mainwheel and skid arrangement, with outrigger wheels at each wingtip and a tailwheel.|$|E

25|$|The M.19 {{began as}} an effort to improve the {{performance}} of the Fokker D.II (Fokker designation M.17). The M.19 featured the Oberursel U.III 14-cylinder, two-row rotary engine, combined with the two-bay wing <b>cellule</b> of the Fokker D.I. The U.III engine, first used in the Fokker E.IV, required a revised fore-and-aft mount and a strengthened fuselage. The prototype M.19 arrived at Adlershof for testing on 20 July 1916. Idflieg issued a production order for 50 aircraft at that time, followed by orders for an additional 60 aircraft in August and 100 in November. The new aircraft was designated D.III by Idflieg.|$|E
25|$|The G.II {{prototype}} first flew in March 1916, {{and testing}} revealed several shortcomings. The most significant {{problem was that}} the aircraft was not capable of carrying the bombload that was specified by the Idflieg. This was solved by a redesign of the wing <b>cellule</b> to extend its span. At the same time, it was changed from a two-bay to a three-bay structure. The second issue was that the undercarriage arrangement made for very long and uncontrollable landing rolls. This was solved by changing it to a conventional tailskid configuration. Other revisions included horn-balanced ailerons and a triangular vertical fin. In this configuration, production commenced in April 1916.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe spatial load {{forecasting}} method {{based on}} {{time series analysis}} usually divides predictive zone into <b>cellules,</b> and then forecast the load of each cell based on time series analysis, to predict the whole spatial load. Now there are many prediction models based on time series analysis, {{but it is hard}} to realize the minimum of the prediction error for each cell, namely not guarantee the accuracy of results of spatial load forecasting. Thus, the spatial load forecasting method based on the theory of clustering analysis is proposed there. Firstly this method analyzes the results and the relative prediction error of each cell with different load forecasting model. Second, according to the best forecast models, cluster all <b>cellules,</b> which <b>cellules</b> in the same cluster use the same prediction model to forecast the load of <b>cellules</b> of the target year. The results of a practical example show that our method is correct and effective...|$|R

2500|$|In early 1918, the Idflieg (Inspektion der Fliegertruppen) {{distributed}} to German aircraft manufacturers a detailed engineering {{report on the}} SPAD S.VII, whose wing structure Idflieg considered to be well-designed. Pfalz accordingly produced several Pfalz D.III-derived prototypes with SPAD-type wings. [...] These developed into the Pfalz D.XII. The new aircraft was powered by the 180hp Mercedes D.IIIaü engine and continued the use of LFG-Roland's patented Wickelrumpf plywood-skinned monocoque fuselage construction. Unlike the earlier aircraft, the D.XII used a two-bay wing <b>cellule.</b> Furthermore, the flush wing radiator was replaced with a car-type radiator mounted {{in front of the}} engine.|$|E
