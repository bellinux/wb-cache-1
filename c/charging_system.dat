On 7 October 2012 the charges increased to £2 for cars, £2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles and £5 for multi-axle goods vehicles. By 2012, local businesses were {{complaining that the}} crossing's charge booths were impeding local growth. The government announced that a new electronic <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> would be introduced in 2014. Drivers {{would be able to}} pay by phone, text, online or in shops. The charge was proposed to increase to £2.50 for cars, £3 for two-axle goods vehicles and £6 for multi-axle vehicles. A later report stated that drivers evading the charge could be fined as much as £105.|$|E

40|$|Recently, we derived an {{improved}} universal upper {{bound to the}} entropy of a <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> S ≤π (2 E b-q^ 2) / ħ. There was, however, some uncertainty {{in the value of}} the numerical factor which multiplies the q^ 2 term. In this paper we remove this uncertainty; we rederive this upper bound from an application of the generalized second law of thermodynamics to a gedanken experiment in which an entropy-bearing <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> falls into a Schwarzschild black hole. A crucial step in the analysis is the inclusion of the effect of the spacetime curvature on the electrostatic self-interaction of the <b>charged</b> <b>system.</b> Comment: 8 page...|$|R

40|$|As a {{first step}} to meet the {{challenge}} to calculate the electronic structure and total energy of charged states of atoms and molecules adsorbed on ultrathin insulating films supported by a metallic substrate using density functional theory (DFT), we have developed a simplified new DFT scheme that only describes the electrostatic interaction of an external <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> with a metal surface. This purely electrostatic interaction is obtained from the assumption that the electron densities of the two fragments (<b>charged</b> <b>system</b> and metal surface) are non-overlapping and by neglecting non-local exchange-correlation effects such as the van der Waals interactions between the two fragments. In addition, the response of the metal surface to the electrostatic potential from the <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> is treated to linear order, whereas the <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> is treated fully within DFT. In particular, we consider the classical perfect conductor model for the metal response, although our formalism is not limited to this approximation. To test the computational implementation of this new scheme, we have considered the case of a Na+ cation interacting with a perfect conductor. The application of this new methodology to realistic problems involving <b>charged</b> <b>systems</b> adsorbed on insulating films supported by a metal surface are deferred to a separate following publication...|$|R

25|$|The {{output of}} a magneto {{depends on the}} speed of the engine, and {{therefore}} starting can be problematic. Some magnetos include an impulse system, which spins the magnet quickly at the proper moment, making easier starting at slow cranking speeds.

The operator would manually switch the ignition over to magneto operation for high speed operation.|$|E
