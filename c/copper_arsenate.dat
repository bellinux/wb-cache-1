5|$|Because {{of their}} toxicity, chromium(VI) salts {{are used for}} the {{preservation}} of wood. For example, chromated <b>copper</b> <b>arsenate</b> (CCA) is used in timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-attacking insects, including termites, and marine borers. The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO3 between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution were used in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{acetoarsenite}} {{was used}} as a green pigment known under many names, including Paris Green and Emerald Green. It caused numerous arsenic poisonings. Scheele's Green, a <b>copper</b> <b>arsenate,</b> was used in the 19th century as a coloring agent in sweets.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, {{crystalline}} oxides As2O3 ("white arsenic") and As2O5 {{which are}} hygroscopic and readily {{soluble in water}} to form acidic solutions. Arsenic(V) acid is a weak acid and the salts are called arsenates, the most common arsenic contamination of groundwater, and a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include Scheele's Green (cupric hydrogen arsenate, acidic <b>copper</b> <b>arsenate),</b> calcium arsenate, and lead hydrogen arsenate.

25|$|As of 2002, US-based {{industries}} consumed 19,600 {{metric tons}} of arsenic. Ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with chromated <b>copper</b> <b>arsenate</b> (CCA). In 2007, 50% of the 5,280 {{metric tons of}} consumption was still used for this purpose. In the United States, the voluntary phasing-out of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on 31 December 2003, and alternative chemicals are now used, such as Alkaline Copper Quaternary, borates, copper azole, cyproconazole, and propiconazole.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} of arsenic to insects, bacteria, and fungi {{led to its}} use as a wood preservative. In the 1930s, a process of treating wood with chromated <b>copper</b> <b>arsenate</b> (also known as CCA or Tanalith) was invented, and for decades, this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic. An increased appreciation of the {{toxicity of}} arsenic led to a ban of CCA in consumer products in 2004, initiated by the European Union and United States. However, CCA remains in heavy use in other countries (such as on Malaysian rubber plantations).|$|E
25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding timber piles is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above groundwater level. Timber will last for a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the groundwater level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of wood preservation using pressure treatment (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), chromated <b>copper</b> <b>arsenate</b> (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{applications}} exploit arsenic's toxicity, {{including the use}} of the oxide as a wood preservative. <b>Copper</b> <b>arsenates,</b> which are derived from arsenic trioxide, are used on a large scale as a wood preservative in the US and Malaysia, but such materials are banned {{in many parts of the}} world. This practice remains controversial. In combination with copper(II) acetate arsenic trioxide gives the vibrant pigment known as Paris green used in paints and as a rodenticide. This application has been discontinued.|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{softwood}} and hardwoods timbers {{are used as}} ties, oak, jarrah and karri being popular hardwoods, although increasingly difficult to obtain, especially from sustainable sources. Some lines use softwoods, including Douglas fir; while they {{have the advantage of}} accepting treatment more readily, they are more susceptible to wear but are cheaper, lighter (and therefore easier to handle) and more readily available. Softwood is treated, while creosote is the most common preservative for railway ties, preservatives are also sometimes used such as pentachlorophenol, chromated <b>copper</b> <b>arsenate</b> and a few other preservatives. Sometimes non-toxic preservatives are used, such as copper azole or micronized copper. New boron-based wood preserving technology is being employed by major US railroads in a dual treatment process in order to extend the life of wood ties in wet areas. Some timbers (such as sal, mora, jarrah or azobé) are durable enough that they can be used untreated.|$|E

2500|$|Anthropogenic (man-made) {{sources of}} arsenic, like the natural sources, are mainly arsenic oxides and the {{associated}} anions. Man-made sources of arsenic, include wastes from mineral processing, swine and poultry farms. For example, many ores, especially sulfide minerals, are contaminated with arsenic, which is released in roasting (burning in air). In such processing, arsenide is converted to arsenic trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures and is released into the atmosphere. Poultry and swine farms make heavy use of the organoarsenic compound roxarsone as an antibiotic in feed. Some wood is treated with <b>copper</b> <b>arsenates</b> as a preservative.

The treatment process used was effective under the conditions required by the NBR 9480, with retention values higher than the minimum required by the standard, which is 6. 5 kg/m 3 of CCA per treated wood, and in addition, provided deep penetration and regular condom in sapwood of all timber treated.

40|$|International audienceDestruction of {{chemical}} munitions from World War I has caused extensive local top soil contamination by arsenic and heavy metals. The biogeochemical behavior of toxic elements is poorly documented {{in this type}} of environment. Four soils were sampled presenting different levels of contamination. The range of As concentrations in the samples was 1937 – 72, 820 mg/kg. Concentrations of Zn, Cu and Pb reached 90, 190 mg/kg, 9113 mg/kg and 5777 mg/kg, respectively. The high clay content of the subsoil and large amounts of charcoal from the use of firewood during the burning process constitute an ample reservoir of metals and As-binding materials. However, SEM–EDS observations showed different forms of association for metals and As. In metal-rich grains, several phases were identified: crystalline phases, where arsenate secondary minerals were detected, and an amorphous phase rich in Fe, Zn, Cu, and As. The secondary arsenate minerals, identified by XRD, were adamite and olivenite (zinc and <b>copper</b> <b>arsenates,</b> respectively) and two pharmacosiderites. The amorphous material was the principal carrier of As and metals in {{the central part of the}} site. This singular mineral assemblage probably resulted from the heat treatment of arsenic-containing shells. Microbial characterization included total cell counts, respiration, and determination of As(III) -oxidizing activities. Results showed the presence of microorganisms actively contributing to metabolism of carbon and arsenic, even in the most polluted soil, thereby influencing the fate of bioavailable As on the site. However, the mobility of As correlated mainly with the availability of iron sinks...|$|R
