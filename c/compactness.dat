5|$|The one {{exception}} to the <b>compactness</b> of the quartet comes in the minuet. The minuet's first half is a standard 12 measures, but the second half is an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions deep into the flat-side keys. The trio echoes the first and fourth movements by commencing with a B upbeat leading to an E.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the <b>compactness</b> theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|During the {{earthquake}} of 1905, there was large scale {{damage to the}} temple complex. Substantial part of the temples were damaged resulting in many broken parts seen lying scattered around the temple. Further, the heterogeneous structural <b>compactness</b> of the sandstone rock mass, from which the temples have been carved out, {{has contributed to the}} damage. A particular structural part of the temple which {{is not part of the}} main monolithic temple complex suffered severe damage to most of its circular columns which resulted in collapse of the mandapa and the roof (probably made of local timber) of the structure.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that {{life as we know}} it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for {{life as we know it}}, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar <b>compactness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the <b>compactness</b> successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{are usually}} built a few metres apart in loose colonies of at most about 10 pairs, {{although}} sometimes pairs nest alone. The nest may {{be built in}} a range of habitats, and usually is built as a cup in a hole or crevice in a cliff or a wall. They may use suitable human-built structures, such as house eaves and streetlights. The nest is an open structure made of grass, lined with feathers and hairs, packed densely for <b>compactness.</b> Some ornithologists have reported this bird building domed nests in acacia trees, but these records may reflect confusion with the Spanish sparrow. The average clutch contains three to five eggs. Both sexes incubate the eggs and bring food to their young, but females do more. Eggs are incubated for short spells, around 10 minutes, and males incubate for shorter periods and less often. Though the male accompanies the female when she finds food and brings it to their nestlings, he less often brings any himself; once the young fledge and leave the nest the male is more active feeding them.|$|E
25|$|A metric space M is compact {{if every}} {{sequence}} in M has a subsequence that converges {{to a point}} in M. This is known as sequential <b>compactness</b> and, in metric spaces (but not in general topological spaces), {{is equivalent to the}} topological notions of countable <b>compactness</b> and <b>compactness</b> defined via open covers.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, a {{structural}} domain {{can be determined}} by two visual characteristics: its <b>compactness</b> and its extent of isolation.

25|$|The <b>compactness</b> theorem has a {{limiting}} {{effect on}} which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the <b>compactness</b> theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus {{the class of}} all finite graphs is not an elementary class (the same holds for many other algebraic structures).|$|E

25|$|The (downward) Löwenheim–Skolem theorem {{is one of}} the two key properties, {{along with}} the <b>compactness</b> theorem, that are used in Lindström's theorem to {{characterize}} first-order logic.

25|$|General topology, {{also called}} point-set topology, {{establishes}} the foundational aspects of topology and investigates properties of topological spaces and concepts inherent to topological spaces.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of a non-quasiprojective algebraic variety were given by Nagata. Nagata's example was not complete (the analog of <b>compactness),</b> but soon afterwards he found an algebraic surface that was complete and non-projective. Since then other examples have been found.|$|E

25|$|The Kakutani {{fixed point}} theorem generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem in a {{different}} direction: it stays in Rn, but considers upper hemi-continuous correspondences (functions that assign to each point of the set {{a subset of the}} set).

25|$|Virginia {{is one of}} {{the most}} gerrymandered states in the country, both on the congressional and state levels, based on lack of <b>compactness</b> and {{contiguity}} of its districts. Virginia congressional districts are ranked the 5th worst in the country because counties and cities are broken into multiple pieces to create heavily partisan districts.|$|E

25|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Kurt Gödel (1929) {{proved the}} completeness theorem, which establishes a correspondence between syntax and semantics in first-order logic. Gödel used the completeness theorem {{to prove the}} <b>compactness</b> theorem, demonstrating the finitary nature of first-order logical consequence. These results helped establish first-order logic as the dominant logic used by mathematicians.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} zoetrope became popular, the flip book was {{introduced}} in 1868. With its simplicity and <b>compactness,</b> along with its more tactile qualities, the flip book has staid relatively popular. A disadvantage of the flip book {{can be seen in}} the fact that the animation stops rather quickly, while the zoetrope can display animation as a continuous loop.|$|E
25|$|Gödel's {{completeness}} theorem (Gödel 1929) {{established the}} equivalence between semantic and syntactic definitions of logical consequence in first-order logic. It shows {{that if a}} particular sentence is true in every model that satisfies {{a particular set of}} axioms, then there must be a finite deduction of the sentence from the axioms. The <b>compactness</b> theorem first appeared as a lemma in Gödel's proof of the completeness theorem, and it took many years before logicians grasped its significance and began to apply it routinely. It says that a set of sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset has a model, or in other words that an inconsistent set of formulas must have a finite inconsistent subset. The completeness and <b>compactness</b> theorems allow for sophisticated analysis of logical consequence in first-order logic and the development of model theory, and they are a key reason for the prominence of first-order logic in mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The {{sideways}} {{displacement of}} the strip is {{much larger than the}} small lengthways expansion in either of the two metals. This effect is used in a range of mechanical and electrical devices. In some applications the bimetal strip is used in the flat form. In others, it is wrapped into a coil for <b>compactness.</b> The greater length of the coiled version gives improved sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Compactness</b> {{conditions}} {{together with}} preregularity often imply stronger separation axioms. For example, any locally compact preregular space is completely regular. Compact preregular spaces are normal, {{meaning that they}} satisfy Urysohn's lemma and the Tietze extension theorem and have partitions of unity subordinate to locally finite open covers. The Hausdorff versions of these statements are: every locally compact Hausdorff space is Tychonoff, and every compact Hausdorff space is normal Hausdorff.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{topology}} (from the Greek τόπος, place, and λόγος, study) {{is concerned}} with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing. This can be studied by considering a collection of subsets, called open sets, that satisfy certain properties, turning the given set into what is known as a topological space. Important topological properties include connectedness and <b>compactness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} Wodak and Janin {{was based on}} the {{calculated}} interface areas between two chain segments repeatedly cleaved at various residue positions. Interface areas were calculated by comparing surface areas of the cleaved segments with that of the native structure. Potential domain boundaries can be identified at a site where the interface area was at a minimum. Other methods have used measures of solvent accessibility to calculate <b>compactness.</b>|$|E
