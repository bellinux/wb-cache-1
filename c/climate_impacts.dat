5|$|External costs, also {{referred}} to as hidden costs, are quantifications of the environmental and <b>climate</b> <b>impacts</b> of air transport. Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely, figures have been produced for the most significant. In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £1.4billion, rising to £4.8billion per annum by 2030. The impact of noise was costed at around £25million per annum in 2000, and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £119million and £236million per annum. Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total external cost for 2000 of around £6billion.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} methodology for evaluating measures for climate optimizing air traffic. In this context we use an integrated simulation framework which allows assessment and optimization of operational concepts {{with respect to}} overall mean <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> and costs on a per route basis for a global route network. The CATS simulation chain considers flight plans with city pairs, aircraft fleet composition, resulting aircraft movements, and trajectories to compute the changes in <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> and direct operating costs. The simulation chain was applied to systematically quantify the potential for <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> reduction and related cost changes through changed cruise flight altitudes and speeds. The simulated global route network comprises all routes served by the selected aircraft type (A 330 - 200) in the year 2006, resulting in 1178 city pairs worldwide. For calculating the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of aviation {{it is important to}} consider the effect of so-called non-CO 2 emissions beside the climate effect of carbon dioxide emissions. As the impact of these non-CO 2 emissions strongly depends on the location of the emission, the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> is no longer proportional to the total amount of emissions. Therefore it is necessary to use an efficient model like AirClim which considers the <b>impact</b> of different <b>climate</b> agents as well as their geographically variable impact for calculating the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of aviation emissions. This simulation shows that it would be possible to reduce the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> by more than 60 % by changing the flight altitude and speed, leading to an increase in direct operating costs by 32 % compared to cost optimized flight altitude and speed.

40|$|Transportation {{activities}} are often highlighted for their <b>climate</b> <b>impact,</b> and one {{industry that has}} a significant impact is the food industry. However, reducing the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of transporting food products can be difficult due to the various characteristics of such products, for example temperature regime. These characteristics also influence shippers’ ability to create efficient logistics systems. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} thesis is to understand the role of food characteristics for efficient logistics in order to enable shippers of food products to reduce the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of transportation. The thesis is a compilation of three papers: (1) a literature review of food logistics in order to study how food aspects have been considered within logistics literature; (2) an interview study to identify links between food characteristics and logistics systems; and (3) a case study to create a framework for reducing the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of transportation by considering food characteristics. To stress the importance of creating frameworks that can be adjusted to the wide range of food characteristics, the findings are analysed with the help of fundamental assumptions of contingency theory. In combination, the three papers constitute a framework for the link between food characteristics and <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of transportation. First, the framework identifies nine food characteristics and describes links between these characteristics and logistics performance variables. Second, the framework describes how to identify product flow characteristics (including food characteristics) for shipments and analyses how these product flow characteristics influence variables for reducing the <b>climate</b> <b>impact.</b> Finally, to guide shippers to make efficient decisions to reduce the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of transportation, this study demonstrates how shipments can be categorised {{with the help of a}} portfolio approach. The thesis explains how to consider the context, both in terms of the physical products and the physical flows, when creating efficient food logistics for reducing the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of transportation. For shippers of food products, the findings of this thesis can be applied to problematising the challenge of transporting a wide variety of products with different food characteristics...|$|R

On the other hand, the Technical Summary of the Fourth Assessment Report of the UNFCC, reflecting a consensus view, indicates a potential Amazon forest loss of between 20 and 80% as a result of <b>climate</b> <b>impacts</b> induced by a temperature increase in the basin of between 2.0 and 3.0degrees Celsius. The IPCC is also indicating a likelihood of major biodiversity extinctions as a consequence. Specifically, according to the Earth Simulator, temperature increases and disruption in precipitation cycles (up to a 90% reduction {{by the end of the}} century) could seriously hamper the workings of the Amazon as a forest ecosystem, reducing its capacity to retain carbon, increasing its soil temperature, and eventually forcing the Amazon through a gradual process of savannization. These predictions were reinforced in 2005, when large sections of southwestern Amazonia experienced one of the most intense droughts of the last hundred years. The drought severely affected human population along the main channel of the Amazon River and its western and southwestern tributaries.|$|E

Of the latter, travel between the UK and Spain, France, Germany and Italy account for around half, with Spain almost matching the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers. Outside of the EU, the United States, the Far East, Switzerland and the Middle East together account for just over half of all passengers flying between the UK {{and the rest of the}} world, with the USA exceeding the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers.

The advent of no-frills carriers has had a significant effect on passenger travel profiles, with strong growth in business travel from regional airports, and increasing inbound traffic generated for the purposes of non-UK residents visiting friends and relatives based in the UK. Whilst these carriers have been perceived to democratise air travel, providing the opportunity for lower income groups to travel more often, the main result is actually that middle and higher income groups travel more often, and often for shorter trips.

The <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> is evaluated without employing metrics such asCO e 2 or global warming potentials. The analysis evaluates the impact at all time scales out to 1000 years.

However, pastured systems that require significant synthetic fertilization, inputs from supplemental feed, or deforestation to create pasture, have substantially greater <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> at all time scales than the feedlot and dairy-associated systems analyzed. Even the best pastured system analyzed has enough <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> to justify efforts to limit future growth of beef production, which in any event would be necessary if climate and other ecological concerns were met by a transition to primarily pasture-based systems.

40|$|Contrails {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{as one of the}} main contributors to aviation-induced <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> in recent years. To reduce the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of contrails, mitigation policies such as taxation will be necessary in the future to incentivize jet aircraft operators to reduce contrail production. Contrails form in regions of the atmosphere with the right ambient conditions and they can be avoided by flying around these regions; this research investigates one such contrail avoidance strategy that uses flight level optimization to minimize contrail formation. A cruise phase flight profile system model was developed in this research that optimizes for environmental objectives such as contrails, CO 2, and NOx, alongside traditional objectives such as fuelburn and flight time. Using this system model and 11 different aircraft types on 12 weather days, a preliminary study was done to determine the price range of contrail taxation that would incentivize airlines to operationally avoid contrails. Result suggests a price range of 0. 12 $/NM to 1. 13 $/NM on contrail tax would effectively incentivize contrail avoidance. Furthermore, since operating costs differ {{depending on the type of}} aircraft, a single price on contrail tax may incentivize contrail avoidance on a small aircraft, but not larger ones. To account for this difference, a method of assigning contrail tax to different aircraft types is introduced using the aircraft maximum takeoff weight. Assuming airlines are incentivized to fly contrail avoidance strategies, the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of the flight profiles was evaluated for 287 flights along 12 O-D pairs for the 24 hour day of April 12, 2010. Under various assumptions of contrail radiative forcing and time horizon of <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> evaluation, the flight level optimization reduced the average <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> per flight by as much as 39. 1 % from a baseline of wind-optimal flight at optimal cruise altitude. In comparison, a complementary lateral optimization method reduced 13. 3 % from the same baseline. Furthermore, flight level optimization shows to be more fuel efficient by reducing the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of contrails by as much as 94 % from the baseline, compared to 60 % using the lateral approach. In terms of the CO 2 emission from the additional fuelburn, the <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> of lateral method was 4 times higher than the flight level approach. Lastly, result shows that designing for long-term environmental objectives is more energy efficient (reduction in <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> per additional kilogram of fuel used) than short-term, which suggest reducing CO 2 emission is favored over contrail avoidance in designing for <b>climate</b> <b>impact</b> optimal flight profiles...|$|R
