Carpenter and Westley began to mass-produce the kaleidoscope, invented by Sir David Brewster in 1817, and had sold over 200,000 items {{within three months}} in London and Paris. The company was also able to mass-produce magic lanterns for use in phantasmagoria and galanty shows, by developing a method of mass production using a <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> <b>printing</b> process. Popular imagery on the lanterns included royalty, flora and fauna, and geographical/man-made structures from around the world. The modern zoetrope was invented in 1833 by British mathematician William George Horner and was popularized in the 1860s. Wood and porcelain dolls in miniature doll houses were popular with middle class girls, while boys played with marbles and toy trains.|$|E
5000|$|Magic {{lanterns}} had widely {{been used}} for entertainment {{towards the end of}} the 18th Century, particularly in phantasmagoria and galanty shows, and became more publicly available in the early 1800s. The lantern slides had to be individually hand painted, a time-consuming and costly process, until Carpenter developed a method to mass-produce them using a <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> <b>printing</b> process. This enabled outline images to be repeatedly printed onto glass and thus create reproducible sets of slides. These outline images could be more easily and quickly hand painted ready for sale. The production of this imagery allowed people to look at magic lanterns in a new way, giving the potential for use in education and other fields. Popular topics included royalty, flora and fauna, and geographical/man-made structures from around the world. [...] The first known set was completed by 1823 showing a number of zoological subjects, followed by astronomical slides. These slides were for the day very good but Carpenter and Westley's slides would in time become highly regarded for their detail. [...] To accompany the slide sets Carpenter produced detailed notes in script form allowing presenters to show the images while running through a prescribed text.|$|E

Examination of the plates with x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrophotometry indicates metal compositions, including arsenical copper, consistent with Indus Valley technology. Microscopy of the metal surface and internal structure reveals detail such as pitting, microcrystalline structure, and corrosion, consistent with ancient cast copper artifacts.

40|$|The laser-assisted seeding (LAS) {{mechanism}} has {{the potential}} to replace the conventional electroless <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> in <b>printed</b> circuit board (PCB) manufacture because it combines the steps of drilling and electroless plating into one. The LAS mechanism should be able to plate microvias with high aspect ratio that may not be feasible by conventional electroless plating due to the small via geometry. The conventional electroless plating process generates considerable quantities of chemical waste. In particular, the plating of microvia with high aspect ratio close to 1 is difficult due to the limited accessibility of chemical solution to the via internal wall surface in conventional plating technology. LAS is a promising alternative. The objectives of this paper are to report the deposition mechanism of a thin copper film layer (laser-assisted seeding) on PCB microvias dielectric and to study the thermal reliability of the microvias produced by this mechanism.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{that allows for}} the first time the preparation of highly defined polymer brush coatings on the wafer-scale under ambient conditions (room temperature, exposure to air) from a broad variety of monomers. The discovered high oxygen-tolerance of the surface-initiated Cu(0) -mediated controlled radical polymerization (SI-CuCRP) yields entire wafers homogeneously covered by a polymer brush of linear, high molar mass polymers with narrow dispersities (D = 1. 1) at extremely high grafting densities (approximate to 1 chain per nm(2)). The low-tech and air tolerant method requires only less than or similar to 4 mL reaction solution containing a monomer and a ligand between two facing substrates. Thus, the SI-CuCRP is scalable to any surface area with minimal costs and minimal equipment. Despite the simplicity of the method, the high endgroup fidelity of SI-CuCRP is demonstrated by the preparation of a tetrablock copolymer brush which is the first example of a higher order block copolymer brush prepared by any surface-initiated polymerization. Finally, we present a new facile lithographic technique, the <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> proximity <b>printing</b> (CP 3), which relies on the proximity of the bulk copper surface to the initiator-bearing substrate.

The archives and rich library in Lilienfeld offered a useful field for his activity. On becoming librarian, he made it his first task to compile a reliable catalogue and then collected all documents bearing on the history of Lilienfeld and of Austria. Copies and impressions of memorial tablets, seals, and coins were reproduced until his transcripts and compilations filled twenty-two folio volumes. From this matter he composed the Fasti Campililienses in two large volumes (Linz, 1747-1754): this monumental work was a history of Lilienfeld from the thirteenth century {{to the end of the}} Middle Ages, a history of the Babenberg dynasty, and also of the Steyer region. His death delayed the completion of his great compilation project. On the suppression of the monastery in 1789, the manuscript was brought to the Imperial Library at Vienna, but the <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>prints</b> were sold. Subsequently both came into the hands of Abbot Ladislaus Pyrker, who published the last two volumes under the title of Fastorum Campiliensium Chrysostomi Hanthaler continuatio seu Recensus genealogico-diplomaticus archivi Campiliensis (Vienna, 1819-20), together with two appendices containing descriptions of the tombstones and extracts from the necrology of the monastery.|$|R
