5|$|II: The New York Times {{gives the}} place of birth as Kortrijk, while The New York Herald Tribune gives Brussels. It is presumed that the more obscure <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be the less likely error.

50|$|Ashkelon {{and other}} coastal <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> have been {{threatened}} by these Katyusha rockets if they reached Gaza. The Ben-Gurion International Airport and various major Israeli <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> have been {{within the range}} of these rockets if situated in the West Bank. The shipment also included rubber boats and diving equipment. This equipment could have facilitated seaborne attacks from Gaza against the coastal cities.|$|R
30|$|Hamilton and Kansas City {{have higher}} {{locational}} qualities than Québec City; thus, {{a team in}} each of these <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> need a slightly lower success rate than Boston, Colorado, and the New York Islanders: for potential fans in the p= 0.25 category, teams in these <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> only need 8 series appearances and 3 series wins, or 10 series appearances and 2 series wins, to reach R_ 0 > 1.|$|R
2500|$|In 1955, Thomas Ferguson, {{the founder}} of the NWAF, {{received}} five years of funding from the LDS Church and began to dig throughout Mesoamerica for evidence of the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. In a 1961 newsletter, Ferguson predicted that although nothing had been found, the Book of Mormon <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be found within 10 years. In 1972, Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote Ferguson questioning the progress given the stated timetable in which the <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be found. Replying to Hougey, as well as other secular and non-secular requests, Ferguson wrote in a letter dated 5 June 1972: [...] "Ten years have passed .... I had sincerely hoped that Book-of-Mormon <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be positively identified within 10 years—and time has proved me wrong in my anticipation." ...|$|R
5|$|In December 1999, a {{disagreement}} arose between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the city; the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> not except the government's promise to finance {{part of the}} line. Both Minister of Transport and Communications, Dag Jostein Fjærvoll from the Christian Democratic Party and Oslo City Commissioner of Transport and the Environment, Merete Agerbak-Jensen from the Conservative Party, agreed upon the distribution of funding {{from the city and}} state, and both wanted construction to start as soon as possible. The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The <b>city</b> <b>would</b> pay NOK 224 million, while the state would pay NOK 673 million.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1988 as Soak City, Cedar Point Shores is Cedar Point's water park. It is {{adjacent}} to Cedar Point and requires separate admission.

5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> mean that they could easily move on to Anuradhapura.|$|E

5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major <b>city</b> <b>would</b> have consisted of several missile batteries. One of {{these would be}} equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began {{pushing for the}} {{construction}} of a new Busch Stadium as part of a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building. In early 2002, plans for a new park were settled among state and local leaders and Cardinals owners. According to an agreement in which the state and <b>city</b> <b>would</b> issue bonds for construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a multipurpose development known as St. Louis Ballpark Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. The new stadium opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for Ballpark Village took place in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, however, North Korean {{troops were}} able to {{surprise}} US troops on Hill 303 and capture them. Late in the battle, these troops were machine gunned in the Hill 303 massacre. Despite these setbacks, the UN forces were successful in driving most of the North Koreans off, but the decisive battle to secure the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> occur during the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, Thomas Ferguson, a Latter Day Saint and {{the founder}} of the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), with five years of funding from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), began to dig {{throughout}} Mesoamerica for evidence of the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. In a 1961 newsletter, Ferguson predicted that although nothing had been found, the Book of Mormon <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be found within ten years. In 1972, Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote to Ferguson questioning the progress given the stated timetable in which the <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> be found.

5|$|He {{then went}} to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the {{government}} leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule. Sudirman urged that the president and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this suggestion was rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, {{responsible}} for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, {{one of the}} city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance of Bob Donnelly. The <b>city</b> <b>would</b> use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions with cable TV channel HBO to decide who would perform.|$|E

Take-Two Interactive's Chief Financial Officer, Lainie Goldstein revealed that Microsoft was paying a total of $50 million {{for the first two}} episodes. In January 2010, Rockstar announced that the DLC as well as Episodes From Liberty <b>City</b> <b>would</b> be made available for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on 13 April 2010 in North America and 16 April 2010 in Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1956 {{the states}} of India were reorganised by language. Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with {{neighbouring}} states to form the modern states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital. Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement, attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded {{the creation of a}} new Telangana state. Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010. The city suffered several explosions: one at Dilsukhnagar in 2002 claimed two lives; terrorist bombs in May and August 2007 caused communal tension and riots; and two bombs exploded in February 2013. On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state, and that Hyderabad <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal, and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill. With the final assent of the President of India in June 2014, Telangana state was formed.|$|E

5|$|Seventh-century Muslim armies had no siege equipment, and {{typically}} employed siege tactics {{only when there}} were no other options. Without the necessary siege equipment, armies of the early Muslim expansion would surround a city, denying it supplies until the city's defenders surrendered. Meanwhile any chance of breaking into the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> be availed, if possible, using stealth and espionage. Muslim armies would usually isolate the city {{from the rest of the}} region and deploy scouts along vital routes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} place the Acra in the Upper City on Jerusalem's western hill, within the area currently occupied by the Old City's Jewish Quarter. These propositions seek to locate the Acra within Antiochia, the Hellenistic polis established in Jerusalem according to 2 Maccabees. This conjectural new <b>city</b> <b>would</b> have been hippodamic in plan and therefore would have required a flat expanse of land which only the western hill could have provided. Furthermore, {{the eastern edge of}} the hill is adjacent to the Temple Mount and higher in altitude—two characteristics attributed to the Seleucid citadel.|$|E
5|$|The French {{crews of}} Henri IV {{received}} a telegraph from Admiral de Gueydon, {{suggesting that the}} bombardment of the <b>city</b> <b>would</b> begin soon, which the crews welcomed with enthusiasm. By then, a large crowd of people in Rabat and Salé had gathered to observe the French ships after they were spotted by Moroccan artillery operators. Admiral de Gueydon decided against starting the bombardment until consul Elton was aboard Caton; the consul did not come aboard the ship until four hours later. At dawn on 26 November though, the British steamer Janus joined Caton, and took the consul as its passenger.|$|E

30|$|Despite these advantages, this two-week {{short-term}} {{time window}} has a limitation {{due to the}} small portion of geocoded tweets compared to the total tweets, giving it {{the potential to be}} noisy. It was possible that some <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> score higher than others due to random variation, or that many <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> have no visits at all. However, only 11 cities, and only 3 US cities, had no visits, with 31 cities having at least 25 visits and as many as 1, 300 (New York). We thus concluded that statistically significant correlations observed between this measure and our other indices would be sound indicators of real relationships.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the late}} 1880s and even early 1900s, Trenton prospered {{because it was}} roughly a day's journey between Detroit and Monroe, Michigan, which meant people {{traveling}} between the two <b>cities</b> <b>would</b> have to stop overnight in Trenton.|$|R
