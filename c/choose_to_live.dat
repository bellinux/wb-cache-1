40|$|The {{notion that}} life is {{meaningful}} through <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> well has historically received substantive attention in various philosophical circles, notably the ancient Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and more recently several of the existentialists.

I develop this notion of <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> well by exploring, developing, and relating these conceptions of happiness and authenticity. By appealing to a very basic account of human nature that has found favor among {{a great number of}} people, I show how happiness and authenticity complement each other as conditions for the possibility of living meaningfully...|$|R
