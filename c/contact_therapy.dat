40|$|Background: Initial {{treatment}} of Eichenholtz stage I Charcot arthropathy {{of the foot}} generally is total contact casting and nonweightbearing. This method, however, often is time-consuming and has a poor result. This study was done to determine the success rate of total contact casting in {{a small group of}} patients and to establish a benchmark time period for treatment. Methods: Ten subjects with acute Eichenholtz stage I (stage of development) Charcot foot arthropathy were prospectively treated with weightbearing total <b>contact</b> cast <b>therapy,</b> undergoing biweekly cast changes. One subject did not complete the study. Subjects were monitored with biweekly clin-ical examination, limb volume measurement, and radiographs. The average age was 58. 2 (range 39 to 72) years and weight was 216. 9 (range 160 to 275) pounds. Results: All subjects were able to use commercially available depth-inlay shoes and custom accommodative foot orthoses at an average of 9. 2 (range 8 to 16) weeks. One subject developed a superficial ulcer that resolved with footwear modification. Conclusion: This preliminary study supports the use of total <b>contact</b> cast <b>therapy</b> and weightbearing in the {{treatment of}} acute Charcot foot arthropathy.

40|$|The {{temporomandibular}} disorders (TMD) diminish {{quality of}} life and can be costly for both individuals and the health care system. Stress from a variety of factors, including daily hassles and maladaptive thought patterns, has been commonly cited as a contributing factor in TMD. Support for this hypothesis comes from research demonstrating masseter muscle hyperactivity in response to experimental stressors, such as painful or frustrating stimuli. Many believe the link between stress and increased masseter muscle pain is parafunctional oral habits, including teeth clenching, grinding, and lip biting. Habit reversal has been used effectively to treat parafunctional oral behaviors and facial pain. Treatment entails teaching individuals to detect, interrupt, and reverse maladaptive oral behaviors. Positive results have been achieved in a group treatment format. Problems with prior research suggest that high attrition resulted from scheduling demands of the group treatment format. To address these problems, this study modified the habit reversal protocol used by Gramling, et al. (1996, 1999) into a minimal <b>contact</b> <b>therapy</b> (MCT) format. MCT has been applied effectively with many problem behaviors, including chronic headaches. Twenty individuals (10 -treatment and 10 -waitlist control) participated in the seven-lesson, manualized treatment. Participants completed a pre- and post-treatment assessment and an 18 -month follow-up. Individuals met with the therapist one time and received weekly feedback via telephone or e-mail. Participants submitted homework and quizzes for each lesson. Those in the control condition spoke with the therapist on a weekly basis as an attention control. Treatment lasted a mean of about 20 weeks. Significant improvement in pain severity including mean pain levels, highest weekly pain levels, and number of pain free days was noted in the treatment group relative to controls. The number and frequency of maladaptive oral habits revealed a strong trend towards lower levels from pre- to post-treatment for individuals in the treatment condition relative to controls. Additional measures of pain symptomotology and personality functioning also revealed significant improvements in the treatment group. Results suggest that a standardized treatment for facial pain is well suited for adaptation to a MCT format.

Estabeleceu-se, como critério de inclusão, que os sujeitos estivessem em processo psicoterapêutico individual e sistêmico junto ao Grupo de Intervenção em Primeiras Crises do Tipo Psicótica – GIPSI, da Universidade de Brasília. Foi realizada uma pesquisa de campo, na qual este grupo participou de sessões corporais, estruturadas com base em uma técnica de dança contemporânea, denominada Contato Improvisação. Também foram utilizados elementos da arte, como a música e a dança espontânea. Procedeu-se, ainda, a uma revisão teórica sobre o percurso do tema corporal na história da Psicologia, encontrando-se seus primórdios, principalmente, na teoria psicanalítica. Os resultados mostraram que o grupo reagiu positivamente, manifestando prazer e bem-estar psíquico às experiências corporais envolvendo o toque no corpo próprio, a regressão aos primeiros movimentos desenvolvidos quando bebês, como o rastejar e o engatinhar, e, fundamentalmente, ao contato com outros corpos. Assim, conclui-se pelo potencial psicoterapêutico de práticas corporais com este tipo de clientela, questionando-se o paradigma vigente a cerca das restrições relativas ao contato corporal com indivíduos estigmatizados como psicóticos, relativizando-se o quadro estrutural que lhes é atribuído. Ressalta-se a relevância da suspensão diagnóstica em suas primeiras crises, privilegiando-se a dimensão fenomenológica de momentos existenciais marcados pelo sofrimento psíquico grave, além da importância da inclusão da família no processo clínico. Por fim, qualifica-se a Terapia do Contato como uma abordagem psicorporal diferenciada, em termos de sua potencialidade de promoção da integração corporal por meio da técnica do Contato Improvisação. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work {{attempted to}} investigate the clinical repercussions presented by severe psychic suffering subjects through body interventions. The inclusion criteria was that the subjects were in individual and systemic psycotherapeutic process in the Group of Intervention in First Crisis of the Psychotic Type – from the University of Brasília. A field research was made, in which this group participated of structured body sessions based in a contemporary dance technique named Contact Improvisation. Music and spontaneous dance were also used. It was also carried out {{a review of the}} theme of the body in the history of psychology, leading to its origins in Psychoanalitical theory. The results showed that the group reacted positively, manifesting pleasure and psychic welfare to body experiences, such as touching their own body, regression to the first movements achieved as babies, like crawling, among others, and, mainly, to the contact with other subjects bodies.

40|$|A recent {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness to support or reject preventive therapy for treatment of contacts of patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Whether preventive therapy is favorable depends both on the effectiveness and the adverse events of the drugs used. We performed a {{systematic review}} to assess adverse events in healthy individuals and MDR-TB contacts treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs potentially effective for preventing development of MDR-TB. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases (August 2011). Record selection, data extraction, and study quality assessment were done in duplicate. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Of 6, 901 identified references, 20 studies were eligible. Among the 16 studies in healthy volunteers (a total of 87 persons on either levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, or rifabutin, mostly for 1 week), serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events were rare (, 1 and, 5 %, respectively), but mild adverse events frequently occurred. Due to small sample sizes of the levofloxacin and ofloxacin studies an increased frequency of mild adverse events compared to placebo could not be demonstrated or excluded. For moxifloxacin the comparative results were inconsistent. In four studies describing preventive <b>therapy</b> of MDR-TB <b>contacts,</b> <b>therapy</b> was stopped for 58 – 100 % of the included persons because of the occurrence of adverse events ranging from mild adverse events such as nausea and dizziness to serious events requiring treatment.

Design: Retrospective interventional case series. Methods: Six anisometropic myopic pediatric patients in one practice were identified through chart-review. None of the patients were compliant with specatacle correction or contact lens wear {{and as a result}} had dense amblyopia of less than 20 / 400 by Snellen or Allen visual acuity (mean &lt; 20 / 400). All patients underwent Verisyse&trade; phakic IOL implantation in the more myopic eye by one surgeon (AP). Pre- and post-operative visual acuity, anterior/posterior segment examination, stereoacuity, axial biometry measurements, cycloplegic refraction, and endothelial cell counts were performed in all patients whenever feasible. Results: The age of patients ranged from 5 &ndash; 11 years. The mean post-operative follow-up time was six months from the time of IOL insertion. Improvement in visual acuity &gt; 6 lines was achieved in four patients (mean visual acuity of 20 / 70 at six months). Improvement in stereoacuity was noted in all six patients (from total mean zero seconds-arc to six-months post-operative mean of 500 seconds-arc by randot stereoacuity testing). Improvement of &gt; 2 lines of visual acuity lines was achieved in the other two patients. No patient lost any lines of visual acuity. Enhanced physical activity, coordination, and improved social interaction were noted in patients and were reported by the parents. No intra/post-operative complications were noted. Discussion: Irreversible or intractable amblyopia secondary to severe anisometropic myopia is a serious medical concern in the pediatric population.

40|$|In the eldely {{population}} osteoarthritis (OA) is {{the most}} common form of arthritis and a major contributor to functional impairment. The hip and knee are the principal large joints affected by OA. Overall, as many as 40 % of those aged over 65 in the community may have symptomatic OA. The aims of the OA treatment are: reducing joint pain and stiffness, maintaining and improving joint mobility, reducing physical disability and handicap, improving health- related quality of life, limiting the progression of joint damage and educating the patients about the nature of the disorder and its progression. The latest guidelines cover the non-pharmacological modalities as education, regular <b>contact,</b> physical <b>therapy,</b> aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. The recommended pharmacological modalities include acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronates, symptomatic slow-acting drugs in osteoarthritis and opioid analgesics. The surgical modalities included in the guidelines are: total joint replacements, unicompartmental knee replacement, osteotomy, joint-preserving surgical procedures, arthroscopic debridement and joint fusion. Optimal management of patients with hip or knee OA requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities. Turk J Phys Med Rehab 2009; 55 Suppl 2 : 75 - 9...|$|R
40|$|Methods/Design. This paper {{presents}} the protocol of a prospective, single-blinded, multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial. In total, 200 patients with OA {{of the hip}} and/or knee will be randomly allocated into either e-Exercise or usual care (physical therapy). E-Exercise is a 12 -week intervention, consisting of maximum five face-to-face physical <b>therapy</b> <b>contacts</b> supplemented with a web-based program. The web-based program contains assignments to gradually increase patients' physical activity, strength and stability exercises and information about OA related topics. Primary outcomes are physical activity and physical functioning. Secondary outcomes are health related quality of life, self-perceived effect, pain, tiredness and self-efficacy. All measurements will be performed at baseline, 3 and 12 months after inclusion. Retrospective cost questionnaires will be sent at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and used for the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{has become}} {{in the recent}} years an {{important}} therapeutic tool for treating esophageal cancer in a palliative setting aiming to reopen the tumor stenosis. The literature shows that the initial enthusiasm for laser, compared with other methods [...] especially endoprosthesis [...] has somewhat been tempered because the success rate in restoring a normal food intake was lower than expected (65 - 68 %). Although the complication rate is low, repeated therapy sessions are needed to maintain the lumen open. This constitutes a major drawback in terms of patient acceptability. Variations in the therapeutical methods (<b>contact</b> laser, photodynamic <b>therapy,</b> [...] .) have not added up to now significant value to laser therapy. Specific indications for laser therapy versus endoprosthesis are discussed and should bring both therapeutic modalities to a more considered application. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing endocavitary <b>contact</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> (ECR) for stage I rectal cancer. METHODS: A database of patients treated with ECR for biopsy-proven rectal adenocarcinoma from July 1986 to June 2006 was reviewed retrospectively. Only patients with primary, non-metastatic, ultrasonographically staged T 1 N 0 and T 2 N 0 cancer who had no adjuvant treatment were included. Patients received a median of 90 (range 60 - 190) Gy contact radiation, delivered transanally by a 50 -kV X-ray tube in two to five fractions. RESULTS: Of 149 patients, 77 (40 T 1, 37 T 2) met the inclusion criteria. Median age was 74 (range 38 - 104) years, and median follow-up 69 (range 10 - 219) months. ECR failed in 21 patients (27 per cent) (persistent disease, four; recurrence, 17), of whom ten remained disease free after salvage therapy. The estimated 5 -year disease-free survival rate was 74 (95 per cent confidence interval 63 to 83) per cent after ECR alone, and 87 (76 to 93) per cent when survival after salvage therapy for recurrence was included. CONCLUSION: ECR is a minimally invasive treatment option for early-stage rectal cancer. However, similar to other local therapies, ECR has a worse oncological outcome than radical surgery...|$|R
