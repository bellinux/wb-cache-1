40|$|The {{very common}} seismological {{observation}} that the P waveform is enriched in high-frequency motion relative to the S waveforms of the same earthquake manifests itself, in spectral studies of the earthquake mechanism, as the "corner frequency shift, " the general although not ubiquitous tendency for the P-wave <b>corner</b> <b>frequency</b> fo(P) to be greater than the S-wave <b>corner</b> <b>frequency</b> fo(S). In point source, time-domain modeling studies of the earthquake mechanism which follow the recipe of D. V. Helmberger and C. A. Langston that explicitly sup-presses the <b>corner</b> <b>frequency</b> shift, it is an equally common result that the synthetic S waves are systematically enriched in high-frequency motion relative to the observations. Almost three dozen spectral analysis and time-domain modeling studies are recapitulated in this one to conclude: (1) the <b>corner</b> <b>frequency</b> shift is a very common condition of the far-field body waves of earthquakes, with no discernible dependence on earthquake source strength, hypocentral distance or depth, or recording device; and (2) the <b>corner</b> <b>frequency</b> shift is the manifestation of an intrinsic property of earthquakes, source finite-ness. Anelastic attenuation estimates for shear waves determined {{on the basis of}} a source model derived from P waves are likely to be strongly biased to high values of Q- 1, if the shear excitation is estimated directly from the equivalent far-field compressional excitation, i. e., with no allowance for source finiteness. The <b>corner</b> <b>frequency</b> shift, moreover, places strong constraints on admissible earthquake source models; point-source and Haskell-type dislocation models will not be among them...|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} response of a geophone {{is that of}} a harmonic oscillator, fully determined by corner frequency (typically around 10 Hz) and damping (typically 0.707). Since the corner frequency is proportional to the inverse square root of the moving mass, geophones with low <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> (< 1 Hz) become impractical. It is possible to lower the corner frequencyelectronically, at the price of higher noise and cost.|$|E
50|$|The {{lower and}} upper {{limiting}} frequencies, also denoted lower and upper stopband <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies,</b> are the frequencies where the stopband and the transition bands {{meet in a}} filter specification. The stopband of a low-pass filter is the frequencies from the stopband corner frequency (which is slightly higher than the passband 3 dB cut-off frequency) up to the infinite frequency. The stopband of a high-pass filter consists of the frequencies from 0 hertz to a stopband corner frequency (slightly lower than the passband cut-off frequency).|$|E
50|$|The {{acquisition}} chain is mainly {{made of a}} seismic sensor and a digitizer. The number of seismic stations depends on the method, from single point (spectrum, HVSR) to arrays (3 sensors and more). Three components (3C) sensors are used except in particular applications. The sensor sensitivity and corner frequency depend also on the application. For ground measurements, velocimeters are necessary since the amplitudes are generally lower than the accelerometers sensitivity, especially at low frequency. Their corner frequency depends on the frequency range of interest but <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> lower than 0.2 Hz are generally used. Geophones (generally 4.5 Hz corner frequency or greater) are generally not suited. For measurements in civil engineering structures, the amplitude is generally higher {{as well as the}} frequencies of interest, allowing the use of accelerometers or velocimeters with a higher corner frequency. However, since recording points on the ground may also be of interest in such experiments, sensitive instruments may be needed.Except for single station measurements, a common time stamping is necessary for all the stations. This can be achieved by GPS clock, common start signal using a remote control or the use of a single digitizer allowing the recording of several sensors.The relative location of the recording points is needed more or less precisely for the different techniques, requiring either manual distance measurements or differential GPS location.|$|E

30|$|To get a rough idea on the {{strength}} of high-frequency radiation, we estimated the approximate values of the <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> for the two events using the S-wave recordings at two selected F-net stations located at rock sites. An additional file is provided that deals with the estimation of the <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> for the two events (see Additional file 1). We found that the <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> for the 2004 event are higher than or similar to those for the 2016 event. Given the similar <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> for the two events, the stress drop for the 2004 event is expected to be much larger because the seismic moment of the 2004 event is larger by a factor of about 12 than that for the 2016 event (Brune 1970, 1971). Stress drop may be considered as one of the parameters that control {{the strength}} of high-frequency radiation (Boore 1983). In fact, as mentioned above, the observed PGAs were clearly underestimated by the GMPEs for the 2004 event, while the prediction was reasonable for the 2016 event. Together, these observations may indicate that the 2004 event was a higher stress drop event.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the frequency content of racing wheelchair propulsion motion data. The selection of the filter corner frequency in previous kinematic analyses of manual wheelchair propulsion was commonly based on gait literature. An estimate of the frequency separating the signal and the noise was determined to make recommendations for low-pass digital filters. The global (noncoordinate specific) cutoff frequency was 6 Hz. The directional cutoff frequencies were 5. 1, 3. 9, and 5. 6 Hz, in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and medial-lateral directions, respectively. Recommendations for the <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> of low-pass Butterworth digital filters based on the cutoff frequency are higher than the <b>corner</b> <b>frequencies</b> used in previous studies of manual wheelchair propulsion kinematic data.

A comparison of the and ratio for high breakdown and standard breakdown voltage devices is made.

It was observed that site effects for rock sites showed significant amplification at high frequencies.

After estimating the seismic moment and the stress drop, it was observed that the relation of the seismic moment, M 0, versus the corner frequency, fo, followed the scaling law M 0 fo 3.
