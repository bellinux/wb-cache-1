5|$|As <b>Crash</b> gathers the {{remaining}} crystals, he is attacked by several mutated animals dispatched by Brio, including the demented kangaroo Ripper Roo, the scimitar-wielding Komodo Brothers Moe and Joe, and the musclebound Tiny Tiger. During Crash's progression, Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns <b>Crash</b> of her uncertainty of Cortex's true intentions. It is not until <b>Crash</b> has gathered the crystals that Coco {{is able to}} reveal Cortex's ultimate plan: with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment, Cortex will power the gigantic Cortex Vortex built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army. <b>Crash</b> manages to defeat Cortex before the crystals can be used, but leaves the Cortex Vortex drifting aimlessly into space. <b>Crash</b> redeems himself by collecting the world's gems for Brio, who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device; <b>Crash</b> activates the laser and destroys the Cortex Vortex, breaking the space station apart.|$|E

5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy <b>Crash</b> and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, <b>Crash</b> and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights <b>Crash.</b> <b>Crash</b> eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading <b>Crash</b> to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E

The marginal effect of rear-end <b>crashes</b> (collision type[*]=[*] 1) is given in Table  2, which indicated that drivers who were involved in rear-end <b>crashes</b> (most common <b>crashes</b> in work zones) were 18 % less likely to be involved in severe <b>crashes</b> in comparison with angle <b>crashes</b> during adverse weather conditions.|$|R

5|$|<b>Crash</b> Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, <b>Crash,</b> as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. <b>Crash</b> is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. <b>Crash</b> will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. <b>Crash</b> can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect <b>Crash</b> from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). <b>Crash</b> can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Crash</b> Bandicoot is {{the first}} {{installment}} in the <b>Crash</b> Bandicoot series, chronicling {{the creation of the}} title character at the hands of series antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and henchman Doctor Nitrus Brio. The story follows <b>Crash</b> as he aims to prevent Brio and Cortex's plans for world domination, and rescue his girlfriend Tawna, a female bandicoot also evolved by Brio and Cortex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Crash</b> Boom Bang! is {{the first}} game in the series to {{exclusively}} feature the Japanese voice cast in all regional versions of the game. The voice cast includes Makoto Ishii in the dual role of <b>Crash</b> and Fake <b>Crash,</b> Risa Tsubaki as Coco, Yōsuke Akimoto as Doctor Cortex, Shinya Fukumatsu as Crunch, Akiko Toda as Tawna, Asuka Tanii as Pura, and Takahiro Yoshino as Pinstripe.|$|E
30|$|The model also {{estimated}} {{the effect of}} collision type (sideswipe <b>crashes)</b> on the severity of <b>crashes.</b> More clearly, drivers {{who were involved in}} sideswipe <b>crashes</b> were 7 % less likely to be involved in severe <b>crashes</b> in comparison with other collision types. It is worth mentioning that most of the sideswipe <b>crashes</b> were not severe in comparison with head-on <b>crashes</b> at work zones, which will be discussed in model 2 interpretation.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} {{that there is}} no agreement among different studies about the severity of work zone <b>crashes.</b> More specifically, some studies reported that work zone <b>crashes</b> were significantly more severe than non-work zone <b>crashes</b> [11]. On the other hand, some studies claimed that work zone <b>crashes</b> were less severe than non-work zone <b>crashes</b> [12, 13]. There is another group of studies, which mentioned {{that there is no}} significant difference between the severity of work zone and non-work zone <b>crashes</b> [14, 15]. While these studies are important and useful to understand factors affecting work zone <b>crashes,</b> it is largely unknown whether the harmful effects of adverse weather conditions can exacerbate the severity of work zone <b>crashes</b> or not.|$|R
40|$|Motorcyclists were {{involved}} in 6. 4 % of all police-reported <b>crashes</b> and 12. 5 % of all fatal <b>crashes</b> in Queensland during 2004 - 2011. Of these <b>crashes,</b> 43 % were single-vehicle (SV) and 57 % were multi-vehicle (MV). The overall reduction in motorcycle <b>crashes</b> in this period masked different trends: single-vehicle <b>crashes</b> increased while MV motorcycle <b>crashes</b> decreased. However, {{little research has been}} undertaken to understand the similarities and differences between SV and MV motorcycle <b>crashes</b> in Queensland and the factors underlying these diverging trends. The descriptive analyses and regression model developed here confirm international research findings regarding the greater role of road infrastructure factors in SV <b>crashes.</b> In particular, road geometric factors such as horizontal and vertical alignment and road surface factors such as sealed/unsealed and wet/dry were more important in SV than MV <b>crashes...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Crash</b> {{starts the}} game with four lives. The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his health meter, which {{decreases}} whenever <b>Crash</b> is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit.

However, the player can win an additional life for <b>Crash</b> by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit. After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by restarting the current episode.|$|E
