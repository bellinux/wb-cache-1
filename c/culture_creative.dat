He said the Union Jack currently only represented the other three UK nations, and Minister for <b>Culture,</b> <b>Creative</b> Industries and Tourism Margaret Hodge conceded that Lucas had raised a valid point for debate. She said, [...] "the Government is keen to make the Union Flag a positive symbol of Britishness reflecting the diversity of our country today and encouraging people to take pride in our flag." [...] This development sparked design contests with entries from all over the world; some of the entries incorporated red dragons and even anime characters and leeks. The lack of any Welsh symbol or colours in the flag is due to Wales already being part of the Kingdom of England when the flag of Great Britain was created in 1606.|$|E

40|$|Developing <b>culture</b> and <b>creative</b> {{industry}} {{has become an}} important agenda for the Chinese government in terms of building an innovation-oriented economy that is supported by culture and creativity. Research on <b>culture</b> and <b>creative</b> industry in China also appeared in various policy documents as well as academic journals and publications in recent years, {{although there is no}} uniform classification on what “culture and creative industry” should encompass. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and critical review on the current status of <b>culture</b> and <b>creative</b> research in China and identify {{the extent to which the}} current research reflect and support on China’s new economic development strategy underpinned by culture and creativity. By selecting and reviewing literatures from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, it has been identified that current research on culture and creativity tends to focus on developed cities/regions using descriptive approach and issues are discussed at conceptual and macro-level. On one hand, our findings support the general trends of growth and significance of <b>culture</b> and <b>creative</b> industry in China. On the other hand, we also identify the lack of systemic review and comprehensive research in this area hinders the process of strategic decision-making by the government and organizational performance in the industry. We recommend that more critical review and in-depth research through multi-disciplinary approach should be supported in order to provide comprehensive understanding on the development and trends of <b>culture</b> and <b>creative</b> industry in China and inform government policies...|$|R

Finally, we concentrate on selected areas of social development and report on recent studies on subjective theories, transmissions of values, and intergenerational relations.

Three key findings have emerged from recent scientific research: 1) individualist cultures are happier than collectivists, 2) psychological attributes characterizing the self (e. g., self-esteem, self-consistency) are more relevant to the happiness of Western individualists than to the happiness of collectivists, and 3) the self-judgment of happiness is anchored on different types of cues and experiences across <b>cultures.</b> <b>Creative</b> Commons License This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the young}} people are not {{interested}} in the local culture as a “wayang” puppet. This condition threatens the extinction of some of the local culture that should be a mainstay of the industry entering an era of creative industries. On the other hand, theyare more interested in playing computer games as changing of people's lifestyles. It becomes our basic idea to produce a game as a creative product. The genre of this game is fighting-adventure. This game depictures a story of fighting between the baby Tetuko and giant Kala Pracona. The game uses Kinect and 3 D platform technology to attract more players to feel their adventures. With Kinect technology, the player can control the character with his gesture. Thus, this game will increase the awareness of young people about the culture of Wayang. Keywords : 3 D game, kinect,adventure, local <b>culture,</b> <b>creative</b> industry...|$|E
40|$|This article excavates the ‘problem ’ {{of popular}} culture in museums, with {{particular}} attention to Sheffield’s National Centre for Popular Music and Preston’s National Football Museum. In both cases, profound issues are raised for information and knowledge experts who must manage and negotiate the contradictions of the popular. These two case studies are contextualized through both urban regeneration policies and sports tourism strategies. Both institutions were situated in the North of England, and both faced extraordinary obstacles. What is interesting is that Sheffield’s Centre was termed – derisively – a Museum. It failed. Preston embraced the label of a National Museum, and after profound threats to the institution, has survived. Part of the explanation for these distinct trajectories is found in understanding the specific challenges that popular culture presents for the presentation of history, narrative, identity and space.
