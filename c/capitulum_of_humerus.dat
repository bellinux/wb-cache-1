5000|$|The humeroradial joint is {{the joint}} between {{the head of}} the radius and the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus,</b> is a limited ball-and-socket joint, hinge type of {{synovial}} joint.|$|R
50|$|Although not {{generally}} termed condyles, the trochlea and <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> act as condyles in the elbow, and the femur head {{acts as a}} condyle in the hip joint.|$|R
50|$|At the shoulder, {{the head}} <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula. More distally, at the elbow, the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> articulates {{with the head}} of the radius, and the {{trochlea}} <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> articulates with the trochlear notch of the ulna.|$|R
50|$|The head's {{proximal}} {{surface is}} concave and cup-shaped {{to correspond to}} the spherical surface <b>of</b> the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus.</b> The radius can thus glide on the capitulum during elbow flexion-extension while simultaneously rotate about its own main axis during supination-pronation.|$|R
5000|$|In human {{anatomy of}} the arm, the lateral portion of the distal {{articular}} surface <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> consists <b>of</b> a smooth, rounded eminence, named the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus.</b> In non-human tetrapods, the name capitellum is generally used, with [...] "capitulum" [...] limited to the anteroventral articular facet of the rib (in archosauromorphs).|$|R
50|$|The radius {{is part of}} two joints: {{the elbow}} and the wrist. At the elbow, it joins with the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus,</b> and in a {{separate}} region, with the ulna at the radial notch. At the wrist, the radius forms a joint with the ulna bone.|$|R
50|$|Several {{synovial}} folds project {{into the}} recesses of the joint.These folds or plicae are remnants of normal embryonic development and can be categorized as either anterior (anterior humeral recess) or posterior (olecranon recess).A crescent-shaped fold is commonly present between {{the head of the}} radius and the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus.</b>|$|R
50|$|The head of {{the radius}} has a {{cylindrical}} form, and on its upper surface is a shallow cup or fovea for articulation with the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus.</b> The circumference <b>of</b> the head is smooth; it is broad medially where it articulates with the radial notch of the ulna, narrow {{in the rest of}} its extent, which is embraced by the annular ligament.|$|R
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus)</b> is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the causative factors underlying poor outcomes {{in the treatment of}} children with fractures <b>of</b> the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the distal  <b>humerus.</b> Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of community-based treatment of 36 patients with fractures <b>of</b> the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the distal <b>humerus</b> who presented to the Department of rehabilitation between 2010 and 2015 owing to poor treatment outcomes. Analysis only involved patients presenting with an extensive dataset with regard to their treatment, including X-rays taken {{at the time of the}} injury and at subsequent stages of treatment. Results: It was found that there had been inaccuracies at the stage of diagnosis in 47. 2 % of patients, errors in the selection of treatment in 13. 9 %, and errors in post-operative management in 38. 9 %. Conclusion: When interpreting radiographs, it is important that physicians clearly assess the degree of displacement when evaluating fractures <b>of</b> the <b>capitulum</b> <b>of</b> the distal <b>humerus.</b> Dislocated fractures require the most accurate reposition. When choosing a treatment method, it is important to predict the possibility of post-traumatic complications. Accumulating evidence of clinical errors indicates that more attention should be paid to the treatment of elbow fractures during the postgraduate education of specialists...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Lower end <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> shows {{olecranon}} and coronoid fossae {{separated by}} a thin bony septum, sometimes it may deficient and shows foramen which communicates both the fossae called Septal aperture, which is commonly referred as supratrochlear foramen (STF). Materials & Methods: We have studied 260 humeri (126 right side and 134 left side), measurements were taken by using vernier caliper, translucency septum was observed by keeping the lower end <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> against the x-ray lobby. Results: A clear cut STF was observed in 19. 2 % bones, translucency septum was observed in 99 (91. 6 %) humeri {{on the right side}} and 95 (93. 1 %) humeri on the left sides respectively (Table – 1). Clinical significance: The presence of STF is always associated with the narrow medullary canal at the lower end <b>of</b> <b>humerus,</b> Supracondylar fracture <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> is most common in paediatric age group, medullary nailing is done to treat the fractures in those cases the knowledge about the STF is very important for treating the fractures. It has been observed in x-ray of lower end <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> the STF is comparatively radiolucent, it is commonly seen as a type of ‘pseudolesions’ in an x-ray of the lower end <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> and it may mistake for an osteolytic or cystic lesions. Conclusion: The present study can add data into anthropology and anatomy text books regarding STF and it gives knowledge of understanding anatomical variation of distal end <b>of</b> the <b>humerus,</b> which is significant for anthropologists, orthopaedic surgeons and radiologists in habitual clinical practice...|$|R

50|$|The holotype of Alamodactylus was {{originally}} referred to Pteranodontidae by Myers (2010) and tentatively identiﬁed as cf. Pteranodon.

Andres and Myers (2013) diagnosed Alamodactylus on the basis of unique combination <b>of</b> constricted <b>humerus</b> mid-shaft and D-shaped distal humerus cross-section. This medium-sized pterosaur also has autapomorphic small pneumatic foramen on ventral surface <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> proximal end, and dorsal nutrient foramen positioned on midline <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> shaft level with the middle of deltopectoral crest.
