Beside of the 25 banks found to suffer from capital shortfalls on 31 December 2013, it was expected the second biggest bank in Portugal, Banco Espírito Santo, would also have shown a capital shortfall if being analyzed. However, ECB decided to postpone the AQR and stress test for this bank, after it went into an orderly resolution and ceased to exist in August 2014 - with all its assets transferred to the Portuguese resolution fund. The resolution plan now being implemented by the resolution fund, will cause a split of the bank into a [...] "bad bank" [...] (holding all bad assets, to be liquidated as soon as possible) and a new continuing recapitalized bank Novo Banco (only holding the healthy assets). At the time of the published stress test, the work of splitting up the assets between the two entities had not yet been completed, and for this reason ECB decided to postpone its stress test of the continuing Novo Banco. One month later, it was announced Novo Banco had a sufficient CET1-ratio of 9.2% as of 4 August 2014 (after secretion of the toxic assets into the [...] "bad bank"), and the resolution fund expected it would be sold as a viable bank to a new private owner during the second quarter of 2015.|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Efficient {{hospital}} management requires appropriate cost and price strategies. Informed decision on costs and prices of healthcare services needs estimation of costs of unit services using microeconomic techniques. There {{is lack of}} knowledge and skills for such costing methods in the healthcare sector of developing countries such as Iran. This study aims at detail description of a relatively simple microcosting method by cost analysis of unit healthcare services in Bou Ali Sina University Hospital affiliated to Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in Bou Ali Sina hospital over the period of October-December 2010. A volume-based top-down microcosting approach was adopted to calculate the average costs of unit services in the facility. Hospital departments were identified and clustered into three categories of General/overhead, intermediate, and final cost centers. The costs were classified into two direct and indirect groups. Data was collected using standard operational <b>budgeting</b> <b>sheets.</b> Costs were prorated using a step-down allocation method. Final units’ bed-day indices and the revenue generated from medication services were determined by reviewing hospitalized patient records. The net profit of each medication unit was calculated based on services cost data and occupied bed-day data. Hospital financial performance was analyzed using break-even analysis. Findings: Over half of the hospital costs were found to incur in intermediate departments (Nutrition, Laboratories, Pharmacy, and Diagnosis Testing departments), and the rest were equally related to general/overhead and final units. Over 75 % of the hospital expenditures were direct costs, half of which being related to human resources expenses. An 80 % bed-day occupancy rate was identified, with CCUs having the highest, and Ophthalmology Ward having the lowest rate. The hospital turned out to be in net loss with the majority of losses caused by ICU, CCU 2 and Internal Ward 1. The data suggests that the hospital can make significant revenue by activating unoccupied bed-day capacity of Ophthalmology and Heart wards. Conclusions: Microeconomic analysis of unit services is instrumental to identifying the areas requiring strengths and areas for improvement in hospital financial management. Such an analysis can also provide insight into practical strategies for improving hospital financial performance...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{changes of}} polar ice sheets have an {{important}} societal impact, because they affect global sea level. Estimating the current mass <b>budget</b> of ice <b>sheets</b> is equivalent to determining the balance between surface mass gain through precipitation and outflow across the grounding line. For the Antarctic ice sheet, grounding line outflow is governed by oceanic processes and outlet glacier dynamics. In this study, we compute the mass budget of major outlet glaciers in the eastern Dronning Maud Land sector of the Antarctic ice sheet using the input/output method. Input is given by recent surface accumulation estimates (SMB) of the whole drainage basin. The outflow at the grounding line is determined from the radar data of a recent airborne survey and satellite-based velocities using a flow model of combined plug flow and simple shear. This approach is an improvement on previous studies, as the ice thickness is measured, rather than being estimated from hydrostatic equilibrium. In line with the general thickening of the ice sheet over this sector, we estimate the regional mass balance in this area at 3. 15 ± 8. 23 Gt a - 1 {{according to the most}} recent SMB model results.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The prime objective of this thesis is to research and develop {{a new system of}} project budgeting, monitoring and forecasting {{to meet the needs of}} the Construction Industry. It is intended that this work will facilitate the means for more efficient control of projects from inception to final completion, utilising where possible the latest developments in computer technology. The initial stage of the work involves an investigation and appraisal of existing methods of formulating project budgets. In particular attention is paid to previous work in the development of mathematical 's' curve models, together with their limitations in use and application. Potential for future development is also identified. The thesis then focuses on the evolution of an improved modelling philosophy for project budgets and forecasts which overcomes previously known problems. In parallel with this work is the development of a computerised system intended to enable the testing of the model against live project data. The model finally selected is then tested against the extensive research work previously undertaken by the DHSS and the data collected from sixteen construction projects. To facilitate the development of a suitable control system to act as a vehicle for the application of the principles developed, a contextual survey is included. This survey is intended to provide an update of previous survey work undertaken by the author in 1977 and to further investigate factors orientated specifically to the objectives of the thesis. The research then concentrates on the development of an integrated set of sub-systems which contribute to the budgeting, monitoring and prediction of project expenditure. These systems are developed in accordance with the need to establish the financial status of projects both before, during and after they are completed. The overall system is based on the latest computer technology available and is designed to be flexible in its application. Tests documented in the text prove that the system operates both in principle and in practice. A further extension of the research is the use of the various project data bases to provide information for a corporate control system which has been developed in principle. This thesis provides a significant step forward in <b>computerised</b> project <b>budgeting</b> and control utilisng 's' curve philosophy and provides a basis for further development. Potential exists for future development of the prediction and corporate control systems, together with software developments to improve general application over a wide range of industries and disciplines where project work is undertaken...|$|R

It is developed for high resolution (1 – 3  km) weather forecasting and applied {{in a number of}} regions in Europe and the Mediterranean. A version of HARMONIE-AROME is also under development for regional climate modelling. Here we run HARMONIE-AROME for a domain over Greenland that includes {{a significant portion of the}} Greenland ice sheet. The model output reproduces temperature, wind speed and direction and relative humidity over the ice sheet well when compared with the observations from PROMICE automatic weather stations (AWS) operated within the model domain on the ice sheet (mean temperature bias 1. 31  ±  3. 6  K) but we identified a much lower bias (− 0. 16  ±  2. 3  K) at PROMICE sites on days where melt does not occur at the ice sheet surface and is thus an artefact of the simplified surface scheme over glaciers in the existing HARMONIE-AROME operational set-up. The bias in summer time temperature also affects wind speed and direction as the dominant katabatic winds are caused by the cold ice surface and slope gradient. By setting an upper threshold to the surface temperature of the ice surface within SURFEX we show that the weather forecast error over the Greenland ice sheet can be reduced in summer when glacier ice is exposed. This improvement will facilitate accurate ice melt and run-off computations, important both for ice surface mass budget estimation and for commercial applications such as hydro-power forecasting. Furthermore, the HCLIM regional climate model derived from HARMONIE-AROME will need to accurately account for glacier surface processes in these regions in order to be used to accurately compute the surface mass <b>budget</b> of ice <b>sheets</b> and glaciers, a key goal of regional climate modelling studies in Greenland...|$|R

40|$|Thin, subvisible cirrus (SVC) clouds at the {{tropical}} tropopause {{have been observed}} {{by a number of}} methods in a variety of observational programs, including in situ sampling and aircraft and space-based lidar. Modeling studies suggest that these clouds {{play an important role in}} dehydrating tropospheric air as it enters the stratosphere. This is because particles large enough to have significant fall speeds can form under the conditions of slow cooling that are implied by the large horizontal extent of the SVC sheets. The IR radiation that these clouds absorb, and the upward vertical motion this implies, also makes them candidates for a tropical troposphere-to-stratosphere mass transfer mechanism. They may also play a role in the earth's radiation <b>budget.</b> These <b>sheets</b> were observed on five flights during the Tropical Ozone Transport Experiment (TOTE) by the NASA Langley DIAL lidar aboard NASA's DC- 8 research aircraft operating during December 1995 and February 1996 south of Hawaii. The relationship of the SVC's observed during TOTE to convection was not a simple one. One class of SVC's are within 1000 km of the persistent strong convection near 15 S (the SPCZ). Trajectory analyses indicated that the SVC air masses have in fact passed through the SPCZ within a few days of observation. These clouds are very close to the tropopause, with maximum potential temperatures not much higher than 370 K, consistent with in situ water and total water measurements near the tropopause made during the Stratosphere Troposphere Exchange Project in January 1987 at Darwin, Australia. A second class of SVC's are not immediately downstream of convection. These clouds tend to be higher, reaching potential temperatures of 390 K or more. Trajectory analyses indicate that the air in these SVC's originates either in the equatorial western Pacific or along the subtropical jet. In any case, the warm temperatures the SVC air masses encounter just prior to the observation time along the back trajectory imply that the clouds cannot be residual particles from cirrus blowoff, but must form locally as the air move upward and equatorward south of Hawaii. Since all the parcels have encountered colder temperatures than those at the time of observation early in their history, subsynoptic scale temperatures colder than the analysis temperatures appear to be required to explain the formation of ice particles. In fact, the sloping shapes of the SVC's do suggest that they are gravity or inertia-gravity waves. In situ meteorological measurements made by the ER- 2 within a day of the DC- 8 remote lidar observations show a gravity wave structure near the equator with an estimated period of about 30 hours.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to examine the shift in the intergenerational mobility of Indian immigrant entrepreneurs in Australia. Based on a qualitative methodology, this article reports on the differences in the entrepreneurial attitudes of push and pull and the aptitudes of social and human capital between pre 2000 and post 2000 immigrant entrepreneurs. The findings suggest that the post 2000 Indian migrant entrepreneurs in Australia are mostly pull motivated, have higher qualifications than the pre 2000 arrivals, speak better English, have professional educational qualifications relevant to their business, and operate predominantly in the service sector. They take fewer years to get into business and are less dependent on immigrant social capital resources than pre 2000 arrivals. The study proposes that, compared with social capital resources, human capital resource have a greater impact on entrepreneurial propensity in the case of second generation Indian migrant entrepreneurs in Australia. Policy Implications This research has implication for Australian immigration policy, labour laws and settlement services of migrants. It recommends successful implementation of policies and durable solutions for Indian immigrants in the labour market in Australia. The Australian Government will be assisted in examining and identifying future options for the intake of temporary and permanent migrants that improve the income, wealth and living standards of Australian citizens, improve the <b>budgets</b> and balance <b>sheets</b> of Australian governments, minimize administration and compliance costs associated with immigration, and provide pathways both for Australian citizens to be altruistic towards foreigners, and for Australia's international responsibilities and obligations to foreign residents to be met. Improvements in the labour laws would promote the effective integration of Indian immigrants into society. Further, Indians in the USA have contributed immensely to the entrepreneurial spirit due to the government support for migrant SMEs and the small business venture funds. The Australian government can replicate this policy, reduce restriction on employment opportunities and enhance entrepreneurship for all migrants. 29 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues relating}} to the establishment and financial management of extrabudgetary funds (EBFs), {{a large group of}} government entities that on average accounts for 40 to 45 percent of central government expenditure-two-thirds of which represents social security funds-in countries at various stages of development. If improperly designed and managed, EBFs can undermine effective fiscal control. However, they also bring potential benefits in the form of greater autonomy of decision-making in countries with well-established governance and financial management systems that have applied the "agency model" of devolved public management and fiscal control. The paper develops a typology of EBFs and argues that EBFs are frequently created because of failures in the budget system and political economy factors that need to be recognized and, where possible, corrected. The paper recommends that data on EBFs be consolidated within a unified system of fiscal reporting and proposes an analytical framework that governments might use to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of their EBFs.

40|$|Mass {{changes of}} polar ice sheets have an {{important}} societal impact, because they affect global sea level. Estimating the current mass <b>budget</b> of ice <b>sheets</b> is equivalent to determining the balance between the surface mass gain through precipitation and the outflow across the grounding line. In Antarctica, the latter is mainly governed by oceanic processes and outlet glacier dynamics. In this thesis, we assess the mass balance of a part of eastern DronningMaud Land via an input/output method. Input is given by recent surface accumulation estimations of the whole drainage basin. The outflow at the grounding line is determined from the radar data of a recent airborne survey and satellite-based velocities using a flow model of combined plug flow and simple shear. We estimate the regional mass balance in this area to be between 1. 88 ± 8. 50 and 3. 78 ± 3. 32 Gt a− 1 depending on the surface mass balance (SMB) dataset used. This study also reveals that the plug flow assumption is acceptable at the grounding line of ice streams. The mass balance of drainage basins is governed by the dynamics of their outlet glaciers and more specifically the flow conditions at the grounding line. Thanks to an airborne radar survey we define the bed properties close to the grounding line of the West Ragnhild Glacier (WRG) in the Sør Rondane Mountains. Geometry and reflectivity analyses reveal that {{the bed of the}} last 65 km upstream of the grounding line is sediment covered and saturated with water. This setting promotes the dominance of basal motion leading to a change in the flow regime: in the interior flow is governed by internal deformation while its relative importance decreases to become driven by basal sliding. Subsequently we present the results of the reconstruction of the SMB across an ice rise through radar data and inverse modelling. The analysis demonstrates that atmospheric circulation was stable during the last millennium. Ice rises induce an orographic uplift of the atmospheric flow and therefore influence the pattern of the SMB across them, resulting in an asymmetric SMB distribution. Since the geometry of the internal reflection horizons observed in radar data depends on the SMB pattern, the asymmetry observed in radar layers reveals the trajectories of air masses at the time of deposit. We present an original and robust method to quantify this SMB distribution. Combining shallow and deep radar layers, SMB across Derwael Ice Rise is reconstructed. Two methods are employed {{as a function of the}} depth of the layers: i. e. the shallow layer approximation for the surface radar layers and an optimization technique based on an ice flow model for the deeper ones. Both methods produce similar results. We identify a difference in SMB magnitude of 2. 5 between the flanks and the ice rise divide, as well as a shift of ≈ 4 km between the SMB maximum and the crest. Across the ice rise, SMB exhibits a very large variability, ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 9 mw. e. a− 1. This anomaly is robust in time. Finally we draw a comprehensive description of the Sør Rondane Mountains sector. The glacial system is close to the equilibrium and seems stable but evidences suggest that it is a fragile equilibrium. The proximity of the open ocean certainly favours the interaction between warm water and the ice shelf cavity conducting to potential important melting. The thinning associated with this melting can detach the ice shelf from pinning points. This will reduce the buttressing from the ice shelf, outlet glaciers will accelerate and mass transfer toward the ocean will increase. Therefore, the future of Antarctic Ice Sheet directly depends on the changes affecting its boundaries and assessing the sensitivity of the ice sheets is essential to quantify and anticipate the future variation of mass balance.
