50|$|The Commission {{is close}} to academia, {{industry}} and end users of separated and liquefied gases.Commission members work closely with Commission A1 <b>Cryophysics,</b> Cryoengineering and Commission C1 Cryobiology, Cryomedicine and Health Products.|$|E
50|$|This Commission {{is truly}} active and {{participates in the}} various {{workshop}} series on cryoprocessing of biopharmaceuticals and biomaterials, as well as establishing innovative e-training actions concerning the Commissionâ€™s multidisciplinary needs {{as well as the}} interdisciplinary needs of the following commissions: A1 <b>Cryophysics,</b> Cryoengineering, A2 Liquefaction and Separation of Gases and finally C1 Cryobiology, Cyomedicine and Health Products.|$|E
50|$|Section A {{comprises}} two Commissions, A1 <b>Cryophysics</b> and Cryoengineering, and A2 Liquefaction and Separation of Gases. Commission A1 {{deals with}} research, development and industrial {{activities at the}} lowest temperatures, including low-temperature physics, applications of superconductivity and helium cryogenics. Commission A2 essentially covers the liquefied gas industry, including air separation and LNG technology, two mature domains with high economic stakes and ongoing developments addressing important societal issues such as energy efficiency and carbon sequestration.|$|E
50|$|Woollam {{was born}} in Kalamazoo, Michigan. His {{interest}} in physics, engineering and business was stimulated by his father, Arthur Woollam, who ran a water pump company in Kalamazoo. As a teenager John was not much interested in school classes, but he spent hours at his father's company studying and building pumps. This attitude changed {{in high school and}} College (Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio) where he majored in physics. He earned his master's degree in 1963 and defended a PhD in 1967 at the Michigan State University (MSU). After that for 13 years he was employed by NASA to work in <b>cryophysics,</b> superconductivity and propulsion systems. In parallel he earned a master's degree in electrical engineering from the Case Institute of Technology at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio) in 1978.|$|E
