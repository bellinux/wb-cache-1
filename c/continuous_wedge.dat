40|$|The {{importance}} of small-scale seismic events in enclosed water bodies, which {{can result in}} large tsunami waves capable of affecting comprehensive damage over small, geographically-confined areas are generally overlooked, although recognizing the occurrence of such events is a necessary element in adequately assessing the risk of natural hazards at specific locations. Here we present evidence for a probable large localized tsunami that occurred within the Bay of La Paz, Baja California Sur, ~ 1100 year before present (BP), {{which resulted in the}} creation of a shelly ridge at an elevation of ~ 2 m above mean high water (MHW). This ridge consists of a <b>continuous</b> <b>wedge</b> of poorly mixed marine sands and shells ~ 50 cm in depth deposited along the entire seaward edge of the lake. The marine shells collected from terrestrial environments around the lake include species from a variety of environments, including offshore species with minimum preferred depths of > 13 m. The evidence suggests that this material was likely deposited by a tsunami with a runup of 2 – 3. 6 m above MHW, probably associated with the slumping of an island along the tectonically active eastern edge of the bay...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods were}} {{attempted}} to determine an objective evaluation of lithographic films {{with respect to}} the sharpness of half-tone dots produced by the films. In Method I a step function target was placed in contact with a <b>continuous</b> <b>wedge</b> and a film sample. After exposure and development, a curve of the film was drawn in terms of per cent transmission versus log exposure. Since the input (target) is a step function, the output (curve) should also be a step function. It was expected that the width of the step in the curve would yield some measure of how well the film would produce hard dots. After curves for several films were drawn and examined, it was found that {{there was no difference between}} films. Method II was conducted in a similar way as Method I but a different target was used. A line screen was used to expose a film in such a way that the lines ran parallel to the sample. The target was then turned ninety degrees and a second sample was exposed. After development, the film was analyzed to find a difference in curves caused by the target orientation. This difference was compared with the difference obtained with another film. No difference between the films was found...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{complete}} {{digital elevation}} and bathymetry model of Taiwan {{provides the opportunity}} to characterize the topography of an emerging mountain belt. The orogen appears to form a <b>continuous</b> <b>wedge</b> of constant slope extending from the subaerial peaks to the submarine basin. We compare submarine channel systems from {{the east coast of}} Taiwan with their subaerial counterparts and document a number of fundamental similarities between the two environments. The submarine channel systems form a dendritic network with distinct hillslopes and channels. There is minimal sediment input from the subaerial landscape and sea level changes are insignificant, suggesting that the submarine topography is sculpted by offshore processes alone. We implement a range of geomorphic criteria, widely applied to subaerial digital elevation models, and explore the erosional processes responsible for sculpting the submarine and subaerial environments. The headwaters of the submarine channels have steep, straight slopes and a low slope-area scaling exponent, reminiscent of subaerial headwaters that are dominated by bedrock landslides. The main trunk streams offshore have concave-up longitudinal profiles, extensive knickpoints, and a slope-area scaling exponent similar in form to the onshore fluvial domain. We compare the driving mechanisms of the likely offshore erosional processes, primarily debris flows and turbidity currents, with subaerial fluvial incision. The results have important implications for reading the geomorphic signals of the submarine and subaerial landscapes, for understanding the links between the onshore and offshore environments, and, more widely, for focusing the future research of the submarine slop...|$|E

3000|$|In this paper, we have {{considered}} similarity {{solutions for the}} steady MHD boundary layer flow due to a <b>continuous</b> moving <b>wedge</b> in a parallel free stream with the induced magnetic field. We investigated {{the effects of the}} moving parameter λ, the ratio of magnetic to dynamic pressure S, the wedge parameter β and the reciprocal magnetic Prandtl number α on the flow field and the induced magnetic field characteristics. It has been found that increasing the values of the moving parameter λ and the wedge parameter β speeds up the fluid flow. In contrast, increasing the ratio of magnetic to dynamic pressure S and the reciprocal magnetic Prandtl number α slows down the fluid flow. Furthermore, the skin friction or the surface shear stress [...]...|$|R

Unlike the B 0 gauge solution, which requires a carefully regulated discrete sum of wedge states subtracted against a mysterious “phantom” counter term, this new solution involves a <b>continuous</b> integral of <b>wedge</b> states, and no regularization or phantom term is necessary. Moreover, we can evaluate the action and prove Sen’s conjecture in a mere few lines of calculation...|$|R
40|$|Wettability {{alteration}} of rock by surfactant {{has been considered}} as feasible method for recovery of oil reservoirs by modifying the wettability of rock surface from oil-wet to water-wet condition. The impact of surfactant can be enhanced by adding nanoparticles. Cationic surfactant performed well in carbonate rock by forming ion pairs between cationic head and acidic component of the crude. Meanwhile, nanoparticles will form <b>continuous</b> <b>wedge</b> film between the liquid and solid surface. In this paper, Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 nanoparticles were used as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) agents. The impact of these two nanoparticles on contact angle and interfacial tension was studied. Besides that, adsorption Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) surfactant on rock surface was also investigated. The results show {{a significant change in}} water-oil contact angle after application of surfactant and nanoparticles. Initial water-oil contact angle for 6 slides demonstrate oil-wet condition. Then, the slides were submerged in prepared solution for 48 hours. The result shows that, slides 2, 5 and 6 changes drastically to more water-wet condition with contact angle 56 °, 40 ° and 47 ° respectively. For surfactant adsorption, the adsorption is very fast at the beginning. The adsorption rate after 5 minutes was 50 mg/g and after 60 minutes the adsorption rate was 310 mg/g. The adsorption rate slowed down after 60 minutes and after 180 minutes the adsorption rate was 315 mg/g in which the rate of adsorption achieve equilibrium. Nanoparticles retention test and Zeta potential shows that Al 2 O 3 is more stable than ZrO 2. The results for interfacial tension (IFT) also show a significant reduction. The IFT value reduces from 8. 46 mN/m to 1. 65 mN/m and 1. 85 mN/m after the application of Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 nanofluids respectivel...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{concerned}} {{with the use of}} gravity data to study the structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath the Kenya Rift Valley. Following a review of previous geophysical studies of the Rift there are descriptions of some methods used in producing a gravity map of Kenya, including an account of the "minimum curvature" interpolation method. The techniques of Dorman and Lewis (1970) are used (a) to show that Kenya's topography is to a large extent isostatically compensated and (b) to compute the gravity effect of the compensation. The latter is explained in terms of the model of the upper mantle structure proposed by Long and Backhouse (1976). It is also used in place of the conventional "regional" in the interpretation of crustal gravity anomalies within the Rift. A seismic experiment carried out in 1975 is described and the data interpreted. This is used to control the interpretation of the gravity data. The results of this study support the idea of some crustal thinning below the Rift but not of a <b>continuous</b> <b>wedge</b> of mantle derived material intruding the crust to high levels. The seismic data imply that normal basement exists below the volcanic rocks of the Rift floor at 0. 50 N; after the effects of the volcanic and sediments have been removed from the gravity data there is a residual "axial high" which is best explained by a wide tabular body, within the basement, which could be similar in form to the elongated layered intrusions seen in ancient rocks (e. g. Rhodesian Great Dyke). It is suggested that below the Rift floor, apart from this intrusion there is normal crustal layering, perhaps intruded by feeders or small magma chambers which do not produce measurable gravity anomalies...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presented}} herein comprises of {{the work}} undertaken to research novel methods of Phased array ultrasonic inspection of complex steam turbine blade roots as found in the power generation industry. The research was conducted {{as part of the}} Engineering Doctorate scheme, administered by the Research Centre for Non-Destructive Evaluation (RCNDE), in conjunction with RWE npower and the University of Warwick. Steam turbine blades, and in particularly last stage blades of low pressure steam turbines, are amongst the most highly stressed components on a power generating plant. Two of the most common blade root fixing types include ‘curved axial entry fir tree roots’ (CAEFTR), and axial pinned roots, both of which are prone to cracking due to the high stresses to which they are subjected under operating conditions. Failure of the blade root fixings of such components, leading to the release of the blades, has historically led to the catastrophic failure and destruction of the whole turbine; the cost of collateral damage to plant components and the loss in generating income are seconded only by the risk these failures pose to life. Due to the high price of failure, NDT plays a critical part in the support and management of engineering maintenance, offering insight into the condition and integrity of turbine components through regular planned inspection regimes. It will be shown in this thesis how the invention of a novel <b>continuous</b> <b>wedge,</b> used to refract ultrasound into the critical regions of the blade roots, has significantly improved the ability to detect defects. Combined with the development of bespoke scanning frames these wedges facilitate the efficient and accurate acquisition of scanned data to assess the integrity of the component. By combining the latest reverse engineering, modelling and simulation tools with novel application of rapid prototyping, the author has been able to demonstrate significant reduction in design cycles whilst improving accuracy, sensitivity and repeatability of the applied inspections. Furthermore, application of this design philosophy has {{led to the development of}} inspection techniques which have facilitated the inspection of remote regions of the blade roots where manual access is limited or impossible. The developments and techniques invented during this research have been successfully deployed across numerous RWE npower and customer projects, leading to estimated savings in excess of £ 1 m...|$|E

Using a similarity transformation, the governing system of partial differential equations is first transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations {{in the form of}} a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) and then solved numerically using a finite difference scheme known as the Keller box method. Numerical results are obtained for the velocity profiles and the skin friction coefficient for various values of the moving parameter λ, the wedge parameter β, the reciprocal magnetic Prandtl number α and the magnetic parameter S. Results indicate that when the wedge and the fluid move in the opposite directions, multiple solutions exist up to a critical value [...]...|$|R
40|$|Continuous tone printing, either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a continuous tone original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of negative working plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive working plate can print a longer range of tones than a negative working plate. So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a negative working plate. A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple negative working plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a <b>continuous</b> tone step <b>wedge.</b> In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A <b>continuous</b> tone step <b>wedge</b> along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the step wedge were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the step wedge. These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the continuous tone effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment <b>continuous</b> tone step <b>wedge</b> as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of ink receptivity) corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a continuous tone image with a negative working plate and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the negative working plate, thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|R

40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of conventional photographic imaging systems the non-linearity of the macroscopic curve can easily {{be dealt with by}} examining the 2 ̆ 2 effective exposure 2 ̆ 2 rather than expressing the density or transmittance. Dealing with the nonlinearities on a microscopic level, however, is very difficult since they result from development adjacency effects. A tool was made using a 2 ̆ 2 V-shaped 2 ̆ 2 groove design by G. W. Schumann which consists of a series of microscopic linear density wedges. The density wedges were made by filling V-cut grooves in a high quality acrylic plastic with a carbon-epoxy dispersion. The density wedges have been produced at the frequencies of 0. 98. cy/mm and 0. 57 cy/mm. These wedges have effective diffuse density ranges between 0. 21 and 1. 18. Their density gradient has been varied from. 28 to 2. 58 density units per mm. The wedges were then tested for their practicality for use in image evaluation. It was found that the characteristic curve for a small image area with a low surrounding density is higher in contrast and shifted to a higher speed when compared to a conventionally produced curve. When the micro scale density wedges were imaged with a high surrounding density, the results were not significantly different from those obtained with the conventional step wedge. There are several drawbacks attributed to the V-groove design that are discussed. The results from the practical application tests, however, suggest that there is significant merit for the micro scale wedges for use in the study of chemical adjacency effects. The micro-scale <b>continuous</b> density <b>wedges</b> are found to present a new concept to sensitometry where the characteristic curve can be related to some of the adjacency effects encountered in specific applications...|$|R
