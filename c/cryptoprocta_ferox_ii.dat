50|$|The {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemur is preyed {{upon by the}} Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii), fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor). Nesting behavior {{poses the}} greatest risks for predation, especially mammalian predators.|$|R
5|$|Diurnal {{birds of}} prey such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) are their most {{significant}} predators. Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and the narrow-striped mongoose (Mungotictis decemlineata).|$|R
50|$|In 1833, Edward Turner Bennett {{described}} the Malagasy fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> and subordinated the Cryptoprocta to the Viverridae.A molecular and morphological analysis based on DNA/DNA hybridization experiments suggests that Cryptoprocta {{does not belong}} within Viverridae, but {{is a member of}} the Eupleridae.|$|R
50|$|Also {{seen in the}} Anjajavy Forest area is the {{endangered}} Fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> the largest mammalian carnivore in Madagascar. Other nocturnal mammals occur in the forest here, like two species of tenrecs: greater hedgehog (Setifer setosus) and (Tenrec ecaudatusalso) and the elusive Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana).|$|R
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} has both native and {{introduced}} predators. Native predators include the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the Madagascar ground boa (Boa madagascariensis). Introduced predators include the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), the domestic cat and the domestic dog.|$|R
50|$|The greater dwarf lemur is preyed {{upon by the}} ring-tailed {{mongoose}} (Galidia elegans) {{during the}} dormant season. Other predators the Malagasy tree boa (Boa manditra), the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus), and it is thought probably by the Fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> as well, since the latter preys on other lemurs.|$|R
50|$|Eupleridae is {{a family}} of carnivorans endemic to Madagascar and {{comprising}} 10 known living species in seven genera, commonly known as euplerids, or malagasy mongooses. The best known species is the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> in the subfamily Euplerinae. All species of Euplerinae were formerly classified as viverrids, while all species in the subfamily Galidiinae were classified as herpestids.|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Swiss-based environmental group WWF in 2003, using a night-time camera trap in Kayan Mentarang National Park. The mammal is {{slightly larger than}} a cat, with red fur, a long tail, and hind legs that are longer than the front legs. Its overall appearance is something between a cat and a fox. In some ways it resembles the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> of Madagascar.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the silky sifaka, Marojejy is home to 10 other species of lemur, several of which are also endangered due mainly to habitat loss. [...] The nocturnal aye-aye has only been seen once at the park, although one old nest and traces of its feeding have been found at various elevations. [...] Other mammals include at least 15species of tenrec, seven species of native rodent, the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> and the Madagascar sucker-footed bat (Myzopoda aurita) ...|$|R
50|$|Eupleridae: Primary {{among these}} {{malagasy}} carnivores is the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> {{a type of}} civet despite its feline appearance. Other Malagasy carnivores include the fanaloka (Fossa fossana), which, despite its scientific name, {{should not be confused}} with the fossa. Nor should it be confused with the very similarly named falanouc (Eupleres goudotii), also known as the Malagasy small-toothed civet. Five species of mongoose are also found in Madagascar, as is the small Indian civet, one of the carnivores believed to have been introduced to the island.|$|R
50|$|In {{this park}} are found eleven species of mammals of which ten are endemic. Among {{them are the}} Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae), the {{smallest}} primate in the world, which is only known from this park. Also the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> Madagascar's largest predator, and the lemurs only predator (apart from people). Other mammals endemic to the Menabe region include the giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena) and the narrow-striped mongoose (Mungotictis decemlineata). There are also forty-seven species of birds (thirty-three endemic) and twenty-three species of reptiles.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} this forest include the apex {{predator}} fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> the fanaloka (Fossa fossana), northern ring-tailed mongoose and numerous bat species. Lemurs occurring here include the crowned lemur, northern sportive lemur, gray mouse lemur, Sanford's brown lemur and the aye-aye. Numerous geckos inhabit the reserve including the Henkel's leaf-tailed gecko, big-headed gecko and day gecko. Other local reptiles are the Madagascar ground boa, the white-lipped chameleon (Furcifer minor) and Oustalet's chameleon, the world's largest chameleon, which can attain 68 centimetres in length.|$|R
50|$|Euplerinae, more {{commonly}} known as malagasy civets, is a subfamily of carnivorans that includes four species restricted to Madagascar. Together with the subfamily Galidiinae, which also only occurs on Madagascar, it forms the family Eupleridae. Members of this subfamily, which include the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> falanoucs (Eupleres goudotii and Eupleres major) and Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana), were placed in families like Felidae and Viverridae before genetic data indicated their consanguinity with other Madagascar carnivorans. Within the subfamily, the falanouc and Malagasy civet are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the fossa.|$|R
5000|$|IUCN {{red list}} website states that, “The {{principal}} threat to this species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture.” [...] They are also threatened by natural predators in their habitat. Some of the well-known predators are “fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> ring tailed mongoose(Galidia elegans), owls (Strigiformes), and Madagascar harrier hawk (Polyboroides radiatus)." [...] Some say that brown mouse lemurs could be influential in spreading {{the seeds of}} plants and fruits they eat. As a result of deforestation they {{are at risk of}} extinction according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).|$|R
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{sympatric}} {{with two other}} carnivores, the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> and the introduced Indian civet (Viverricula indica). However, {{there seems to be}} virtually no range or dietary overlap between these animals and Grandidier's mongoose. From sub-fossil evidence, {{it is clear that the}} region underwent drastic climatic change during the last 3000-2000 years. It is presumed that the distribution of this mongoose was notably broader and the proportion of prey types different in earlier times than today. Grandidier's mongoose must have adapted to dryer conditions, which have resulted in its very limited distribution and the exploitation of notably small prey.|$|R
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant fossa, is an extinct species of {{carnivore}} from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the mongooses and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox).</b> C.spelea is larger than the fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that {{there is more than one}} surviving species.|$|R
50|$|The Makira forests {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} expanses of humid forest left in the biologically rich eastern rainforest biome of Madagascar. Makira is estimated to contain around 50% of Madagascar’s floral biodiversity and harbors the highest lemur diversity in the country with 17 species. Particularly notable is the occurrence of 3 critical endangered lemur species, the Silky Sifaka (Propithecus candidus), the Indri (Indri Indri) and the Black and White Vari (Varecia variegata subcincta). In addition to a remarkable density of 17 lemurs species, a total of 57 mammals species have been recorded to date, including the Fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> the Falanouc (Eupleres goudotii) and 13 species of tenrecs.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{species of}} mammal have been {{recorded}} on the reserve including eight species of lemur, 48 bird species, eleven species of reptile and one amphibian. Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) was previously found at this site but has since been extirpated. Mammals found on the reserve include Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae), which is evaluated as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is the smallest species of mouse lemur; an endangered species, Pale fork-marked lemur (Phaner pallescens); red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus) also vulnerable; and the Fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> a cat-like, carnivore and also a vulnerable species.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} mainly covered by dense {{deciduous}} dry forest {{and is the}} last place for the critically endangered lemur, Perrier's sifaka (Propithecus perrieri). There are five other species of lemurs found on the reserve. Four {{have been given the}} conservation status of endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and one, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) is a vulnerable species. The four endangered species are the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), Indri (Indri indri), Diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata variegata). Two carnivores the Malagasy or striped civet (Fossa fossana) and the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> are also vulnerable species. The above mammals are all endemic to Madagascar.|$|R
5000|$|Fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> are {{the first}} {{documented}} example of cooperative hunting in solitary species, as fossa {{are some of the}} least social carnivores. [...] The fossa is the largest member of Madagascar mongooses. They are carnivorous, feeding mostly on small lemurs and tenrecs. Prey size may have been important for the evolution of cooperative hunting in fossa because one of their main sources of prey (larger lemurs) has recently gone extinct. Larger lemurs (20-120 pounds), such as giant sloth lemurs, were abundant on Madagascar until 500-1500 years ago. [...] Cooperative hunting was common to take down a prey of this size. However, since extinction was relatively recent, cooperative hunting may have persisted even after their prey size diminished.|$|R
5|$|Predation in {{the wild}} appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, {{probably}} because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs {{have been killed by}} fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor).|$|R
500|$|The fossa ( [...] or Malagasy <b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> is a cat-like, {{carnivorous}} mammal {{endemic to}} Madagascar. It {{is a member}} of the Eupleridae, a family of carnivorans closely related to the mongoose family (Herpestidae). Its classification has been controversial because its physical traits resemble those of cats, yet other traits suggest a close relationship with viverrids (most civets and their relatives). Its classification, along with that of the other Malagasy carnivores, influenced hypotheses about how many times mammalian carnivores have colonized Madagascar. With genetic studies demonstrating that the fossa and all other Malagasy carnivores are most closely related to each other (forming a clade, recognized as the family Eupleridae), carnivorans are now thought to have colonized the island once around 18 to 20 million years ago.|$|R
40|$|The removal, or absence, of predatory species {{could be}} a {{contributing}} proximate factor {{to the rise of}} primate cathemerality. But predators themselves can also be cathemeral, so cathemerality could well be an evolutionary stable strategy. From a comparative perspective, it appears that the effect of predatory species cannot provide a unitary explanation for cathemerality. Varying distributions and population densities of predators, especially raptors, may be key factors in owl monkey (Aotus) cathemerality, but temperature and lunar cycle variation have also been implicated. In Madagascar, while raptors are potential predators of lemur species, the cathemerality of Eulemur species coincides with that of the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> a major predatory threat to lemurs. Thus, lemurid cathemerality may be more parsimoniously explained as an evolutionary stable strategy...|$|R
50|$|One {{characteristic}} {{in common}} with other tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests {{is the presence of}} relatively high densities of mammalian biomass. Several of Madagascar's characteristic lemur species are found here including the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, five subspecies of Propithecus, three species of Lepilemur, and five species of Microcebus. Endemic mammals include three endangered species, golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) and Perrier's sifaka (Propithecus diadema perrieri) and western forest rat (Nesomys lambertoni) as well as mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz), golden-brown mouse lemur (Microcebus ravelobensis), northern rufous mouse lemur (M. tavaratra), pygmy mouse lemur (M. myoxinus), Milne-Edwards' sportive lemur (Lepilemur edwardsi), and greater big-footed mouse (Macrotarsomys ingens). As well as lemurs the dry forests are home to the island's largest predator, the fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> and some smaller carnivorans.|$|R

40|$|The fosa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox)</b> is {{a medium}} sized {{carnivore}} {{of the family}} Eupleridae which is endemic to the island of Madagascar. Recent publications {{have shown that the}} fosa is under significant pressure from deforestation and fragmentation, leading to its classification as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act. A trap study was conducted from 1999 to 2008 in Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar, to ascertain the health of a population and measure additional threats to its survival. Feral dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) appeared in the park in 2004 and a comparison of trap rates of the two species shows an inverse relationship between the presence of dogs and the presence of fosa. In this paper I discuss reasons for this relationship, the effect of the continued presence of dogs, and implications for the management of the park...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{research}} on Fosa <b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox</b> {{has been conducted}} in Ankarafantsika National Park since 1999, with rare sightings of the forest’s second elusive carnivore, the Western Falanouc Eupleres major. During annual carnivore live-trapping from 1999 - Present, a single Falanouc was captured on the 30 th of March 2002. Since this capture, two photographs have been taken of the Falanouc. In June 2011, a project volunteer photographed a Falanouc during the day whilst conducting trap-checks. Recently, a second photograph was recorded during the largest systematic camera-trapping study of Madagascar’s western carnivores. From April – July 2014 eighty paired camera-traps operated on average for 79 days, recording a sole image of the Western Falanouc at 01 h 18 on the 19 April 2014. Herein we discuss the morphometrics and photographic records of the Western Falanouc from Ankarafantsika National Park...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the diet of Grandidier's Vontsira Galidictis grandidieri (family Eupleridae), {{one of the}} rarest carnivorans {{in the world and}} restricted to an area of 400 km 2 in the spiny forest of south-western Madagascar. From May 2006 to May 2007, 342 G. grandidieri scats were collected in the Parc National de Tsimanampetsotsa – 256 faecal samples in the dry season and 86 in the wet season. In total, 886 prey items were identified from these scats. Invertebrates (principally large cockroaches of the genus Gromphadorhina) were the most frequently eaten prey. Even though vertebrates comprised only 8 and 17 % of prey individuals in the diet of G. grandidieri during the dry and wet seasons, they contributed 58 and 80 % of the prey biomass in each season, respectively. About 90 % of all prey consumed had body masses below 10 g. This is well below the weight of the prey consumed by <b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox,</b> the only native carnivoran occurring in sympatry with G. grandidieri, making competition for food between the two species unlikely...|$|R
500|$|In 1902, Guillaume Grandidier {{described}} subfossil carnivoran remains {{from two}} caves on Madagascar as a larger [...] "variety" [...] {{of the living}} fossa (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox),</b> C. ferox var. spelea. G. Petit, writing in 1935, considered spelea to represent a distinct species. Charles Lamberton reviewed subfossil and living Cryptoprocta in 1939 and agreed with Petit in recognizing two species, naming this species from a specimen found [...] at Ankazoabo Cave near Itampolo. The specific name spelea means [...] "cave" [...] and was given because of the location of its discovery. However, Lamberton apparently had at most three skeletons of the living fossa, not nearly enough to capture the range of variation in that species, and some later authors did not separate C.spelea and C.ferox as species. Steven Goodman and colleagues, using larger samples, compiled another set of Cryptoprocta measurements that was published in a 2004 article. They found that some subfossil Cryptoprocta fell outside the range of variation of living C.ferox, and identified those as representing C.spelea. Grandidier had not designated a type specimen for the species, and to maintain C.spelea as the name for the larger form of the fossa, Goodman and colleagues designated a specimen {{to serve as the}} type specimen (specifically, a neotype).|$|R
40|$|In {{at least}} 9 {{mammalian}} species, females are masculinized throughout life, but {{the benefits of}} this remain unclear despite decades of thorough study, in particular of the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) in which the phenomenon {{has been associated with}} a high fitness cost. Through examination of wild and captive fossas (<b>Cryptoprocta</b> <b>ferox,</b> Viverridae), androgen assays' and DNA typing for confirmation of gender, we made the first discovery of transient masculinization of a female mammal. juvenile female fossas exhibited an enlarged, spinescent clitoris supported by an os clitoridis and a pigmented secretion on the underpart fur that in adults was confined to males. These features appeared to diminish with age. The majority of adult females lacked them, and os clitoridis length was inversely related to head-body length. No evidence was found to link this masculinization to elevated female androgen levels. Circulating concentrations of testosterone and androstenedione, but not dihydrotestosterone, were significantly lower in females than in males. No significant differences in testosterone, androstenedione, or dihydrotestosterone levels were found between juvenile (masculinized) and adult (nonmasculinized) females. There are several possible physiological mechanisms for this masculinization. None of the hypotheses so far proposed to explain the evolutionary basis of female masculinization in mammals are applicable to our findings. We present 2 new hypotheses for testing and development...|$|R
