5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with <b>carboplatin,</b> gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or <b>carboplatin).</b> Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, <b>carboplatin),</b> alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|Platinum {{is used in}} {{catalytic}} converters, laboratory equipment, {{electrical contacts}} and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects. Compounds containing platinum, such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and <b>carboplatin,</b> are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and <b>carboplatin).</b> Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and <b>carboplatin.</b> and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboplatin</b> is less potent than cisplatin; {{depending}} on the strain of cancer, <b>carboplatin</b> may only be 1/8 to 1/45 as effective. The clinical standard of dosage of <b>carboplatin</b> is usually a 4:1 ratio compared to cisplatin; that is, for a dose that usually requires a particular dose of cisplatin, {{four times as much}} <b>carboplatin</b> is needed to achieve the same effectiveness. The stable property of <b>carboplatin</b> is a mixed blessing: once uptake of the drug occurs, its retention half-life is considerably longer than cisplatin, but it is also this inertness that causes <b>carboplatin</b> to go right through the human body, and up to 90% of the <b>carboplatin</b> given can be recovered in urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboplatin</b> {{has also}} been used for {{adjuvant}} therapy of stage 1 seminomatous testicular cancer. Research has indicated {{that it is not}} less effective than adjuvant radiotherapy for this treatment, while having fewer side effects. This has led to <b>carboplatin</b> based adjuvant therapy being generally preferred over adjuvant radiotherapy in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Calvert's {{formula is}} used to {{calculate}} the dose of <b>carboplatin.</b> It takes under consideration the creatinine clearance and the desired area under curve.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of <b>carboplatin</b> and etoposide, is a current topic {{of research for}} germ cell malignancies.|$|E
25|$|Relative to cisplatin, the {{greatest}} benefit of <b>carboplatin</b> is its reduced side effects, particularly {{the elimination of}} nephrotoxic effects. Nausea and vomiting are less severe and more easily controlled.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in {{ovarian cancer}} {{typically}} consists of platins, {{a group of}} platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. <b>Carboplatin</b> is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is <b>carboplatin</b> with paclitaxel. <b>Carboplatin</b> is superior to cisplatin {{in that it is}} less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboplatin</b> is used {{to treat}} a number of forms of cancer. This {{includes}} ovarian cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, brain cancer, and neuroblastoma. It {{may be used for}} some types of testicular cancer but cisplatin is generally more effective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboplatin,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Paraplatin among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used to treat}} a number of forms of cancer. This includes ovarian cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, brain cancer, and neuroblastoma. It is used by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Oncologists {{are already}} individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure. <b>Carboplatin</b> and {{busulfan}} dosing rely upon results from blood tests {{to calculate the}} optimal dose for each patient. Simple blood tests are also available for dose optimization of methotrexate, 5-FU, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.|$|E
25|$|Before 1970, {{survival}} rates from testicular cancer were low. Since {{the introduction of}} adjuvant chemotherapy, chiefly platinum-based drugs like cisplatin and <b>carboplatin,</b> the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of testicular cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in throat {{cancer is}} not {{generally}} used {{to cure the}} cancer as such. Instead, {{it is used to}} provide an inhospitable environment for metastases so that they will not establish {{in other parts of the}} body. Typical chemotherapy agents are a combination of paclitaxel and <b>carboplatin.</b> Cetuximab is also used in the treatment of throat cancer.|$|E
25|$|Side effects {{generally}} occur. Common {{side effects}} include low blood cell levels, nausea, and electrolyte problems. Other {{serious side effects}} include allergic reactions and increases future risk of another cancer. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. <b>Carboplatin</b> in the platinum-based antineoplastic family of medications and works by interfering with duplication of DNA.|$|E
25|$|All {{platinum}} based drugs, {{and particularly}} BBR3464, cause large dose limiting side-effects. For BBR3464 these are largely diarrhea, cramps and vomiting, but are {{so severe that}} the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in humans is between 0.9 to 1.1 milligrams per square metre. This is considerably lower than the MTD for all the platinum based drugs currently used in the clinic, like cisplatin (60â€“120mg) and <b>carboplatin</b> (approx. 800mg).|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboplatin</b> was {{patented}} in 1972 {{and approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 26.49 to 37.37 USD per 450mg vial. In the United Kingdom that amount costs the National Institute of Health (NIH) about 160 pounds (around 200 USD).|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and <b>carboplatin.</b> On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|The use of DMSO as an {{alternative}} treatment for cancer is of particular concern, {{as it has been}} shown to interfere with a variety of chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, <b>carboplatin,</b> and oxaliplatin. There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that DMSO has any effect, and most sources agree that its history of side effects when tested warrants caution when using it as a dietary supplement, for which it is marketed heavily with the usual disclaimer.|$|E
25|$|Although other {{combinations}} of drugs have occasionally {{been shown to}} be noninferior at various endpoints and in some subgroups of patients, the combination of cisplatin or <b>carboplatin</b> plus etoposide or irinotecan are considered comparable first-line regimens for SCLC. For patients who do not respond to first line therapy, or who relapse after complete remission, topotecan is the only agent which has been definitively shown to offer increased survival over best supportive care (BSC), although in Japan amirubicin is considered effective as salvage therapy.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, <b>carboplatin</b> and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{depends on}} the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or <b>carboplatin</b> or oxaliplatin) every three weeks with {{fluorouracil}} (5-FU) either continuously or every three weeks. In more recent studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, cisplatin and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial â€“ for example â€“ compares four regimens containing epirubicin and either cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and either continuously infused fluorouracil or capecitabine.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors {{are another}} investigational drug class {{that may have}} {{applications}} in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have {{also been shown to}} increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3â€“4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and <b>carboplatin</b> in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.|$|E
25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include <b>carboplatin</b> combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or platins.|$|E
25|$|Between 30 and 40 {{percent of}} {{patients}} undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and <b>carboplatin.</b> Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, {{is determined by the}} choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory â€“ pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity â€“ in some cases motor nerves are affected, and occasionally, also, the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin, a platinum-based compound, was {{discovered}} by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing {{to try to explain}} this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental artifact â€” the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of <b>carboplatin,</b> a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.|$|E
500|$|Cisplatin, or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) is {{the first}} of a series of square planar platinum(II)-containing {{chemotherapy}} drugs, including <b>carboplatin</b> and oxaliplatin. These compounds are capable of crosslinking DNA, and kill cells by similar pathways to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. (Side effects of cisplatin include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, tinnitus, hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} its structure, <b>carboplatin</b> differs from {{cisplatin}} in {{that it has a}} bidentate dicarboxylate (the ligand is CycloButane DiCarboxylic Acid, CBDCA) in place of the two chloride ligand, which are the leaving groups in cisplatin. For this reason, [...] "CBDCA" [...] is sometimes used in the medical literature as an abbreviation referring to <b>carboplatin.</b> <b>Carboplatin</b> exhibits lower reactivity and slower DNA binding kinetics, although it forms the same reaction products in vitro at equivalent doses with cisplatin. Unlike cisplatin, <b>carboplatin</b> may be susceptible to alternative mechanisms. Some results show that cisplatin and <b>carboplatin</b> cause different morphological changes in MCF-7 cell lines while exerting their cytotoxic behaviour. [...] The diminished reactivity limits protein-carboplatin complexes, which are excreted. The lower excretion rate of <b>carboplatin</b> means that more is retained in the body, and hence its effects are longer lasting (a retention half-life of 30 hours for <b>carboplatin,</b> compared to 1.5-3.6 hours in the case of cisplatin).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Carboplatin</b> was {{discovered}} at Michigan State University, [...] and {{developed at the}} Institute of Cancer Research in London. Bristol-Myers Squibb gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for <b>carboplatin,</b> under the brand name Paraplatin, in March 1989. Starting in October 2004, generic versions of the drug became available.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{theories}} {{exist to}} explain the molecular mechanism of action of <b>carboplatin</b> with DNA: ...|$|E
2500|$|As an {{adjuvant}} treatment, use {{of chemotherapy}} {{as an alternative}} to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, internal scarring, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc.). [...] Two doses, or occasionally a single dose of <b>carboplatin,</b> typically delivered three weeks apart, is proving to be a successful adjuvant treatment, with recurrence rates in the same ranges as those of radiotherapy. The concept of <b>carboplatin</b> as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. However, very long-term data on the efficacy of adjuvant <b>carboplatin</b> in this setting do not exist.|$|E
2500|$|Triplatin tetranitrate (rINN; {{also known}} as BBR3464) is a platinum-based {{cytotoxic}} drug that underwent clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} human cancer. The drug acts by forming adducts with cellular DNA, preventing DNA transcription and replication, thereby inducing apoptosis. [...] Other platinum-containing anticancer drugs include cisplatin, <b>carboplatin,</b> and oxaliplatin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{preferred}} {{treatment for}} most forms of stage 1 seminoma is active surveillance. [...] Stage 1 seminoma {{is characterized by}} the absence of clinical evidence of metastasis. [...] Active surveillance consists of periodic history and physical examinations, tumor marker analysis, and radiographic imaging. [...] Around 85-95% of these cases will require no further treatment. [...] Modern radiotherapy techniques as well as one or two cycles of single-agent <b>carboplatin</b> have been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} relapse, but carry the potential of causing delayed side effects. [...] Regardless of treatment strategy, stage 1 seminoma has nearly a 100% cure rate.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{drawback}} of <b>carboplatin</b> is its myelosuppressive effect. This {{causes the}} blood cell and platelet output of bone marrow {{in the body}} to decrease quite dramatically, sometimes as low as 10% of its usual production levels. [...] The nadir of this myelosuppression usually occurs 21â€“28 days after the first treatment, after which the blood cell and platelet levels in the blood begin to stabilize, often coming close to its pre-carboplatin levels. This decrease in white blood cells (neutropenia) can cause complications, and is sometimes treated with drugs like filgrastim. The most notable complication of neutropenia is increased probability of infection by opportunistic organisms, which necessitates hospital readmission and treatment with antibiotics.|$|E
