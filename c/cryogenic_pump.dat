40|$|Severe {{deterioration}} of concrete joints has developed {{at a rapid}} rate for several Michigan highway projects. This deterioration {{was found to be}} linked to deicer salt applications during the winter season. Surface scaling was found to be associated with frost {{deterioration of}} the portland cement mortar from exposure to a salt solution on the surface during a freeze-thaw cycle. These concretes were found to have inadequate entrained air content in the Portland cement paste. The driving force responsible for developing surface scaling can be explained by means of an existing theory known as the Cryogenic Suction Pump. This mechanism is thermodynamic-based. For pure surface water the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pump</b> is limited to capillary pore-suction, as the surface liquid freezes instantly. When deicing chemicals are present on the surface the salt solution mixture remains unfrozen and thus increases the suction pump effect. Entrained air was found to be the major factor in mitigating the cryogenic suction pump. <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>pump</b> expansion is reduced with increasing entrained air content as air decreases pore-filling and creates capillary discontinuity, which inhibits suction. This study is a first to identify a link between surface scaling due to pure water and salt-water (i. e. 3 % sodium chloride concentration). Also, a link between surface scaling and the Interfacial Transit Zone (ITZ) which is a localized zone around the aggregate consisting of higher porosity was found. Due to the larger pore-size and high porosity damage from <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pump</b> initiates in this region. Scaling is localized and propagates with depth and width. Substantial improvement is surface scaling resistance was achieved by eliminating the weak-ITZ by means of pozzolanic reactions between the Portland cement paste and GGBFS. The pozzolanic reactions further reduced capillary sorptivity (i. e. rate of capillary suction versus square root of time) as seen from water sorption results and thus reduces the rate of transport by <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|E

40|$|Several {{modifications}} {{have been}} made to the design and operation of an extended-shaft <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pump</b> to increase the efficiency of pumping. In general, the efficiency of pumping a cryogenic fluid is limited by thermal losses which is itself caused by pump inefficiency and leakage of heat through the pump structure. A typical <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pump</b> includes a drive shaft and two main concentric static components (an outer pressure containment tube and an intermediate static support tube) made from stainless steel. The modifications made include replacement of the stainless-steel drive shaft and the concentric static stainless-steel components with components made of a glass/epoxy composite. The leakage of heat is thus reduced because the thermal conductivity of the composite is an order of magnitude below that of stainless steel. Taking advantage of the margin afforded by the decrease in thermal conductivity, the drive shaft could be shortened to increase its effective stiffness, thereby increasing the rotordynamic critical speeds, thereby further making it possible to operate the pump at a higher speed to increase pumping efficiency. During the modification effort, an analysis revealed that substitution of the shorter glass/epoxy shaft for the longer stainless-steel shaft was not, by itself, sufficient to satisfy the rotordynamic requirements at the desired increased speed. Hence, it became necessary to increase the stiffness of the composite shaft. This stiffening was accomplished by means of a carbon-fiber-composite overwrap along most of the length of the shaft. Concomitantly with the modifications described thus far, it was necessary to provide for joining the composite-material components with metallic components required by different aspects of the pump design. An adhesive material formulated specially to bond the composite and metal components was chosen as a means to satisfy these requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} the ITER-FEAT vacuum pumping and {{fuelling}} systems is supported by two key R&D programs, the first directed towards {{the development of a}} steady state tritium compatible pellet injector, and the second towards the development of a supercritical helium cooled <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pump</b> for torus exhaust. While the pellet injector programme for ITER-FEAT is new, that for the cryopump has evolved from a programme that originally supported the 1998 ITER design. As the plasma exhaust parameters have remained essentially unchanged between these two machines, the R&D conducted to date remains valid.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some recent}} progress on {{internal and external}} free molecular flows. The {{first part of this}} paper concentrates on steady collisionless gas flows inside arbitrary en-closures, which are either convex or concave, two-dimensional or three-dimensional, formed by several plates maintained at different temperatures. If the molecular reflections on these plates are completely diffuse, then at the final steady flow stage for any point inside the enclosures, the velocity distribution function (VDF) is completely determined, and macro-scopic properties such as density, velocities, temperature and heat flux can be exactly determined by integrating the VDF with different moments. The result from this study leads to many exact solutions for internal collisionless gas flow and thermal fields, such as those inside vacuum packaged Micro-/Nano- Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS/NEMS) devices.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents {{the design of a}} condition monitoring scheme for the neutral beam <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pumping</b> system deployed in the Joint European Torus. The performance of the scheme is demonstrated by analysing its response to a range of fault scenarios. Condition monitoring has been successfully used in a diverse range of industries, from rail transport, to commercial power generation, to semiconductor manufacturing, among others. The application of model based condition monitoring to fusion applications has, however, been very limited. Given the importance of improving the availability of fusion devices, it was hypothesised that model based condition monitoring techniques could be used to good effect for this application. This provided the motivation for this research, which had the ultimate objective of demonstrating the usefulness of model based condition monitoring for fusion devices. The <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pumping</b> system used in the neutral beam heating devices operated by the project sponsor, the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, was selected as the target for a demonstration condition monitoring scheme. This choice of target system was made and justified by the author through an analysis of its role in the neutral beam devices. The relative merits of several model based approaches were investigated. An observer based residual generation scheme, utilising a Kalman filter bank and residual thresholding arrangement was determined to be most suitable. A novel, accurate non-linear simulation model of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>pumping</b> system was developed to act as a surrogate plant during the research, to facilitate the design and test procedure. This model was validated using historical process data. Two system identification techniques were used to obtain a set of linear models of the system for use in the Kalman filter bank. The scheme was tested by using the non-linear model to simulate ten different faults, all with unique failure modes. Two residual thresholding arrangements were tested and their performance was analysed to find the arrangement with the best performance. It was found that both variations of the scheme could detect all ten faults. The scheme using dual thresholds to check both the direction and magnitude of the residual signals was, however, better at isolating specific faults. The non-linear simulation model developed during the research was proven to be a genuine representation of the plant, by validating its response using historical process data. As such, it could be used in the future as the basis for a model based control system design procedure. The effectiveness of the scheme at detecting a range of faults which can arise in neutral beam heating systems supports the case for the future use of model based condition monitoring in nuclear fusion research...|$|R
