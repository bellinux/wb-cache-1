The solubility diagram and tie-line data were determined at 298 ± 0. 20 K and atmospheric pressure, using various compositions of mixed solvent. Reliability of the data was ascertained by making Othmer-Tobias and Hand plots...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} liquid-liquid equilibrium data on propionic acid-water-solvent ternary mixtures at {{a temperature}} of 298. 15 K are presented. The solvents are n-hexane, cyclohexane, cyclohexanol and <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> The distribution coefficients and separation factors are reported.

40|$|The heat {{capacities}} between T = (5 and 320) К and the enthalpies {{of phase}} transitions of cyclohexyl formate, acetate, butyrate, and valerate in the condensed state {{were determined by}} adiabatic calorimetry. All the substances were found to form glasses. <b>Cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> had a solid-to-solid transition. The configurational entropies of the investigated substances in the liquid state were considered according to Adam-Gibbs theory. The enthalpies of hole formation in liquid esters were estimated from the temperature dependences of their densities.

40|$|The lipase catalyzed kinetic {{resolution}} of three trans- 1 -(2 -hydroxycyclohexyl) -indoles in both batch and continuous flow systems is reported. Ring opening of cyclohexene oxide by the corresponding indole followed by enzymatic acylation with vinyl acetate resulted in novel, highly enantioenriched indole-substituted cyclohexanols and <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetates.</b> The {{effect of the}} temperature on enantiomeric ratio (E) and productivity (specific reaction rate, rflow) in the continuous-flow mode acylation was studied at analytical scale in the 0 – 70 °C range. Preparative scale kinetic {{resolution of}} the three indole derivatives was performed in mixed continuous- and recirculation-flow mode resulting in almost complete conversion and good to excellent enantiomeric purity of the products...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was performed in}} the enzymic resolution of the isomers of 2 -(4 -methoxybenzyl) <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetates</b> 1 and 2. The investigation consisted in application of three commercially available lipases (Novozyme 435, Lipozyme IM and non-immobilized powdered lipase from Candida antarctica), two ionic liquids (1 -butyl- 4 -methylpyridinium chloride and 1, 3 -dimethylimidazolinium methyl sulfate), three modifications of the reaction conditions and two respective isomers of the racemic substrate (1 and 2), and resulted in our finding the appropriate conditions to get both of the products, stereoisomers of 2 -(4 -methoxybenzyl) cyclohexanol (3; 1 S, 2 S) or (5; 1 S, 2 R), and (in some cases) also the stereoisomers of the deracemized substrate (4; 1 R, 2 R) or (6; 1 R, 2 S) with high or acceptable enantiomeric purity.

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{substrate}} scope of bis(imino) pyridine iron-catalyzed hydrogenation and [2 pi + 2 pi]. diene cyclization reactions identified C-O bond cleavage {{as a principal}} deactivation pathway. Addition of diallyl or allyl ethyl ether to the bis(imino) pyridine iron dinitrogen complex, ((iPr) PDI) Fe(N(2)) (2) ((iPr) PDI = 2, 6 -(2, 6 -(i) Pr-C(6) H(3) N=CMe) (2) C(5) H(3) N, 1 -(N(2)) (2)), under a dinitrogen atmosphere resulted in facile cleavage of the C-O bond and yielded a mixture of the corresponding paramagnetic iron allyl and alkoxide complexes. For ethyl vinyl ether, clean and selective formation of the iron ethoxide was observed with concomitant loss of the vinyl fragment. In situ monitoring of the catalytic hydrogenation of trans-methyl cinnamate established ester C-O bond cleavage as a competing process. Stoichiometric reactions between 1 -(N(2)) (2) and allyl and vinyl acetate also produced facile C-O oxidative addition. For the latter, a six coordinate diamagnetic bis(imino) pyridine acetatoxy iron vinyl compound was obtained and characterized by X-ray diffraction. Phenyl acetate undergoes exclusive acyl C-O bond cleavage, while alkyl-substituted esters such as ethyl, pentyl, benzyl, isopropyl, <b>cyclohexyl,</b> and tert-butyl <b>acetate</b> undergo competing ester and acyl C-O bond cleavage accompanied by iron-promoted decarbonylation. Deuterium labeling studies established that reversible C-H activation and chelate cyclometalation Occur prior to, but are not a prerequisite for, carbon-oxygen bond oxidative addition of ethyl acetate. The molecular and electronic structures of the ether and ester C-O bond cleavage products have been established and demonstrate that ligand- rather than metal-based oxidation accompanies substrate activation...|$|R
40|$|A carbon solid acid {{with large}} surface area (CSALA) was {{prepared}} by partial carbonization of H 3 PO 4 pre-treated peanut shells followed by sulfonation with concentrated H 2 SO 4. The structure and acidity of CSALA were characterized by N 2 adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), 13 C cross polarization (CP) /magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), titration, and elemental analysis. The results demonstrated that the CSALA was an amorphous carbon material with a surface area of 387. 4 m 2 /g. SO 3 H groups formed on the surface with a density of 0. 46 mmol/g, with 1. 11 mmol/g of COOH and 0. 39 mmol/g of phenolic OH. Densities of the latter two groups were notably greater than those observed on a carbon solid acid (CSA) with a surface area of 10. 1 m 2 /g. The CSALA catalyst showed better performance than the CSA for the hydrolysis of <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to cyclohexanol. Under optimal reaction conditions, <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> conversion was 86. 6 % with 97. 3 % selectivity for cyclohexanol, while the results were 25. 0 % and 99. 4 %, respectively, catalyzed by CSA. The high activity of the CSALA {{could be attributed to}} its high density of COOH and {{large surface area}}. Moreover, the CSALA showed good reusability. Its catalytic activity decreased slightly during the first two cycles due to the leaching of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-containing SO 3 H groups, and then remained constant during following uses...|$|E
40|$|Vanadium {{substituted}} hexagonal mesoporous aluminophosphate (VHMA) {{molecular sieves}} were synthesized hydrothermally. Various physicochemical studies, viz., XRD, TEM, DRUV - VIS, EPR, N- 2 sorption {{were used to}} find the location of vanadium ions in the VHMA matrix and to check the mesoporosity of the sample. The catalytic activity of VHMA was evaluated, under mild reaction conditions, for the oxidation of cyclohexane reaction, which mainly gave cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone along with a very small amount of a secondary product, viz., <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> A comparative study, with other vanadium containing molecular sieves, viz., VMCM- 41, VAPO- 5 and VS- 1, on the application of VHMA catalyst reveal that the latter exhibits excellent activity, selectivity and stability to leaching for the oxidation reaction of cycloalkanes, including bulkier molecules such as cyclododecane...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the removal}} of glycolic acid from aqueous {{solutions}} by using reactive extraction with different organic solvents and tripropylamine mixtures was investigated. In experimental studies, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), 1 -decanol, toluene, <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (CHA), DMP and an ionic liquid, namely 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (IL), were chosen as the diluent solvent in the organic phase. In recent chemistry researches, IL compounds {{have come to the}} foreground due to their superior properties and environmentally friendly chemical structures and they are being used intensively. For this reason, it is particularly aimed to compare the efficiency of the IL compound with other solvents. In addition to the solvent effect, the amine concentration used was changed to determine the effect on extraction yield. Using the obtained data, the most important parameters for the design of reactive extraction processes were calculated: Distribution coefficient (D), loading factor (Z), and the percentage of extraction efficiency (E%). The maximum removal of glycolic acid has been achieved as 99. 76 % with IL and 1. 75 mol L- 1 initial amine concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of lipases from porcine pancreas, Candida antartica recombinant from Aspergillus oryzae, Candida cylindracea (immobilized), Penicilium roqueforti, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus arrhizus, Mucor miehei (two types of immobilization), and Pseudomonas cepacia (two types of immobilization) was studied after {{using them as}} biocatalysts of blackcurrant oil hydrolysis under SC-CO 2 conditions. The reaction was performed at 40 °C and 15 MPa in a continuous-flow reactor. Increased relative {{activity of}} all used lipases after the hydrolytic reaction was observed. The most remarkable increase in the activity was noted for the lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus which was {{increased by more than}} 50 times. The highest activity was shown by Lipozyme®, lipase from Mucor miehei, immobilized on macroporous resin. Both treated and untreated Lipozyme® were used as biocatalysts in hydrolytic resolution of the racemic cis- or frani-isomers of 2 -(4 -methoxybenzyl) cyclIohexyl acetates. Satisfactory reaction yields (40 %) and excellent enantiomeric purity of the products (E = 472) were obtained when hydrolysis of the frans-isomer of 2 -(4 -methoxybenzyl) <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> was catalyzed by Lipozyme® treated with SC-CO 2. © 2008 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen...|$|E
40|$|The cyclohexanone-containing {{fullerene}} mono-adduct, abbreviated as CHOC 60, was efficiently prepared through single-step Diels-Alder reaction with 2 -(trimethylsilyloxy) - 1, 3 -butadiene and fullerenes. After {{reduction and}} esterification, CHOC 60 was further converted into <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> functional fullerene mono-adduct, named as CHAC(60), which showed excellent solubility in common organic solvents. P 3 HT-based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated through a typical structure of ITO/ PEDOT:PSS/P 3 HT:(CHOC 60 or CHAC(60)) /Ca/Al. The composite ratios of P 3 HT and the fullerene derivatives were modified such as 1 : 0. 5, 1 : 1 and 1 : 1. 5 (w/w). The devices fabricated using CHOC 60 or CHAC(60) as acceptors achieved the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 2. 97 % and 3. 15 %, respectively, which exhibited comparative photovoltaic performances with commercial PC 61 BM. Moreover, CHOC 60 -based devices significantly reduced the manufacturing cost by the simplified synthesis of CHOC 60 with high yield and low fullerene consumption. The non-aromatic side chain radical CHOC 60 and CHAC(60) provide {{a new idea}} {{for the design of}} fullerene derivative acceptors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{magnetic}} and monodisperse microspheres {{were prepared}} for use in microfluidic immunomagnetic cell sorting, with a specific application to the capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Multi-step swelling polymerization method {{in the presence of}} <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> porogen was used for preparation of monodisperse (4 µm) macroporous poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co- 2 -[(methoxycarbonyl) methoxy]ethyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) microspheres. After their hydrolysis and ammonolysis, carboxyl and amino groups were introduced in the microspheres. Iron oxide was then precipitated in the microspheres to render them magnetic. Repeated precipitation made possible to raise the iron oxide content to more than 30 wt. %. The microspheres were characterized by electron microscopy, atomic absorption and IR spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), To minimize non-specific adsorption of the microspheres in a microchannel, and of cells on the microspheres, they were coated with albumin crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. Antibodies of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM) were then immobilized on the albumin-coated magnetic microspheres using the carbodiimide method. Capture of MCF 7 cells as a model of CTCs by the microspheres with immobilized antiEpCAM IgG was performed in a batch experiment. Finally, MCF 7 cells were captured by the anti-EpCAM-immobilized albumin-coated magnetic microspheres in an Ephesia chip. A very good rejection of lymphocytes was achieved. Thus, the feasibility of capturing of circulating tumor cells by albumin-coated monodisperse magnetic poly(glycidyl methacrylate) microspheres with immobilized anti-EpCAM in a microfluidic device was confirmed...|$|E
