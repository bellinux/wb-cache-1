40|$|The {{strength}} of thin shells, under external pressure, is highly dependent {{by the nature}} of imperfection. This paper investigates buckling behaviour of imperfect thin cylindrical shells with analytical, numerical, and experimental methods in conditions for which, at present, a complete theoretical analysis was not found in literature. In general, collapse is initiated by yielding, but interaction with geometrical instabilities is meaningful, in that imperfections reduce the load bearing capacity by an amount of engineering significance also when thickness is considerable. The aim {{of this study was to}} conduct experiments that are representative of buckling, in the context of NPP applications as, for instance, the IRIS (international reactor innovative and secure) and LWR steam generator (SG) tubes. At Pisa University, a research activity is being carried out on the buckling of thin walled metal specimen, with a test equipment (and the necessary data acquisition facility) as well as numerical models were set up by means FEM code. The experiments were conducted on A- 316 test specimens, tubes with and <b>without</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welding.</b> The numerical and experimental results comparison highlighted the influence of different types of imperfections on the buckling loads with a good agreement between the finite-element predictions and the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper investigates {{buckling}} behaviour of imperfect thin {{cylindrical shell}} with analytical andexperimental assessment methods, {{in the context}} of NPP applications as, for instance, the IRIS LWR integratedSteam Generator (SG) tubes. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, thin shell, homogeneous and isotropic material, also tubegeometric imperfections as eccentricity/ovality/welding are assumed to investigate the effects of latter on thelimit pressure load in conditions for which, at present, a complete theoretical analysis was not found in literature. At Pisa University a research activity is being carried out on the buckling of thin walled metal specimen, with atest equipment (and the necessary data acquisition facility), suitable for carrying out test series on this issue, aswell as numerical models implemented on the MARC FEM code, were set up. Findings: The experiments were conducted on test specimens of the same material (AISI 316) tube withand <b>without</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welding.</b> The comparison between numerical and experimental results, for the samegeometry and loading conditions, shows a good agreement between the elastic-plastic finite-element predictionsand the experimental data. Research limitations/implications: The presented research results may be considered preliminary in thesense that it would be important to enlarge the statistical base of the results themselves, even if they are yetcertainly meaningful to highlight the real problem, considering the relatively large variability of the geometricalimperfections also in high quality production tubes. Originality/value: From {{the point of view of}} the practical implication, besides the addressed problem generalinterest in industrial plant technology, it is worth to stress that straight and curved axis tubes are foreseenspecifically in innovative nuclear reactors SG desig...|$|R

40|$|In porthole-die extrusion, {{the metal}} {{flowing through the}} die has to split up around the webs and then rejoin {{creating}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welds</b> that extend along the whole profile. The formation and quality of these welds depend on the metal flow around the webs {{and a number of}} process parameters such as the thermal and mechanical history stored in the material in the welding area and the temperature and pressure in the welding chamber. The paper presents a new laboratory test principle based on physical-simulation experiments on real materials that proves to be particularly suitable for investigating and modelling <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welds</b> in hot extrusion. In the test, the conditions governing the formation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welds</b> in the real industrial process are accurately reproduced and the process parameters affecting the quality of the welds can be individually controlled as well.

The effect of the <b>longitudinal</b> support <b>welded</b> on a 6 inch bore diameter pipe for guided wave propagation is investigated by both simulative and experimental method. Experimentally, the amplitude of the reflected signals from the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welded</b> support is so large that the signal reflected from the features after the support would be distorted. This phenomenon is also observed when the finite element simulation is adopted. Not only the signal peak lagged behind the actual position of the support but also the enduring signal of the welded support covered up the signal of the defect beyond the support. The echoes from the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welded</b> support were simulated and mode conversion was discussed. Moreover, the received signals are separated into single-mode waveforms with a mode extraction technique. A good agreement was found between FEM results and experimental results. 1...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{developed}} optical inspection tools provide {{images from}} the inside of natural gas pipelines to monitor pipeline integrity. The vast amounts of data generated prohibits human inspection of the resulting images. We designed an image processing and classification method to identify abnormal events. Non-overlapping image blocks are classified into twelve categories: normal, black line, grinder marks, magnetic flux leakage inspector marks, single dots, small black corrosion dots, osmosis blisters, corrosion dots, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>weld,</b> field joint, cavity at a <b>weld</b> and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>weld</b> too close to field joints. Results compare different types of statistical classifiers. Features extracted from the pipeline image are designed to mimic the features humans use to identify the different classes.

Classification results show this to be a useful tool for pipeline monitoring. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{repair and}} hot-tapping of {{pipelines}} in the field, often so-called repair sleeves or split-tees are used. These consist of two semi-circular pipe segments, {{joined by two}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welds</b> and attached to the pipe by two circumferential fillet welds. Whereas the Time of Flight Diffraction (ToFD) method is successfully applied for inspection of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>welds,</b> NDE possibilities for the circumferential fillet welds are limited. Radiography is not an option, a. o. because of the thickness variations. The weld’s complex, varying geometry prevents a reliable volumetric ultrasonic inspection. N. V. Nederlandse Gasunie and Röntgen Technische Dienst bv in The Netherlands are conducting a modeling study in order to optimize parameters for inspection by ultrasonic phased arrays and ToFD. The {{ultimate goal is to}} achieve a level of NDE reliability for these welds that is comparable to that of circumferential butt welds. The presentation will highlight some results and provide an outlook on the implications of split-tee fillet welding and NDE. Introduction: In The Netherlands, manual ultrasonic examination of circumferential fillet welds of assemblies used for repairs and hot-taps on gas transport pipelines became mandatory early 2003. This decision was related to failure of a split-tee fillet weld in November 2002. Before 2003, the examination requirement of these fillet weld...|$|R
