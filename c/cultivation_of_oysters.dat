40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the growth of the}} mangrove oyster Crassostrea gasar cultured in marine and estuarine environments. Oysters were cultured for 11 months in a longline system in two study sites - São Francisco do Sul and Florianópolis -, in the state of Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil. Water chlorophyll-&# 945; concentration, temperature, and salinity were measured weekly. The oysters were measured monthly (shell size and weight gain) to assess growth. At the end of the culture period, the average wet flesh weight, dry flesh weight, and shell weight were determined, as well as the distribution of oysters per size class. Six nonlinear models (logistic, exponential, Gompertz, Brody, Richards, and Von Bertalanffy) were adjusted to the oyster growth data set. Final mean shell sizes were higher in São Francisco do Sul than in Florianópolis. In addition, oysters cultured in São Francisco do Sul were more uniformly distributed in the four size classes than those cultured in Florianópolis. The highest average values of wet flesh weight and shell weight were observed in São Francisco do Sul, whereas dry flesh weight did not differ between the sites.

40|$|Background: Oysters impart {{significant}} socio-ecological {{benefits from}} primary production of food supply, to estuarine ecosystems via reduction of water column nutrients, plankton and seston biomass. Little though is {{known at the}} molecular level of what genes are responsible for how oysters reproduce, filter nutrients, survive stressful physiological events and form reef communities. Neuropeptides represent a diverse class of chemical messengers, instrumental in orchestrating these complex physiological events in other species. Results By a combination of in silico data mining and peptide analysis of ganglia, 74 putative neuropeptide genes were identified from genome and transcriptome databases of the Akoya pearl oyster, Pinctata fucata and the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, encoding precursors for over 300 predicted bioactive peptide products, including three newly identified neuropeptide precursors PFGx 8 amide, RxIamide and Wx 3 Yamide. Our findings also include a gene for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and two egg-laying hormones (ELH) which were identified from both oysters. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis supports similar global organization of these mature peptides. Computer-based peptide modeling of the molecular tertiary structures of ELH highlights the structural homologies within ELH family, which may facilitate ELH activity leading to the release of gametes. Conclusion Our analysis demonstrates that oysters possess conserved molluscan neuropeptide domains and overall precursor organization whilst highlighting many previously unrecognized bivalve idiosyncrasies. This genomic analysis provides a solid foundation from which further studies aimed at the functional characterization of these molluscan neuropeptides can be conducted to further stimulate advances in understanding the ecology and <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>oysters...</b>|$|E

40|$|Shelf <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> {{mushrooms}} is {{a unique}} Korean production method. This method was adapted by Korean scientists in the early 1980 ’s from button mushroom (Agaricus bisporous) growing on shelves. Button mushroom cultivation can be summarized as follows: Phase I (outdoor fermentation), Phase II (pasteurization and conditioning), Phase III (spawning and incubation), fruiting, harvesting and emptying. The unique characteristics <b>of</b> shelf <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> mushroom in Korea include {{the fact that the}} substrate is fermented in three steps (pre-fermentation, pasteurization, and post-fermentation) rather than on the shelf itself. Unlike the pasteurization process that lasts for 2 - 6 hours in most countries, shelf cultivation requires the substrate materials to be pre-fermented outdoors for 2 - 3 days, then pasteurized at 60 - 65 ℃ for 8 - 10 hours, and finally post-fermented at 45 - 55 ℃ for 3 - 4 days. This process requires considerable time and generates significant expenses. In Korea, the main methods <b>of</b> <b>oyster</b> mushroom growing are shelf cultivation, bag cultivation and bottle cultivation. Korean oyster mushroom growers ferment the substrate materials in shelf cultivation while they sterilize substrate materials in the cases of bag and bottle cultivation. Button mushroom (A. bisporus) is a secondary decomposer requiring the previous degradation of substrates by bacteria or other fungi {{in order to be able}} to absorb nutrients from the substrate.
