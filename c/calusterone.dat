50|$|<b>Calusterone</b> (INN, USAN) (brand names Methosarb, Riedemil; former {{developmental}} code names NSC-88536, U-22550), {{also known}} as 7β,17α-dimethyltestosterone, is an orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that is used as an antineoplastic agent. It is a 17α-alkylated AAS similar in structure to bolasterone (which is its 7α-isomer).|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone (1) {{appears to}} be used to make mibolerone. For comparison, also see {{bolasterone}} and <b>calusterone.</b> The first step involves extending the conjugation of the enone function by an additional double bond. Chloranil (tetrachloroquinone) is the forerunner of dichlorodicyanoquinone (DDQ), a reagent used extensively for introducing additional unsaturation in the progestin and corticoid series.|$|E
50|$|Bolasterone (INN, USAN) (brand names Myagen, Methosarb; former {{developmental}} code names NSC-66233; U-19763), {{also known}} as 7α,17α-dimethyltestosterone, is a 17α-alkylated anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) that is used in veterinary medicine. It has close structural similarity to testosterone, and like methyltestosterone has a methyl group at C17α {{in order to increase}} oral bioavailability. In addition, it is also 7α-methylated, similar to its 7β-methylated isomer <b>calusterone.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>calusterone</b> (7 beta, 17 alpha-dimethyltestosterone) on rat mammary DMBA-induced {{adenocarcinoma}} was studied both in vivo and in organ culture. In vivo all 8 tumours with {{a diameter of}} less than 30 mm regressed following <b>calusterone</b> injection (10 mg/day for 2 - 3 weeks). In organ culture <b>calusterone</b> (20 mug/ml medium) inhibited the synthesis of DNA and RNA in all 7 cases examined. Testosterone also inhibited the synthesis of DNA and RNA in organ culture in 12 out of 14 and 10 out of 14 tumours respectively. Oestradiol- 17 beta {{on the other hand}} had no effect on DNA and RNA synthesis in organ culture although 70 % of the tumours examined were ovarian dependent, i. e. regressed following castration. This could be explained by the direct effect of <b>calusterone</b> on rat adenocarcinoma compared with the indirect effect of oestradiol- 17 beta which probably exerts its action by activating the secretion of prolactin which acts on the tumour...|$|E
40|$|Androgens are {{effective}} therapeutic agents in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. Early studies with testosterone propionate showed objective regression rates of {{slightly more than}} 20 %. Subsequent work with synthetic androgens has failed to show {{a significant reduction in}} toxicity or an increase in therapeutic efficacy over testosterone propionate. <b>Calusterone</b> (7) 3, 17 a-dimethyltestosterone), in early clinical trials, showed both of these qualities and was believed by some to be the "ideal androgen. " As with many new drugs, subsequent work failed to confirm these early findings, and most of the later data gathered on <b>calusterone</b> are inconsistent. We conclude from our knowledge at present that <b>calusterone</b> offers no real advantages or disadvantages over other androgens in the treatment of breast cancer...|$|E
