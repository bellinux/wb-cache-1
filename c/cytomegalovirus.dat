With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and <b>cytomegalovirus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{thirds of}} people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} have experienced an infection {{before the onset of}} the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, the exact nature of the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by Campylobacter jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only very few people with Campylobacter or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively). The strain of Campylobacter involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.|$|E

40|$|This {{discussion}} {{focuses on}} the dynamic nature of three chronic congenital infections of man, namely those caused by <b>cytomegaloviruses,</b> rubella virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. The spectra of the fetal infection are described and {{the risks associated with}} the acute and chronic phases of the fetal infections are contrasted. Because of their frequency and subtlety, emphasis is placed on the late-appearing sequelae which are associated with the persistent and/or recurring aspects of these infections. The risks of congenitally acquired infections will be discussed here in terms of the nature of disease in the fetus, infant, and child caused by <b>cytomegaloviruses</b> (CMV), rubella virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Although these organisms have relatively low pathogenicity, even for the human conceptus, they can produce acute, multi-organ system disease in the fetus. More commonly, however, the intrauterine infection is subclinical but with a variable tendency to produce subtle, late-appearing defects in association with persistent and/or recurring infections long after delivery. Because of their frequency, the subclinical infections are equally as important from a public health standpoint as the clinically apparent ones...|$|R

5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, <b>cytomegalovirus,</b> coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. <b>Cytomegalovirus</b> protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E

Here, we compare the processing of a protective and a nonprotective epitope derived from the same viral protein, the antiapoptotic protein M 45 in the murine model.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{intracellular}} replication, <b>cytomegaloviruses</b> need to inhibit the induction of apoptosis in infected cells until progeny viruses are produced. Apoptosis {{is an important}} part of the innate immune system and can be induced by multiple stimuli. Since various path-ways converge at mitochondria, these organelles are of major importance for apoptosis. The balance of antiapoptotic (Bcl- 2, Bcl-xL) and proapoptotic (Bak, Bax) Bcl- 2 family proteins decides between death and survival of the cell. Many viruses express Bcl- 2 homologues to inhibit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via Bax and Bak. However, murine and rat cy-tomegaloviruses do not express such proteins. Instead they code for a Bax-specific inhibitor of apoptosis, which has been named vMIA Previous studies identified an antiapoptotoc function of the m 41 gene region because the deletion of this gene lead to apoptosis of infected cells. The aim of this work was to iden-tify the mechanism of apoptosis inhibition used by the responsible proteins and to find out whether additional viral proteins are needed for this function. This study shows that the m 41 locus codes for two separate proteins. The larger m 41 protein has a molecular weight of ap-proximately 20 kDa and localises to the Golgi. The smaller 10 kDa m 41. 1 protein is encoded within the m 41 gene using a different reading frame and localises to mitochondria. By con-structing virus mutants expressing only one of the two proteins it could be shown that m 41 is of minor importance in the settings used. The only phenotype observed by a virus missing the m 41 protein was a reduced viability of infected macrophages. Instead the mitochondrial local-ised m 41. 1 is of major importance. It could be demonstrated that m 41. 1 inhibits the oligomer-isation of activated Bak thereby inhibiting the onset of apoptosis. Furthermore, the antiappop-totic function of m 41. 1 is Bak-dependent because an influence on Bax-mediated apoptosis is missing. Additionally, the function of m 41. 1 is independent of other viral proteins and ho-mologous apoptosis inhibitors are conserved in murine and rat <b>cytomegaloviruses.</b> <b>Cytomegaloviruses</b> inhibit apoptosis at the mitochondrial checkpoint in an unconven-tional manner. In contrast to most viruses they do not express a Bcl- 2 homologue but inhibit Bax and Bak independently with two separate proteins (vMIA and m 41. 1) This striking mechanism has not been described for another pathogen so far...|$|R
