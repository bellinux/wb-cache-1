The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the prevalence and causes of proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients. Methods. All kidney transplant recipients followed up in our clinic were included in the study. As a center protocol 24 -hour urine collections were used to quantify protein excretion with 3 -month intervals posttransplantation during the first year, and yearly thereafter. The etiology of chronic kidney disease and demographic characteristics of the study group were obtained from outpatient records. Data regarding the immunosuppressive regimens used, 24 -hour proteinuria levels and creatinine <b>clearences,</b> new-onset hypertension, new-onset diabetes mellitus, rejection episodes, infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV) and polyoma (BK), and biopsy findings were noted. Results. A total of 260 kidney transplant recipients (97 females, mean age 42. 3 ± 12. 3 years) were evaluated.

40|$|Background: Kidney disease, {{even when}} mild, was once {{considered}} so major {{an impediment to}} successful pregnancy and so dangerous to the mother’s wellbeing. High-risk pregnancy mainly associated to renal impairment may occur in 10 - 20 % of gestations {{and it is very}} important that renal function is closely monitored to prevent or minimize maternal and fetal complications. This study was designed to investigate the performance of Cockcroft-Gault CGeq and the simplified MDRDeq equations in healthy pregnant women to assess renal function. Methods: We studied 167 normal ambulatory pregnant women and kidney function was contemporaneously estimated through the CGeq and the simplified MDRDeq and calculated through the creatinine clearance (Ccr). Serum and urinary creatinine were assayed using Jaffé reaction method in the same AutoAnalyser. Results: When we compared calculated and estimated <b>clearences</b> for measurement of kidney function we observed that CGeq overestimated renal function (CGeq = 168. 41 ± 38. 80 ml/ min/ 1. 73 m 2, Ccr = 146. 27 ± 30. 49 ml/min / 1. 73 m 2, p < 0. 001), MDRDeq underestimated renal function (Ccr = 146. 27 ± 30. 49 ml/min / 1. 73 m 2, MDRDeq = 129. 15 ± 29. 28 ml/min / 1. 73 m 2, p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that CGeq overestimated, MDRDeq underestimated significantly kidney function during gestation in healthy women and cannot be recommended to assess renal function in obstetric practice.

40|$|The devlopment of {{domestic}} heat pump systems is mainly {{based on the}} use of volumetric oil lubricated compressors. Following the implementation of economizer based rotary compressors, which represented a major improvement step, one major opportunity to improve both efficiency and heat rate, in particular for high temperature lift heat pumps, is to use two stage cycles. However the reliability of those can be strongly impaired by oil migration, resulting in oil level unbalance when using oil lubricated compressors, unless more sophisticated auxiliaries including an oil pump are added. The need for this additional equipment, the requirement of higher vapour velocity for oil return and impediments to the efficiency of enhanced surfaces for heat exchangers are some of the incentives for the development of oil free compressor systems. As high speed bearings and electrical motors are gradually becoming available this open the way to consider the use of low power, compact, oil-free and high speed radial compressors. This paper describes the basic design of a high speed single stage radial compressor for high pressure ratios and a wide flow range aimed for the first stage of a two stage heat pump. A commercially available 3 D viscous code has been applied to calculate the flow field through the impeller and the diffuser. The particular choice of the bearings allows using very small tip <b>clearences</b> resulting in low leakage losses. To complete the design a commercial 3 D Finite Element code has been used for stress prediction {{as well as for the}} calculation of the blade critical frequencies and their corresponding modes. During the design process the impeller blade geometry has been continuously checked for machinability in order to ensure a feasible impeller using conventional 5 axis milling machines.

40|$|Introduction: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{an abundant}} metabolic disorder with a merging prevalence worldwide. In Germany 8 % {{of the adult}} population is affected. Of those one third suffer from diabetic nephropathy with renal impairment. As an index factor the significance of the endothelin regulation for the development and the degree of diabetic nephropathy remains unclear and requires further evaluation. In our study we analysed endothelin (mRNA-) expression and the associated magnitude of diabetic nephropathy. Material and Methods: For experimental analysis a transgenic rat model with overexpression of human endothelin- 2 (huET- 2 +) was applied and a diabetic metabolism induced by streptocotocin injection. As controls a group of transgenic non diabetic and 2 non transgenic either diabetic non diabetic were assembled The groups were followed for 6 months. On a four weekly interval plasma levels of glucose, creatinin, urea, 24 h proteinuria and albuminuria were measured. Furthermore urea and creatinin <b>clearences</b> were calculated. As the determination procedure {{at the end of the}} 6 month interval systolic blood pressure was measured, the kidneys resected and weight. The endothelin concentration in plasma and glomerular supernatants were analysed with ELISA. Computer assisted histomorphometrics was applied for estimating glomerular volume and degree of glomerular sclerosis. Finally from the rat kidneys the glomerula were isolated and mRNA-expression of ET- 1, ET- 2, ET-receptors (A/B), Fibronektin, TGF-ß and PAI- 1 were obtained. Protein expression of Fibronektin, TGF-ß und PAI- 1 (ELISA) was analysed. Results: In a 4 group rat model study diabetic and non diabetic as well as transgenic and non transgenic characteristics due to present hyperglykemia and increased human endothelin- 2 expression were observed. For both transgenic groups ET levels in plasma and glomerular supernatants were elevated. With induced diabetic metabolism a relevant increase of ET plasma levels were found however quantity of ET levels of glomerular supernatants were not affected. During the study 12 % of the diabetic wild type rats and 55 % diabetic transgenic rats perished non related to renal impairment. The systolic blood pressure was comparable among the four study groups. In wild type rats with induced diabetic metabolism proteinuria, albuminuria, renal weight, glomerular volume and matrix-accumulation, fibronectin expression and urea clearance increased significantly with associated diabetic nephropathy. In transgenic non diabetic rats a significant rise of proteinuria, albuminuria and degree of glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis was found. In transgenic diabetic rats a significant rise of proteinuria, albuminuria and degree of glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis was observed. Changes however were comparable in magnitude with those present in the wild type diabetic group. The animals endogenous ET- 1 m-RNA expression was significantly elevated in transgenic nondiabetic rats Significant changes of ET-receptor-mRNA in the presence of hyperglycemia and/or ET 2 overexpression was not observed. Conclusion: The combination of transgenic endothelin 2 overexpression and induced hyperglycemia in the applied rat model results in no increase of manifest diabetic nephropathie. Our initial hypothesis failed. Although new aspects of the role of endothelin in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy were discovered. We may conclude the impact of the endothelin regulation system is less important for the development of the diabetic nephropathy than i. e. the renin-angiotensin system...|$|R

There were also moderate positive correlation (0. 500 and 0. 502) between urine NGAL values and percentage difference of serum creatinine and creatinine <b>clearence.</b> All that indicate that higer values of urine NGAL are followed by higher percentage difference of serume creatinine and creatinine <b>clearence.</b> By using of automated urine NGAL test detection of acute kidney injure is posible 24 - 48 hours earlier comparing with actual results acquired by determination of serum creatinine concentration. The results of this study will indicate urine NGAL as a reliable biomarker of early acute kidney injure. A combination of early and late markers of kidney damage (urine NGAL, serum creatinine) can greatly contribute to better control the outcome of all those who are a risk group for the development of AKI...|$|E
