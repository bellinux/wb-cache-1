40|$|We {{systematically}} {{investigate the}} dependence of the temperature of cold cesium atoms of polarization gradient cooling (PGC) in optical molasses on experimental parameters, which contain changing modes of <b>cooling</b> <b>laser,</b> PGC interaction time, <b>cooling</b> <b>laser</b> frequency and its intensity. The SR mode of <b>cooling</b> <b>laser,</b> that means the <b>cooling</b> <b>laser</b> frequency is changed with step mode and <b>cooling</b> <b>laser</b> intensity is changed with ramp mode, {{is found to be}} the best for PGC comparing with other SS, RS, and RR modes. We introduce a statistical explanation and an exponential decay function to explain the variation of cold atomic temperature on time. The heating effect is observed when the <b>cooling</b> <b>laser</b> intensity is lower than the saturation intensity of cold atoms. After optimization, the lowest temperature of cold cesium atoms is observed to be about 4 uK with the number of 2 x 10 ^ 9, a density of 1 x 10 ^ 11 /cm^ 3 and the phase space density of 4. 4 x 10 ^(- 5).
