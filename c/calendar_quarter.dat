500|$|Horsefield {{learned to}} read during a single year's {{attendance}} at school when he was six, after which {{he went to work}} for a gingham weaver. His education continued with twice-weekly evening tuition in writing and arithmetic until he was around 15 years old. James Cash, a journalist, amateur botanist and the first chairman of the Manchester Cryptogamic Society, says Horsefield received some education for a short time when he started work: the weaver for whom he served charged two shillings (10p) per <b>calendar</b> <b>quarter</b> to instruct his young employees in reading. This instruction took the form of the employees reading out lessons to him while they worked at their handlooms. An avid reader, his interest in botany was piqued when he obtained a copy of Nicholas Culpeper's 1653 book, The Complete Herbal, of which he said, [...] "The wonderful properties that are there ascribed to plants excited in me a strong desire to get acquainted with the plants themselves." [...] Thereafter he attended working-men's botanical societies and meetings in public houses, thus meeting a broad church of people with interests not only in the science of botany but also in floriculture, herbalism and horticulture.|$|E

40|$|Using data on worker {{training}} programs in South Dakota {{over the years}} 2002 – 11, this study estimates the employment and earnings effects of occupational skills training and on-the-job training. Average treatment effects {{for the first and}} third <b>calendar</b> <b>quarters</b> after training are reported by: gender, worker type, demographic group, region of residence, and time period of job loss. ^ Both occupational skills training and on-the-job training effectively increased the employment rates and incomes of participants. The effectiveness of occupational skills training tended to grow as time passed, but the effectiveness of on-the-job training tended to fade over time. Three <b>calendar</b> <b>quarters</b> after leaving training, the effects of occupational skills training were generally higher than they were after only one quarter. In contrast, three <b>calendar</b> <b>quarters</b> after training, on-the-job treatment effects tended to be smaller than after one quarter. ^ On-the-job training had large impacts on employment but disproportionately small impacts on earnings. The employment effects of on-the-job training were typically 2 to 3 times larger than the employment effects of occupational skills training. But when considering earnings effects, the impacts of occupational skills training were often larger than those of on-the-job training. ^ Training was generally more effective for men than women in the period immediately following training, but after three <b>calendar</b> <b>quarters</b> the effects of training were typically larger for women than for men. The short- and longer-run effects of training were greater for the non-dislocated jobless than for displaced workers. The demographic results showed that Native Americans benefited more from training than did any other demographic groups. ^ From a regional perspective, training effectively increased employment rates and incomes for both rural and urban areas, with the impacts being slightly larger for rural areas than for urban. Finally, training was less effective {{in the wake of the}} 2007 – 09 recession than beforehand. Training had no significant employment effects and only modest income effects following the Great Recession. ^ The results reported in this study suggest that occupational skills training and on-the-job training effectively increased employment rates and quarterly earnings across numerous sub-populations, regions, and time periods. The findings of this study will help guide policy makers going forward so that they might maximize the potential impacts of worker {{training programs}}. ...|$|R

Junichi Masuda at Game Freak developed the titles, saying it would [...] "become {{a new type of}} game that offers a number of new forms of play" [...] and that he was determined to create [...] "the ultimate [...] version". Though Diamond and Pearl were expected to be released in Japan by 2005, Nintendo revealed that the developers were still working on aspects of the gameplay and that the games would not be released until 2006. [...] The company said that Diamond and Pearl would be able to communicate with Pokémon games for the Game Boy Advance, allowing players to transfer their Pokémon to the new games. Nintendo also announced that the games would make full use of the Wi-Fi capabilities of the DS, allowing 16 players to communicate wirelessly at one time. Further information concerning the games was not released until mid 2006, when Nintendo President Satoru Iwata mentioned that connectivity with Pokémon Battle Revolution was also still in development; new features such as the Pokétch and time sensitivity were also mentioned.|$|E

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the rate of rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is slower during the spring-summer than {{during the rest of the}} year, we used PSA data from a prospective single-arm cohort study of men who had been followed to characterize a watchful observation protocol with selective delayed intervention for clinically localized, low-to-intermediate grade prostate adenocarcinoma. The rate of PSA increase was calculated as the visit-to-visit slope of log(PSA) against time, from 1 calendar-quarter visit to the next. The nonparametric Friedman test confirmed differences in rate of PSA rise among the <b>calendar</b> <b>quarters</b> (P = 0. 041). Post hoc analysis showed the rate of PSA increase during Q 2 was significantly slower than in each one of the other <b>calendar</b> <b>quarters</b> (Q 1 versus Q 2, P = 0. 025; Q 3 versus Q 2, P = 0. 002; Q 4 versus Q 2, P = 0. 013), with no differences among quarters Q 1, Q 3, and Q 4. These results are consistent with the vitamin D hypothesis that the higher 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels associated with spring and summer have a desirable effect on prostate biology. The therapeutic implication is that vitamin D supplementation in the range of 2000 IU/d, a dose comparable to the effect of summer, can benefit men monitored for rising PSA...|$|R

40|$|Between 1976 and 1982, 164, 128 {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} herring were tagged and released at 72 sites along the Maine and New Hampshire coasts. Total recovery rates were 5. 9 %for juveniles and 4. 9 % for adults. Effective recovery rates (i. e. from the 15 th day after release) were 4. 1 and 3. 5 %. respectively. Migration patterns varied with season and region of tagging. Summer-feeding juve-niles from all areas {{along the coast}} frequently moved into adjacent areas during the 3 rd and the 4 th <b>calendar</b> <b>quarters.</b> Some of these juveniles then underwent an autumn migration to the southwest where they overwintered off the Massachusetts and New Hampshire coasts.
