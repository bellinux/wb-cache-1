25|$|Decomposition had {{commenced}} in the skin. Dark brown spots were on {{the anterior}} surface of the left chin. There was a deformity in {{the bones of the}} right leg, which was not straight, but bowed forwards. There was no recent external injury save to the neck. The body being washed more thoroughly I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> healing sores. The lobe of the left ear was torn as if from the removal or wearing through of an earring, but it was thoroughly healed. On removing the scalp {{there was no sign of}} extravasation of blood.|$|E
25|$|Practically all early {{respirators}} {{consisted of}} a bag placed completely over the head, fastened around the throat with windows through which the wearer <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Some</b> were rubber, some were made of rubberized fabric, and still others of impregnated fabric, {{but in most cases}} a tank of compressed air or a reservoir of air under slight pressure was carried by the wearer to supply the necessary breathing air. In some devices certain means were provided for the adsorption of carbon dioxide in exhaled air and the rebreathing of the same air many times; in other cases valves allowed exhalation of used air.|$|E
2500|$|Surf Hill: This ride, {{common to}} other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, {{until they reached}} a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people {{frequently}} collided with {{each other on the}} way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the [...] "back breaker", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle. Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby snack bar with {{a good view of the}} attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> serious injuries, lost bikini tops, or both. Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.|$|E
60|$|The gun now {{pointed up}} the by-path, {{and there was}} an opening in the bush through which Kate <b>could</b> <b>see</b> for <b>some</b> distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "It must be {{very far}} away," [...] he went on. [...] "I don't think you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it. <b>Some</b> native craft making for the Moluccas, probably. Come, we mustn't stay here." ...|$|R
50|$|In February 1992, Jennings {{contracted}} pneumonia, {{which led}} to respiratory failure that deprived his brain of oxygen. After recovering, while he <b>could</b> still <b>see</b> <b>some</b> colors and movement, his sight virtually vanished.|$|R
2500|$|After {{encouraging}} legion X, Caesar went to {{the right}} wing. Things looked bad. [...] He {{could see that the}} men of XII Victrix were crammed so closely together in one mass by their standards that they could not fight effectively. [...] All (six) centurions of the fourth cohort were dead, its standard bearer killed and the standard missing. [...] Of the remaining cohorts, almost all the centurions were either wounded or killed; Baculus, the legion’s primipilus, a fine soldier, had received so many minor and serious wounds that he could barely stand. The Nervii were attacking vigorously from lower ground and pressing at the front and both flanks. [...] Caesar <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> men were shirking and {{trying to get to the}} rear; others were slowly ceasing effective resistance. There were no reserves. This was the crisis-point. [...] He took a shield from a soldier at the rear and {{went to the}} first line. [...] Calling his centurions by name, he ordered them to have the soldiers advance (signa inferre) and the maniples open up and extend. [...] As he tells it, his arrival brought hope and boosted the soldiers’ morale. Every man was now keen to do well in front of his general. As a result, the enemy assault was checked slightly.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} {{one of the}} guards called down that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> Indians to the {{northwest}} of the fort.|$|E
6000|$|... "A trolley-car runs part way, and then--we'll take a cab. Come on," [...] he added, anxiously, for he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of his saloon friends edging near.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Signage for {{the center}} <b>could</b> still be <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> {{years after the end}} of its existence.|$|R
60|$|Miss Meadows bethought {{her that}} grandmamma was anxious, so she only waited {{to give an}} {{invitation}} to tea, but merely to Mrs. Kendal; she would say nothing about Sophy since disgrace--well-merited--if they <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>some</b> feeling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{a length}} of time that you could perceive," [...] said his father; [...] "just as {{it was with the}} man cutting wood. We <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>some</b> time elapsed between the {{striking}} of the blow, and our hearing the sound." ...|$|R
60|$|Running {{with all}} {{possible}} swiftness, our friends soon {{reached a point}} where they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the pork barrels. Barringford held up his hands and was recognized.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I dunno," [...] {{suggested}} Lapham, after a moment; [...] "why {{not talk}} to the minister of your church? May be he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> way out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} hostess spoke: [...] "I wish we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of these things. You make us shudder deliciously. Can't you {{sometime}} bring this remarkable young woman--they're always women, aren't they?" ...|$|E
60|$|So the lad {{said that}} he was most willing, and she told him that three Trolls had planted them all three there in the earth, but that {{formerly}} they had dwelt in the castle which he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> at <b>some</b> distance in the wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "He won't {{be expecting}} us today," [...] Surajah replied, [...] "but I {{have no doubt}} he will begin to feel anxious by {{tomorrow}} night. I wish we <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> way of getting the horses down. It will be awkward doing without them." ...|$|R
60|$|The blaze {{here was}} no longer bright, but Neale <b>could</b> <b>see</b> distinctly. <b>Some</b> of the piles of ties were burning. The heat had begun to drive the men out. Troopers were everywhere. And it {{appeared}} the rattle of rifles was receding up the valley. The Sioux had retreated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I don't know," [...] she said, [...] "I guess so. The {{doctor said}} he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some,</b> {{and he wants}} to see his friends. That's not strange--he always did. I'll ask. Will you tell me your name?" ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the boys}} {{came to a}} spot where the river wound around the hill, and beyond this was a broad stretch of plains, {{apparently}} many miles in extent. Far to the southward they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> tall timber.|$|E
60|$|So they sallied forth {{into the}} cool morning air. There were lamps burning in the streets, and in one direction, where there was an opening among the buildings, Rollo <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> faint signs of the dawn in the eastern sky.|$|E
60|$|The {{water in}} the lagoon was so {{clear that it was}} almost transparent, and beneath us and around us we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> fish, <b>some</b> large and some small, {{swimming}} about as if they were floating in the air, while down below the white sandy bottom seemed to sparkle in the sunlight.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked away}} from him. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that for <b>some</b> reason or other she was embarrassed. The colour had {{streamed}} into her cheeks, but she went on bravely enough.|$|R
5000|$|On this album, Nic Wastell, an Englishman, {{corrected}} {{some of the}} lyrics. [...] "The {{idea came}} from both myself and from our label, because I am fairly lazy {{when it comes to}} writing lyrics. Since we had recorded all the music, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>some</b> of the lyrics weren't entirely complete," [...] says Christensen.|$|R
60|$|I {{sprang up}} at that, and, {{wondering}} {{what might be}} toward, I crossed to my barred window and stood there listening. I overlooked {{the courtyard of the}} jail, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> commotion below, in sympathy, as it were, with the greater commotion without.|$|E
6000|$|Jack brightened up suddenly. [...] "I can't {{really believe}} it is you, Harry. You've grown so big and burly, and you look so old." [...] He smiled. [...] "I wish I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of that {{shooting}} they all tell about, but that would let the cat out." ...|$|E
60|$|At lunch-time I {{stopped in}} {{at a large}} dry-goods store to attend to my wife's commission. I saw a well-dressed man walking the floor between the counters, where long lines of girls were waiting on much longer lines of customers, and asked him where I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> red calico.|$|E
6000|$|As the coastguards {{jumped from}} the cart, and began {{to get out the}} rocket stand, the old whaler pointed out the {{direction}} where the swimmer's head <b>could</b> still be <b>seen.</b> <b>Some</b> of the sailors <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it too; though to Stephen and the laymen it was invisible. The chief boatman shook his head: ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Umbra, {{penumbra}} and antumbra of Earth {{and images}} that <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> at <b>some</b> points {{in these areas}} (note: sizes and distances are not to scale).|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the cutter had reached a point {{opposite}} to where {{the person in the}} snow rested. All the boys <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>some</b> person, wrapped in an overcoat, lying face downward. A cap that looked strangely familiar to Sam lay close at hand. Stopping the horse, Sam leaped from the cutter, and Spud did the same.|$|R
60|$|So little a {{time had}} elapsed, that when I {{got to the}} top of the first steepness, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> part of the open mountain, the murderer was still moving away at no great distance. He was a big man, in a black coat, with metal buttons, and carried a long fowling-piece.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shuddered and}} turned away. His face buried {{itself in the}} pillow. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> twinge of remorse had seized upon him. At last he spoke. [...] "Cumberledge," [...] he said, in a very low and almost frightened tone, [...] "don't let her come near me! I can't bear it. I can't bear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hereward? Hereward? Who {{wants to}} know about that villain?" [...] {{answered}} the potter, {{as soon as he}} was asked in English. [...] "Would to Heaven he were here, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of you noble knights and earls paying him for me; for I owe him more than ever I shall pay myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Talking {{about water}} gardens, miss," [...] he said, [...] "I wish you <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> of the {{beautiful}} ones that I have come across!--more beautiful and lovely than anything {{on the top of}} the earth; you may be sure of that. I was reminded of them the moment you spoke to me about your goldfish and their plants." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Josie's eyes were so {{accustomed}} to the dim moonlight that she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> distinctly <b>some</b> distance ahead of her. The sky was clear; there was just enough wind to rustle {{the leaves of the}} trees. Now and then in some farmyard a cock would crow or a dog bark, but no other sounds broke the stillness of the night.|$|R
60|$|In this country, as in {{all others}} they had visited {{underneath}} the earth's surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light coming from some unknown source. Looking out, they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> into <b>some</b> of the houses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, {{and were able to}} mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in their dwellings.|$|R
