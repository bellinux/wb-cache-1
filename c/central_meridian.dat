50|$|In most {{applications}} the Gauss-Krüger {{is applied}} to a narrow strip near the <b>central</b> <b>meridians</b> where {{the differences between the}} spherical and ellipsoidal versions are small, but nevertheless important in accurate mapping. Direct series for scale, convergence and distortion are functions of eccentricity and both latitude and longitude on the ellipsoid: inverse series are functions of eccentricity and both x and y on the projection. In the secant version the lines of true scale on the projection are no longer parallel to central meridian; they curve slightly. The convergence angle between projected meridians and the x constant grid lines is no longer zero (except on the equator) so that a grid bearing must be corrected to obtain an azimuth from true north. The difference is small, but not negligible, particularly at high latitudes.|$|R

40|$|We provide {{measurements}} of the absolute reflectivity of Jupiter and Saturn along their <b>central</b> <b>meridians</b> in filters covering {{a wide range of}} visible and near-infrared wavelengths (from 0. 38 to 1. 7 μm) that are not often presented in the literature. We also give {{measurements of}} the geometric albedo of both planets and discuss the limb-darkening behavior and temporal variability of their reflectivity values for a period of four years (2012 - 2016). This work is based on observations with the PlanetCam-UPV/EHU instrument at the 1. 23 m and 2. 2 m telescopes in Calar Alto Observatory (Spain). The instrument simultaneously observes in two channels: visible (VIS; 0. 38 - 1. 0 μm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR; 1. 0 [...] 1. 7 μm). We obtained high-resolution observations via the lucky-imaging method. We show that our calibration is consistent with previous independent determinations of reflectivity values of these planets and, for future reference, provide new data extended in the wavelength range and in the time. Our results have an uncertainty in absolute calibration of 10 [...] 20 %. We show that under the hypothesis of constant geometric albedo, we are able to detect absolute reflectivity changes related to planetary temporal evolution of about 5 - 10 %.
