40|$|This paper {{estimates}} adult equivalence scalcs in {{the context}} of a nonlinear demand system using cross-section individual household data. It then evaluates the treatment of children under the tax allowance and <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> on the basis of the estimated equivalence scales. The results suggest that a <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>system</b> allowing for economies of scale in the family is consistent with the cost of children implied by the notion of adult equivalence scale. For any tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>system</b> to be considered equitable it must allow for dissimilar treatment of unequals or similar treatment of equals. Households are unequal not only in terms of their income level, but also in terms of their size and composition. For example, families with children that have the same income as childless families are likely to have lower standards of living because of the financial burden of raising children. Therefore, an equitable tax and <b>benefit</b> <b>system</b> should equivalize the well-being of families with alternative size and composition in the assessment of net income taxes. Most countries attempt to equivalize the well-being of families with different size and composition through child welfare programs. Such programs usually provide assistance to families with children either in the form of a tax allowance, a reduction in the tax liability of the household, or a child b ~ w j i t, a payment to the person who looks after the child. The child welfare programs in developed countries are often based on a <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> and payments may vary with the number and age of children. In the U. K., for example, the child welfare system was originally based on tax allowance, but since 1977 has changed to one based on <b>child</b> <b>benefit.</b> This cha~lge was implemented mainly because the tax allowance system is regressive since households benefit in proportion to their marginal income tax rate. Under the tax allowance system, families with low income will not receive any financial assistance for their children because they pay no taxes. The cost of children can be measured with the concept of (udult) rquivulrnce scale, generally defined as the cost of reaching a given level of utility under differen...|$|R

This paper examines {{the impact of a}} change in the German <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>system</b> in 1996, which led to a large increase in lump sum transfers to families with children. We analyze the impact on the labor force participation of family members as well as on household consumption directed to children. Comparing behavioral changes of adults with children with behavioral changes of adults without children, we find that mothers slightly reduced their labor market participation switching from full to part time employment, while participation rates of fathers increased. At the same time we observe a significant increase in maternal time for child care, especially among women with small children...|$|R
40|$|Using {{evidence}} from the European Community Household Panel we find that family benefits vary in their importance to household incomes and {{in the prevention of}} child poverty across Europe. In one group of countries family benefits appear to {{have a significant effect on}} the protection of children from financial poverty. The UK and the Netherlands are both members of this group, and we use the microsimulation model EUROMOD to examine the extent to which differences in <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> explain the very different level of child poverty in the two countries. We also explore the effect of 2 ̆ 01 cswapping 2 ̆ 01 d <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>systems</b> between the two countries and find that there is some scope for improvements in looking beyond national borders. We conclude that the poverty reduction properties of universal <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> may be improved without resorting to means-testing or compromising the other functions of these benefits. This analysis illustrates that comparative microsimulations can be extremely informative, and provides a flavour of the potential of EUROMOD to offer valuable pointers for the direction of social policies...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{develops}} a {{general equilibrium model}} with overlapping generations and endogenous fertility in order to analyze the interaction between public policy and household labor supply and fertility decisions. The model's benchmark equilibrium reflects the current family policy consisting of joint taxation of married couples, monetary transfers and in-kind benefits which reduce the time cost of children. Then we simulate alternative reforms of the tax and the <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>system</b> and analyze the long-run impact on fertility and female labor supply. Our simulations indicate three central results: First, policies which simply increase the family budget either via higher transfers (direct or in-kind) or via family splitting increase fertility but reduce female employment. Second, increasing tax revenues due {{to the introduction of}} individual taxation would increase female employment but reduce fertility. Third, revenue neutral policies such as a reform of the benefit structure or a move towards individual taxation combined with an increase in in-kind benefits may achieve both goals and therefore yield significant welfare gains. stochastic fertility, general equilibrium life cycle model...|$|R

Second, debt reduction coupled with increasing <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> is preferable to debt reduction alone to reduce public debt for future generations.

40|$|Provides an {{overview}} of the child care industry in Australia, trends through time, international comparisons and a regional perspective on child care costs and affordability. Abstract The 35 th AMP. NATSEM Income and Wealth Report Child Care: Affordability in Australia provides unique research into the affordability of child care in Australia. The report provides {{an overview}} of the industry in Australia, trends through time, international comparisons and a regional perspective on child care costs and affordability. The report finds that child care costs have increased dramatically over the past 10 years but due to government benefits we find that the out-of-pocket costs remain well contained for families but at a significant cost to the Government. The report considers the difficult decision that parents make in returning to work and we show that returns to work for a low income mother can be as low as $ 3. 45 per hour once the loss of government <b>benefits,</b> taxation and <b>child</b> care costs are considered. The report finds that the most unaffordable child care is in the Sydney CBD area and some mining communities where the daily rate can be as high as $ 170 per day. The least expensive child care is in North Queensland and Brisbane has the most affordable child care of capital cities. The <b>child</b> care <b>benefits</b> <b>system</b> provides significant relief for parents but a larger share of the benefits are received by relatively high income families. The report considers an alternative child care policy of making child care payments tax deductible and the report finds that relative to the current system all families would be worse off but low and middle income families would be significantly disadvantaged...|$|R
40|$|For {{families}} with children, employment {{comes at a}} price. They must subtract from their wages the cost of someone else caring for their child. Their wage minus the costs of obtaining child care, transportation, and other expenses that may be generated by employment is generally {{referred to as the}} effective wage. The Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) child care subsidy voucher, the Earned In-come Tax Credit (EITC), and the Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC) are all intended to increase the effective wage of parents to support them enter-ing and staying in the workforce. This paper explores the trade-offs between employment and effective wage that parents must make through the lens of three hypothetical North Carolina families facing promotion, bonus, and employer relocation opportunities. Through their eyes we understand why it would be rational to turn down these opportunities due to the potential loss {{of thousands of dollars in}} benefits. These situations demonstrate the weaknesses of the cur-rent system, where the needs of employers and employees become increasingly opposed as families approach the income eligibility threshold and the portability threshold. This paper proposes a policy to better align the needs of employers and employees by restructuring the incentive system to phase out benefits gradu-ally, guarantee help to anyone who is eligible, make support sensitive to regional changes in child care prices, and administer it through the tax system rather than local social services offices throughout the country.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset records the number of UK families that are claiming a <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> {{and the number of}} children for whom the benefit is received from 2003. On average, more than 98 per cent of children in the UK are estimated to receive the <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit,</b> which is paid directly into claimants’ bank, building society or post office accounts. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset contains details {{of the total number of}} claimants, by age of child, sex of child and household composition. Geographic referencing is possible allowing records to be linked to Ward, District or Government Office Region. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> was introduced in 1977 and administered by the Department for Work and Pensions until 2003. Thereafter, responsibility for the collection of <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> information was passed from the DWP to the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in April 2003. Hence HMRC only hold <b>child</b> <b>benefit</b> data from 2003. In 2007 / 08 <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> was paid to the carers of more than 13 million children in 7. 5 million families in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> is available for the majority of children in the UK (around 98 %) and so the dataset holds information relating to claims in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset is obtained from the HMRC computer systems that administer the benefit. Data scans are carried out quarterly. National Level quarterly data is scheduled for release approximately three months after the relevant period. Responsibility Quarterly datasets based on a 5 % sample are available from May 2003 to October 2007. In addition annual datasets which give complete coverage of <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> recipients are available from 2003 to 2006, and quarterly from May 2009. The annual dataset can be geographically referenced to the Lower Layer Super Output Area, as can quarterly datasets from June 2009. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset geographical areas are calculated using the postcode and address information reported on the claim. Accurate linking using the National Insurance Number, <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> Number, or names and addresses can then occur. More specifically, most HMRC data do contain names and addresses. Variables within the dataset may be subject to statistical disclosure control techniques to prevent disclosure and confidentiality issues being breached. Published counts of <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> data at a small area level are also rounded so the published total number of claimants in a larger area may possibly not match the summed totals from data tables produced at a smaller geography. The HMRC also carry out a number of standard checks to ensure overall quality of the data. However, many people now receive <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> directly into bank or Post Office accounts. Although people should inform the HMRC when they move home, the address information may not always be up to date. The dataset information comes from a scan of the computer systems that are used to administer <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit.</b> Anyone attempting to defraud the system is liable to prosecution. Therefore the quality of the dataset is believed to be of a high standard. Please note that families with children may choose not to claim <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> (take up rates are estimated to be around 98 %) and there are some circumstances where a child might be ineligible. Research Usage and Linkage As the <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> data are restricted in scope, the potential for research purposes is limited. However, it does provide a good basis for assessing the overall number of claimants at specified times, the geographical distribution of claimants and estimating the size of the child population. For example, the Office for National Statistics use this dataset to create population estimates at the lower layer super output area level. The data has been used to estimate the number of children living in low income households (English Indices of Deprivation 2007, Economic Deprivation Index 2008 and the Child Well-being Index 2009), and also to estimate the proportion of children post 16 years old staying in full-time education (English Indices of Deprivation 2007 and Child Well-being 2009). In the past the data also formed the basis of sampling frames for the Millennium Cohort Study. The <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset is linked by the HMRC to other datasets that they hold, to help with the administration of tax credits. This includes the Tax Credit Claimants dataset which has the same referencing in order for comparisons to be made. Linking is made using the National Insurance number, <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> Number or names and addresses. In theory, it is possible to link the <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> dataset with other individual tax records and DWP benefit data. These linked datasets have the potential to be used for in-depth research of family income, work and worklessness patterns. Finally, the initial wave of the Families and Children Study was drawn from <b>Child</b> <b>Benefit</b> records. </div...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} history of public financial student support policies in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, from their establishment in 1815 until today. It focuses especially on the political and administrative decisions that led to actual policies. This history is divided in seven episodes during which policies had different goals and took different shapes. This way, the episodes reflect the changing role {{of the national government}} in Dutch society. Policy makers used financial student support as an instrument in their efforts to influence the course of social developments, with varying success. They tried to influence supply on the job market, to stimulate the development of individual talents and to advance social justice. Larger objectives were state formation, economic and cultural development and the emancipation of particular groups in society. Ever since the introduction of <b>child</b> <b>benefits</b> in the <b>system</b> in 1953, it has been impossible to tell whether student support is a form of education policy, income policy or social support.
