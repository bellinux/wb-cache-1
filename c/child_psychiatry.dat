40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} describing {{the content and}} time allocated to undergraduate medical education curricula in <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> and make recommendations about <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> teaching goals and curricula content. METHOD: A literature search from 1970 to February 2007 using the key words undergraduate, curriculum, teaching, education, <b>psychiatry,</b> <b>child,</b> adolescent, and medical school, was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. RESULTS: There is limited agreement about curricula content for undergraduate <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> teaching programs in medical schools, {{with a wide range}} of objectives identified by different programs. On average, the time allowed for teaching <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> is small. There is also great variation in the time allocated by different medical schools. In many countries, the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists with academic appointments is limited, and <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> programs are developed and taught by a small number of teaching staff at each medical school. CONCLUSIONS: Medical schools should reconsider the relatively low priority given to teaching <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> to medical students. The <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> profession must identify clear learning goals for a longitudinal developmentally appropriate model of <b>child</b> and adolescent <b>psychiatry</b> education commencing at an undergraduate level in medical schools and continuing through residency and fellowships. There is a need to promote national and international standards for teaching in this area and to encourage stronger collaborations between teaching staff across different medical schools.

25|$|The era {{since the}} 1980s flourished, in large part, because of {{contributions}} {{made in the}} 1970s, a decade during which <b>child</b> <b>psychiatry</b> witnessed a major evolution {{as a result of}} the work carried out by Michael Rutter. The first comprehensive population survey of 9- to 11-year-olds, carried out in London and the Isle of Wight, which appeared in 1970, addressed questions that have continued to be of importance for child psychiatry; for example, rates of psychiatric disorders, the role of intellectual development and physical impairment, and specific concern for potential social influences on children's adjustment. This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children. These studies described the prevalence of ADHD (relatively low as compared to the US), identified the onset and prevalence of depression in mid-adolescence and the frequent co-morbidity with conduct disorder, and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievemment.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} six months of World War II, Bowlby worked at a clinic in Canonbury in the <b>child</b> <b>psychiatry</b> unit. Later on in the war, Bowlby became a {{lieutenant}} colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, the children that were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the child guidance clinic in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time going back and forth from Cambridge to London, where he would see patients in private. From this experience, Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies. This actually extended his research interested on separation that he was focused on pre-war.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1899, the term [...] "child psychiatry" [...] (in French) {{was used as}} a {{subtitle}} in Manheimer's monograph Les Troubles Mentaux de l'Enfance. However, the Swiss psychiatrist Moritz Tramer (1882–1963) was probably the first to define the parameters of <b>child</b> <b>psychiatry</b> in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis within the discipline of medicine, in 1933. In 1934, Tramer founded the Zeitschrift für Kinderpsychiatrie (Journal of <b>Child</b> <b>Psychiatry),</b> which later became Acta Paedopsychiatria. The first academic <b>child</b> <b>psychiatry</b> department in the world was founded in 1930 by Leo Kanner (18941981), an Austrian émigré and medical graduate of the University of Berlin, under the direction of Adolf Meyer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore. Kanner was the first physician to be identified as a child psychiatrist in the US and his textbook, <b>Child</b> <b>Psychiatry</b> (1935), is credited with introducing both the specialty and the term to the Anglo-phone academic community. [...] In 1936, Kanner established the first formal elective course in <b>child</b> <b>psychiatry</b> at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1944 he provided the first clinical description of early infantile autism, otherwise known as Kanner's Syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|From its {{establishment}} in February 1923, the Maudsley, a London-based postgraduate {{teaching and research}} psychiatric hospital, contained a small children's department.

Gillberg began to study DAMP in the late 1970s, when ADHD was still called MBD and the DAMP concept has been adjusted as the term ADHD was introduced and became internationally used. Around 1990, DAMP had become a generally accepted diagnostic concept in two Nordic countries, but when the DSM-IV appeared in 1994, DAMP became considered a redundant term in many countries, since DAMP is essentially equivalent to ADHD in combination with DCD as defined by DSM-IV.
