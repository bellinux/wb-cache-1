5|$|After {{one hour}} of jury deliberation, Wise {{was found guilty of}} first-degree murder. The jury urged mercy in sentencing, and the judge {{sentence}}d Wise to a life sentence in prison, under the terms of which she <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> freed by executive clemency.|$|E
5|$|A $1 million {{insurance}} policy was secured against the diamond with Lloyd's of London. The terms set by Lloyd's stipulated that it <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> publicly worn for thirty days {{in any given}} year, that it be stored in a vault, and that Taylor was {{to be accompanied by}} armed guards when wearing it in public. Taylor would later have a replica made of the diamond that cost $2,800.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after being married, Anne Dallas Dudley became {{involved}} in the temperance movement as a supporter of alcohol prohibition. Through her work in the temperance movement and her association with friends such as Maria Daviess and Ida Clyde Clark, Dudley became convinced that women's place in society <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> improved if women were allowed to vote. At the time, however, a majority of men and women opposed the idea of women participating in the political process.|$|E

5000|$|The {{elections}} {{produced a}} parliament with 394 seats for the Communist-controlled [...] "Democratic Bloc" [...] and 28 for the PSL, a result which everyone knew <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> obtained through massive electoral fraud. Indeed, the opposition claimed {{that it would}} have won as much as 80 percent of the vote had the election been conducted in a fair manner.|$|R
5|$|Built between 1857 and 1859, the {{hospital}} was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E
5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> {{found in the}} adipose (fat) tissue. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood {{as well as in}} adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E

50|$|For example, suppose {{someone might}} {{believe that there}} is {{intelligent}} life on Mars, and base this belief on a further belief, that there is a feature on the surface of Mars that looks like a face, and that this face <b>could</b> <b>only</b> have <b>been</b> made by intelligent life. So the justifying belief is: that face-like feature on Mars <b>could</b> <b>only</b> have <b>been</b> made by intelligent life. And the justified belief is: there is intelligent life on Mars.|$|R
5|$|Giovanni Battista Grassi, {{professor}} of Comparative Anatomy at Rome University, showed that human malaria <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> transmitted by Anopheles (Greek anofelís: good-for-nothing) mosquitoes. Grassi along with coworkers Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli and Ettore Marchiafava {{announced at the}} session of the Accademia dei Lincei on 4 December 1898 that a healthy man in a non-malarial zone had contracted tertian malaria after being bitten by an experimentally infected Anopheles claviger specimen.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures {{to make them more}} pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of the}} Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by pointing to his contract, which stated the picture <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> in black-and-white.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, {{the color}} of {{clothing}} showed a person's social rank and profession. Red <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and green by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. The Mona Lisa wears green in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1883, Steinitz took {{second place}} in the {{extremely}} strong London 1883 chess tournament behind Zukertort, who made a brilliant start, faded at the end but finished 3 points ahead. Steinitz finished 2½ points ahead of the third-placed competitor, Blackburne. Zukertort's victory again led some commentators to suggest that Zukertort should be regarded as the world chess champion, while others said the issue <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> resolved by a match between Steinitz and Zukertort.|$|E
5|$|Mahan {{went on to}} say victory <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> {{achieved}} by engagements between battleships, which {{came to be known as}} the decisive battle doctrine in some navies, while targeting merchant ships (commerce raiding or guerre de course, as posited by the Jeune École) could never succeed.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the fate}} of Laos did not depend on a {{military}} solution in the air or {{on the ground in}} Laos and <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> decided by the outcome in Vietnam, winning the war against the DRV in northern Laos was not the objective. Instead, maintaining access to the country was paramount and keeping the Royal Lao government in power became the primary objective.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado recall {{election}} of 2013 {{was a successful}} effort to recall two Democratic members of the Colorado Senate following their support of new gun control legislation.

5|$|The RBZ also issued special traveller's cheques in 2003, {{with six}} {{denominations}} ranging from $1000 to $100000. These were short-lived due to unpopularity {{with the general}} public: identification was required both during issue and encashment of such cheques, which <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used once by the bearer. As usual, banks levied a commission fee {{on all of the}} cheques.|$|E

5|$|Western civilization <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> saved, Innis argued, by {{recovering}} {{the balance}} between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing {{institutions of higher learning}} from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore {{the balance between}} power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
