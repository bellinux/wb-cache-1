In the present work the elution of copper-, iron-, and zinc-cyanocomplexes from polyacrylic- and polystyrene-based resins was studied. It was found that iron and <b>copper</b> <b>cyanides</b> are easily eluted from polyacrylic- and polystyrene-based ion exchange resins using either SCN- or NO 3 -. However, elution of the zinc cyanide complex from polystyrene-based resins was poor when using nitrate solution as eluant. Besides, an increase in elution temperature from 25 °C to 50 °C improved the elution of iron and zinc cyanides from polystyrene-based resins using a nitrate eluant; however temperature did not have any significant effect on other metal cyanocomplexes or for elution using thiocyanate. It was therefore proposed that the optimal combination of resin-eluant was site-specific, and depends on the features of the effluent, processing temperature, eluant concentration, and ion exchange resin under consideration...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), there is still no commercially available instrument of the rotating type. The first reported rotating EQCM (REQCM) was built in the authors' laboratory in 1994 and, in 1997, a second generation instrument was designed to overcome problems with stability and sensitivity. This paper describes the design and construction of a rotating EQCM, detailing how these problems can be minimized. The advantages of this equipment are its high sensitivity (< 10 ng), the ability to study reactions over relatively short time intervals and the possibility of studying electrochemical reactions which occur simultaneously with the evolution of gas. In this paper, the benefits of the REQCM are illustrated using two simple examples: the deposition of <b>copper</b> from <b>cyanide</b> solutions; and the leaching of <b>copper</b> in <b>cyanide</b> solutions.

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of copper-bearing minerals {{is known to}} bring on many challenges during the cyanidation of gold ore, like high consumption of cyanide and low extraction of metal, which are undesirable impacts on the auriferous recovery in the subsequent process step. The high <b>copper</b> solubility in <b>cyanide</b> prevents the direct use of classical hydrometallurgical processes for the extraction of gold by cyanidation. Additionally, {{the application of a}} conventional flotation process to extract copper is further complicated when it is oxidized. As a result, an acid pre-leaching process was applied in order to clean the ore of these copper minerals that are cyanide consumers. The objective was to evaluate the amount of soluble <b>copper</b> in <b>cyanide</b> before and after acidic cleaning. From a gold ore containing copper, the study selected four samples containing 0. 22 %, 0. 55 %, 1. 00 % and 1. 36 % of copper. For direct cyanidation of the ore without pre-treatment, <b>copper</b> extraction by <b>cyanide</b> complexing ranged from 8 to 83 %. In contrast, the pre-treatment carried out with sulfuric acid extracted 24 % to 99 % of initial copper and subsequent cyanidation extracted 0. 13 to 1. 54 % of initial copper. The study also showed that the copper contained in the secondary minerals is more easily extracted by cyanide (83 %), being followed by the copper oxy-hydroxide minerals (60 %), while the copper contained in the manganese oxide is less complexed by cyanide (8 % a 12 %). It was possible to observe that minerals with low acid solubility also have low solubility in cyanide. Cyanide consumption decreased by about 2. 5 times and gold recovery increased to above 94 % after acidic pre-cleaning...|$|R

In the present study, the electrochemical destruction of cyanide with copper/active carbon fiber (Cu/ACF) composite cathode and Dimensionless Stable Anode (DSA) under alkaline conditions was investigated. Firstly, various cathode materials including stainless steel, ACF, copper plate and Cu/ACF were compared for cyanide removal. Cyanide removal efficiencies {{by the individual}} H 2 O 2 oxidation generated using ACF cathode or individual DSAs anodic oxidation using stainless steel cathode were less than 20 %. Using Cu/ACF as the cathode, the removal efficiency of cyanide was largely improved compared with other cathodes. At the current density of 50. 01 A/m(2) and the geometric area ratio of Cu/ACF= 1 : 2, the concentration of cyanide was lowered from 1. 50 to 0. 07 mM within 90 minutes. Due to the dissolution of copper plate by the cyanide ions, the concentration of copper ions increased rapidly {{at first and then}} decreased with the efficient destruction of cyanide ions. Combined with the SEM-EDX and XPS analysis of the anode surface, it was concluded that the generation of copper oxides occurred at the anode surface, which exhibited catalytic activities for cyanide removal. Meantime, ESR results confirmed the generation of hydroxyl radicals in solution. Hydroxyl radicals generated in the reaction between <b>copper</b> <b>cyanides</b> complexs and H 2 O 2 were responsible for the cyanide removal.
