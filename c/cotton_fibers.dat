40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} develop cotton fabric {{underwear}} {{with the health care}} function, the <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> was modified with the collagen (CMCF) using periodate oxidation method. The aldehyde groups on the glucose chains of the oxidized cotton cellulose were reacted with the amino groups of collagen to obtain the CMCF, and the oxidized cellulose was crosslinked with collagen in aqueous acetic acid media. The effects of collagen concentration, treatment time, reaction temperature, pH value of solution and periodate concentration on the amount of collagen crosslinked on <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> were respectively discussed, and the optimal reaction technology was obtained. XPS characterization of the modified <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> showed a characteristic peak about 400. 0 – 405. 0 eV corresponding to collagen, which indicated that the collagen was combined on the surface of <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber.</b> The mechanical properties of the collagen modified <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> were improved.

25|$|Production {{capacity}} in Britain and the United States was improved by {{the invention of}} the modern cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw <b>cotton</b> <b>fibers</b> were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).|$|E
25|$|The cotton gin is a {{mechanical}} device that removes the seeds from cotton, {{a process that}} had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word gin is short for engine.

Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only pull through some of the feathers.|$|E

In April 1932, Ruska suggested {{the construction of a new}} electron microscope for direct imaging of specimens inserted into the microscope, rather than simple mesh grids or images of apertures. With this device successful diffraction and normal imaging of an aluminium sheet was achieved. However the magnification achievable was lower than with light microscopy.

40|$|Abstract—Contaminants {{present in}} cotton have serious {{impact on the}} quality of <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> mainly in terms of {{fineness}} and strength of <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber.</b> The manual removal of cotton contaminants requires lot of manpower and is a time consuming process. So, in textile industries automatic cotton contamination detection is required as manual removal of contaminants has low efficiency. The detection of cotton contaminants is particularly challenging due to the large number of contaminant classes which are characterized by their vagueness and ambiguity based on their characteristics and due to their unpredictable size, shape, material and position as some of the contaminants get inside the <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> layer and become invisible and some are of same color as <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber.</b> Digital image processing algorithm based on machine vision provides accurate and efficient detection of contaminants in real-time. In this research, a comparison of HSI and YCbCr color model is presented in detecting and classifying contaminants. For detecting different types of contaminants, automatic thresholding is used. After detection, naive bayes classifier is used for differentiating different types of contaminants that worked on the principle of feature extracted from different contaminants from the <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber.</b> Shape descriptors like extent, solidity, area, orientation are used as features to distinguish contaminant classes.

Its quality has to be constantly improved to increase its competitive advantage over synthetic fibers and {{to keep up with the}} continuous modernization of spinning factories. Even though it is not a property of commercial value, fineness constitutes, along with length, strength, color and maturity, a major trait of fiber quality. The spinning of fine fiber results in reduced losses and the production of strong, uniform, lustrous, and soft-touch yarn. Literature. Genetic improvement combined with improved cultural practices: harvesting, ginning and storage have led to significant improvements in <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> length, maturity and strength. To date, cotton producers have not usually been interested in fineness because earlier studies, contrary to the more recent ones, have identified its correlation with reduced yield. In this review we present the factors that influence <b>cotton</b> <b>fiber</b> fineness and show possible ways to improve it. Conclusion. Any factor interfering with fiber growth and fiber development can influence fiber fineness. However, genetic influence is more important than the impact of the environment on fineness.
