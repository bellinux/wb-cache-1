40|$|This policy brief {{explores the}} dynamics, trends and {{challenges}} that <b>characterise</b> <b>portions</b> of the pastoral belt, spanning from Afghanistan to Somalia to Mauritania. Cases from ongoing trends in North-Eastern Somalia and Northern Mali provide interesting {{insights into the}} current structural crisis affecting {{a large part of}} the pastoral world. Pastoralism – mobile livestock rearing – is both a cultural identity and an economic activity. Moreover, herding represents the best way to safely occupy and secure vast, remote territories, where the costs of any other form of controlling, monitoring and patrolling would be largely higher. Although elements of heterogeneity exist, pastoral territories share similar geographical, economic as well as political configurations in the different regions of the world...|$|R

He is able to <b>characterise</b> analytically the <b>portions</b> of the parameters space that imply an "anti-Tobin" effect. This paper shows, by means of numerical methods, that the procedure used by Villieu to prove his result is biased when the elasticity of substitution between consumption and real money balances is low. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. Although the entire coastal strip {{is often referred to as}} Soconusco, Soconusco proper is the southeastern <b>portion</b> <b>characterised</b> by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands. The northwestern portion of the coastal strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of efficiently checking of integrity constraints in data base programming languages supporting subtyping and class hierarchies. More specifically, we consider two different problems: (1) statically reduce the number of constraints to be checked, and (2) generate an efficient run time checker. Using simple strategies, one can significantly improve the efficiency of the verification. We show how {{to reduce the number of}} constraints to be checked by <b>characterising</b> the <b>portions</b> of the database that are concerned by the constraints and involved in a transaction. We also show how to generate efficient algorithms for checking a large class of constraints (universally quantified conjunctive constraints). Last, we show how all the techniques presented took great advantage of the underlying type system which provide a significant help both in solving (1) and (2).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a weight sensitivity algorithm {{that can be}} used to investigate a portion of weight space of interest to the decision maker in a goal or multiple objective programme. The preferential information required from the decision maker is an initial estimate of their starting solution, with an equal weights solution being used as a default if this is not available, and preference information that will define the portion of weight space on which the sensitivity analysis is to be conducted. The different types of preferential information and how they are incorporated by the algorithm are discussed. The output of the algorithm is a set of distinct solutions that <b>characterise</b> the <b>portion</b> of weight space searched. The possible different output requirements of decision makers are detailed in the context of the algorithm. The methodology is demonstrated on two examples, one hypothetical and the other relating to predicting cinema-going behaviour. Conclusions and avenues for future research are given.

40|$|Barrierefreiheit is a {{key term}} in the German {{inclusion}} movement, in education and more generally. Sometimes translated as ‘accessibility’, it refers not just to absence of barriers but to freedom from barriers, which in turn indicates a significant social and ethical component. It signals an active, conscious intervention by agents, a consequence of agentic commitment towards crossing borders and overcoming boundaries. In this regard, this article seeks to provide an epistemological analysis and illustration of what ‘inclusive’, ‘barrier-free’ education means, by examining three ideas within social epistemology: epistemological access, epistemic paternalism and epistemic justice. In so doing, it articulates a position that might be called ‘context-sensitive realism’, which cautions against not only constructivist theoretical leanings but also the anti-individualism that <b>characterises</b> a substantial <b>portion</b> of the inclusive education literature...|$|R
40|$|Tropical dry {{deciduous}} forest is an endangered ecosystem whose plant-pollinator relationships are little known. We <b>characterised</b> a <b>portion</b> {{of the web}} of interactions between flowering plants and flower visitors in the Kirindy Forest of the Menabe region of west-central Madagascar. Taking a plant-centered approach, we observed individuals of the 5 most abundant native plant species that were coming into flower {{at the end of}} the annual dry season, and recorded all identifiable flower-visitors. Taking a visitor-centered approach, we walked a network of established trails and listened for distinctive calls of a common flower-visiting bird, noting the plant species visited. The former approach revealed connections among the early-flowering species via birds and insects, whereas the latter confirmed these connections and added an additional plant species. Flowers of the 6 plant species were visited on average by 5. 5 animal species, while 10 visitor species for which we had reasonable samples frequented on average the flowers of 3. 3 plant species. These qualitative results resemble those reported from other temperate and tropical webs, in that interactions appeared to be relatively generalised by pollinator species and body plan (e. g., birds vs. bees). Also in agreement, the visitation web was significantly nested, with more-specialised species tending to interact with mutualistic partners that were themselves more generalised. In addition to documenting previously-unreported interactions, therefore, this preliminary web conforms to more widespread patterns emerging for pollination systems at the community level...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} in Closed Access. The {{purpose of this}} study was to adapt wavelet {{analysis}} as a tool for discriminating speech samples taken from healthy subjects across two biological states. Speech pressure waveforms were drawn from a study on effects of hormone fluctuations across the menstrual cycle on language functions. Speech samples from the vowel portion of the syllable ‘pa’, taken at the low- and high-hormone phases of the menstrual cycle, were extracted for analysis. Initial analysis applied Fourier transforms to examine the fundamental and formant frequencies. Wavelet analysis was used to investigate spectral differences at a more microbehavioural level. The key finding showed that wavelet coefficients for the fundamental frequency of speech samples taken from the high-hormone phase had larger amplitudes than those from the low-hormone phase. This study provided evidence for differences in speech across the menstrual cycle that affected the vowel portion of syllables. This evidence complements existing data on the temporal features of speech that <b>characterise</b> the consonant <b>portion</b> of syllables. Wavelet analysis provides a new tool for examination of behavioural differences in speech linked to hormonal variation...|$|R

40|$|The Kambalda Nickel Mines are a type {{example of}} massive nickel {{sulphide}} deposits {{located in the}} 2. 7 Ga Archaean Eastern Goldfields Province, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. Nickel sulphide deposits are hosted in embayments, known as troughs, in the contact between Lunnon Basalt and the overlying Kambalda Komatiite. This contact is structurally complex {{as a result of}} several phases of compressive deformation after ore formation. The troughs and the orebodies they host define a linear pattern, trending NNW-SSE sub-parallel to each other and the regional structural trend. This thesis proposes a new model for the origin of these troughs which is based on a comparison with extensional structures seen in the Holocene volcanic fissure swarms of Iceland. It is argued that Kambalda ore troughs were originally similar extensional structures formed synvolcanically during a previously undocumented early extensional event. This early extension created the NNW-SSE tectonic grain that <b>characterises</b> the eastern <b>portion</b> ofthe Yilgarn Craton. The model is developed to explain unusual thrust structures on the Kambalda Dome. These thrusts represent footwall shortcuts formed during subsequent compressive deformation which partially inverted the original graben bounding faults. However three-dimensional kinematic modelling of the Kambalda Dome and Tramways fold-thrust structures suggests they are not inversion anticlines above the regional scale BoulderLefroy Fault. The relationship between these structures and the Boulder-Lefroy Fault remains ambiguous. It is suggested that the regional Foster, Tramways and Democrat-Republican thrusts are thick-skin structures, hence precluding models invoking a regional thrust duplex. The new model presented in this thesis for the early structural history of the Kambalda area provides an explanation for many of the geologic features observed today in the Kambalda areaEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The DOMON domain is {{a domain}} {{widespread}} in nature, predicted to fold in a β-sandwich structure. In plants, AIR 12 is constituted {{by a single}} DOMON domain located in the apoplastic space and is GPI-modified for anchoring to the plasma membrane. Arabidopsis thaliana AIR 12 has been heterologously expressed as a recombinant protein (recAtAIR 12) in Pichia pastoris. Spectrophotometrical analysis of the purified protein showed that recAtAir 12 is a cytochrome b. RecAtAIR 12 is highly glycosylated, it is reduced by ascorbate, superoxide and naftoquinones, oxidised by monodehydroascorbate and oxygen and insensitive to hydrogen peroxide. The addition of recAtAIR 12 to permeabilized plasma membranes containing NADH, FeEDTA and menadione, caused a statistically significant increase in hydroxyl radicals as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance. In these conditions, recAtAIR 12 has thus a pro-oxidant role. Interestingly, AIR 12 {{is related to the}} cytochrome domain of cellobiose dehydrogenase which is involved in lignin degradation, possibly via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In Arabidopsis the Air 12 promoter is specifically activated at sites where cell separations occur and ROS, including •OH, are involved in cell wall modifications. air 12 knock-out plants infected with Botrytis cinerea are more resistant than wild-type and air 12 complemented plants. Also during B. cinerea infection, cell wall modifications and ROS are involved. Our results thus suggest that AIR 12 could be involved in cell wall modifying reactions by interacting with ROS and ascorbate. CyDOMs are plasma membrane redox proteins of plants that are predicted to contain an apoplastic DOMON fused with a transmembrane cytochrome b 561 domain. CyDOMs have never been purified nor <b>characterised.</b> The trans-membrane <b>portion</b> of a soybean CyDOM was expressed in E. coli but purification could not be achieved. The DOMON domain was expressed in P. pastoris and shown to be itself a cytochrome b that could be reduced by ascorbate. ...|$|R
