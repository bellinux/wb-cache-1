50|$|Users unlock CPUs {{to allow}} underclocking, overclocking, and front side bus speed {{compatibility}} with certain motherboards, but unlocking invalidates the manufacturer's warranty and mistakes can cripple a CPU. However, locking a chip's clock multiplier {{does not necessarily}} prevent users from overclocking, as {{the speed of the}} front-side bus can still be changed to provide a performance increase. AMD Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs are generally unlocked by connecting bridges (jumper-like points) {{on the top of the}} CPU with <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> or pencil lead.

Nylon 6 are basically hygroscopic materials and difficult to plate and hence <b>conductive</b> <b>painting</b> procedure has been adopted for electroplating them.

40|$|Research {{has been}} {{continued}} to further improve the space durability of conductive and non-conductive polymer-based <b>paints</b> and of <b>conductive</b> thermal control <b>paints</b> for space applications. Efforts {{have been made}} to enhance the space durability and stability of functional Characteristics in ground-based space environment imitating conditions, using specially developed surface modification treatment. The results of surface modification of new <b>conductive</b> <b>paints,</b> including the ground-based testing in aggressive oxidative environments, such as atomic oxygen/UV and oxygen plasma, and performance evaluation are presented. Functional properties and performance characteristics, such as thermal optical properties (differential solar absorptance and thermal emittance representing the thermal optical performance of thermal control paints) and surface resistivity characteristics of pristine, surface modified, and tested materials were verified. Extensive surface analysis studies have been performed using complementary surface analyses including SEM/EDS and XPS. Test results revealed that the successfully treated materials exhibit reduced mass loss and no surface morphology change, thus indicating good protection from the severe oxidative environment. It was demonstrated that the developed surface modification treatment could be applied successfully to charge dissipative and <b>conductive</b> <b>paints...</b>|$|R
50|$|Secondary defoggers, such {{as those}} used on a vehicle's backglass and/or side view mirrors, often consist {{of a series of}} {{parallel}} linear resistive conductors in or on the glass. When power is applied, these conductors heat up, thawing ice and evaporating condensation from the glass. These conductors may be composed of a silver-ceramic material printed and baked onto the interior surface of the glass, or may be a series of very fine wires embedded within the glass. The surface-printed variety is prone to damage by abrasion, but can be repaired easily with a <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> material.|$|E

They {{are one of}} the few types of speakers in which the transducers themselves can be built from scratch by an amateur. Basic hardware for complete ESL DIY projects is available all over the web. Such supplies include resistors and capacitors for RC-circuit frequency equalization, if necessary; step-up transformers; perforated metal sheets or grids and insulating plastics for the stators; polymer film and <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> (e.g. a liquid graphite suspension) for the membrane; simple tensioning equipment for proper membrane tuning; and a frame, usually of wood, to hold everything together.

50|$|Connections {{are made}} to the paper by {{painting}} on areas of silver-loaded <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> and attaching wires to these, usually with spring clips. Each painted area has a low resistivity (relative to the carbon) and so may be assumed {{to be at a}} constant voltage. With the voltages applied, the current flow through the sheet will emulate the field distribution. Voltages may be measured within the sheet by applying a voltmeter probe (relative to one of the known electrodes) or current flows may be measured. As the sheet's resistivity is constant, the simplest way to measure a current flow is to use a small two-probe voltmeter to measure the voltage difference between the probes. As their spacing is known, and the resistivity, the resistance between them and (by Ohm's law) the current flow can be easily determined.|$|E

Unresponsive keys occur when this connection grows weak. This can be fixed by applying <b>conductive</b> silver <b>paint</b> (such as from a circuitwriter pen) to each graphite pad on the [...] "ribbon".

5000|$|... #Caption: A {{circular}} capacitor B, 7.7 cm in diameter, {{built from}} {{multiple layers of}} mica and tinfoil, was fitted into a smooth spherical celluloid ball D that was covered with <b>conductive</b> <b>paint,</b> and which was suspended by a fine phosphor-bronze wire 37 cm long within a grounded tube. The wire was connected to one electrode of a Wimshurst machine which kept alternate plates of the capacitor charged to 3000 volts. The opposite plates of the capacitor {{as well as the}} celluloid ball were kept at ground voltage by means of a platinum wire that dipped into a sulfuric acid bath that not only served as a conductive electrode, but also damped oscillations and acted as a desiccant. A mirror attached to the capacitor was viewed through a telescope and allowed fine changes in orientation to be viewed.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications is for thermal modelling. Voltage is the analog of temperature and current flow that of heat flow. If the boundaries of a heatsink model are both painted with <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> to form two separate electrodes, each may be held at a voltage to represent the temperatures of some internal heat source (such as a microprocessor chip) and the external ambient temperature. Potentials within the heatsink represent internal temperatures and current flows represent heat flow. In many cases the internal heat source may be modelled with a constant current source, rather than a voltage, giving a better analogy of power loss as heat, rather than assuming a simple constant temperature. If the external airflow is restricted, the 'ambient' electrode may be subdivided and each section connected to a common voltage supply through a resistor or current limiter, representing the proportionate or maximum heatflow capacity of that airstream.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} the system is that the heating {{elements}} can sometimes stop working, leaving {{one side of the}} screen uncleared. If this is the result of burn out, total replacement of the screen is the only remedy as the wires are actually embedded in the glass, (as opposed to a rear defogger, which can usually be repaired with <b>conductive</b> <b>paint).</b> The problem is sometimes caused by the power cable coming loose from its mounting near the base of the screen. The loose cable then catches on the windscreen wiper mechanism and fatigues over time. The remedy is then to reattach the wire to the foil {{at the base of the}} screen, but this can be problematic since the system requires such high current (~30 amps). Some owners have been known to smash the screen and submit a fraudulent insurance claim for stone damage, as Quickclear screens are expensive replacement parts and many insurance policies offer a low excess (deductible) for windscreen damage. This type of screen is also known to cause serious problems with tollway recording tags unless the tag is placed in the correct area behind the rearview mirror.|$|E
30|$|Conductive yarns, as per {{their name}} sounds, {{are capable of}} {{conducting}} electricity through them. Usually the textile materials (natural and synthetic), at standard atmospheric conditions, are very good electrical insulators {{with the exception of}} only few intrinsically conductive polymers such as polyacetylene, polyaniline, polypyrrole etc., which are capable of conducting charges (Maity et al. 2013). Non-conducting textile materials can be converted to conductive materials by either giving them surface treatments like <b>conductive</b> <b>paints,</b> ionic/electroless plating, vacuum metallization or by incorporating conductive fillers inside in a particular order (Cheng 2006). According to Duran and Kado lu (2014), certain properties of conductive textiles that includes: weight, flexibility, pliability, air permeability, porosity, comfort in wearing, less corrosiveness and lower cost of production, have made its use imperative in applications where electromagnetic shielding and static dissipation is required.|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} source such as {{a simple}} cathode is a cheap and light device which can serve several technological and scientific purposes in space: (1) electrostatic charging of a spacecraft can be limited by releasing electrons accumulated on the conductive elements of their surface; (2) the erosion of conductive coatings {{and the ability of}} <b>conductive</b> <b>paints</b> to withstand the space environment can be evaluated by monitoring the flow of charged particles impinging on their surface; (3) measuring the current collected by the spacecraft surface as a function of its potential with respect to an emitter is a very sensitive diagnostic technique which can yield a number of plasma parameters, such as density and temperature; (4) it is possible to convert the thermal motion of space plasmas into electrical energy by collecting energetic electrons and returning them to the medium as cold particles; (5) a wave in a plasma is characterized by a conduction current density which gives rise to fluctuations of the current flowing to the surface...|$|R
40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation (Oregon DOT) {{maintains}} {{more than}} 120 coastal bridges; many are reinforced concrete structures over 15 m (50 ft) in length. Twelve of these bridges are historic structures. Oregon DOT {{is concerned about}} the ongoing deterioration of these bridges, rising maintenance and repair costs, and the need to protect Oregon’s large investment in coastal bridges. Over 80, 000 m 2 (850, 000 ft 2) of coastal bridge surface have been repaired and protected from further chloride-induced corrosion damage by using conductive coating anodes. Most of the anode area is thermal-sprayed (TS) Zn.

50|$|Another {{narrow band}} design {{is to use}} a λ/4 length of metal pipe. The coaxial cable is placed inside the pipe; at one end the braid is wired to the pipe while at the other end no {{connection}} is made to the pipe. The balanced end of this balun is at the end where no connection is made to the pipe. The λ/4 conductor acts as a transformer, converting the zero impedance at the short to the braid into an infinite impedance at the open end. This infinite impedance at the open end of the pipe prevents current flowing into the outer coax formed by the outside of the inner coax shield and the pipe, forcing the current to remain in the inside coax. This balun design is not good for low frequencies because of the long length of pipe that will be needed. An easy way to make such a balun is to paint the outside of the coax with <b>conductive</b> <b>paint,</b> then to connect this paint to the braid through a break in the outer insulation 1/4 wave from the end. For both forms (pipe or paint), the length is dependent on the velocity factor for the outer transmission line.|$|E
5000|$|External {{triggering}} is {{the most}} common method of operation, especially for photographic use. The electrodes are charged to a voltage high enough to respond to triggering, but below the lamp's self-flash threshold. An extremely high voltage pulse, (usually between 2000 and 150,000 volts), the [...] "trigger pulse", is applied either directly to or very near the glass envelope. (Water-cooled flashtubes sometimes apply this pulse directly to the cooling water, and often to the housing of the unit as well, so care must be taken with this type of system.) The short, high voltage pulse creates a rising electrostatic field, which ionizes the gas inside the tube. The capacitance of the glass couples the trigger pulse into the envelope, where it exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas surrounding {{one or both of the}} electrodes, forming spark streamers. The streamers propagate via capacitance along the glass at a speed of 1 centimeter in 60 nanoseconds (170 km/s). (A trigger pulse must have a long enough duration to allow one streamer to reach the opposite electrode, or erratic triggering will result.) The triggering can be enhanced by applying the trigger pulse to a [...] "reference plane", which may be in the form of a metal band or reflector affixed to the glass, a <b>conductive</b> <b>paint,</b> or a thin wire wrapped around the length of the lamp. If the capacitor voltage is greater than the voltage drop between the cathode and the anode, when the internal spark streamers bridge the electrodes the capacitor will discharge through the ionized gas, heating the xenon to a high enough temperature for the emission light.|$|E

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} {{has emerged as}} an important branch of civil engineering in recent times, {{with the need to}} automatically monitor structural performance over time to ensure structural integrity. More recently, the advent of smart sensing materials has given this field a major boost. Research has shown that smart sensing materials fabricated with conductive filler at a concentration close to the percolation threshold results in high sensitivity to strain due to the piezoresistive effect. Of particular interest to this research are cementitious sensors fabricated using carbon black fillers. Carbon black is considered because of its widespread availability and low cost over other conductive fillers such as carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers. A challenge in the fabrication of these sensors is that cementitious materials require a significant amount of carbon black to percolate, resulting in a loss in mechanical properties. This research investigates a new method to accelerate percolation of the materials, enabling cementitious sensors with fewer carbon black particles. A carbon black-based <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> that allows earlier percolation by facilitating conducting networks in cementitious sensors is used. The <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> consists of a block copolymer, SEBS (styrene-co-ethylene-co-butylene-co-styrene), filled with carbon black particles. The percolation thresholds of sensors fabricated both with and without <b>conductive</b> <b>paint</b> are, as well as their strain sensing characteristics and compressive strength. The study found that SEBS could successfully reduce the percolation threshold by 42 %, and that samples with SEBS showed better electrical responses in dynamic conditions.

40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} have {{presented}} results on the simulation of electrostatically supported high speed rotary bells used in the automotive industry. Applying an extended version of FLUENT which includes the static electric field and the space charge effect due to the charged droplets, transfer efficiency and film thickness distribution of the coating processes of flat plates could be estimated to {{a high degree of}} accuracy. In the present contribution the obtained results are transferred to the case of high speed rotary bells with so-called external charging. This charging mechanism, using electrodes to produce a flux of free ions interacting with the paint droplets is mainly applied in the case of water based <b>conductive</b> <b>paints.</b> Hence, the existing program for direct charging atomisers has to be extended further, considering the following features: - calculation of the static local density of ion current and the corresponding space charge field - calculation of particle trajectories taking into account the transient charging within the flow domain In principle, the space charge field is calculated solving an additional conservation equation for the flow of ions. For the time dependent charging of the paint droplets existing models are applied using additional corrections factors based on experimental results of the local currents. Current results indicate a good agreement of the main features of measured and calculated static film thicknesses, e. g. the general geometry and the extention. This is also true for the transfer efficiency. Consequently, also the dynamic film thickness profiles, produced by the atomiser moving over a flat target, are very similar. As the next step, the program will be verified with respect to the sensitivity to parameter changes of the atomiser and more complex target geometries. Future applications of the program are not limited to the calculation of the coating process only. A potential task may be the development of improved atomizers...|$|R

The optimum electrical conductivity of 5. 33 × 10 - 4 S cm- 1 was obtained at 25 wt % CWM. It {{was found that the}} contact of the filler improves the electrical conductivity.

40|$|In years {{data have}} been {{collected}} on <b>conductive</b> therrnal-control <b>paints,</b> such as PCBZ {{and in order to}} evaluate their stability to the space environment. In addition to being considered for thermal control, the paints have been considered as an alternate material for use within on-orbit calibration systems. For example, several NASA/Earth Observing System and European Space Agency instruments to be flown later this decade will require bright, and spatially uniform surfaces to reflect sunlight into their camera fields-of-view. This will provide both an absolute calibration, by knowing the magnitude of the reflected light, and flat-field pixel-to-pixel comparisons within an instrument. Data are here, as by the Multi-angle Imaging and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer projects. Properties include factor, conductivity, thermal cycling, resistance, and environmental exposure stability. Finally, the suitability of thermal paints for calibration applications are compared to as t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} are to provide design criteria, techniques, materials, and test methods to ensure control of absolute and differential charging of spacecraft surfaces. The control of absolute and differential charging of spacecraft cannot be effected without {{the development of new}} and improved or modified materials or techniques that will provide electrical continuity over the surface of the spacecraft. The materials' photoemission, secondary emission, thermooptical, physical, and electrical properties in the space vacuum environment both in the presence and absence of electrical stress and ultraviolet, electron, and particulate radiation, are important to the achievement of charge control. The materials must be stable or have predictable response to exposure to the space environment for long periods of time.
