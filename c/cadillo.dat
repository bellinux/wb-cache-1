5000|$|The Luís Jiménez Show was {{canceled}} abruptly by Univisión Radio on July 22, 2014 without explanation. Members {{of the show}} have expressed on their own that the show will continue, not being specific if in Univisión Radio or elsewhere, and Carolina <b>Cadillo</b> posted on her Facebook page that [...] "The best is yet to come".|$|E
5000|$|Its {{common names}} include coatbuttons and tridax daisy in English, jayanthi in Kannada, <b>cadillo</b> chisaca in Spanish, herbe caille in French, jayanti veda in Sanskrit, ghamra in Hindi, bishalya karani (ବିଶଲ୍ୟକରଣୀ) in Oriya, kambarmodi in Marathi, gayapaaku (గాయపాకు) & gaddi chemanthi (గడ్డి చామంతి) in Telugu,vettukaaya poondu or kinatruppasan (கிணற்றுப்பாசான்) in Tamil, kotobukigiku in Japanese and tīn túkkæ (ตีนตุ๊กแก; [...] "gecko feet") in Thai.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the creek}} {{was known as}} Arroyo de los <b>Cadillos</b> which means [...] "Cockleburr Creek" [...] in Spanish. Simon Theodore Finger settled on the Redwood City side of the creek in 1855 and planted a {{vineyard}} as well as olives. Born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1816, Theodore (as he was known) was listed in the 1860 U.S. Census as a farmer. The Arroyo de los <b>Cadillos</b> was generally misspelled as Cordillas. By 1862, it was known as Finger's Arroyo, then later Finger's Creek or Finger Creek. In 1877 the San Mateo County map shows it as Cordillas Creek; the Wellesley Park subdivision map labelled it Cordilleras Creek in 1888, and the USGS accepted this name in 1895. Local residents still called it Finger Creek for many years.|$|R
50|$|Francis Méndez reads regular {{news at the}} top of {{the hour}} (not the same as Hablando Plepla), but injecting humorous slang phrases to the headlines. This goes in sharp {{contrast}} to the serious, almost dead-panned delivery of the show's sports announcer, Cuban-born Renato Murphy, as well as that of <b>Cadillo's</b> traffic report. The result is almost as odd as the Noticias Locas segment itself.|$|R
50|$|Each {{member of}} the team is known for a {{perceived}} self-avowed defect or particularity: Luis Jiménez claims to have undersized genitalia and hypospadias, Moonshadow has an inguinal hernia but reportedly has the fastest tongue in American radio history; Francis Méndez is allegedly a former cocaine addict who now suffers from erectile dysfunction as a result, Carolina <b>Cadillo</b> is a proud nymphomaniac who speaks Spanish with a noticeable English accent (Spanish is her second language) and who has virtually no buttocks, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Jiménez and Moonshadow {{do not act}} alone: {{besides a}} {{sizeable}} audience participation, the show's announcers and assistant producers (called the Mequetrefes, or Whippersnappers) are key {{to the success of}} the show. This ragtag group feature a female traffic announcer (Carolina <b>Cadillo,</b> born in Newark, New Jersey, of Peruvian and Nicaraguan descent), a rather peculiar news announcer (Francis Méndez, born in Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic), the show's main audio producer (DJ Chucky), its call screeners and production assistants (Tony Sánchez, Bocachula, El Papichulo, etc.), and the like. The show's executive producer, María Eugenia Alma, appears sporadically in the show, particularly as female singer and occasional phone call prankster.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{incorporate}} mucilaginous solutions in the juice clarification process as an alternative for improving the final products that are produced in the agribusiness panela in Ecuador. The {{study was conducted with}} 14 mucilaginous plants properties, five plant species: Mallow wild (Malva peruviana L.), Yausabara (Pavonia sepium A. St-Hil) Yausa (Abutilon famous Planch), black <b>Cadillo</b> (Triumfetta Lappula L) and False Joaquín (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), it was obtained excellent results as clarifying agents. Three factors were assayed experimentally such as solution concentration, amount of solution added to the juice and incorporation temperature on two levels, judged by turbidity variable as a response. The results indicated that the factors tested affect significantly the juice clarification (clear and bright) and the best results were achieved with turbidity (Yausabara and Yausa Malva silvestre, Falso Joaquín y <b>Cadillo</b> negro) and with the combinations obtaining juices...|$|E
