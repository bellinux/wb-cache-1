40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>clentiazem</b> were assessed in 199 patients with stable angina in a dose-ranging, placebocontrolled, double-blind, parallel design study. Background. To date, {{this is the first}} large {{efficacy and}} safety study of <b>clentiazem</b> in patients with stable angina. Methods. After washout and a 1 -week placebo run-in period, patients received 20, 40, 80 or 120 mg/day of <b>clentiazem</b> tablets or placebo as a twice-daily dosage for 1 week of treatment after 1 week of dose titratlon. A symptom-limited exercise tolerance test was performed 4 and 12 h after dosing at the end of treatment and results were compared with baseline measurements. Results. At 4 h after dosing, improvement of exercise duration from baseline value was significantly greater with <b>clentiazem</b> at doses of 40 mg/day (63 ± 11 s), 80 mg/day (99 ± 10 s) and 120 mg/day (70 ± 11 s) than with placebo (34 ± 10 s). Moreover, <b>clentiazem</b> (80 and 120 mg/day) increased the time to onset of angina and to ≥ 1 mm of ST segment depression significantly more than did placebo. At submaximal exercise, <b>clentiazem</b> (40, 80 and 120 mg/day) decreased rate-pressure product, mainly {{as a result of a}} decrease in heart rate. At 12 h after dosing, improvement of exercise duration from baseline was significantly greater with <b>clentiazem</b> in doses of 80 mg/day (77 ± 9 s) and 120 mg/day (70 ± 10 s) than with placebo (42 ± 9 s). The incidence of treatmentrelated adverse events with placebo (27 %) and <b>clentiazem</b> (29 %) was similar. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events with <b>clentiazem</b> were asthenia, headache (both 7. 9 %), first-degree atrioventricular block and dizziness (both 4. 4 %). Conclusions. The results of this short-term study suggest that <b>clentiazem</b> given twice daily in doses of 80 or 120 mg/day is safe and effective monotherapy in the treatment of stable angina...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of <b>clentiazem,</b> a calcium channel blocker (1) on the {{accumulation}} of lipid in the aorta, (2) {{on the level of}} plasma lipids, and (3) on the number of adherent intimal monocytes and foam cells. Seventy Wistar rats were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) regular diet, (2) an atherogenic diet consisting of regular chow with 2 % cholesterol, 1 % cholic acid, and 0. 5 % thiouracil (CCT), (3) CCT supplemented with 5 mg/kg/day <b>clentiazem,</b> and (4) CCT with 25 mg/kg/day <b>clentiazem.</b> Animals were sacrificed after 6 or 12 weeks of diet. Aortas were studied by light microscopy after staining with oil red O (ORO) and/or hematoxylin. ORO staining was quantified in both abdominal and thoracic regions of the aorta. The aortas of the <b>clentiazem</b> groups demonstrated significantly less ORO staining than CCT diet controls in thoracic aorta after 6 weeks and abdominal aorta after 12 weeks. There {{was no significant difference in}} the plasma lipid concentrations. The clentiazem-treated groups had fewer numbers of adherent monocytes and foam cells. We conclude that <b>clentiazem</b> inhibits lipid deposition in cholesterol-fed rats without lowering plasma lipid concentrations and that the number of intimal monocytes and foam cells is decreased in the presence of this calcium antagonist...|$|E
40|$|Abstract[3 H]Azidobutyryl <b>clentiazem,</b> a new {{photoactivatable}} diltiazem derivative, has {{a higher}} binding affinity than azidobutyryl diltiazem. It can be covalently incorporated into the α 1 subunit of the skeletal muscle calcium channel by UV irradiation, which allows the benzothiazepine binding site to be determined. The photolabeled α 1 subunit and its proteolytic fragments were analyzed with a panel of sequence-directed antibodies. The {{results suggest that the}} linker region between segment S 5 and S 6 of domain IV is involved in benzothiazepine binding. This site is different from the dihydropyridine and verapamil binding sites...|$|E
