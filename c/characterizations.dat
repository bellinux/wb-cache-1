These negative <b>characterizations</b> persisted in foreign scholarly literature until the mid-1970s. Recent academic research has recast Ranavalona's actions as those of a queen attempting to expand her empire while protecting Malagasy sovereignty against the encroachment of European cultural and political influence.|$|E
5|$|Film {{producers}} Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown {{read the}} novel before its publication {{and bought the}} film rights, selecting Steven Spielberg to direct the film adaptation. The Jaws film, released in June 1975, omitted many of the novel's minor subplots, focusing more on the shark and the <b>characterizations</b> of the three protagonists. Jaws became the highest-grossing movie in history up to that point, becoming a watershed film in motion picture history {{and the father of}} the summer blockbuster film.

40|$|AbstractA {{constructive}} <b>characterization</b> of {{the class}} of minimally 3 -connected graphs is presented. This yields a new <b>characterization</b> for the class of 3 -connected graphs, which differs from the <b>characterization</b> provided by Tutte. Where Tutte's <b>characterization</b> requires the set of all wheels as a starting set, the new <b>characterization</b> requires only the graph K 4. The new <b>characterization</b> is based on the application of graph operations to appropriate vertex and edge sets in minimally 3 -connected graphs...|$|R
40|$|Modeling is {{the basis}} for any {{experimental}} <b>characterization</b> and is therefore a key in the <b>characterization</b> of soil water and chemical fate and transport processes. Before undertaking any process of <b>characterization,</b> it is necessary to use a conceptual model rather than a numerical model. This point of view considers modeling to be the starting point for any soil <b>characterization</b> process. It {{is important to note that}} the end result of <b>characterization</b> efforts is to describe how the processes will evolve in space and time through a mathematical model. The <b>characterization</b> process is based on modeling while soil process simulation modeling builds on the results of the soil <b>characterization.</b> This chapter discusses the <b>characterization</b> of water content and soil process...|$|R

40|$|We first give a full <b>characterization</b> of average-case quantum one-way permutations. Our <b>characterization</b> is an {{extension}} of the <b>characterization</b> of worst-case quantum one-way permutations (or, a partial <b>characterization</b> of average-case quantum one-way permutations) by Kashefi, Nishimura and Vedral. As in the previous results, our <b>characterization</b> is also written in terms of reflection operator and pseudo identity. To prove the full <b>characterization</b> of average-case quantum one-way permutations, we incorporate their basic ideas with the universal hashing technique and modify the reduction between inverting average-case quantum one-way permutation and another problem appeared in the <b>characterization</b> of worst-case quantum one-way permutations. In a sense, our <b>characterization</b> says that the hardness of inverting quantum one-way permutations comes from the hardness to efficiently implement some reflection operators. ...|$|R

The Firebrand has been overshadowed by the popularity of The Mists of Avalon, receiving less attention and critical praise. Reviews of the book ranged from mixed to positive, with many literary critics praising Bradley's ability to give new <b>characterizations</b> to legendary figures. It has been translated into at least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the initial}} <b>characterizations</b> of tsunami {{earthquakes}} came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E
