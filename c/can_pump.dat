5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E

25|$|The blood–brain barrier poses a {{difficult}} obstacle to pass to deliver chemotherapy to the brain. This {{is because the}} brain has an extensive system in place {{to protect it from}} harmful chemicals. Drug transporters <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> out drugs from the brain and brain's blood vessel cells into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood circulation. These transporters pump out most chemotherapy drugs, which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors. Only small lipophilic alkylating agents such as lomustine or temozolomide are able to cross this blood–brain barrier.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, {{energy storage}} is {{economical}} when the marginal {{cost of electricity}} varies more than the costs of storing and retrieving the energy plus the price of energy lost in the process. For instance, assume a pumped-storage reservoir <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> to its upper reservoir a volume of water capable of producing 1,200 MW·h after all losses are factored in (evaporation and seeping in the reservoir, efficiency losses, etc.). If the marginal cost of electricity during off-peak times is $15 per MW·h, and the reservoir operates at 75% efficiency (i.e., 1,600 MW·h are consumed and 1,200 MW·h of energy are retrieved), then {{the total cost of}} filling the reservoir is $24,000. If all of the stored energy is sold the following day during peak hours for an average $40 per MW·h, then the reservoir will see revenues of $48,000 for the day, for a gross profit of $24,000.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 65 The {{replacement}} of conventional bearings with magnetic bearings in a <b>canned</b> motor <b>pump</b> is discussed. The primary objective was {{the development of}} a long life bearings for <b>canned</b> motor <b>pumps.</b> The research project was a joint effort between the University of Virginia, Kingsbury, Incorporated, and Goulds Pump Company. The research team designed, constructed and tested the bearings in a 20 hp, 300 gpm, single stage centrifugal <b>canned</b> motor <b>pump</b> running at 3600 rpm. Both magnetic radial and thrust bearings were incorporated in retrofitted bearing housings. Displacement probes sensed the shaft position near the bearings. Control electronics then employed the displacement signal as the feedback signal to control the level of current in the magnets. Proportional-integral-derivative type analog controls were used. The bearings were successfully installed and tested. Performance and vibration tests were conducted on the <b>canned</b> motor <b>pump</b> with the original bearings and with the magnetic bearings. No significant change was found in the pump performance but some small changes were observed in the pump vibration characteristics.

From the surge tanks the tunnels each turn into a [...] long penstocks which delivers water to the power station which is located underground near the lower reservoir.

500|$|The word maser {{derives from}} the acronym MASER, which stands for [...] "Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation". The maser is a {{predecessor}} to lasers, which operate at optical wavelengths, and is named by the replacement of [...] "microwave" [...] with [...] "light". Given a system of atoms or molecules, each with different energy states, an atom or molecule may absorb a photon and move to a higher energy level, or the photon may stimulate emission of another photon of the same energy and cause a transition to a lower energy level. Producing a maser requires population inversion, which is when a system has more members in a higher energy level relative to a lower energy level. In such a situation, more photons will be produced by stimulated emission than will be absorbed. Such a system is not in thermal equilibrium, and as such requires special conditions to occur. Specifically, it must have some energy source that <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> the atoms or molecules to the excited state. Once population inversion occurs, a photon with a photon energy corresponding to the energy difference between two states can then produce stimulated emission of another photon of the same energy. The atom or molecule will drop to the lower energy level, {{and there will be}} two photons of the same energy, where before there was only one. The repetition of this process is what leads to amplification, and since all of the photons are the same energy, the light produced is monochromatic.|$|E
