40|$|Recasting of {{the casting}} alloys affects the {{composition}} and elemental release which may have cytotoxic effect different from the pure alloy in the surrounding tissues. An Invitro {{study was conducted to}} investigate the elemental release and their cytotoxic effects from commercially available Ni–Cr dental casting alloys, commonly used for fabricating fixed partial dentures. Three Ni–Cr alloys [Wiron 99 (A), <b>Ceramet</b> (B), and Hi Nickel CB (C) ] were tested. Alloy specimens (disks 3  ×  5  mm) were casted and grouped as follows: Group I (A 1 /B 1 /C 1) : 100 % pure alloy; Group II (A 2 /B 2 /C 2) : 50 % new with 50 % recast; and Group III (A 3 /B 3 /C 3) : 100 % recast. Disks of each alloy type from each group were transferred to Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium and left for 3  days at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2. Ni, Cr, Co, Cu and Mo elemental release from metal alloys into culture medium was investigated using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Cytotoxicity was tested using mouse fibroblast cells and MTT Assay. Controls consisted of 6 wells containing cells with no alloy specimens. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by t-test. The total amount of elements released in parts per billion for various casting groups were Group I, A 1 - 6. 572, B 1 - 6. 732, C 1 - 8. 407; Group II, A 2 - 22. 046, B 2 - 26. 450, C 2 - 29. 189; Group III, A 3 - 84. 554, B 3 - 88. 359, C 3 - 92. 264. More amounts of elements were released in Hi Nickel CB than <b>Ceramet</b> and Wiron 99 in all the three test groups. Percentage of viable cells from MTT analysis were Group I, A 1 - 62. 342, B 1 - 61. 322 C 1 - 60. 593, Group II, A 2 - 58. 699, B 2 - 56. 494, C 2 - 52. 688, Group III, A 3 - 53. 101, B 3 - 52. 195, C 3 - 47. 586. The viable cells present in the culture media were more in Wiron 99 than <b>Ceramet</b> and Hi Nickel CB. Elemental release increased with amount of recast alloy. Amongst the three alloys tested Hi Nickel CB had significantly higher elements released compared to <b>Ceramet</b> and Wiron 99 in 100 % pure alloys, 50 % recast and 100 % recast alloys. Wiron 99 showed least element release in 100 % pure alloy, 50 % recast and 100 % recast specimens. 100 % pure alloys of all three alloys are less cytotoxic, but their cytotoxicity is more on 50 % and 100 % re-casted alloys. Out of all three variations of casting Wiron 99 was least cytotoxic, followed by <b>Ceramet</b> and Hi Nickel CB. Recasting of alloys significantly increased the elements released and their cytotoxicity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new cermet sinter with sweat-gland micro-pore {{structure}} {{has been developed}} by powder metallurgy technology in vacuum. The effects of the pore-forming materials on micro-pore structure and Y 2 O 3 additions as well mechanical properties of TiC/FeCrWMoV cermets were investigated. Some typical sweat-gland micro-pores were formed while compound additives TiH 2 and CaCO 3 adding into the sinter matrix. The porosity of the cermet sinters changes from 20 % to 28 % with the compound additives from 6 % to 8 %, and the micro-pores of sinters exist a regularized and interpenetrated network structure just like human’s sweat-gland one and obeying to Rayleigh Distribution. As such the sinters could be easily infiltrated with high-temperature solid lubricant. For improving {{the property of the}} <b>ceramet</b> sinter, the elements Y 2 O 3 of 0. 6 ～ 0. 8 % (vol. fraction) was also added into the sinter matrix and its effect on the sinter has been also discussed...|$|E
