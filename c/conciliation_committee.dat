While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E

They also add to the literature by underlining the fact that ambiguity in which rule to apply, or how to interpret a given rule, is not a necessary condition for these procedural choices. The results are thus not only relevant to scholars interested in bicameral bargaining, but also to scholars with a general interest in rule application...|$|R

Members of the Socialist Party group called for the transition features of the Mehaignerie Law (introduced under the previous Chirac Government) to be made permanent. Under these features, most rents would not be free, but would instead “be set by negotiation between landlord and tenant and subject to arbitration by <b>conciliation</b> <b>committees,</b> with rent increases being based on comparable rents in the area.” In partial response to this call, a law was passed in January 1989 which called for “spreading out rent increases exceeding 10 percent over six years and required that all proposals from landlords to increase rents had to include proof that there were comparable rents in the neighbourhood.” A Ministry for Cities was set up in 1990 to work against ‘exclusion’ of all kinds, by developing a strategy to target physical, social, economic and educational issues in an integrated way. That same year, the Grands Projets Urbains (GPU) were launched, largely physical projects targeting 14 particularly deprived urban neighbourhoods which aimed for a thorough restructuring of the estates. In March 1991, the “dotation generale defonctionnement” was reformed to redistribute transfers from richer to poorer localities.|$|R

She and Unwin opposed the Boer War (1899–1902); both were founder-members of the pro-Boer South African <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Committee,</b> Cobden acting as the committee's secretary. The couple settled in South Kensington, from where Cobden continued to pursue her own causes. In 1893, with Laura Ormiston Chant, she represented the WFL in Chicago at the World Congress of Representative Women. At home, she assisted women candidates in the 1894 Kensington [...] "vestry" [...] elections.

40|$|Family Affairs Conciliation (Jinji Chotei) Act {{enacted in}} 1939, had {{operated}} from July 1, 1939 to December 31, 1947. Up to 1939, in our Japanese judicial procedures under the modern legal system, {{we had not}} known any official or formal way to solve or adjust the family affairs troubles except formal lawsuit way, where the strict or rigid procedure did not invariably fit into the "characteristics" of the domestic relation problems. Since 1919, {{in accordance with the}} complicating tendency in family relations mainly due to so-called "Family System", it had been urged that the Civil Code provision of Family and Succession should be revised and the Family Court should be established, where the family relations were to be adjusted and regulated by means of special procedure. In the meantime, in 1937 there happened Sino-Japanese Incident, and the family affairs troubles were increased especially in the bereaved families. So the judicial authorities dared to codify the conciliation procedure only, setting aside the substantial revision of Code Civil. In other words, this particular circumstances due to the "Incident" had partly prompted the codification of Family Affair Conciliation "procedure" and partly checked the "material" revision of the Family and Succession provision before the War II. Judicial authorities hastened to draw up a bill of Family Affair Conciliation Act. The bill which consisted of 12 articles was proposed, approved and enforced promptly, in 1939. We should take notice {{of the fact that the}} leading principles of this 1939 Act was not any "rule of legal principle", but a "rule of Moralism (Dogi) and Paternalism (Onjo) ". Well, how would be the actual circumstances of applications, under this Act during nine years? What would be the factual meaning and function of the conciliation including both sides "procedural" and "material"? It is important to answer these questions at the point of view that the Conciliation under the 1939 Act (Jinji Chotei) was, to say the least of it, the antecedent of the present Family Affairs Conciliation under the 1948 Act (Kaji Chotei). But, in order to answer these questions we should do a great many of preparatory works, of course. This study aims to prepare the answer these questions as possible and to find a clue to the next study of the present Family Affairs Conciliation under 1948 Act (Kaji Chotei). There in this issue, I will introduce: the outline of legislative process of the Act (II), and the actual applications of the Act, based on some materials and cases (arranged categorically) (III), that were in some County Court's <b>Conciliation</b> <b>Committees</b> at Simozuma (1), Ninohe (2), and Osaka (3) ...|$|R
40|$|Cet article identifie quels sont, parmi 21 objectifs et 23 comportements des parties durant la conciliation, ceux qui sont reliés à l'efficacité du processus. Les données ont été recueillies par {{questionnaire}} auprès de 732 porte-parole patronaux et syndicaux ayant oeuvré en conciliation volontaire au Québec en 1987 - 88. Le résultat le plus frappant est que les objectifs poursuivis par chacune des parties n'agissent à peu près pas sur l'issue du processus. This {{paper is}} {{the first of a series}} of two articles describing the results of a research project on the efficiency of compulsory and voluntary conciliation procedures in Quebec. The similarity between these two procedures having been established in a previous paper (Ross and Brossard 1990), the purpose of the present study is to analyze how the objectives and attitudes of the parties affects the efficiency of conciliation. This first article pertains exclusively to the voluntary conciliation System which was established in Quebec in 1978. The extensive literature on conciliation procedure efficiency may be divided into three categories, i. e., the intervention context, the conciliator, and the negotiating parties. However, in the third case, where the analysis focuses on the parties, the emphasis is mostly on their characteristics and on the nature of their relationship. It is less common for researchers to explore the intentions and attitudes of the parties during conciliation. In view of this gap in the research field, authors like Kochan suggest that the parties themselves be observed closely (Kochan and Jick 1978). In order to analyze the objectives of the parties, a typology was developed and validated by specialists with extensive knowledge of the procedure. This typology includes 21 objectives divided into three large categories. These objectives are listed in Table 1. A questionnaire probing the objectives of each party was sent to 732 management and union spokespersons. Table 2 shows which objectives are viewed as having priority by each of the parties. Specific objectives considered most important by each party are displayed in Table 3. The results show that the parties are very much alike from this standpoint. Various tactics used during conciliation were also drawn upon to develop a typology to analyze attitudes. The 23 tactics shown in Table 4 are divided into six categories, each one referring to an important feature of the conciliation procedure: importance given to conciliation in the overall collective bargaining strategy; accessibility of the <b>conciliation</b> procedure; negotiation <b>committee</b> members and rights; collective bargaining content; choice of conciliator and current pressure tactics. A questionnaire consisting of 49 specific questions was important in precisely identifying the parties' attitudes. Three categories were defined regarding the efficiency — the most efficient cases, the more or less efficient cases, and the truly less efficient cases - according to a method described in a previous article (Ross and Brossard 1990). The findings of this research show primarily that only one objective (out of 21) is linked to efficiency (whatever the type of tactic) and that 11 out of 23 tactics seem to have some effect on the outcome of the conciliation. Table 5 demonstrates which objective and tactics are related to the procedure efficiency. It also identifies the importance of the relation between each of the significant variables and the procedure efficiency. The study suggests that those variables which are related to the parties matter as much in explaining the phenomenon as the more contextual variables, namely the resort to conciliation, the duration of the conciliation procedure, union status (independent or affiliated), etc. These early results lay the groundwork for a comparison between compulsory and voluntary conciliation, to be pursued in a subsequent article...|$|R

2500|$|To {{make new}} legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the [...] "ordinary {{legislative}} procedure" [...] that applies for most EU acts.

On its side, [...] the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve a proposal, but by unanimity to amend the Commission's proposal. [...] If the Parliament and Council have not adopted an identical text after two readings, a <b>Conciliation</b> <b>committee</b> meets to find a compromise, which must be submitted to a third reading in each for final approval. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council: the adoption of EU law thus requires a high threshold, but once adopted it is also harder to change.
