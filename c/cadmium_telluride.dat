Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cadmium</b> zinc <b>telluride</b> has {{experienced}} tremendous growth in {{its application to}} various radiation sensing problems {{over the last five}} years. However, there are still issues with yield, particularly of the large volume devices needed for imaging and sensitivity-critical applications. Inhomogeneities of various types and on various length scales currently prevent the fabrication of large devices of high spectral performance. This paper discusses the development of a set of characterization tools for quantifying these inhomogeneities, in order to develop improvement strategies to achieve the desired <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>telluride</b> crystals for detector fabrication...|$|R
40|$|Using a new {{electrodeposition}} process, thin-film <b>cadmium</b> mercury <b>telluride,</b> Cd=Hg~_=Te, with (1 - x) {{no greater}} than 0. 4, was electrodeposited onto an indium tin oxide-coated glass cathode. The deposition bath contained Cd(II), Hg(II), and tri-n-butyl phosphine telluride in propylene carbonate, and its composition {{was shown to}} have adirect effect on the com-position of the electrodeposited films. Film composition was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and by pro-ton-induced x-ray emission. Structural analysis of the <b>cadmium</b> ercury <b>telluride</b> films was achieved by way of scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffractometry. Crystallinity of the films was shown to increase following heat-treatment i either argon or air. The bandgaps, which were determined by measuring the optical absorption spectra of these materials, were shown to decrease with increasing (1 - x), as predicted by an empirical expression. Of great practical importance and versatility is the ternary chalcogenide; <b>cadmium</b> mercury <b>telluride</b> (Cd=Hgl-xTe or CMT).

5|$|Tellurium, {{which is}} a {{semiconductor}} in its standard state, is used mainly as a component in type II/VI semiconducting-chalcogenides; these have applications in electro-optics and electronics. <b>Cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> (CdTe) is used in solar modules for its high conversion efficiency, low manufacturing costs, and large band gap of 1.44 eV, letting it absorb {{a wide range of}} wavelengths. Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), alloyed with selenium and antimony, is a component of thermoelectric devices used for refrigeration or portable power generation.|$|E
5|$|Being a soft metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> solar panels.|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this LDRD project was to develop {{technology}} for a miniature gamma-ray camera for use in nuclear medicine. The camera will meet a need of the medical community for an improved means to image radio-pharmaceuticals in the body. In addition, this technology-with only slight modifications-should prove useful in applications requiring the monitoring and verification of special nuclear materials (SNMs). Utilization of the good energy resolution of mercuric iodide and <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>telluride</b> detectors provides a means for rejecting scattered gamma-rays and improving the isotopic selectivity in gamma-ray images. The first year of this project involved fabrication and testing of a monolithic mercuric iodide and <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>telluride</b> detector arrays and appropriate collimators/apertures.

5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550megawatt (MWAC) {{photovoltaic}} {{power station}} approximately six miles north of Desert Center, California, in the Mojave Desert. It uses approximately 8.8 million <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> modules made by the US thin-film manufacturer First Solar. As of Fall 2015, the Solar Farm has the same 550MW installed capacity as the Topaz Solar Farm in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California, making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar plants by installed capacity.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. Promethium, lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, nickel-metal hydride, and button cell batteries.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cadmium</b> zinc <b>telluride</b> {{radiation}} detectors {{can operate}} in direct-conversion (or photoconductive) mode at room temperature, unlike some other materials (particularly germanium) which require liquid nitrogen cooling.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} {{quantum dots}} have been encapsulated in a poly(methyl methacrylate) film {{and used as}} a luminescent downshifting layer on <b>cadmium</b> sulfide/cadmium <b>telluride</b> photovoltaic devices.

Today the global market share of CdTe is 5.4%, up from 4.7% in 2008. This technology’s highest power conversion efficiency is 21%. The cell structure includes glass substrate (around 2mm), transparent conductor layer, CdS buffer layer (50–150nm), CdTe absorber and a metal contact layer.|$|E
25|$|Another newer technology, {{thin-film}} PV, {{are manufactured}} by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum.

After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.|$|E

25|$|At {{the present}} time, {{the price of}} the raw {{materials}} cadmium and tellurium are a negligible proportion of the cost of CdTe solar cells and other CdTe devices.
