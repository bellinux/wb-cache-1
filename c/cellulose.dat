It was eventually made available in a powder form from which it was readily injection moulded. Arthur Eichengrün developed the first injection moulding press in 1919.

5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible <b>cellulose</b> fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising <b>cellulose</b> sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of <b>cellulose</b> contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into cellulosic ethanol. This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the <b>cellulose</b> into sugars, followed by the fermentation of the sugars into ethanol. Microbes also produce {{a variety of sources}} of bioenergy including methane and hydrogen.|$|E
30|$|Based {{on those}} results above, {{it can be}} seen that group II <b>celluloses</b> {{dominated}} both the hydrolyzed and degraded products as compared to group I <b>celluloses.</b> The result on the WS portions at 270  °C/ 10  MPa/ 15  min revealed that the degree of difficulty for decomposition is greater for <b>celluloses</b> in group I than those in group II.|$|R
30|$|The <b>celluloses</b> were {{dissolved}} in 0.5  M cupriethylenediamine (Cuen) by viscometry as per TAPPI method [36]. The DP of the <b>celluloses</b> was then {{calculated from the}} intrinsic viscosity [η] according to the equation DP 0.905  =  0.75 [η] [37]. For the crystallinity determination, Gaussian functions were used to deconvolute the XRD patterns of various crystalline <b>celluloses</b> [38].

5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and <b>cellulose</b> in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the <b>cellulose</b> intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E

5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is {{the interaction between}} protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest <b>cellulose,</b> such as ruminants and termites. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant <b>cellulose</b> to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E
40|$|Water-soluble quaternized <b>celluloses</b> {{with various}} {{substitution}} degrees were prepared. The polymers showed excellent flocculation ability against anionic dyes; this ability was strongly {{dependent on the}} substituent degree and not affected by the temperature and pH of the dye solution. The flocculation ability was accurately fitted by a pseudo-second order kinetic model, which enabled reliable predictions of the flocculation behavior. In addition, the flocculation behavior of the anionic dyes followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, whose analysis revealed the maximum anionic dye coagulation/flocculation capacity. The quaternized <b>celluloses</b> could be regenerated by washing in NaOH solution and precipitation in acetone. The quaternized <b>celluloses</b> exhibited good biodegradability, with a maximum degradation of 48 % within 48 [*]h using cellulase. These encouraging {{results indicate that the}} cationic <b>celluloses</b> could be applicable for use as reusable flocculants for wastewater treatment, leading to an environmentally friendly method to the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions...|$|R
30|$|The {{prepared}} cell IIII {{and cell}} IIIII were further {{used for the}} preparation of <b>celluloses</b> IVI (cell IVI) and IVII (cell IVII), by firstly soaking them in glycerol for 3  days at ambient condition. They were then heated in a reaction vessel at 260  °C/ 0.6  MPa for 30  min and cooled down to ambient condition [34]. The product was, then, washed with water and acetone successively, and dried in vacuum. Basically, the converted <b>celluloses</b> consisted of group I (celI I, cell IIII, cell IVI) and group II (cell II, cell IIIII, cell IVII). Their chemical compositions were also analyzed and all these <b>celluloses</b> were found to contain similar monosaccharide components of about 99.9  wt% glucose and 0.1  wt% xylose [35].|$|R
40|$|TEMPO-mediated {{oxidation}} {{has been}} reported to effectively convert C 6 primary hydroxyl groups to carboxyl groups for better water-solubility. However, the pH decreases continuously during the oxidation process, and it is therefore difficult to maintain the stability of the reaction. The control of pH at a constant level throughout the oxidation process is a complicated task. The applicability of a carbonate buffer system and a borax buffer system with various continuous addition rate of sodium hypochlorite solution was considered. Carbonate buffer solution and borax buffer solution can efficiently buffer the pH. The results of carboxyl content and DP of <b>celluloses</b> proved that the activities of sodium hypochlorite solution can be maintained when sodium hypochlorite is added with controlled flow rates without adjusting pH by hydrochloric acid. Buffer solutions created a milder reaction environment in which the damage of <b>celluloses</b> would be buffered. The conclusion was consistent with DP tests of <b>celluloses.</b> Compared with carbonate buffer, the borax buffer with high ability of penetration could enhance the depth and width of oxidation, which was demonstrated by the results of X-ray diffraction patterns and carboxyl content of <b>celluloses...</b>|$|R

5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. <b>Cellulose</b> is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. <b>Cellulose</b> is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, <b>cellulose,</b> and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with <b>cellulose,</b> especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, <b>cellulose</b> is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting <b>cellulose.</b> There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E

However, there were only two degrading stages of the woods in nitrogen atmosphere, which corresponded to the water loss in woods, the degradation of the hemicelluloses, <b>celluloses</b> and lignin, because the charred residues of the wood could not be further oxidated in inert atmosphere...|$|R
5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use <b>cellulose</b> as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the <b>cellulose</b> molecule.

The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E
