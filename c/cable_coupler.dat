50|$|The {{original}} and most common {{version of the}} powerCON is rated at 20 A. It comes in two deliberately incompatible variants to prevent people connecting two mains supplies together. The type A is blue and used for power sources (power flows out of a blue-ended cable, into a chassis socket). The type B is white and used for power drains (power flows from a chassis socket into a white-ended <b>cable).</b> <b>Couplers</b> are available with one chassis socket of each type mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube to extend cables.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Numerical {{conformal}} mapping is exploited as a simple, accurate, and efficient {{tool for the}} analysis and design of coaxial waveguides and couplers of complex cross section. An implementation based on the Schwarz–Christoffel Toolbox, a public-domain MATLAB package, is applied to slotted coaxial cables and to symmetrical coaxial couplers, with circular or polyg-onal inner conductors and external shields. The effect of metallic diaphragms of arbitrary thickness, partially separating the inner conductors, is also easily taken into account. The proposed tech-nique is validated against {{the results of the}} finite-element method, showing excellent agreement {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost, and is also extended to the case of nonsymmetrical couplers, providing the designer with important additional degrees of freedom.

5000|$|A Speakon {{connector}} {{is designed}} with a locking system {{that may be}} designed for soldered or screw-type connections. Line connectors (female) mate with (male) panel connectors and typically a cable will have identical connectors at both ends. If it is needed to join <b>cables,</b> a <b>coupler</b> can be used (which essentially consists of two panel connectors mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube). Recently the manufacturer has introduced a new series called STX which includes also male line connectors and female panel Speakon connectors are designed to be unambiguous in their use in speaker cables. With 1/4" [...] speaker jacks and XLR connections, it is possible for users to erroneously use low-current shielded microphone or instrument cables in a high-current speaker application. Speakon cables are intended solely for use in high current audio applications.|$|R
50|$|A network {{analyzer}} has connectors on its front panel, but the measurements are seldom {{made at the}} front panel. Usually some test cables will connect from the front panel to the device under test (DUT). The length of those cables will introduce a time delay and corresponding phase shift (affecting VNA measurements); the cables will also introduce some attenuation (affecting SNA and VNA measurements). The {{same is true for}} <b>cables</b> and <b>couplers</b> inside the {{network analyzer}}. All these factors will change with temperature. Calibration usually involves measuring known standards and using those measurements to compensate for systematic errors, but there are methods which do not require known standards. Only systematic errors can be corrected. Random errors, such as connector repeatability can not be corrected by the user calibration. However, some portable vector network analyzers, designed for lower accuracy measurement outside using batteries, do attempt some correction for temperature by measuring the internal temperature of the network analyzer.|$|R

The design includes handover overlap design, base station connectivity, signal reticulation using splitters, couplers, bi-directional amplifiers, attenuators, discrete antennas, radiating <b>cables</b> and opto-electric <b>couplers</b> etc. It is found that signal strength, noise, intermodulation calculated for the up and down links are in compliance with the given specifications and satisfy the required system margin. Our system specifications based on TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) ensures that the received signal is at least 5 dB higher than the TETRA dynamic sensitivity level and yields 95 % coverage of all the used areas...|$|R
40|$|Next-generation {{wireless}} mobile communications will {{be driven}} by converged networks that integrate disparate technologies and services. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{are expected to be}} one of the next generation of wireless interconnection technologies, providing flexible high bandwidth wireless backhaul over large geographical areas. While single radio mesh nodes operating on a single channel suffer from capacity constraints, equipping mesh routers with multiple radios using multiple non-overlapping channels can significantly alleviate the capacity problem and increase the aggregate bandwidth available to the network. However, it is well known that multi-radio Mesh platforms face many limitations such as interference, radiation leakage, crosstalk and limited computing resource etc. A misperception among researchers is that the so called “crosstalk” is one of the limiting factors to the performance decrease in multi-radio Mesh networks, but through a series of experiments the results shows otherwise. In this paper, we present a unique experimental approach that utilizes antenna <b>cables,</b> splitters, <b>couplers</b> and attenuators etc. to create a controlled wireless environment, and results indicates, despite negligible effect, crosstalk is not a limiting factor, but rather the finite computing resource constrains the aggregated performance of multi-radio Mesh networks, and several other factors have been investigated as well...|$|R
40|$|Failures of {{connectors}} used {{in radio}} frequency (RF) systems cost the telecom industry, mainly cellular phone providers, {{billions of dollars}} annually. This cost is incurred because {{the integrity of the}} connectors cannot currently be monitored in-system and failure results in catastrophic signal loss. The Smart Connector project aims to solve this problem by designing a connector with the capability to sense and report its own integrity. An integrated sensor chip has been developed that mounts on a molded inter-connect device inside of a coaxial cable connector. The current prototype system uses a direct connection to the chip to send the sensor data. However, for the system to be feasible in the target environment it must communicate sensor data wirelessly down the coaxial cable. The sensor chip uses a small loop coupler to inductively couple RF energy from the center conductor of the coaxial <b>cable.</b> The loop <b>coupler</b> is used to wirelessly receive power and to send and receive data from the sensor chip. Because the sensor chip is completely passive (it has no power source) the power available to transmit data is limited. The goal of this thesis is to develop a low power, wireless telemetry system for the Smart Connector sensor disk. This work investigates the analysis and design of an intra-coaxial cable reflected power communication system for use in the Smart Connector system. Theoretical analysis and experimentation proved the plausibility of using an intra-coaxial reflected power communication method for the telemetry system. Design guidelines were derived through the theoretical analysis which highlight many trade-offs and requirements for use in a final Smart Connector system. A simulation model of the communication link, which closely matches results from the theoretical model, was developed using the Cadence tool set. Finally, a complete prototype system capable of sending and receiving data packets via intra-coaxial cable reflected power communication was implemented...|$|R

For this application USAge coupler that has been measured and calculated total attenuation and acceptance on both of lane, before coupler being installed and after coupler installed. For the result to measurement total attenuation befor intalled coupler on lane "Main" : 9 dB and lane "Protection" : 8. 5 dB and the result calculation on lane "Main": 7. 4 db and lane"Protection": 10. 75 dB. While the results measurement acceptance after installed coupler on lane"protection": - 12. 5 dBm, and result calculation on lane "Main":- 13. 4 dBm and lane" Protection": - 11. 75 dBm. On measurement and calculation total attenuation also acceptance, before and after install coupler, {{there is a difference}} result that have find from measurement and calculation. This is because of the difference connectors are not clean, connection that is not "pres" and bending on optical fiber. This difference will not becoming a problem because result that be obtained equally-equally good, and in the circumscription that be given devices (lath).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{development}} was to validate {{the use of the}} external Rover Ultra High Frequency (RUHF) antenna for space under extreme thermal environments to be encountered during the surface operations of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The antenna must survive all ground operations plus the nominal 670 Martian sol mission that includes summer and winter seasons of the Mars thermal environment. The qualification effort was to verify that the RUHF antenna design and its bonding and packaging processes are adequate to survive the harsh environmental conditions. The RUHF is a quadrifilar helix antenna mounted on the MSL Curiosity rover deck. The main components of the RUHF antenna are the helix structure, feed <b>cables,</b> and hybrid <b>coupler,</b> and the high-power termination load. In the case of MSL rover externally mounted hardware, not only are the expected thermal cycle depths severe, but there are temperature offsets between the Mars summer and winter seasons. The total number of temperature cycles needed to be split into two regimes of summer cycles and winter cycles. The qualification test was designed to demonstrate a survival life of three times more than all expected ground testing, plus a nominal 670 Martian sol missions. Baseline RF tests and a visual inspection were performed {{prior to the start of}} the qualification test. Functional RF tests were performed intermittently during chamber breaks over the course of the qualification test. For the RF return loss measurements, the antenna was tested in a controlled environment outside the thermal chamber with a vector network analyzer that was calibrated over the antenna s operational frequency range. A total of 2, 010 thermal cycles were performed. Visual inspection showed a dulling of the solder material. This change will not affect the performance of the antenna. No other changes were observed. RF tests were performed on the RUHF helix antenna, hybrid, and load after the 2, 010 qualification cycles test. The RF performance of the RUHF antenna, hybrid, and load were almost identical before and after the complete test. Therefore, the developed design of RUHF is qualified for a long-duration MSL mission. The RUHF antenna has not been used for long-duration missions such as MSL in the past. The state-of-the-art technology of the RUHF antenna is used to develop the antennas for MSL mission survivability. This developmental test data provides the confidence in using this RUHF antenna for future NASA missions to Mars...|$|R
