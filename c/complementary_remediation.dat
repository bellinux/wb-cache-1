40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) Figure 1 is a 310 -square-mile United States Department of Energy nuclear {{facility}} located along the Savannah River near Aiken, South Carolina. During operations, {{which started in}} 1951, hazardous substances (chemicals and radionuclides) were released to the environment. The releases occurred {{as a result of}} inadvertent spills and waste disposal in unlined pits and basins which was common practice before environmental regulations existed. The hazardous substances have migrated to the vadose zone and groundwater {{in many areas of the}} SRS, resulting in 515 waste units that are required by environmental regulations, to undergo characterization and, if needed, remediation. In the initial years of the SRS environmental cleanup program (early 1990 s), the focus was to use common technologies (such as pump and treat, air stripping, excavation and removal) that actively and tangibly removed contamination. Exclusive use of these technologies required continued and significant funding while often failing to meet acceptable clean-up goals and objectives. Recognizing that a more cost-effective approach was needed, SRS implemented new and <b>complementary</b> <b>remediation</b> methods focused on active and passive technologies targeted to solve specific remediation problems. Today, SRS uses technologies such as chemical/pH-adjusting injection, phytoremediation, underground cutoff walls, dynamic underground stripping, soil fracturing, microbial degradation, baroballs, electrical resistance heating, soil vapor extraction, and microblowers to more effectively treat contamination at lower costs. Additionally, SRS's remediation approach cost effectively maximizes cleanup as SRS works proactively with multiple regulatory agencies. Using GIS, video, animation, and graphics, SRS is able to provide an accurate depiction of the evolution of SRS groundwater and vadose zone cleanup activities to convince stakeholders and regulators of the effectiveness of various cleanup technologies. Remediating large, complex groundwater plumes using state of-the art technologies and approaches is a hallmark of years of experience and progress. Environmental restoration at SRS continues to be a challenging and dynamic process as new cleanup technologies and approaches are adopted...|$|E

40|$|Contaminated {{groundwater}} {{associated with}} Building 100 at the Young-Rainey Science, Technology, and Research Center, formerly the DOE Pinellas plant, {{is the primary}} remedial challenge {{that remains to be}} addressed at the site. Currently, Building 100 is an active industrial facility that is now owned and operated by the Pinellas county government. Groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells recently installed near the southern boundary of the site suggest that contaminated groundwater has migrated off the plant site. In response to the challenges presented by the Building 100 plume, the Office of Legacy Management (LM) requested assistance from the DOE Office of Groundwater and Soil Remediation (EM- 32) to provide a review team to make technical recommendations so that they can efficiently and effectively address characterization and remediation of the plume. The review team was unanimous in the conclusion that a dynamic strategy that combines a phased implementation of direct push samplers, sensors, and tools can be used to better delineate the extent of contamination, control plume migration, and rapidly remediate the contaminated groundwater at the site. The initial efforts of the team focused on reviewing the site history and data, organizing the information into a conceptual model, identifying appropriate technologies, and recommending an integrated strategy. The current groundwater data from the site indicate a two-lobed plume extending to the east and south. To the east vinyl chloride is the primary contaminant of concern, to the south, vinyl chloride and cis 1, 2 -DCE are the primary contaminants. The limited data that are available suggest that reductive dechlorination of the TCE is already occurring but is not sufficient to prevent offsite migration of low concentrations of TCE daughter products. The team recommends that DOE pursue a strategy that builds on the natural cleansing capacity of the subsurface with reductive methods including biostimulation and/or bioaugmentation to provide a sustainable remediation system within the flow path of the plume. Additional data will be required to implement this approach and will include: (1) Better delineation of {{the nature and extent of}} contamination; (2) Demonstration the plume is currently stable or shrinking; and (3) Demonstration the full reductive dechlorination is occurring. The technical team recommends that DOE use a phased approach to identify residual contamination and to provide rapid installation of remedies. Matrices of characterization and remediation sensors, technologies, and tools were developed by the team in order to match the specific conditions and requirements of the site. The team provides a specific example of remedy that includes the incorporation of a dynamic characterization strategy moving from minimally invasive to more aggressive field techniques, the consideration of multiple <b>complementary</b> <b>remediation</b> approaches based on a spatiotemporally phased approach keyed to the different demands of different parts of the plume, and the integration and sequencing of the characterization and remediation activities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} {{accomplished}} {{within the framework}} of SILPHES financed by ADEME, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (AMI 2013 program). SILPHES is a "technology demonstrator" project which aims at developing innovative solutions for in situ remediation of a mixture of recalcitrant chlorinated solvent, mainly composed of hexachlorobutadiene, hexachloroethane, PCE, TCE and hexachlorobenzene. SILPHES is organized around two fundamental and <b>complementary</b> tasks:-The <b>remediation</b> of chlorinated solvents point source pollution. This part is devoted to the optimization of the treatment of the point source, which includes physical, chemical and thermal treatments, associated with diagnostic and monitoring;-The remediation of chlorinated solvents plume. This part is devoted to the improvement of environmental diagnosis and the design and monitoring of natural attenuation, bioremediation or chemical treatment. This paper only covers a part of the first point stated above, i. e. the remediation of the residual phase of chlorinated solvents remaining after pumping...|$|R
40|$|Due to high {{affinity}} for organic carbon phase, hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) preferentially deposit in bed sediments in surface aquatic systems. Consequently, many contemporary sediment contaminants are HOCs, including DDTs, PCBs, and PBDEs. However, their accumulation potential and toxicity to benthic organisms in sediments are regulated by bioavailability, rather than bulk chemical concentrations. The overall {{purpose of the}} current project was to develop and apply chemically-based methods to explore bioavailability of HOCs in sediments, and help improve the assessment of their potential ecotoxicological risks and sometimes human health effects in the environment. A solid phase microextraction (SPME) method using disposable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibers was developed for measuring the phase distribution of flame retardant PBDEs in sediments. Results showed that PBDEs were predominantly sorbed to the sediment phase, with freely dissolved concentration (C free) only accounted for free) of HOCs as indicated by the matrix-SPME method. At 1 % amendment rate in a sediment with low organic carbon (0. 12 %) content, C free of selected PBDEs was reduced by 47. 5 &ndash 78. 0 %, 47. 3 &ndash 77. 5 %, and 94. 1 &ndash 98. 3 % with biochar, charcoal, and activated carbon, respectively. To overcome the shortcomings of current measurement methods, an isotope dilution method (IDM) was developed and applied for bioavailability prediction of legacy HOCs (e. g., DDT and its metabolites, PCBs) in historically-contaminated sediments from the Palos Verdes Superfund site. The IDM-based accessible concentration was shown to correlate closely with tissue residues in the exposed marine benthic polychaete Neanthes arenaceodentata (R 2 = 0. 84 &ndash 0. 94). Bioavailability measurements from the SPME, IDM and Tenax methods were compared in amendment-based remediation. After normalizing over the unamended sediments, significant linear correlations (R 2 > 0. 90, p < 0. 01, slopes= 1. 00 &ndash 1. 09) were found between these methods, suggesting they are interchangeable or <b>complementary</b> for evaluating <b>remediation</b> efficiency or progress. Overall, the bioavailability estimation methods or their specific applications developed from this project will improve understanding environmental fate of HOCs and their potential toxicity to such organisms as the sediment-dwelling invertebrates. The developed methods may be readily adoptable for other HOCs as well as other matrices (e. g., soil) ...|$|R
