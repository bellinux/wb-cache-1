40|$|An {{analysis}} and design method is presented {{for the design}} of composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> that include the transverse shear effects and damage tolerance considerations. This method is incorporated into a sandwich optimization computer program entitled SANDOP. As a demonstration of its capabilities, SANDOP is {{used in the present study}} to design optimized composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> for for transport aircraft wing applications. The results of this design study indicate that optimized composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> have approximately the same structural efficiency as stiffened composite <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> designed to satisfy individual constraints. The results also indicate that inplane stiffness requirements have a large effect on the weight of these composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> at higher load levels. Increasing the maximum allowable strain and the upper percentage limit of the 0 degree and +/- 45 degree plies can yield significant weight savings. The results show that the structural efficiency of these optimized composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> is relatively insensitive to changes in core density. Thus, core density should be chosen by criteria other than minimum weight (e. g., damage tolerance, ease of manufacture, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Designs {{to enrich}} the {{environment}} are cru-cial {{in the effort to}} fully address the biological needs of domestic animals. Although enrichment programs have been shown to improve health and welfare, little is known of their potential for application to commercial broiler breeder environments. We investigated the potential ben-efits of <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> for broiler breeder reproductive per-formance in a commercial setting. This demonstration trial occurred on 5 commercial broiler breeder farms, each with a control and panel treatment room containing ap-proximately 7, 000 females and 800 males. Reproductive performance was measured from 25 to 60 wk by the num-ber of eggs laid per female per week as well as weekly fertility and hatchability rates. The location of marked males was recorded weekly to quantify male movement. Access to <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> improved egg production by 2. 1...|$|R

The first experiment investigated social spacing and aggressive behavior in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>cover</b> <b>panels.</b> Smaller group sizes were more affected by <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> than larger group sizes. In the second and third experiments patchy environments were used to test optimal foraging strategies. In the second experiment, smaller group sizes were more affected by patch locations than larger ones. In the third experiment birds were presented with patches varying in quality. Birds in all group sizes were able to immediately discern patch quality and preferred patches of higher quality. Despite generations of artificial selection pressure domestic fowl continue to forage optimally in patchy environments, and adopt flocking strategies predicted by behavioral ecology theory...|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} GD250N {{focus on a}} rigid body frame, power-to-weight ratio and futuristic styling. To save weight, trellis frame design is {{used to make a}} rigid and {{lightweight}} structure. Fibre-reinforced plastic polymer and aluminum are mostly used to build this lightweight motorcycle. Fibre-reinforced plastic is mostly used in making the frame <b>cover</b> <b>panel</b> and the condom tank (Fibre-reinforced plastic fuel tank inside and covered by a plastic panel). The design is considered unique because the condom tank is made from a tough, lightweight, fibre-reinforced plastic material which ensure its safety equivalent with a heavy metal tank. The swing arm is also made from aluminum to save weight.|$|E

50|$|The {{front cover}} shows {{a grid of}} 24 concert photos. A further 24 photos appear on the back, and 48 more on the inner gatefold. Early copies had no artist name or title on the cover (aside from the spine); this {{information}} appeared on a large yellow sticker attached to the shrink wrap. The sticker lists six of seven track titles. On later copies, the cover was modified to include {{an image of the}} sticker, now printed on the cover and covering part of the photo spread. Note that the exclamation mark after the title only appears on the sticker and later front covers; it does not appear on the spine or labels, and should not be considered as part of the title.

5000|$|Packaging {{methods have}} changed since the {{introduction}} of the LP record. The 'wrap-around' or 'flipback' sleeve initially became the standard packaging method for LPs during the 1950s. In this packaging method the front cover is able to be printed in colour and is laminated, whereas the back cover features only black text on a white background and is usually unlaminated. These sleeves are constructed in two parts: a laminated front section is wrapped around a separate back panel. Three 'flaps' are used to fix the front and back panels together on the outside. As the unlaminated cardboard back cover section is prone to discolouration due to exposure to natural light, in some instances a single printed sheet containing the back cover information is pasted over the entire back panel, covering the 'wrap-around' flaps but not reaching {{the outer edge of the}} sleeve, thus allowing some of the laminated 'flaps' to be exposed. While discolouration still occurs with this method, it is often less evident than when the cardboard back cover alone is exposed. A common feature of flipback sleeves in the 1960s was for information specific to either monaural or stereo versions of the record (typically a format-specific catalogue number and a [...] "MONO" [...] or [...] "STEREO" [...] disclaimer) would be printed on the same front cover artwork, and the whole front panel shifted up or down to expose the appropriate [...] "version" [...] on the front while the unused one would be covered up (but often not very well) by the back <b>cover</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{analytical}} and experimental {{results of an}} all-composite wing stub box are presented in this report. The wing stub box, which is representative of an inboard portion of a commercial transport high-aspect-ratio wing, was fabricated from stitched graphite-epoxy material with a Resin Film Infusion manufacturing process. The wing stub box was designed and constructed by the McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Company {{as part of the}} NASA Advanced Composites Technology program. The test article contained metallic load-introduction structures on the inboard and outboard ends of the graphite-epoxy wing stub box. The root end of the inboard load introduction structure was attached to a vertical reaction structure, and an upward load was applied to the outermost tip of the outboard load introduction structure to induce bending of the wing stub box. A finite element model was created in which the center portion of the wing-stub-box upper <b>cover</b> <b>panel</b> was modeled with a refined mesh. The refined mesh was required to represent properly the geometrically nonlinear structural behavior of the upper <b>cover</b> <b>panel</b> and to predict accurately the strains in the stringer webs of the stiffened upper <b>cover</b> <b>panel.</b> The {{analytical and}} experimental results for deflections and strains are in good agreement...|$|E
