Coming in during the 18th over, with England at 144/4, he managed to knock 10 from 11 balls however <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> boundary. The Netherlands successfully chased down the target from the final ball.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing under the cover of darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E

5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death. The {{builders}} left a cavity into the wall and the poor girl with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to the}} general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E

25|$|Although American search {{aircraft}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> approaching enemy carriers, {{the presence}} of reconnaissance aircraft near the American carriers indicated the Japanese had found them.

Most of these raids were destroyed or broken up by American fighters, severely disrupting the ensuing Japanese attacks, but several raids did get through.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} of Drake's raid were significant to the Spanish. Rumors {{soon began to}} spread that the English had a settlement further north and were using the place {{as a base for}} piracy. This was confirmed by news from released Spanish prisoners that Drake had wanted to replenish the colony of Roanoke. Although the Spanish knew of Roanoke they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> English colony despite a number of military expeditions sent out. Menéndez came the closest reaching 37 degrees latitude but failed to find anything.|$|E

25|$|In December 629, {{on the eve}} of the Conquest of Mecca, Muhammad sent Al-Zubayr and Ali to {{intercept}} a spy who was carrying a letter to the Quraysh. When they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> letter in her baggage, they realised she must have concealed it on her person, so they threatened to strip her. The spy then produced the letter, which she had hidden in her hair, and Al-Zubayr and Ali brought it back to Muhammad, confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise.|$|E
25|$|In March 1929, Cliff White and Cyril Paris, {{two local}} extreme sports enthusiasts, created {{a plan to}} use the CPR cabin as an {{overnight}} point in their ski trek over the great divide.

Upon waking in the morning they discovered that they had only just missed the CPR cabin. These two men were the first to ski what is now known as Sunshine Village.|$|E
25|$|The initial service {{commenced}} on 7 July 1935 and was operated {{using an}} eight-passenger Junkers W 34, Ternen. The first flight {{came at a}} time with fog in Trondheim and the pilot chose to land at Skansen instead of Jonsvatnet, as he claimed he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> lake in the fog. As there were no available boats and—as determined after a short while—the lake was not fog-covered, the aircraft flew onwards to Jonsvatnet. DNL hired two pilots for the route; they swapped places in Trondheim. The service had three weekly round-trip flights, with stops in Bergen, Ålesund, Molde, Kristiansund, Brønnøysund, Sandnessjøen, Bodø, Svolvær, Narvik, Harstad and Tromsø. Twelve flights in each direction were carried out that season, ending on 3 August.|$|E

25|$|On December 29 General Clinch left Fort Drane (recently {{established}} on Clinch's plantation, about twenty miles (32km) northwest of Fort King) with 750 soldiers, including 500 volunteers on an enlistment due to end January 1, 1836. They {{were going to}} a Seminole stronghold called the Cove of the Withlacoochee, an area of many lakes on the southwest side of the Withlacoochee River. When they reached the river, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> ford, and Clinch had his regular troops ferried across the river in a single canoe they had found. Once they were across and had relaxed, the Seminoles attacked. The troops survived only by fixing bayonets and charging the Seminoles, {{at the cost of}} four dead and 59 wounded. The militia provided cover as the Army troops withdrew across the river.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, as the press {{continued}} to publish sensationalized accounts of the events depicting the Home of Truth as a dangerous cult, {{more than half of}} the colonists left, disillusioned. In February 1937, Marie Ogden made another announcement that Edith Peshak was about to be restored to life. The investigators returned, insisting that a death certificate must be signed. Ogden continued to claim the woman was not actually dead. After being arrested, Ogden consented to sign the certificate on May 4, 1937, but the authorities still <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> body. Finally, a former member came forward and confessed to having helped her cremate the corpse shortly after the original investigation, in August 1935. All but seven of Ogden's remaining followers abandoned Home of Truth.|$|E
25|$|Before being encircled, the Ninth Army {{had already}} {{suffered}} heavy {{losses in the}} Battle of the Seelow Heights. It is estimated that, {{at the start of}} the encirclement, it had fewer than 1,000 guns and mortars, approximately 79 tanks, and probably a total of 150–200 combat-ready armoured fighting vehicles left. In all, there were about 80,000 men in the pocket, the majority of whom belonged to the Ninth Army, consisting of the XI SS Panzer Corps, V SS Mountain Corps and the newly acquired V Corps, but there was also the Frankfurt Garrison. The number of tanks reported included 36 tanks in the XI SS Panzer Corps, including up to 14 King Tigers of the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Air supply was attempted on April 25 and 26, but could not be carried out because the planes that had taken off <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> drop point for supply, and no contact with the encircled army could be established.|$|E
