If the money were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an out-of-season fishing permit from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. A member of OOF, together with a representative from NMFS present at the meeting, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations in the region were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters.

40|$|In many {{bird species}} {{protandry}} {{is a common}} pattern during their spring migration, allegedly this pattern is also present for the passerine species snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis). During their spring migration males tends to arrive 3 - 4 weeks {{before the arrival of}} females at the breeding grounds. In this study I have examined if this pattern is reflected in their spring migration as well if there is a differential timing between the age classes for males. I also examined if there is a connection between wingspan and arrival time at Umeå delta for each sex and between the sexes. To make this study possible I captured and banded snow buntings during spring at Umedeltat field station and combined my data with 2012 ’s data of banded snow buntings from the same station. There was a significant difference in mean <b>capture</b> <b>dates</b> between males and females, with males arriving 1. 6 days earlier. There was also a significant difference in mean <b>capture</b> <b>dates</b> between older and younger males, older males arriving 2. 7 days earlier. When I examined the wingspan for the sexes I looked at it for each year. During 2017 there was a trend for females that those with longer wingspan arrived earlier than females with shorter wingspan. During 2012 there was a significant correlation; females with longer wingspan arrived earlier than those females with shorter wingspan. There was no correlation between males each year. I also found that in 2017 the mean <b>captures</b> <b>dates</b> for males was later than in 2012. In contrast mean <b>capture</b> <b>dates</b> for females was earlier 2017 than in 2012. My data strongly indicate that protandry is present in snow buntings as well as wingspan may have greater importance for females during their migration than males...|$|R

30|$|All {{analyses}} were done using unbalanced ANOVA in R unless indicated otherwise (R-Core Team 2012). To examine the thrips population around the study site over time, thrips captured on sticky traps were pooled across location and compared across <b>capture</b> <b>dates.</b> The effect of trap location was evaluated by pooling traps within each location (i.e. north, east, south-edge and south-outer) and comparing across <b>capture</b> <b>dates.</b> Thrips entering the field site {{were compared with}} thrips within the field site by correlating cabbage head thrips counts with trap catches throughout the season by date. The influence of variety and planting date on total thrips observed on cabbage heads over the growing season was analysed. Location of thrips within the cabbage head at harvest, cabbage head weight and cabbage size was analysed for the two main varieties, Bronco and Lennox, and planting date. Percentage of cabbage heads showing thrips damage were analysed by location with the cabbage head and correlated with number of thrips present at harvest and the total thrips present on the heads over the season. And finally, correlation between trap catches and head weight and cabbage size was examined using linear models. Cabbage head weight and size (circumference along polar and equator dimensions) were compared for variety, planting date and harvest date. Thrips counts were transformed by sin− 1 (sqrt(x +  0.5)) where necessary prior to ANOVA where homogeneity of variance was violated.|$|R

40|$|Surface fuels {{data are}} of {{critical}} importance for supporting fire inci-dent management, risk assessment, and fuel management planning, but the development of surface fuels data can be expensive and time con-suming. The data development pro-cess is extensive, generally begin-ning with acquisition of remotely sensed spatial data such as aerial photography or satellite imagery (Keane and others 2001). The spa-tial vegetation data are then cross-walked {{to a set of}} fire behavior fuel models that describe the available fuels (the burnable portions of the vegetation) (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005).

40|$|An {{important}} task for network operators is to properly dimension {{the capacity of}} their links. Often, this is done by simple rules of thumb based on coarse traffic measurements provided, e. g., by SNMP. More accurate estimations of the required link capacity typically require packet-level measurements, which are hard to implement in today’s high-speed networks. The challenge is, therefore, to accurately estimate the traffic statistics needed for estimating the required link capacity with minimal traffic measurement effort. This paper proposes a novel, hybrid procedure for link dimensioning that combines flow-level measurements, minimal efforts on packet captures, and an analytical traffic model. The result is an efficient and robust method to estimate required link capacities. Although the idea of estimating required capacities from flows is not new, the novelty {{of this paper is}} that it proposes a complete, efficient and deployable procedure. The proposed procedure has been extensively validated using real-world traffic <b>captures</b> <b>dating</b> from 2011 and 2012.
