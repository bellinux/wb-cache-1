40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{advanced}} investment strategies and reduces their risk by using the orders for automatically closing the open position at a loss for a pre-defined value. The advantage of strategies that do not use these protective orders is that they can survive against the price movement and then close the position at a profit. The disadvantage is that the open positions are subject to unlimited risk because of the use of financial leverage. The aim {{of this paper is to}} eliminate the risk of open-ended losses while maintaining the potential profitability of these strategies. This statistical analysis is used to test the large number of combinations of levels to close the position at a loss. Using this analysis is to find the optimal value for <b>closing</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> at a loss, which currently does not reduce profitability. The article compares the results of the proposed portfolio without the use of protection orders and the use of protective orders for the period 2005 - 2012. The results of this analysis show the need for the use of protection orders in the use of financial leverage. Analyzed strategy works in intraday mode, where the purchase made at 17 : 00 and 22 : 00 in the case of sales made to meet the entry conditions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how high-frequency trading decisions of individual investors {{are influenced by}} past price changes. Specifically, we address {{the question as to}} whether decisions to open or <b>close</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> are different when investors already hold <b>a</b> <b>position</b> compared to when they don't. Based on a unique dataset from an electronic foreign exchange trading platform, OANDA FXTrade, we find that investors' future order flow is (significantly) driven by past price movements and that these predictive patterns last up to several hours. This observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions. We provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to <b>close</b> <b>an</b> existing <b>position</b> than if they are used to open one. We interpret this finding as evidence for the existence of a monitoring effect, which has implications for theoretical market microstructure models and behavioral finance phenomena, such as the endowment effect...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{trading in}} {{currency}} markets, reducing te mean of absolute or squared errors of predicted values is not valuable unless {{it results in}} profits. A trading rule {{is a set of}} conditions that describe when to buy or sell a currency or to <b>close</b> <b>a</b> <b>position,</b> which can be used for automated trading. To optimize the rule to obtain a profit in the future, a probabilistic method such as a genetic algorithm (GA) or genetic programming (GP) is utilized, since the profit is a discrete and multimodal function with many parameters. Although the rules optimized by GA/GP reportedly obtain a profit in out-of-sample testing periods, {{it is hard to believe}} that they yield a profit in distant out-of-sample periods. In this paper, we first consider a framework where we optimize the parameters of the trading rule in an in-sample training period, and then execute trades according to the rule in its succeeding out-of-sample period. We experimentally show that the framework very often results in a profit. We then consider a framework in which we conduct optimization as above and then execute trades in distant out-of-sample periods. We empirically show that the results depend on the similarity of the trends in the training and testing periods...|$|R
