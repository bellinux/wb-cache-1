5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft <b>control</b> <b>center</b> was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This <b>control</b> <b>center</b> was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E
5|$|Lunney worked {{both in the}} <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> and at remote sites; {{during the}} flight of John Glenn, America's first orbital spaceflight, he was serving as the FIDO in Bermuda. In September 1961, NASA's Space Task Group was reorganized into the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved to Houston, Texas, and Lunney moved with it. In Houston, he became head of the Mission Logic and Computer Hardware section, where he defined and oversaw the {{computing}} and display requirements of the flight dynamics division within the new Mission <b>Control</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail <b>control</b> <b>center</b> and back-up <b>control</b> <b>center</b> was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> {{has been}} {{redesigned}} and split into three pages: one for general settings, such as quick toggles for airplane mode and orientation lock, one for audio controls {{and one for}} controlling HomeKit (internet of things) appliances, if used.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 is {{compatible}} with iOS 7, which was released on September 18, 2013. However, some features are not supported.

5|$|After Prapiroon dissipated, the {{regional}} Disease Prevention and <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> of Guangxi Autonomous Region sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas. Despite the {{damage in the}} wake of the typhoon, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs did not activate any emergency response plans. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12-month span. Reconstruction in the areas devastated by Prapiroon began shortly after the typhoon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} high speed railway system in Taiwan, THSRC started {{operation}} in 2007 {{with a lot}} of foreign talents including French and German train drivers and operation controllers in the Operation <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> (OCC).

Since May 2008, all controllers working in the OCC have been Taiwanese, and since October 2008, all train drivers have been Taiwanese.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling <b>control</b> <b>center.</b> At 15:10, the <b>control</b> <b>center</b> initiated emergency procedures {{for the loss of}} a train and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash. The president of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, and the president of SNCF Réseau, Jacques Rapoport, also travelled to the site in the hours after the accident.|$|E

This paper describes Mission Control Technologies (MCT), an application platform that is powering mission control today and is designed to meet the needs of future NASA <b>control</b> <b>centers.</b> MCT is an extensible platform that provides GUI components and a runtime environment. The platform enables NASA s IT goals through its use of lightweight interfaces and configurable components, which promote standardization and incorporate useful solution patterns.

5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission <b>Control</b> <b>Center.</b> Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|THSRC has {{established}} a system to respond to natural disasters and unexpected intrusion onto the right-of-way, called DWS (Disaster Warning Systems). This system consists {{of a network of}} sensors installed along the rail route to detect unexpected situations such as earthquakes, strong winds, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, and intrusions. In case of an unexpected situation, the DWS will send signals to the OCC (Operation <b>Control</b> <b>Center)</b> immediately; it will also activate contingency measures {{to ensure the safety of}} the passengers and trains, including decelerating or stopping trains in the affected area.|$|E
5|$|The {{air traffic}} control at Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training.
