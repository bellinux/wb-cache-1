6000|$|He {{flushed and}} <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I've been {{an old woman}} for nearly six months," [...] he said, with a laugh. [...] "I find I can't stand it any longer." ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very timidly. She {{seemed to}} me so beautiful, so exquisitely childish, that I touched the fingers of the hand she gave me {{with a feeling of}} {{positive}} reverence.|$|E
6000|$|... "They both came in together," [...] Ruth said. [...] "They {{talked in}} a corner for some time. The man who was with Isaac seemed terrified about something. Then Isaac <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and asked about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of the swallowtails {{dragged him}} up against some steps {{and began to}} fan him. Another one of 'em <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|Shahbaz Khan {{began to}} call again: 'They are below us. I can see them. For the pity of God <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Hafiz Ullah! My father slew ten of them. Come over!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I swam over," [...] he said, [...] "but I can't get back. I've got the cramps. Can't {{you make}} {{some sort of}} a raft, and <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> The water's awfully cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ray {{opened the}} {{carriage}} door and gripped Blenavon's arm. [...] "Get in," [...] {{he said in}} a low, suppressed tone. There was something almost animal in the fury of Ray's voice. I looked away with a shudder. Blenavon stepped quietly into the carriage. Then Ray <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and as he looked searchingly into my face, he pointed up the carriage drive.|$|E
6000|$|... "The place our Brothers {{have made}} over beyond there. They have made great banks about their house, {{north and south}} and east and west; they have made deep pits and hidden places, and even now--one <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> quite recently. He said--I did not {{altogether}} heed what he said then. But he spoke of arms. It may be--there--we should find shelter....|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he dismounted, and {{was coming}} to me, when his eye fell on El Chico. 'Sergeant,' he said to a non-commissioned officer,' take four men and march that fellow well outside the village, and then stand and watch him; and see that he goes on, and if he doesn't, shoot him.' Then he <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> 'It is well that I arrived in time, my lad,' he said in French.' How {{did you get into}} this scrape?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Shahbaz Khan {{began to}} call again: [...] "They are below us. I can see them! For the pity of God <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Hafiz Ullah! My father slew ten of them. Come over!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, it's rather lonely {{being here}} in this big room all by oneself so long; so I asked Martha Biggs <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I suppose there's no harm in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|She must {{both look}} and listen, [...] For only the soul's choice can save her now. [...] <b>Come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> daughter; stand beside me; [...] Think {{of this house}} and of your duties in it.|$|R
60|$|I {{had dropped}} my work now, {{and was looking}} at her, with my breath held, while my heart seemed to stop beating. What did she mean? These {{questions}} about sudden joy, this talk about officers found after being long supposed dead?--could it be?--but I could not speak. Polly {{looked up at me}} now for the first time, for she had before kept her eyes on her work; then she threw down the embroidery, <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and knelt down beside me.|$|E
60|$|So next night, when I {{heard the}} window go, I lay there without a word, though it went against all my better feelings. I didn't even growl. Someone {{came in and}} moved about in the dark, with a lantern, but, though I smelt {{that it was the}} man, I didn't ask him a single question. And {{presently}} the man lit a light and <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and gave me a pat, which was a thing he had never done before.|$|E
60|$|November 10.--It {{is getting}} warmer and warmer. Some land birds came and perched in the rigging today, {{though we are}} still a {{considerable}} way from our destination. The heat {{is so great that}} we are too lazy to do anything but lounge about the decks and smoke. Goring <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day and asked me some more questions about my stone; but I answered him rather shortly, for I have not quite forgiven him yet for the cool way in which he attempted to deprive me of it.|$|E
5000|$|When Jerry tells Elaine what he said, Elaine is alarmed {{and shows}} some uncharacteristic consideration: [...] "I don't want John {{thinking}} that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy. I'm {{trying to get}} a little squirrel <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, Jack, I {{knew that}} I could rely upon you; and now {{come in to}} tea, {{and there was one}} thing I wanted to say, I want you once a month <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at Birmingham on Saturday {{afternoon}} and stay till Sunday evening. It will be a great pleasure to me; I shall see how you are getting on, and shall hear all the news of Stokebridge." ...|$|R
60|$|On Sunday evening my handbag {{stood in}} my room packed, ready for my departure. Dick Blair <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> and brought strange and sad news.|$|R
60|$|We were in Glasgow next day, and the Major took us {{down to the}} depot, where {{a soldier}} with three stripes on his arm and a fistful of ribbons from his cap, showed every tooth {{he had in his}} head at the sight of Jim, and walked three times round him to have the view of him, {{as if he had been}} Carlisle Castle. Then he <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and punched me in the ribs and felt my muscle, and was nigh as pleased as with Jim.|$|E
60|$|The constable {{who came}} with the hue-and-cry was {{immediately}} informed of this, and <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be satisfied from my own mouth, and I assured him that I saw the three gentlemen as I was at the window; that I saw them afterwards at {{the windows of the}} room they dined in; that I saw them afterwards take horse, and I could assure him I knew one of them to be such a man, that he was a gentleman of a very good estate, and an undoubted character in Lancashire, from whence I was just now upon my journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I {{know very well}} what I am saying," [...] she answered. [...] "I went to Anna's rooms because I felt that I must see her. He was there concealed, waiting her return. He {{recognized}} me at once, and he behaved like a madman. He swore that I was his wife, that chance had given me to him at last. John, he was {{between me and the}} door. A strong coarse man, and there were things in his eyes which made my blood run cold with terror. He <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I was helpless. Beside me on Anna's table was a pistol. I was not even sure whether it was loaded. I snatched it up, pointed it blindly at him, and fired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I 'ad {{hardly been}} there ten minutes afore {{the other one}} came along. I saw 'er stop and speak to a policeman, and then she <b>came</b> {{straight}} <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But Malia did not {{sit beside}} him. I {{remember}} her eyes were wild, her hair down and flying, as she bent over him and whispered in his ear. And her hair covered him about and hid him as she whispered, {{and the sight of}} it pounded my heart against my ribs and dizzied my head till scarcely could I half-see. And I willed myself with all the will of me that if, in short minutes, she did not <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I would go across the circle and get her.|$|R
60|$|From all which I told her, that I had, on {{the most}} serious {{reflections}} I {{was able to make}} in the case, come to this resolution, which I hoped she would like, as a medium between both, viz. that she should use her endeavours with her son <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> leave <b>to</b> go to England, as I had desired, and <b>to</b> furnish <b>me</b> with a sufficient sum of money, either in goods along with me, or in bills for my support there, all along suggesting that he might one time or other think it proper <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Another pigeon!" [...] I shouted presently, {{filled with}} pride at the {{discovery}} and fishing the bird {{up from the}} bottom. He <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and began to examine the dead bird, his wrath still increasing; then I shouted gleefully again, [...] "Another pigeon!" [...] and altogether I shouted [...] "Another pigeon!" [...] about five times, {{and by that time}} he was in a quite furious temper. [...] "Rats--rats!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "killing all these pigeons and dragging them up here just to put them away in empty barrels--who ever heard of such a thing!" [...] No stronger language did he use. Like the vicar's wonderfully sober-minded daughter, as described by Marjory Fleming, [...] "he never said a single dam," [...] for that was the sort of man he was, but he went back fuming to his boxes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing." [...] His voice sank, and {{his eyes}} dropped to Frona, leaning against the box beneath him and {{steadying}} it. She {{did not seem to}} be affected. [...] "Bella <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I closed my eyes and breathed regularly. She held the slush-lamp to me, but I played sleep naturally enough to fool her. Then I heard a snort of sudden awakening and alarm, and a cry, and I looked out. The Indian was hacking at Borg with a knife, and Borg was warding off with his arms and trying to grapple him. When they did grapple, Bella crept up from behind and threw her arm in a strangle-hold about her husband's neck. She put her knee into the small of his back, and bent him backward and, with the Indian helping, threw him to the floor." ...|$|E
60|$|And let me {{say just}} one word of {{attenuation}} of my (only apparent) meanness over the Golden Bowl. I was in America when that work appeared, and it was published there in 2 vols. and in very charming and readable form, each vol. but moderately thick and with a legible, handsome, large-typed page. But there <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{a copy of the}} London issue, fat, vile, small-typed, horrific, prohibitive, that so broke my heart that I vowed I wouldn't, for very shame, disseminate it, and I haven't, with that feeling, had a copy in the house or sent one to a single friend. I wish I had an American one at your disposition--but I have been again and again depleted of all ownership in respect to it. You are very welcome to the British brick if you, at this late day, will have it.|$|E
5000|$|... "Four or {{five weeks}} later, Al <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and says, When {{are you going}} to do the next fold-in? And I said, I dont have another fold-in. That was it! So he said, Come on, you can come up with {{something}} else. I wracked my brain, and the only thing I could come up with was Nixon face was hidden within curtain folds. That one really set the tone for what the cleverness of the fold-ins has to be. It couldnt just be bringing someone from the left to kiss someone on the right." ...|$|R

6000|$|My dear Becher,--I am much {{obliged to}} you for your inquiries, and [...] shall profit by them accordingly. I am {{going to get up}} a play here; [...] the hall will {{constitute}} a most admirable theatre. I have settled the [...] 'dram. pers.,' and can do without ladies, as I have some young friends [...] who will make tolerable substitutes for females, and we only want [...] three male characters, beside Mr. Hobhouse and myself, for the play we [...] have fixed on, which will be the 'Revenge.'

6000|$|... "You want to {{know how}} all goes in Brisport, I suppose. Well, [...] I'll tell you. I'm cutting Markham and Davidson out completely, [...] my boy. The day after our little joke I got a bruised leg (that [...] baby), a cut head (the woman the baby fell upon), an [...] erysipelas, and a bronchitis. Next day a fine rich cancer of [...] Markham's threw him up and <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Also a {{pneumonia}} [...] and a man who swallowed a sixpence. I've never had a day since [...] without half a dozen new names on the list, and I'm going to [...] start a trap this week.

6000|$|My dear Austin,--First and {{foremost}} I {{think you will}} be {{sorry to hear that}} our poor friend Arick has gone back to the German firm. He had not been working very well, and we had talked of sending him off before; but remembering how thin he was when he came here, and seeing what fat little legs and what a comfortable little stomach he had laid on in the meanwhile, we found we had not the heart. The other day, however, he set up chat to Henry, the Samoan overseer, asking him who he was and where he came from, and refusing to obey his orders. I was in bed in the workmen's house, having a fever. Uncle Lloyd <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> told me of it, and I had Arick sent up. I told him I would give him another chance. He was taken out and asked to apologise to Henry, but he would do no such thing. He preferred {{to go back to the}} German firm. So we hired a couple of Samoans who were up here on a visit to the boys and packed him off in their charge to the firm, where he arrived safely, and a receipt was given for him like a parcel.[16] ...|$|E
60|$|Hyson made {{an attempt}} to defend the narrow passage leading to his cabin, and I heard a scuffle, and his voice {{shouting}} for assistance. There was none to assist, however, and he was brought on to the poop with the blood streaming from a deep cut in his forehead. He was gagged like the others, and a council was held upon our fate by the negroes. I saw our black seamen pointing towards me and making some statement, which was received with murmurs of astonishment and incredulity by the savages. One of them then <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and plunging his hand into my pocket took out my black stone and held it up. He then handed it {{to a man who}} appeared to be a chief, who examined it as minutely as the light would permit, and muttering a few words passed it on to the warrior beside him, who also scrutinised it and passed it on until it had gone from hand to hand round the whole circle. The chief then said a few words to Goring in the native tongue, on which the quadroon addressed me in English. At this moment I seem to see the scene. The tall masts of the ship with the moonlight streaming down, silvering the yards and bringing the network of cordage into hard relief; the group of dusky warriors leaning on their spears; the dead man at my feet; the line of white-faced prisoners, and in front of me the loathsome half-breed, looking in his white linen and elegant clothes a strange contrast to his associates.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou too wilt have heard, dearest Sister, that Luise has [...] fallen seriously ill; {{and that}} our poor dear Mother is [...] thereby robbed of all consolation. If Luise's case were to [...] grow worse, or our Father's even, our poor Mother would be [...] left entirely forsaken. Such misery would be unspeakable. [...] Canst thou make it possible, think'st thou, that thy [...] {{strength}} could accomplish such a thing? If so, at once make [...] the journey thither. What it costs I will pay with joy.

60|$|Weeks later, Attley <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see <b>me,</b> {{and before}} his car stopped Malachi {{let me know}} that Bettina was sitting beside the chauffeur. He greeted her by the scruff of the neck as she hopped down; and I greeted Mrs. Godfrey, Attley, and a big basket.|$|R
60|$|I was silting at {{the open}} porch in the gloaming, turning over in my mind the {{unexpected}} events which had occurred so rapidly--the gale, the wreck, the rescue, and the strange character of the castaways--when my sister <b>came</b> quietly <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and put her hand}} in mine.|$|R
