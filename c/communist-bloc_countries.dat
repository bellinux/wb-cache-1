5|$|During {{the same}} period, the North Vietnamese were {{recovering}} from losses incurred during the Easter Offensive of 1972 by replacing personnel and modernizing their equipment. Weapons improvement {{was due to}} a new influx of Soviet and Chinese military aid. During 1973, North Vietnam received 2.8million metric tons of goods (worth $330million) from <b>communist-bloc</b> <b>countries,</b> a 50 {{percent increase over the}} previous year. In 1974 that total increased to 3.5million metric tons ($400million) (according to CIA), while the South's aid was slashed to only $965 million per year, down from $2.2 billion.|$|E

50|$|Because cyclists {{from the}} Eastern Bloc {{were not allowed}} to become {{professional}} it was an amateur race. It attracted the best cyclists from communist countries, plus guest teams from non-communist <b>countries.</b> <b>Communist-bloc</b> riders tended to dominate the event, but there were exceptions: Briton Ian Steel won the 1952 race, and the British League of Racing Cyclists team also won the team competition - the first time that both classifications had gone to the same nation.|$|R

50|$|In Algiers, Algeria, on February 24, 1965, Guevara {{made what}} turned out to be his last public {{appearance}} on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity. He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries, accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries. He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the <b>communist-bloc</b> <b>countries</b> must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of imperialism. Having criticized the Soviet Union (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on March 14 to a solemn reception by Fidel and Raúl Castro, Osvaldo Dorticós and Carlos Rafael Rodríguez at the Havana airport.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in June 7, 1967, the South African {{government}} {{passed the}} Defense Amendment Bill, making it compulsory for all white males of eligible age {{to participate in}} the armed forces. The background to this change in the law was the rapid escalation of the Border War in Southern African, with <b>Communist-bloc</b> <b>countries</b> increasingly sending men and material to Africa, and covert support from America and Israel to assist South Africa in stemming Communism and African Nationalism. Beyond this proxy war, South Africa’s security situation internally was also changing drastically, as there was increasing resistance to the Apartheid government activity in the form of protest, riots, bombings, and assaults on remote locations such as farms in the isolated North of the country.|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for converting terrorist networks from undirected graphs to simplified directed graphs (or digraphs), and mapping {{the flow of}} influence in them, is described. It {{is based on an}} “influence assumption”—that important persons with more links influence less important persons with fewer links. This methodology, which was previously used to analyze the structure of influence relationships in <b>Communist-bloc</b> <b>countries</b> and the international system, is illustrated by its application to two terrorist networks constructed after 9 / 11. In the second more complex network, the hierarchy sheds light on the leadership and likely terrorist cells embedded in the network. Refined data and alternative assumptions about influence could provide additional insights into the structure of terrorist networks. 2 Influence in Terrorist Networks: From Undirected To Directed Graph...|$|E
40|$|May 5, 1993, was Karl Marx's {{one hundred}} seventy-fifth birthday. Unlike the recent past, when this date was the {{occasion}} of major celebration in the USSR and other <b>communist-bloc</b> <b>countries,</b> this year's observance was quiet, without the usual fanfare. This change unquestionably stems from the obvious fact that the system of "real socialism," which claimed to embody Marx's teachings and to be superior to all preceding social systems, has revealed its insolvency. However, this fact cannot and should not mean that Marx's role in nineteenth- and twentieth-century history will be forgotten. The influence of Marxism was (and continues to be) so great thatâthe "change of landmarks" notwithstandingâit cannot be expunged from history. It {{is all the more}} true that the socialist idea originated long before Marx and has been and continues to be preserved and to prosper independently of Marx, and, as we shall see, even in opposition to his doctrine in many respects. In other words, the plurality of socialist ideas and theories has been an incontrovertible fact. But if, as we have noted, the Marxist variant of socialism has failed, can this conclusion be drawn concerning its other variants? Have other variants of the socialist idea found embodiment, and if so, how have they been expressed? Until recently, an open formulation of such a question was impossible. Now, however, the renunciation of previous dogmas and the need for reevaluation become not only possible but also timely to the highest degree. The "revisionist" concept, which is shameful in its origin and terrible in its role, must be removed from social life once and for all. ...|$|E
