40|$|World {{energy demand}} {{expected}} to increase {{as a result of}} blossoming urbanisation, better living standards and rising human population. Biodiesel becomes an important alternative energy as the price and demand of fossil fuel in the global market is increasing each day. It has become obvious that biodiesel can create a generous contribution to the future energy demands as it brings less pollution to environment if compared to fossil fuels. There are many different types of potential feedstock and catalyst for biodiesel production. Compared to edible oil and non-edible vegetable oils as a feedstock, natural waste is very much considered as a biodiesel feedstock because of the huge demand for edible oils as a food source. Moreover, the uses of natural waste oils as a feedstock and catalyst from wastes are more cost effective. Therefore, production of biodiesel from natural waste {{is the best way to}} overcome all the associated problems with edible oils. In this present study, waste cooking oil (WCO) and impregnation of K + over deoiled spent bleaching clay (SBC) as a catalyst (K + impregnated DSBC) were attempted.

40|$|International audienceQuicklimes {{produced}} {{in an industrial}} kiln have a very low hydration activity compared to those {{produced in}} the laboratory. In this study, we seek to explain these differences in reactivities by providing quantitative data on the kinetics of the two mechanisms involved {{in the production of}} quicklime: the calcination of limestone to produce quicklime, and the undesirable sintering of quicklime. The first mechanism increases the specific surface area of the product from a few m(2) g(- 1) to more than 80 m(2) g(- 1), making the quicklime highly reactive: the time to react with water is less than 10 s. The second mechanism reduces the specific surface area down to a few m(2) g(-l) -which is typical for an industrial quicklime-and severely reduces its reactivity: the time to react with water is around 15 min. The impact of the local temperature and of the local partial pressure of CO 2 is quantified for both mechanisms, by experimenting the two extreme cases of pure N- 2 atmosphere and pure CO 2 atmosphere using specially designed laboratory apparatus. Some correlation between the quicklime reactivity and the specific surface area is found. The work demonstrates that industrial <b>furnace</b> <b>calcining</b> large limestone pellets, leads to low reactivity quicklimes both because the calcination temperature is too high and the CO 2 pressure is too elevated...|$|R

Concrete mix of design characteristic strength of 25 N/mm 2 was adopted as the control. The cement component replaced with PSA at five levels of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % were cast, and on hardened exposed to varying concentration of sulphates of magnesium, sodium and calcium at four levels of 0 %, 1 %, 3 % and 5 % each for three exposure periods of 62, 92 and 152 days after complete immersion in water for 28 days. Using three replicates in all the tests, a total of 630 cubical (150 mm) specimens were cast and tested. The results revealed that compressive strength increased with increase in curing age but decreased as the PSA contents increased. The design compressive strength was attained with 10 % PSA content {{at the age of}} 28 days. The compressive strength reduction in sulphate solutions was noted to increase significantly (p = 0. 005, R 2 = 0. 995) with increase exposure period and concentration, with the most severe caused by magnesium sulphate and the least by calcium sulphate. The least reduction in compressive strength was experienced with 10 % PSA blended cement concrete.

40|$|The cement {{industry}} contributes around 5 - 7 % of man-made CO 2 emissions globally {{because of the}} Portland Cement (PC) production. Therefore, innovative reactive magnesia cement, with significant sustainable and technical advantages, has been proposed by blending reactive MgO and hydraulic binders in various proportions. MgO is currently produced from the calcination of magnesite (MgCO 3), emitting more CO 2 than the production of PC, or from seawater/brine which is also extremely energy intensive. Hence this research aims to investigate an innovative method to produce MgO from reject brine, a waste Mg source, through carbon sequestration, by its reaction with CO 2, to provide a comparable low carbon manufacturing process due to the recycling of CO 2. The produced deposits are then calcined to oxides with potential usage in construction industry. The entire system is a closed loop to achieve both environmental optimisation and good productivity. This research focuses on the chemical manufacturing process, integrated with material science knowledge and advancements, instead of concentrating purely on chemistry evaluations. Six series of studies were conducted, utilising MgCl 2, CaCl 2, MgCl 2 -CaCl 2, MgCl 2 -CaCl 2 -NaCl, and MgCl 2 -CaCl 2 -NaCl-KCl to react with CO 2 under alkaline conditions. The precipitates include hydrated magnesium carbonates, calcium carbonates and magnesian calcite. Generated carbonates were then <b>calcined</b> in a <b>furnace</b> to obtain MgO, CaO or dolime (CaO•MgO). All six series of carbonation processes were carried out under a controlled pH level, to study the constant pH’s effect on the process and resulting precipitates.

In conclusion, the optimum parameters {{for the production of}} the carbonated precipitates are: 0. 25 MgCl 2 + 0. 05 CaCl 2 + 2. 35 NaCl + 0. 05 KCl, 700 rpm stirring speed, 25 oC room temperature, pH= 10. 5, and 500 cm 3 /min CO 2 infusion rate.

Three different catalysts are synthesized with addition of different promoters supported by alumina. The catalysts are synthesized by using the wet impregnation process, which involved dissolving and mixing specific calculated amount of nitrate salts and calcined alumina in distilled water. The solutions are then stirred for 3 consecutive hours before they are dried {{in the oven for}} 12 hrs. Lastly, the catalysts are <b>calcined</b> in a <b>furnace</b> at 1023 K for 5 consecutive hours to remove remaining water content and nitrates. The calcined and uncalcined catalysts were collected for catalyst characterization analysis which involved, Thermalgrametric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) and X-ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD). Calcined unreduced catalysts were used for ethanol dry reforming syngas production reaction runs at conditions of temperature 973 K, pressure 1 atm, and 1 : 1 C 2 H 5 OH to CO 2 ratio. The content of the produced syngas were analyzed using gas chromatography, and the results were compared between the catalysts for their performances. XRD analysis showed that the second metal promotion did not affect the original structure of catalyst. The SEM analysis indicates addition of cerium and lanthanum as promoters affected the morphology of the catalyst by altering the surface texture by introducing flakes to the molecular surface of the promoted catalysts. Addition of La-group promoters is capable to provide stable catalytic performance and slightly improved C 2 H 5 OH and CH 4 conversion into syngas mixture of H 2 and CO when compare to non-promoted cobalt catalyst. The promoter addition decreases/slow-down the process of carbon decomposition on the catalysts’ surfaces in the order; La > Ce > non-promoted Co/Al 2 O 3 catalysts together boosts up the production of H 2 and CO gas in term of production rate, yield and also selectivity. The production output H 2 :CO ratio is very suitable for downstream production such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. The trend of CH 4 :CO ratio suggests catalytic reforming of methane from ethanol decomposition occurrence, where methane was converted into syngas mixture of CO and H 2.
