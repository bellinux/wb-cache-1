5|$|The gods' complex <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> {{expressed}} in myths and in intricate relationships between deities: family ties, loose groups and hierarchies, and combinations of separate gods into one. Deities' diverse appearances in art—as animals, humans, objects, and combinations of different forms—also alluded, through symbolism, to their essential features.|$|E

5|$|The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass {{to that of}} {{its host}} star has been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> not as well-constrained, the planet's <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> not well-constrained either. The {{inability}} to constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's <b>characteristics</b> <b>is</b> {{a consequence of the}} fact that the star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.|$|R
5|$|Uranus was {{the last}} giant planet without any known {{irregular}} moons, but since 1997 nine distant irregular moons have been identified using ground-based telescopes. Two more small inner moons, Cupid and Mab, were discovered using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003. As of 2016, the moon Margaret {{was the last}} Uranian moon discovered, and its <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> published in October 2003.|$|E
5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E
5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{characteristic}} in {{the physical}} world can adopt one out of a set of values. Quantification of a characteristic may have several meanings; however, according to the Free Dictionary it is used for [...] "the act or process of assigning numbers to phenomena according to a rule". Accordingly, quantification of a characteristic means that the set of values of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> mapped on a suitable set of numbers. In other words, a <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> represented by a variable. The rules take care that all the relations like order, distance or a natural zero among the values of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>are</b> preserved within the obtained set of real numbers. An appropriate quantification necessitates therefore that the relations and hence the nature of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently well understood. In physics metric <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> of interest and quantification of a metric <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> obtained by selecting, for example, the values which are mapped on the real numbers 0 and 1, where the letter is called unit with a particular name like meter, mass or second.|$|R
5000|$|Persecution cannot alone be used {{to define}} PSG status, {{but it can be}} part of the social {{perception}} case for PSG status, i.e., the fact that people having a <b>characteristic</b> <b>are</b> persecuted is evidence that that <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> socially perceived as making them a distinct group.|$|R
50|$|Linguistic {{universals}} are {{patterns that}} can be seen cross linguistically. Universals can either be absolute, meaning that every documented language exhibits this characteristic, or statistical, meaning that this <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> seen in most languages or is probable in most languages. Universals, both absolute and statistical can be unrestricted, meaning that they apply to most or all languages without any additional conditions. Conversely, both absolute and statistical universals can be restricted or implicational, meaning that a <b>characteristic</b> will <b>be</b> true on the condition of something else (if Y <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> true, then X <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> true).|$|R
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Sanchez {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to {{maintain}} composure in the pocket amidst defensive pressure and focus on finding an open receiver to extend the team's offensive series. In his four-year career, Sanchez has had ten fourth quarter comebacks and twelve game winning drives. These <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> highlighted by Bill Parcells and Sam Wyche and garnered comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger. Sanchez was also noted for his proficiency in short passing situations and competitive nature; in December 2010, following dismal performances, Rex Ryan threatened to reduce Sanchez's repetitions with the first team offense during practice which infuriated Sanchez.|$|E
50|$|Eidetic {{reduction}} {{is a form}} of imaginative variation by which one attempts to reduce phenomenon into its necessary essences. This is done by theoretically changing different elements (while mentally observing whether or not the phenomenon changes) of a practical object to learn which <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> necessary for it to be it without being something else. If a <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> changed, and the object remains unchanged, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> unnecessary to the essence of the object, and vice versa.|$|R

Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E
5|$|He is the player's first {{opponent}} {{in all of}} his roles and is famous for his weakness and cowardice. These elements are considered by critics to be stereotypes of French people. These <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> emphasized by the developer of the Wii game which included cutscenes which depict Glass Joe in French settings. Glass Joe {{is considered one of the}} most well-known characters in the Punch-Out!! series and a Nintendo icon. His name has been used to describe poor performance by sportspeople and teams. In The Wii game his dialogue consists of him pleading not for the player to strike him in the jaw, complaints about the tightness of his gloves, and counting to ten in French.|$|E
5|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the Argentine naval commission then threw {{out all of}} the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were judged to be the best aspects of all the plans.

After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> allowed.|$|E

Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E

Steinkjer Station was the other station entirely built in stone. It has a combined Baroque Revival and Art Nouveau style, and is more anonymous than Levanger Station. Its <b>characteristics</b> <b>were</b> largely lost after it was connected with the bus station.

Niitsuma explained that its Wii exclusivity was also {{due to a lack}} of Capcom fighting games for the console, and because the Wii's casual quality matches the Vs. series trait of accessibility. The producer suggested that porting a sequel would be easier, but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making such plans. On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's senior vice president Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell Tatsunoko vs. Capcom physically or digitally.|$|E
