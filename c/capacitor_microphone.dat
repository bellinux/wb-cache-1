25|$|A {{condenser}} microphone, {{also called}} a <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone</b> or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, {{one of these}} plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condenser}} microphone, invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente, is {{also called}} a <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone</b> or electrostatic microphone—capacitors were historically called condensers. Here, the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and the vibrations produce {{changes in the}} distance between the plates. There are two types, depending on the method of extracting the audio signal from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones. With a DC-biased microphone, the plates are biased with a fixed charge (Q). The voltage maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = [...] ), where Q = charge in coulombs, C = capacitance in farads and V = potential difference in volts. [...] The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to {{the distance between the}}m for a parallel-plate capacitor.

40|$|Measurements of {{pressure}} {{variations in the}} source region are to be conducted in conjunction with an investigation of sound generation mechanisms on axial flow turbomachinery. The <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphones</b> normally used in acoustic measuring techniques cannot be used universally because of their volume. In addition, there are plans to measure pressure variations at the blade tips of a rotating impeller. The use of <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphones</b> might be problematic due to centrifugal accelerations (> 1000 g) present there. Piezoelectric or piezoresistive transducers offer themselves as candidate pressure sensors. While silicon sensors today are becoming smaller and smaller and more complex, their operational performance is increasing. The objective of the investigation {{was to determine the}} quality of a variety {{of pressure}} sensors as compared to that of <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphones</b> under suitable acoustic sound applications (free field, pressure chamber and with flow). Commercially available miniature pressure sensors - e. g. piezoresistive sensors made by KULITE, or IC sensors, or even piezoelectric films (PVDF) - obviously have been used for acoustic measurements only little or not at all. Their main advantages over <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphones</b> are their considerably smaller external dimensions. The behavior of different sensors with respect to amplitude, frequency and phase position were to be determined and assessed.

50|$|A <b>capacitor</b> ("condenser") <b>microphone</b> has a thin {{diaphragm}} that {{responds to}} ultrasound waves. Changes {{in the electric}} field between the diaphragm and a closely spaced backing plate convert sound signals to electric currents, which can be amplified.|$|R
5000|$|In a <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone</b> (commonly {{known as}} a {{condenser}} microphone), the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and vibrations produce changes in {{the distance between the}} diaphragm and a fixed plate, changing the voltage maintained across the capacitor plates.|$|E
50|$|An {{electret}} microphone {{is a type}} of <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone</b> invented by Gerhard Sessler and Jim West at Bell laboratories in 1962.The externally applied charge described above under condenser microphones is replaced by a permanent charge in an electret material. An electret is a ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged or polarized. The name comes from electrostatic and magnet; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.|$|E
5000|$|When {{electronic}} equipment was built using vacuum tubes, microphonics were often a serious design problem. The charged {{elements in the}} vacuum tubes can mechanically vibrate, changing {{the distance between the}} elements, producing charge flows {{in and out of the}} tube in a manner identical to a <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone.</b> A system sufficiently susceptible to microphonics could experience audio feedback, and make noises if jarred or bumped. Certain vacuum tubes were made with thicker internal insulating plates and more supports to minimize these effects.A special tool, called a valve hammer, or tube hammer was sometimes used to safely tap the device suspected of being microphonic, while it was operating, so checking if such a tap would produce objectional audio effects.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to their}} good {{performance}} {{and ease of}} manufacture, hence low cost, {{the vast majority of}} microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units. Nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones are electret types. They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones. Though electret microphones were once considered low quality, the best ones can now rival traditional condenser microphones in every respect and can even offer the long-term stability and ultra-flat response needed for a measurement <b>microphone.</b> Unlike other <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphones,</b> they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated preamplifier that does require power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamplifier is frequently phantom powered in sound reinforcement and studio applications. [...] Monophonic microphones designed for personal computer (PC) use, sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5mm plug as usually used, without power, for stereo; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power via a resistor from (normally) a 5V supply in the computer. Stereophonic microphones use the same connector; there is no obvious way to determine which standard is used by equipment and microphones.|$|R
40|$|Very {{little has}} been done to {{quantify}} temporomandibular joint (TMJ) sound amplitudes and background noise and to determine the spectrum from healthy TMJs. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} record acoustically the sounds emitted by healthy TMJs with and without mandibular movements, for determination of baseline spectra. TMJ sounds were recorded bilaterally from 40 subjects with healthy joints by means of a self-developed recording system using miniature <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphones</b> inserted into the earpieces of a medical stethoscope placed in the meatus of the auditory canal. The recordings were performed without mandibular movements and during three consecutive opening and closing movements. The signals were high-pass-filtered at 50 Hz, low-pass-filtered at 2 kHz, and analyzed by fast Fourier transform computation on a 1024 -point window (fs = 5 kHz). The linearly weighted average baseline spectrum recorded without motion showed maximum values of 31 dBSPL (sound pressure level) with a standard error of + 2 to - 3 dB. The linearly weighted average movement spectrum had a peak of 66 dBSPL at 156 Hz and decreased almost linearly by about 40 dB/decade to 25 dBSPL at 2000 Hz with a standard error of +/- 2 dB. Thus, the TMJ sound spectrum of mandibular movements in asymptomatic subjects differed at low frequencies by up to 35 dB from the baseline spectrum in absence of motion...|$|R
40|$|Exploring the {{abundant}} {{resources in the}} ocean requires underwater acoustic detectors with a high-sensitivity reception of low-frequency sound from greater distances and zero reflections. Here we address both challenges by integrating an easily deformable network of metal nanoparticles in a hydrogel matrix {{for use as a}} cavity-free microphone. Since metal nanoparticles can be densely implanted as inclusions, and can even be arranged in coherent arrays, this microphone can detect static loads and air breezes from different angles, as well as underwater acoustic signals from 20 Hz to 3 kHz at amplitudes as low as 4 Pa. Unlike dielectric <b>capacitors</b> or cavity-based <b>microphones</b> that respond to stimuli by deforming the device in thickness directions, this hydrogel device responds with a transient modulation of electric double layers, resulting in an extraordinary sensitivity (217 nF kPa– 1 or 24 μCN– 1 at a bias of 1. 0 V) without using any signal amplification tools...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} a <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone</b> {{calorimeter}} to measure rapid enthalpy changes that occur when bacteriorhodopsin-containing membrane fragments are excited with short flashes of light. We resolved the enthalpy changes into three phases. At about 100 microsecond after the flash, the bacteriorhodopsins converted into metastable states have an enthalpy about 15 - 20 kcal mol- 1 greater than the enthalpy before excitation. Some of this energy (approximately 10 kcal) is then released to the surroundings as the membrane fragments release protons to the solution. After proton release and before proton rebinding, {{a large amount of}} heat is released to the surroundings, equivalent to about 40 - 45 kcal/mol of bacteriorhodopsin reacting. At this point the energy of the system is about 35 kcal/mol less than it was before the flash; i. e., the system has released all of the energy of the photon (49 kcal/E) plus an additional 35 kcal/mol. Nevertheless, the free energy of the system must still be greater than it was originally, because relaxation to the original state occurs spontaneously. An entropy decrease of at least 125 cal/mol per deg is required to compensate for the heat release. An entropy decrease of this magnitude implies a major increase in molecular order in the purple membrane...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new single-chip MEMS <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone</b> on a {{silicon wafer}} by {{minimizing}} {{the size and}} the reduction of mechanical strength using a circular diaphragm with a fixed center is proposed. In the proposed microphone, the diaphragm includes a number of holes to pass the air through {{the gap between the}} back plate and diaphragm, and thus reduces the damping of the sound from the microphone. Novelty of this method, creating a circular microphone with fixed center, which the diameter of diaphragm is less than the conventional condenser microphone. At first, the mechanical analysis was conducted on microphone diaphragm in order to achieve the pull-in voltage. The pull-in voltage of the proposed circular microphone is 14 volts. According to the obtained pull-in voltage, the bias voltage were applied to the microphone, and various parameters such as capacitance and sensitivity were measured. Based on the simulation results of COMSOL, the proposed microphone with diaphragm diameter of 400 μm and a thickness of 1. 5 μm, the sensitivity of - 23 dB is shown. In comparison with previous works, the proposed microphone with lower supply voltage is provided the better frequency performance, and higher sensitivity, in order to sense the sound...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{materials}} science are fundamental to technological developments and have broad societal impacts. For example, years of materials science research {{has gone into}} developing cellular phones which are composed of polymer cases, liquid crystal displays, LEDs, silicon chips, Ni-Cd batteries, resistors, <b>capacitors,</b> speakers, and <b>microphones,</b> and compacted into a space equivalent {{to that of a}} deck of cards. Like many technological developments, cellular phones have become a ubiquitous part of society, and yet most people know little about the materials science associated with their development. The rich context that materials science provides for learning Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) content and the need to enhance K- 12 educators 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of materials science was the motivation for developing and offering a 20 hour four-day professional development course entitled 2 ̆ 2 Living in a Materials World. 2 ̆ 2 In addition to exposing the participating K- 12 educators to the fundamentals of materials science, the course provided a means for bridging our every day experiences and the work of scientists and engineers. 2 ̆ 2 Living in a Materials World 2 ̆ 2 was one of the fifteen STEM content courses offered as part of the Idaho Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (i-STEM) summer institute for upper elementary and middle school teachers. The four-day institute included a 20 hour course and 12 - 16 hours of plenary sessions, planning, and collaborative sharing. The goal of the i-STEM institute was to enhance the participating educators 2 ̆ 7 STEM content knowledge, capacity for teaching STEM, comfort and attitudes toward teaching STEM, knowledge of how people learn, and strategies for integrating STEM throughout the curriculum. In addition, the participants received STEM curriculum {{in materials}} science and a resource kit composed of STEM materials and equipment, valued at about 300, to support the implementation of curriculum and content learned at the institute with their students. The i-STEM summer institute participants were pre/post tested on their comfort with STEM, perceptions of STEM education, pedagogical discontentment, implementations of inquiry, attitudes toward student learning of STEM, and content knowledge associated with the specific course they took during the institute. The results from our research indicate a significant increase in content knowledge for the Living in a Materials World strand participants (t = 11. 36, p 3 ̆c. 01) (results were similar in the other courses). As a whole the summer institute participants expressed significant increases in their comfort levels for teaching STEM (t = 10. 94, p 3 ̆c. 01), inquiry implementation (t = 5. 72, p 3 ̆c. 01) and efficacy for teaching STEM (t = 6. 27, p 3 ̆c. 01), and a significant decrease in pedagogical discontentment (t = - 6. 26, p 3 ̆c. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There {{are several}} sources of noise in an {{industrial}} and agriculture environment. Machines with rotating or reciprocating engines are sound-producing sources. Also, the audio signal can be analyzed to discover how well a machine operates. Diesel engines complex noise SPL and sound frequency content both strongly depend on fuel combustion, which produces the so-called combustion noise. Actually, the unpleasant sound signature of diesel engines {{is due to the}} harsh and irregular self-ignition of the fuel. Therefore, being able to extract combustion noise from the overall noise would be of prime interest. This would allow engineers to relate the sound quality back to the combustion parameters. The residual noise produced by various sources, is referred to as mechanical noise. Since diesel engine noise radiation is associated with the operators’ and pedestrians’ discomfort, more and more attention to being paid to it. The main sources of noise generation in a diesel engine are exhaust system, mechanical processes such as valve train and combustion that prevail over the other two. In the present work, experimental tests were conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine in order to investigate the combustion noise radiation during stationary state for various diesel and biodiesel fuel blends. Materials and Methods: The engine used in the current study is an ASHTAD DF 120 -RA 70 that is a single cylinder 4 stroke water cooled diesel engine and its nominal power is 7. 5 hp at 2200 rpm. The experiment has been done at three positions (Left ear of operator, 1. 5 and 7. 5 meter away from exhaust) based on ISO- 5131 and SAE-J 1174 standards. For engine speed measurement the detector Lurton 2364 was utilized with a measurement accuracy of 0. 001 rpm. To obtain the highest accuracy, contact mode of detector was used. The engine noise was measured by HT 157 sound level meter and was digitalized and saved with Sound View software. HT 157 uses alow impedance, <b>capacitor</b> <b>microphone</b> with a unidirectional pattern whose size, sensitivity and frequency range are 1 / 2 ", 50 mV Pa- 1 and 10 Hz to 20 kHz with a flat extrusion, respectively. Choosing the combination of fuel was carried out according to experiments that have been done before determining engine operation parameters. Results and Discussion: Fuel type has a direct effect {{on the quality of the}} IC engine's combustion phenomenon. One of the most important quality parameters that can be fluctuated by fuel type is engine noise. The fuel type has a direct effect on internal fuel ignition engines and affects the quality of fuel ignition. One of the effects of ignition quality is the sound of the engine that is very important in terms of both the health and evaluation of engine performance. Two-wheel tractors are of the most important tools used in agriculture. In addition to agricultural work, they have applications in rural areas as power generators. No research has been carried out so far in Iran on the sound of two-wheel tractors fuelled with diesel and biodiesel fuels. Therefore, the sound of the ignition of biodiesel and diesel mixtures in four stroke, single cylinder, two wheel diesel tractors manufactured by Ashtad Company was studied. The purpose of this study is to analyze the noise parameters of a diesel engine using B 0, B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20, B 25 and B 30 biodiesel–diesel blends. Biodiesel was produced from waste oil and blended with net diesel fuel to evaluate the Power tiller's engine noise parameters. This study was carried out at a stationary position and at three positions such as driver's left ear position (DLEP), 1. 5 meter (1. 5 MAFE) and 7. 5 meters (7. 5 MAFE) away from the exhaust at 6 engine speeds (1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000 & 2200 rpm). Statistical analysis and frequency analysis were used to analyze sound of the engine. The results showed that the sound pressure levels of the engine for B 10 fuel have the least amount of noise level of the sound pressure. However, this fuel has no significant difference at 1...|$|E
