40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{heuristic}} structural decomposition strategy for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), called Cut-and-Traverse (CAT) decomposition. This method has three steps: <b>cutting</b> <b>step,</b> traversing step and combining step. In the first step, <b>cutting</b> <b>step,</b> we gradually decompose {{the structure of}} a CSP instance to multiple partitions by finding independent cuts in a given CSP. Every cut is a set of hyperedges in a CSP instance. We can control the size of cut by only finding independent cuts that are no greater than a given bound number h. In the second step, traversing step, we traverse each partition and get an equivalent acyclic constraint network for each partition. In the third step, combining step, we combine the acyclic constraint networks in all partitions and get an equivalent acyclic constraint network for the given CSP. Using this method, the complexity is O(|E | h) where |E | is the number of constraints in given CSP instance. Our experiment shows that CAT decomposition spends far much less time than hypertree decomposition while sometimes produces same hyperwidth decomposition as hypertree decomposition. Also it is shown that CAT decomposition always produces better decomposition result than hinge decomposition. ...|$|E

In normal mice, most fenestrations are irregular holes with a relative large size (Fig.  2 A) while, in As(III)-exposed mice, a majority of fenestrations appear as approximately round holes {{and most of them are}} relatively smaller than those in normal ones (Fig.  2 B).|$|E

The manufacturing defects can be divided into two categories: machining defects and positioning defects. A double measurement method is principally used to quantify separately machining and positioning defect. The first measurement is operated inside a machine tool just after the final <b>cutting</b> <b>step.</b> The second measurement is realised outside of the machine tool (e. g. on a coordinate measuring machine - CMM). However, data processing method and precision between two different machines are different.

The selection rule selects a small prior set of possible interacting points and a <b>cutting</b> <b>step</b> remove from this prior set the irrelevant points. We also prove that the Ising models satisfy the assumptions of the main theorems, without restrictions on the temperature, on the structure of the interacting graph or on the range of the interactions.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper explores the through-thickness distribution of residual stresses in a valve seat of complex geometry where a Tristelle insert was HIP-bonded to a Type 316 stainless steel body. The contour method was conducted in a novel way to measure a full cross-sectional map of hoop stress at an axial-radial plane {{along the length of the}} valve seat. Special care was applied to control and optimise the <b>cutting</b> <b>step</b> of the measurement technique in order to produce cut surfaces of high quality thereby minimising potential associated errors in stress. The innovation in the present work was to use sacrificial material to avoid any cutting artefacts introduced by the cutting process. High levels of residual stresses were measured in the region where an insert was HIP-bonded to the main body. The excellent correlation between the stresses measured using the contour and incremental centre hole drilling methods demonstrates the importance of controlling the quality of a contour cut and that care should be taken to avoid cutting artefacts particularly when stresses close to the surface are of interest. ...|$|E

30|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to evaluate three-dimensional stress distributions within a stem volume (as shown in Fig.  1). They generally require the felling of the tree and the step-by-step destruction of the log. In this destruction process, each cutting operation creates a new free surface allowing a local release of the remaining growth stress. Based on the deformation measured at each <b>cutting</b> <b>step,</b> together with data on mechanical properties of the material, the pre-existing stress can be obtained by back calculation. The differences among the various methods of stress-distribution determination concern mainly the setup of cutting steps and the technique used to measure deformation. When wood is removed from log periphery or from the remaining log, at each stage, the deformation must be measured at the newly created surface, for instance by gluing new strain gauges [6, 7]. When it is removed from the inner part of the log, like with the cylinder removal method [8, 9], a single set of strain gauges can be used for the whole test. As another approach, the central plank method allows to evaluate, in two steps only, a good approximation of the radial distribution of growth stress along stem diameter [37, 38].|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) has become the material of choice {{for a variety of}} microsystem applications, including microfluidics, imprint lithography, and soft microrobotics. For most of these applications, PDMS is processed by replication molding; however, new applications would greatly benefit from the ability to pattern PDMS films using lithography and etching. Metal hardmasks, in conjunction with reactive ion etching (RIE), have been reported as a method for patterning PDMS; however, this approach suffers from a high surface roughness because of metal redeposition and limited etch thickness due to poor etch selectivity. We found that a combination of LOR and SU 8 photoresists enables the patterning of thick PDMS layers by RIE without redeposition problems. We demonstrate the ability to etch 1. 5 -μm pillars in PDMS with a selectivity of 3. 4.

This thesis serves to explore a few methods of procedurally generating models of rocks or boulders {{that could be used in}} such contexts. This includes geometry and shading.

Sphere inflation, inspired by a classic sphere modeling method, involves "inflating" a base mesh (usually a platonic solid) to grow towards the boundaries of a sphere using an iterative subdivision approach, halting at a predetermined level of iteration. The second approach, recursive subdivision of segmented edges, involves dividing a base mesh into edge segments based on a predefined segment size, subdividing a polygon with pre-segmented edges with a recursive subdivision method based on the sphere inflation subdivision scheme. The segmented edges method is followed by a corner <b>cutting</b> <b>step</b> to "carve" the base mesh into a shape approaching a rock.

This novel work {{was an attempt to}} increase energy dissipation on stepped spillways since it not include stilling basin and have less cost compared with traditional spillways. So, in this paper, to investigate the increasing of energy dissipation of flow over stepped spillways of different step shapes, a twelve physical plywood models have been built. Experiments have been carried out for different types of step shapes: - plain steps, steps have half cut, inclined end sill steps normal to downstream slopes of stepped face, and steps have a rough surface using crushed gravel. Three downstream slopes of stepped face (è = 30 o, 50 o, and 70 o) were tested with spillway having constant number of steps and constant height. In total, 144 experiments were done, the hydraulic parameters of flow over the models were measured and the energy dissipation of flow was calculated. Experimental results showed that the energy dissipation of flow on inclined end sill, and rough steps are more than the plain one. While the experiments results on the <b>cutting</b> <b>steps</b> showed that the energy dissipation are less than the plain one. With decreasing the downstream slopes of the stepped spillway face, the energy dissipation is increased. In addition, when compared with traditional spillways the case of rough steps and steps with inclined end sill can be used to increase the relative energy dissipation on plain steps by about 19 % and about 18 % respectively for small angle of spillway face since the stepped spillways more effective than traditional spillways by 10 %. Therefore, double that means that the affectivity of stepped spillway was approximately. On the other side, the energy dissipation increased at low discharges by 0. 1 % when using the <b>cutting</b> <b>steps</b> but decreased by 13 % with larger discharges. In summary, the flow energy dissipation decreases with increasing the flow rate, and the roughed step spillway surface is more effective compared to the other spillway surfaces at low or high flow rate.

Additionally, studies on waste minimization through recycling of the waste brake lining dust into the virgin mix and the effect of this recycling on subsequent product performance quality were also carried out. The audit showed that there was generation of waste at just about every step of the process, as evidenced by weight loss calculations on the original mix entering the process. For example, in the <b>cutting</b> <b>step</b> this loss was about 30 percent, in grinding it ranged from 10. 64 percent to 13. 03 percent, in drilling from 2. 17 percent to 6. 8 percent, and in chamfering from 0. 49 percent to 1. 07 percent; in the case of cutting this included both cutting residues and fines while {{in the rest of the}} cases these were only fines.
