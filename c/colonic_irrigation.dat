For many centuries, <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigation</b> was the only treatment available.

During the mid 20th Century, several operations were developed for instances where the sphincters were intact but weakened. Muscle transpositions using the gluteus maximus or the gracilis were devised, but did not become used widely until later. End-to-end sphincteroplasty is shown {{to have a high}} failure rate in 1940. In 1971 Parks and McPartlin first describe an overlapping sphincteroplasty procedure. Biofeedback is first introduced in 1974. In 1975, Parks describes post anal repair, a technique to reinforce the pelvic floor and EAS to treat idiopathic cases. Endoanal ultrasound is invented in 1991, which starts to demonstrate the high number of occult sphincter tears following vaginal deliveries. In 1994, the use of an endoanal coil during pelvic MRI shows greater detail of the anal canal than previously. During the last 20 years, dynamic graciliplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, injectable perianal bulking agents and radiofrequency ablation have been devised, mainly due to the relatively poor success rates and high morbidity associated with the earlier procedures.|$|E

40|$|Evidence of {{a varied}} nature {{has led to}} the widely {{accepted}} conclusion that one of the significant factors leading to elevation of the blood pressure in essential hypertension is constriction of the arterioles. A thorough review of the literature dealing with this problem has recently been published by Fishberg (1) and tends to show that the most important vascular territory involved in this mechanism is the splanchnic region. The evidence is, as has been said, varied. As long ago as 1875 Litten (2) observed that tying off the superior mesenteric artery in dogs was followed promptly by rise of arterial pressure of from twenty to twenty-five millimeters of mercury. The elevation frequently persisted for several hours. Longcope and McClintock (3, 4) demonstrated that compression of the coeliac axis and superior mesenteric arteries in dogs is followed by temporary increase of the blood pressure.

40|$|Results {{of colon}} {{surgery at the}} turn of the century, as {{compared}} with those of the present day, show great improvement in recent years. This improvement has been due to many factors, the most important of all being the careful preoperative preparation of the patients. Formerly, patients were admitted to the hospital and in a day or two were operated on. The bowels were full of faeces and teeming with bacteria, and as a result the mortality after operation often ranged from sixty to seventy per cent, even in the hands of the best surgeons. In the past fifteen or twenty years, however, it became apparent that certain measures could be taken to reduce mortality. It was shown that one cause of the high morbidity and mortality was lack of pre-operative preparation. It became the practice to precede an operation by at least a weeks preparation which consisted of a preliminary purge, followed by <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigations,</b> a liquid diet and parenteral feeding. There was an immediate reduction in mortality following operations on the colon after this regime. Then with the introduction of the sulfonamides, a new era in the surgery of the colon was inaugurated. Intraperitoneal and parenteral administration of the readily absorbed sulfonamides induced a redaction in the incidence of peritonitis, but the most pronounced change followed the introduction of sulfonamides which were poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally [ [...] . ...|$|R

50|$|There are {{arguments}} {{both for}} and against <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigation</b> in people with diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, severe or internal hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum or colon, and its usage is not recommended soon after bowel surgery (unless directed by one's health care provider).

5000|$|While <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{enjoyed a}} vogue {{in the early}} 20th century as a {{possible}} cure for numerous diseases, subsequent research showed that it was useless and potentially harmful.

5000|$|The term [...] "colonic irrigation" [...] is {{commonly}} used in gastroenterology {{to refer to the}} practice of introducing water through a colostomy or a surgically constructed conduit as a treatment for constipation. The Food and Drug Administration has ruled that <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigation</b> equipment is not approved for sale for the purpose of general well-being and has taken action against many distributors of this equipment, including a Warning Letter.

50|$|Each episode {{features}} a guest presenting {{a list of}} things to Brigstocke that, until coming on the show, they had never done before but many others have. Generally the show is structured around one each of certain types of experiences; reading a new book, listening to some new music, watching a new film or television programme (for all of these, the guest is often given an example of a genre they've never sampled before), eating a new food and taking part in a new leisure activity. Examples of the latter include comedian Phill Jupitus having his first <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigation,</b> magician Paul Daniels learning how to swim and Goodies star Tim Brooke-Taylor buying his first pornographic magazine.|$|E
50|$|This {{procedure}} {{involves the}} surgical {{creation of a}} stoma (either an appendicostomy, cecostomy, or sigmoidostomy), which thereafter functions as an irrigation port. This antegrade <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigation</b> aims to introduce fluid to wash out the colon at regular intervals. The idea is to ensure regular emptying of the colon and rectum and hopefully, prevent involuntary loss of bowel content. The Malone antegrade continence enema (MACE) is where an appendicostomy is created, i.e. the vermiform appendix is stitched to the abdominal wall to form a stoma. ACE is often necessary in addition to others when FI is complicated by neuropathy and/or an incomplete IAS. Patients may have persistent leakage of fluid per rectum for several hours following the irrigation.|$|E

5000|$|Krusen {{realized}} that {{the growth of the}} field of physical medicine required an ongoing commitment to research, and he was an early proponent of outcome studies and evidence-based practice.

In the 1930s, the modality articles focused on fever therapy, shortwave diathermy, heat lamps, <b>colonic</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and radiotherapy. In the 1940s, he continued publishing on shortwave diathermy and fever therapy but added articles on ultraviolet, infrared, and atomic energy. In the 1950s, Krusen published multiple ultrasound plus microwave and electrical stimulation articles. Although modalities were his main focus, Krusen also published articles in the 1930s on industrial medicine, followed in the 1950s with articles on disabled workers and industrial health. During the World War II and shortly after, Krusen published several articles on the need for rehabilitation training within the United States defense programs. Later in his career, he stressed the important role that PM&R should play in the hospital and outpatient settings, and offered commentary on the future of PM&R within the broader field of medicine.|$|E
