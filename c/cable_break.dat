5000|$|Rings can be unidirectional, {{with all}} traffic {{travelling}} either clockwise or anticlockwise around the ring, or bidirectional (as in SONET/SDH).

40|$|The {{global network}} of subsea fibre-optic cables plays a {{critical}} role in the world economy and is considered as strategic infrastructure for many nations. Sediment density flows have caused significant disruption to this network in the recent past. These cable breaks represent the only means to actively monitor such flows over large oceanic regions. Here, we use a global <b>cable</b> <b>break</b> database to analyse tropical cyclone triggering of sediment density flows worldwide over 25 yrs. Cable breaking sediment density flows are triggered in nearly all areas exposed to tropical cyclones but most occur in the NW Pacific. They are triggered by one of three sets of mechanisms. Tropical cyclones directly trigger flows, synchronous to their passage, as a consequence of storm waves, currents and surges. Cyclones also trigger flows indirectly, with near-synchronous timing to their passage, as a consequence of peak flood discharges. Last, cyclones trigger flows after a delay of days {{as a consequence of the}} failure of large volumes of rapidly deposited sediment. No clear relationship emerges between tropical cyclone activity (i. e. track, frequency and intensity) and the number of sediment density flows triggered. This is a consequence of the short period of observation. However, expansion of the cable network and predicted changes to cyclone activity in specific regions increases the likelihood of increasing numbers of damaging flows...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} {{discovery of}} active submarine landslides and turbidity currents {{in the deep}} ocean {{was made in the}} 1950 s through analysis of breaks in transoceanic communications cables. Further insights regarding the causes, frequency, and behavior of damaging submarine flows are presented here, based on recent disruptions of modern communications cables in the Strait of Luzon off southern Taiwan. In 2006, the Pingtung earthquake triggered landslides and at least three sediment density flows (a general term covering turbidity currents and similar flows). These flows sped down submarine canyons and into the Manila Trench at 12. 7 – 5. 6 m s– 1 (45 – 20 km h– 1), resulting in 22 cable breaks. In 2009, the cables were again damaged, this time by extreme river discharge associated with Typhoon Morakot. Two cables were damaged during the main flood when debris-charged river waters dived to the seabed and down Gaoping Canyon. A second, more damaging sediment density flow formed three days later when river levels were near normal and seismic activity was low. It is suggested that this second flow resulted from deposited flood sediment that was remobilized possibly by internal wave activity. Further breaks were reported in 2010 and 2012. While historical <b>cable</b> <b>break</b> databases are incomplete, they imply that since at least 1989, density flows capable of breaking cables have been infrequent, but they increased markedly after the 2006 Pingtung earthquake—a time that coincided with a transition to more extreme rainfall associated with northward migration of typhoon tracks to Taiwan...|$|E

On 21 May 2003, a magnitude 6. 8 earthquake located near Boumerdès (central Algerian coast) triggered large turbidity currents responsible for 29 submarine cable breaks {{at the foot of the}} continental slope over ~ 150 km from west to east. Seafloor bathymetry and backscatter imagery show the potential imprints of the 2003 event and of previous events. Large slope scarps resulting from active deformation may locally enhance sediment instabilities, although faults are not directly visible at the seafloor. Erosion is evident at the foot of the margin and along the paths of the numerous canyons and valleys. Cable breaks are located at the outlets of submarine valleys and in areas of turbiditic levee overspilling and demonstrate the multi-source and multi-path character of the 2003 turbiditic event.

Preliminary results on sediment core PSM-KS 23 off Boumerdès typically show a 800 -yr interval between turbidites during the Holocene, in accordance with the estimated mean seismic cycle on land, even if at this stage it is not yet possible to prove the earthquake origin of all the turbidites...|$|E
40|$|Submarine landslides, debris {{flows and}} {{turbidity}} currents are significant geohazards for seafloor infrastructure in many {{locations around the}} world. Their deposits potentially provide a valuable record of major earthquakes, which extends further back in time than most terrestrial earthquake records. It is therefore important to determine their frequency and triggering mechanisms, and what types of earthquake trigger submarine slides and flows in different settings. Submarine cable breaks provided the first evidence of submarine mass movements, {{as shown by the}} 1929 Grand Banks earthquake. Even now the global network of subsea telecommunication cables provides our only means to monitor flows globally. Here, we present the first global analysis of the occurrence of submarine mass movements caused by earthquakes using <b>cable</b> <b>break</b> data. Using a global database of subsea fibre-optic cable breaks we identify earthquakes that triggered (and did not trigger) submarine mass movements from 1989 to 2015. We note that cable breaks are not a perfect record of submarine mass movements, and may only record more powerful (>~ 2 m s− 1) flows. However, our results show, in contrast to previous assertions, that there is no specific earthquake magnitude that systematically trigger mass flows capable of breaking a cable. Some earthquakes with magnitudes > 7. 0 Mw triggered cable breaking flows, but many > 7. 0 Mw earthquakes have failed to break nearby cables. We also show that some very small (3. 0 – 4. 0) magnitude earthquakes are capable of triggering cable breaking flows. The susceptibility of slopes to fail as a consequence of large and small earthquakes is dependent on the average seismicity of the region and the volume of sediment supplied annually in addition to other preconditioning factors such as slope architecture and mechanical sediment properties...|$|E

40|$|Northern Algeria is {{threatened}} by moderate to large magnitude earthquakes resulting from the slow convergence between the African and European plates. Main active faults are located offshore along the Algerian coast, as exemplified by the 2003 Mw 6. 9 Boumerdès earthquake. This event triggered numerous and widespread turbidity currents over ∼ 150 km along strike in the Algerian basin (reaching 2800 m of water depth) and demonstrates the multi-source and multi-path characteristics of earthquake-triggered turbidity flows along this margin segment. We rely on the sedimentological analysis of five cores located at the toe of the Algiers margin, close to the 2003 <b>cable</b> <b>break</b> sites, to explore the potential for Holocene turbidite paleoseismology. Radiocarbon measurements provide age models for hemipelagic sediments. Based on sedimentary facies identification, analysis of depositional sequences (stacking pattern) and a stratigraphic framework established by age models, a first correlation of turbidites between the 5 cores is attempted. The number of turbidites is constant {{at the base of}} the continental slope and decreases seawards (over 80 km away from the coast). From turbidite correlations, 36 synchronous events are identified along the Algiers margin segment over the last 9 kyr, and are tentatively interpreted as seismically triggered, providing a 250 yr long mean recurrence interval. The main historical earthquakes in the Algiers area (2003, 1716 and 1365 AD) reasonably correlate with three out of the four last turbidites, strengthening the hypothesis that turbidites are suitable markers for Holocene paleoseismology. Recurrence intervals of turbidites range between 50 and 900 yr, defining quiescence periods exceeding 450 yr. Three quiescence periods lasting about 800, 1400 and 500 yr (7 – 6. 2 ka BP, 5. 4 – 4 ka BP, and 1. 5 – 1 ka BP, respectively) support irregular earthquake cycling. Earthquake-triggered turbidites are more frequent in the study area than in the western adjacent margin segment (offshore El Asnam). This higher frequency could arise from the location of the seismogenic faults beneath the continental slope, whereas they are located several tenths of kilometers onland in the El Asnam area, implying less instabilities of the submarine slope...|$|E
40|$|Submarine mass {{movements}} {{are one of}} the most important processes for moving sediment across our planet. They represent the dominant process for moving sediment in many parts of the world’s oceans, freshwater lakes and reservoirs. These flows also represent a significant geohazard. They can generate damaging tsunami and have the potential to damage strategically important seafloor infrastructure. It is therefore important to understand the frequency and triggering mechanisms of these events. This thesis aims to further our understanding using a variety of different data types (artificial data, deposits found in cores, seismic stratigraphy and submarine cable breaks) across different spatial scales. First, artificial data is used to analyse the impacts of large age uncertainties on identifying a triggering mechanism for large (> 1 km 3) landslides in a global database. It is shown that the size of age uncertainties, the small number of landslides within the database and the combination of multiple different settings into one dataset will likely result in landslides appearing to occur randomly. As a result it is suggested that it is prudent to focus on well-dated landslides from one setting with similar triggers rather than having a poorly calibrated understanding of landslide ages in multiple settings which may prevent a trigger being identified. Second, a global database of subsea fibre optic cable breaks is used to investigate the triggering of submarine mass movements by earthquakes and tropical cyclones. Globally earthquakes between Mw 3 and Mw 9. 2 are shown to trigger mass movements. However, in contrast to previous assertions it is shown that there is not a specific earthquake magnitude that will systematically trigger mass movements capable of breaking a cable. The susceptibility of slopes to fail as a consequence of large and small earthquakes is dependent on the average seismicity of the region and the volume of sediment supplied annually to the continental shelf. The frequency of damaging tropical cyclone triggered submarine mass movements is lower than earthquake triggered mass movements. Analysis of the <b>cable</b> <b>break</b> database reveals three mechanisms by which mass {{movements are}} triggered. First, tropical cyclones trigger flows directly, synchronous to their passage due to dynamic loading of the seabed. Second, flows are triggered indirectly, as a consequence of peak flood discharges delivering large volumes of sediment to the continental shelf. Third, flows are triggered indirectly following a delay as a consequence of the large volumes of rapidly deposited sediment that occurs after the passage of a tropical cyclone. No clear global relationship between future climate change and flow frequency is shown, however, changes to cyclone activity in specific regions appears likely to increase damaging flow frequency. Third, using a new piston core dataset, the timing and frequency of glacigenic debris-flows on the Bear Island Trough-Mouth Fan is investigated. The timing of glacigenic debris-flows over the last 140, 000 years is shown to be controlled by the presence of an ice stream close to the shelf edge. Moreover, it is shown that the frequency and volumes of these flows is controlled by the overall dynamics of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet which vary significantly over the 140, 000 year time period. Last, a review of the relationship between ice sheets and submarine mass movements around the Nordic Seas over the Quaternary is presented using published seismic and sediment core datasets. From these data sources, the growth and decay histories of the Greenland, Barents Sea and Scandinavian Ice Sheets are tracked relative to the different types of submarine mass movements identified on their margins. The type and frequency of submarine mass movement is shown to be highly variable as a consequence of variable ice sheet extent, rates of sediment transport and meltwater export of sediment. These records have allowed the identification of first order controls on sediment delivery to continental margins at ice sheet scales. It has also enabled updated conceptual models of trough-mouth fan processes, glaciated margin development and submarine landslide occurrence to be developed. ...|$|E
5000|$|The drivers {{remotely}} {{control the}} speed of the cable, which is powered by a [...] electric motor and slowed by redundant braking systems, all located at the upper terminus. The cable itself is 950 m long, has a diameter of 40 mm, and has a breaking load of 66.5 tonnes. In the unlikely event of the <b>cable</b> <b>breaking,</b> the loss of cable tension would automatically cause track gripper brakes on each car to be deployed to bring them to a standstill.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} for breaking high strength prestressed cable. The old method used an aluminum oxide grit packed into a special gripping jaw. The new method uses aluminum shims wrapped around the cable and then is gripped with a V-grip. The new method gives nearly 100 % "good breaks" on the cable compared to approximately 10 % good breaks with the old method. In addition, the new <b>cable</b> <b>breaking</b> method gives higher ultimate tensile strengths, is more reproducible, is quicker, cleaner and easier on equipment...|$|R
5000|$|WACS is {{the largest}} {{submarine}} cable on Africa’s western seaboard, with a design capacity of 14.5 Tbit/s and the largest submarine cable on Africa's western seaboard [...] linking South Africa with the United Kingdom WIOCC has made a strategic investment in WACS to extend its service reach and offer cost-effective, carrier-grade diversity solutions. Circuits on WACS can be protected against <b>cable</b> <b>breaks</b> and equipment failures by choosing its ‘in system protection’ option, which reroutes affected traffic onto an alternative fibre pair {{in the event of}} a failure.|$|R
