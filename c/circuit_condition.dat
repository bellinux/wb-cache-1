25|$|High-resistance {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the fault current to 25A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|E

40|$|In this study, series {{active filter}} or dynamic voltage restorer {{application}} is proposed for reduction of downstream fault current {{in addition to}} voltage quality enhancement. Recently, the application of Z-source inverter is proposed in order to optimize DVR operation.

Here, the Z-source inverter based DVR is proposed to compensate voltage disturbance at the PCC and to reduce the fault current in downstream of DVR. By calculating instantaneous current magnitude in synchronous frame, control system recognizes if the fault exists or not, and determines whether DVR should compensate voltage disturbance or try to reduce the fault current.

40|$|We {{study the}} carbon {{nanotube}} Schottky barrier at the metallic electrode interface in polarized gases using an equivalent circuit model. The gas-nanotube interaction is often weak {{and very little}} charge transfer is expected [l]. This is the case with'oxygen, but the gas-electrode interaction is appreciable and makes the oxygen molecules negatively charged. In the closed <b>circuit</b> <b>condition,</b> screening positive charges appear in the nanotube {{as well as in}} the electrode, and the Schottky barrier is modulated due to the resultant electrostatic effects [2]. In the case of ammonia, both the gas-nanotube and gas-electrode interactions are weak, but the Schottky barrier can still be modulated since the molecules are polarized and align in the preferred orientation within the gap between the electrode and nanotube in the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> (dipole layer formation). In the closed <b>circuit</b> <b>condition,</b> an electric field appears in the gap and strengthens or weakens the preferred dipole alignment reflecting the nanotube Fermi level.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a five-phase permanent-magnet (PM) motor is analyzed under postfault conditions. Proper current control strategies are adopted {{so as to guarantee}} safe drive operation after any fault occurrence. This paper covers three fault types: the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> of a single phase, the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> of two nonadjacent phases, and the open <b>circuit</b> <b>condition</b> of two adjacent phases. Two motors with two different windings (with double and single layers, respectively) are compared under each fault type. This paper aims to highlight the difference in the motor {{performance of}} motors adopting these two different windings. A further novelty of this paper is that the proper current control strategies are derived analytically, including not only the fundamental harmonic of the flux-density distribution but also the higher harmonics. It is shown that these harmonics cause high torque oscillations. Owing to this analytical approach, the strategy can be applied to a variety of PM motors. In addition, the postfault current waveforms remain sinusoidal, making the current control easier. For each fault type, the results of both simulations and experimental tests are included. A good match between analytical predictions and experimental tests validates the proposed current control strategies...|$|E

40|$|Time course {{studies on}} {{phosphate}} transfer in frog urinary bladder. Unidirectional 32 P-phosphate and 3 H-mannitol fluxes were simultaneously measured, at two minutes intervals, in frog urinary bladders. The spontaneous or externally imposed transepithelial potential (PD) and {{short circuit current}} (SCC) were also recorded in most experiments. It was observed that: (1) Phosphate transfer was rapidly and reversibly modified by changes in mucosal sodium concentration in open <b>circuit</b> <b>conditions.</b> (2) Between four and six minutes after changing mucosal NaCl concentration, phosphate fluxes reached a new steady-state value. (3) The observed correlation between the Na-dependent phosphate flux and the Na-dependent transmembrane potential was high (r = 0. 99, N = 12). (4) In open <b>circuit</b> <b>conditions,</b> the mucosa-to-serosa unidirectional phosphate fluxes were inhibited by 10 − 5 M amiloride, while the serosa-to-mucosa movements were increased. (5) On the contrary, no effects of mucosal NaCl concentration or amiloride on the mucosa-to-serosa phosphate fluxes were detected in short <b>circuit</b> <b>conditions.</b> (6) The transepithelial phosphate transfer was linearly related to phosphate concentration and insensitive to arsenate (10 − 3 M) action. (7) An externally imposed PD was less effective for driving a phosphate movement than the one depending on Na, suggesting some type of coupling between Na+ and phosphate transports. (8) The mucosa-to-serosa phosphate fluxes were reduced by parathyroid hormone and oxytocin. Maximum inhibition was observed four minutes after the hormonal action. It is concluded that the transepithelial PD {{plays a major role}} in phosphate handling in frog urinary bladder...|$|R
