50|$|<b>Dip</b> <b>coating</b> is an {{industrial}} coating process which is used, for example, to manufacture bulk {{products such as}} coated fabrics and condoms and specialized coatings for example in the biomedical field. <b>Dip</b> <b>coating</b> is also commonly used in academic research, where many chemical and nanomaterial engineering research projects use the <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> technique to create thin film coatings.|$|R
50|$|Many factors {{contribute}} to determining the final state of the <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> of a thin film. A large variety of repeatable <b>dip</b> <b>coated</b> film structures and thicknesses can be fabricated by controlling many factors: functionality of the initial substrate surface, submersion time, withdrawal speed, number of dipping cycles, solution composition, concentration and temperature, number of solutions in each dipping sequence, and environment humidity. The <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> technique can give uniform, high quality films even on bulky, complex shapes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dip</b> <b>coating</b> {{have been}} {{utilized}} {{for example in}} the fabrication of bioceramic nanoparticles, biosensors, implants and hybrid coatings.

30|$|On the contrary, Fig.  6 e, f {{describes}} how the TiNT catalyst has covered all the outer surface of pumice {{as the product of}} <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method. It has been reported that <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method can produce a thin and controllable layer on the support [36]. Unlike solvent evaporation method, <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method was conducted on relatively low temperature. In this condition, the molecules of aquadest would just slightly move in the system, making the interaction between TiNT and pumice occurred mostly on the outer surface of pumice. Therefore, most titania particles were immobilized on the external part of pumice. One benefit to be noticed is <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method could produce very homogen layer of catalyst on the surface of support, which would favor the mechanical strength of immobilized titania.|$|R

40|$|The toluene {{degradation}} in synthetic wastewater {{was performed}} by liquid-solid photocatalytic process using titanium dioxide (anatase phase) as the catalyst under UV irradiation and flowing oxygen gas. Two different systems of titania catalyst; suspension and <b>dipping</b> <b>coated</b> titanium dioxide catalysts containing 0. 1 - 1. 0 mM of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) surfactant, were carried out. The mixture was irradiated with UV lamp at 27 ± 1 ºC and toluene concentration was analyzed by HPLC. The toluene degradati on coefficients (C/C 0) of 250 mL, 100 mg.

L- 1 suspension titania catalyst containing 0. 6 mM surfactant was complete within 60 min, whereas the optimum of the toluene degradation coefficient for the <b>dipping</b> <b>coated</b> titania system containing 1. 0 mM surfactant was 0. 20 at 60 min. However, the maximum toluene degradation based on specific activity of the <b>dipping</b> <b>coated</b> titania with 1. 0 mM SDS was 1, 000 mg. g- 1 titania, {{higher than that of}} the suspended titania which was 200 mg. g- 1.

30|$|Simple {{methods for}} immobilizing titania into pumice were applied, where the {{products}} {{had been used}} {{for the application of}} photodegrading phenol waste. There were two simple methods, which were used separately: solvent evaporation and <b>dip</b> <b>coating.</b> Based on titania sol stability test, it was observed that acid condition would be favourable for immobilizing titania unto pumice, and preferable dispersion medium for solvent evaporation method was ethanol, while <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method was better to use aquadest (water). Prepared samples were characterized by FE-SEM, EDX, XRD, and BET analysis. Mechanical strength and photodegradation tests were conducted to observe the quality and ability of immobilized photocatalyst. Experimental results show that both methods had produced mechanically strong immobilized titania, where <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method tended to produce homogen solid film of titania on the outer surface of pumice, while solvent evaporation method could deliver titania deeper unto the inner part of the pumice. Catalyst detachment level of immobilized titania nanotube by <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method was 4.6 %, while the one of the products of solvent evaporation method was 5.0 %. Furthermore, in terms of photocatalytic activity, product of <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method gave slightly better performance (with 28 % of phenol elimination after 240  min) than the product of solvent evaporation method (24 %), due to shading effect, mostly occurring to immobilized catalyst in the inner part of the pumice.|$|R
30|$|It {{was also}} {{observed}} that <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method tends to produce uniform layer of titania {{on the outer}} surface of pumice, whereas solvent evaporation method was apparently capable to deliver titania deeper into internal part of pumice. In this case, shading effect might be encountered for the product of solvent evaporation method, making its photodegradation performance slightly lower than the one of <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method. The outcomes of this result suggest that both <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> and solvent evaporation method could be optimized to produce a promising technology {{for the elimination of}} organic pollutants, such as phenol. However, it still needs further improvement and study to find the optimal conditions for the photodegradation system to bring out products which can eliminate waste effectively and efficiently.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} theoretically the Landau-Levich problem of <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> {{in the presence}} of a strong interaction potential normal to the substrate. This study is motivated by <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> at very low capillary numbers when the deposited film thickness is less than 1 µm and such interaction forces become important. The objective of this work is to demonstrate that {{in the presence of}} an extra body force the solution procedure differs significantly from the classical one and leads to substantial deviations from the Landau-Levich law for the entrained film thickness. In particular, attractive potentials produce film thickening and the resulting film thickness is independent of speed to lowest order. Repulsive potentials bring about more complicated behavior and lead either to films whose thickness is also independent of speed, or to a modification of the leading order constant in the classical Ca^(2 / 3) law. Demonstration of these effects is given for a model potential. The analysis is generally applicable to many physical situations when there is an interaction between a coating liquid and a substrate, e. g., <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> of ferromagnetic liquids on magnetic substrates, or <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> of liquids carrying charges...|$|R

In addition, it was found that for certain immobilization method there is a suitable dispersion medium that should be chosen accordingly: ethanol for solvent evaporation method, while aquadest for <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method.

Layered {{structure}} with composition gradient between inner layer of alumina (Al 2 O 3) and outer layer of zirconia (ZrO 2 - 3 mol % Y 2 O 3;TZ- 3 Y) was fabricated using a gel casting {{process for the}} inner layer and a <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> process for the outer layer in an aqueous system. The interlayer with composition gradient was prepared by mixing the Al 2 O 3 and TZ- 3 Y slips as a volume ratio. Dried green bodies of the inner layer were pre-sintered at 1100 °C for 5 hr.
