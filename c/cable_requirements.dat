50|$|One of the {{significant}} problems in controlling dimmers is getting the control signal from a lighting control unit to the dimmer units. For many years this was achieved by providing a dedicated wire from the control unit to each dimmer (analogue control) where the voltage present on the wire was varied by the control unit to set the output level of the dimmer. In about 1976, {{to deal with the}} bulky <b>cable</b> <b>requirements</b> of analog control, Strand's R&D group in the UK developed an analogue multiplexing control system designated D54 (D54 is the internal standards number, which became the accepted name).

40|$|With {{plans for}} future {{offshore}} wind farms having larger power ratings and being situated much further offshore, {{there will be}} a growing trend towards the usage of High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission technology for submarine cables [1]. HVDC submarine cables provide lower investment cost for long-haul transmission, higher operating voltages and have no reactive power consumption, thus they have less losses than AC lines. DC transmission schemes may consist of a single polarity cable (monopole) carrying full circuit power with sea return, but there is a preference for having two cables of positive and negative polarity (bipole) each carrying half circuit power. The power output generated by these wind farms is not constant, fluctuating with wind speed [2]. They generate a lot of electricity when they are working at their maximum, {{but most of the time}} they generate at a much lower rate. The conventional rules for calculating cable ratings use thermal models based on steady state conditions with maximum load. This approach often leads to cables being oversized compared to real requirement. Incorrectly rated subsea cables can lead to poor asset utilisation. Therefore, new modelling techniques are essential to drive down the cost of connecting offshore renewable energy projects to the grid. Using predictive rating modelling to assess <b>cable</b> <b>requirements</b> more accurately, should result in a smaller and (therefore cheaper) cable; thus reducing the cost of connecting wind farms to the electricity grid. This research project uses Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to create a 2 D predictive model a pair of extruded XLPE HVDC submarine cables, laid side by side in a trench on the seabed. Historical wind farm output data will be used to compare the performance of cables using conventional assumptions with those using the predictive model. Adoption of such approaches by the industry could lead to substantial savings on wind farm export cable systems, improving the viability of offshore wind and delivering long term cost savings to the consumers. <br/...|$|E
40|$|D. Ing. The {{technique}} {{of using a}} live power cable to simultaneously transport a communication signal, has been practiced since the early 1900 ’s. In most cases, power-line communications has been implemented as a retrofit technology, with its main benefit being the utilization of a ‘free’ existing network. This driving force of power-line communications is typical for high-, medium-, and low-voltage distribution networks, as well as intra-building networks currently targeted for home automation and home networking. Researchers have thus focused on the optimum use of these existing power-line channels, often accepting the inherent drawbacks of this hostile communication channel. Apart from unpredictable noise sources, two main disadvantages of the low-voltage powerline network as a communication channel, are i) the unknown power cable characteristics and topology and ii) time-dependent fluctuation of the power-line impedance level as loads are unpredictable switched into, {{and out of the}} network. These two factors have obscured the requirements for proper coupling and impedance adaptation to the degree that most researchers and manufacturers have merely accepted this typical ≈ 20 -dB coupling loss as one of the inherited disadvantages of the power-line channel. Most researchers and manufacturers have thus defaulted to a guessed power-line impedance level, and have used one fixed coupler winding ratio under all circumstances, regardless of power-line conditions. This study has shown that proper coupling and impedance adaptation can yield significant transmission gains even with limited (qualitative) knowledge of a power-line channel and its topology. After formulating design steps for an impedance-adapting coupler that facilitates bidirectional transmission, the impact of the fluctuating power-line impedance on coupler bandwidth was investigated. Next, impedance adaptation strategies were considered and the tradeoff between series <b>cable</b> <b>requirements</b> and parallel load requirements was explored. A model of sufficient simplicity was developed to facilitate qualitative description and classification of power outlets – functioning as communication nodes. Very interesting simulation results were obtained and these were verified using a laboratory setup of characterized power cables and calibrated loads. Next, these simulation results were employed to improve power-line transmission over a live, uncharacterized 220 -V residential network by means of i) classifying typical residential rooms qualitatively in order to choose proper coupler winding ratios and ii) using an innovative dual coupler for dedicated on-off switching with harsh loads, thereby mitigating the fluctuating impact of said loads on low-voltage power-line communications...|$|E

An enormous amount of growth in the computational demands of data center applications has stimulated the creation of warehouse scale data centers, holding servers that number in the thousands. As the number of servers within a data center grows, the interconnecting infrastructure becomes of paramount importance. Present day interconnects are formed using either copper wire in a twisted pair configuration or through the use of fiber optic cables. One of the main concerns with the scalability of a data center 2 ̆ 7 s interconnecting network is the power consumption. Large power hungry switches at the aggregation and core levels make up a significant portion of a data centers power portfolio and cannot be overlooked. Furthermore, large bundles of wires both reduce the air flow within data centers and are costly to replace and maintain. This cabling complexity problem limits cooling effectiveness and exacerbates the power consumption challenges. Recent advancements in the unlicensed 60 GHz spectrum have given rise to transceivers that can support high bandwidth links, comparable to wired links found in most data centers.
