5|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is a set}} of guidelines which are used to ensure that the animals produced by a breeder or breeding facility <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> the specifics of the standardized breed. All registered Highland cattle must <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> it. The {{breed standard}} was created in Inverness on 10 June 1885. There are four main parts to the standard: the head, the neck, the back and body, and the hair. Below is a concise list of the main points of the breed standard. A judge in a show will judge the cattle against a provided breed standard.|$|E
