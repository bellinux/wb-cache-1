40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{neuronal}} {{growth cone}} is a dynamic, "shape changing" structure which guides the developing neurite {{to a distant}} target (Figure 1). The growth cone membrane is constantly creating filopodia, long, thin structures which grow and shrink into the extra [...] cellular space. The exact causes of filopodial excursions are unknown. However, experimental work by Davenport (1992) linked filopodial outgrowth to the local concentration of calcium, which Hentschel (1994) proposed as a morphogen regulating neuronal dendrite growth. We suggest that calcium acts as a morphogen to directly regulate the pattern of filopodial outgrowth and subsequent retraction. Turing (1952) developed a mathematical basis for "morphogenesis", the process underlying {{the development of the}} shape of an organism. This provides an appropriate framework for modelling the neuronal growth <b>cone.</b> <b>Shaft</b> Cell Body Growth Cone Filopodia Rearward F-Actin Flow Lamellipodia Mi...|$|E
40|$|Head {{shape and}} stylet {{morphology}} of males of 90 populations of M. arenaria, M. hapla, M. incognita, and M. javanica from geographic {{regions of the}} world were compared by light microscopy (LM). In addition, stylets of one population each of M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. javanica and three different chromosomal forms of M. hapla race A and two of race B were excised and examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Differences among species occurred in both head and stylet morphology. Head morphology differed in size and shape of the head cap, annulation of the head region, and width of the head region relative to the first body annule. Differences in stylets occurred in size and shape of the <b>cone,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and knobs. All populations of M. hapla, except one, had similar head morphology, but stylet morphology was different between cytological races A and B. Populations of M. javanica varied with respect to the presence of head annulations. Head shape and stylet morphology of males are recommended as additional characters useful in the identification of root-knot nematodes...|$|E

40|$|The serine/threonine kinase p 21 -activated kinase (PAK) {{has been}} implicated as a {{downstream}} effector {{of the small}} GTPases Rac and Cdc 42. While these GTPases evidently induce a variety of morphological changes, the role(s) of PAK remains elusive. Here we report that overexpression of betaPAK in PC 12 cells induces a Rac phenotype, including cell spreading/membrane ruffling, and increased lamellipodia formation at growth <b>cones</b> and <b>shafts</b> of nerve growth factor-induced neurites. These effects are still observed in cells expressing kinase-negative or Rac/Cdc 42 binding-deficient PAK mutants, indicating that kinase- and p 21 -binding domains are not involved. Furthermore, lamellipodia formation in all cell lines, including those expressing Rac binding-deficient PAK, is inhibited significantly by dominant-negative RacN 17. Equal inhibition is achieved by blocking PAK interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor PIX using a specific N-terminal PAK fragment. We conclude that PAK, via its N-terminal non-catalytic domain, acts upstream of Rac mediating lamellipodia formation through interaction with PIX...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and life stages of Meloidogyne cruciani on tomato was studied at 28 C. Roots of 2 -wk-old 'Rutgers' tomato seedlings {{were exposed to}} inoculum for 24 h, rinsed, and the seedlings repotted. No major changes in juvenile development were observed prior to 8 days after inoculation. At 11 days the second-stage juvenile had enlarged considerably. The genital primordium had not yet asumed the V-shape characteristic of developing females, but the presence of rectal glands identified the juveniles as females. At this time (11 days), two additional, previously undescribed esophageal lobes were first observed; they were adjacent to the dorsal and subventral glands. After molting from second to third stage, the stylet <b>cone,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and the lumen of the stylet knobs are shed and remain attached to the second-stage cuticle. The excretory duct of the third-stage juveniles was directed anteriorly from the excretory pore of the second-stage cuticle and appear attached to the body wall of the third-stage juveniles opposite the procorpus. At 19 days after inoculation, the last molt took place. The adult female possessed a new stylet, a large five-gland esophagus, a prominent excretory system ending in a unicellular gland and a fully developed reproductive system...|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} morphology {{of female}} heads of three populations {{of each of}} two cytological races of Meloidogyne hapla (race A-meiotic, race B-mitotic) and single populations of M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. javanica was compared by light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Perineal patterns of all nine populations were observed with a LM and then examined with a SEM. In addition, female stylets of each population were excised, viewed with a SEM, and compared with observations made with a LM. Head morphology of the females, including shape of medial and lateral lips, expression of sensilla, and head annulation, was distinct for each species, each race of M. hapla, and each population of M. hapla race A. The morphology of a given perineal pattern appeared similar with the SEM and the LM. The SEM emphasized surface details, whereas the LM revealed subcuticular structure as well. Stylet morphology was unique for each species but similar in all populations of M. hapla. There were differences between species {{in the shape of}} the <b>cone,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and knobs and in the distance of the dorsal esophageal gland orifice from the stylet knob base. Several of the morphological characters first detected in the SEM were seen subsequently with the LM and are helpful in species identification...|$|E
40|$|The stomatostylet of Criconemoides {{curvature}} {{consists of}} three parts: tooth <b>cone,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and knobs. The tooth cone constitutes the outer conical covering and inner lining of the anterior half of the stylet lumen. The tooth cone is easily separated from the shaft by treating an isolated styler with 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite. The posterior half of the shaft is cylindrical, tapering anteriorly to form the shaft extension, wedged between {{the inner and outer}} tooth cone. The shaft extension extends to the stylet lumen orifice, which is subterminal and ventral. Six ducts enter the shaft through the junction between the shaft and knobs. They extend anteriad toward the tip of the shaft extension. Cytoplasmic connections between the ducts and the cells surrounding the stylet occur near tile junction between the shaft and the basal knobs. Ribosome and membranous structures are observed in these ducts. The esophagus of the adult female consists of a fused procorpus and metacorpus with a large valve possessing thickened cuticular walls at the anterior and posterior ends. The dorsal esophageal gland reservoir is composed of many honeycomb-like compartments made up of two types of differing electron density. The subventral esophageal glands, however, consist of only one type of granules. Both dorsal and subventral esophageal glands open into the esophageal lumen through trachea-like branched multiple canals...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} and alterations of infective juvenile (J 2) body components {{with emphasis}} on the body wall, stomatal wall, stylet, and sensilla of Heterodera glycines were observed. During the molt of J 2 to J 3, the J 2 hypodermis separates from the J 2 cuticle and forms an extracellular space, continuous with an invagination of the anterior, center of the J 3. The space between the J 2 cuticle and the enlarged J 3 hypodermal cells is filled with electron-dense material resembling a fluid observed in insects during molt. Regeneration of the J 2 during molt was traced {{in a series of}} ultrathin sections. The site of stylet regeneration is in the hypodermal and myoepithelial tissues of the invaginated anterior, center of the J 3. Four arcade-like cells are related to specific components of the stomatal wall, the stylet cone, and the stylet shaft of the J 3. The first and second arcade-like cells are primarily related to stomatal wall development, whereas the third and fourth arcade-like cells are related to stylet <b>cone</b> and <b>shaft</b> development. Spherical, electron-translucent vacuoles that occur in myoepithelial cells just posterior to the arcade-like cells appear to be progenitors of the stylet knobs. Early stages of protractor muscle attachment to the vacuolar membrane were observed...|$|R
40|$|A root-knot {{nematode}} parasitising yakon (Polymia sonchifolia) in SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil, {{is identified}} as Meloidogyne inornata. The species is redescribed from this material and compared with the original description of M. inornata. The female perineal patterns have a distinct, high, dorsal arch composed of smooth to wavy striae, similar to Meloidogyne incognita. The female stylet is 15. 0 - 17. 0 Â¿m long with the cone generally slightly curved dorsally and with well developed knobs. DGO is 3. 5 - 4. 5 Â¿m. Males have a high, rounded, head cap that is continuous with the body contour and has a large, round, centrally concave, labial disc raised above the medial lips. The head region is never marked by incomplete annulations and the stylet is robust, 20. 0 - 25. 0 Â¿m long, with a straight <b>cone,</b> cylindrical <b>shaft</b> with several small projections and pear-shaped, backwardly sloping knobs. The stylet length of second-stage juveniles is 10. 0 - 13. 0 Â¿m, DGO is 2. 5 - 3. 5 Â¿m, tail length is 35. 0 - 58. 0 Â¿m and c = 6. 7 - 13. 9. Biochemically, the esterase phenotype I 3 (= Y 3) is species-specific and is the most useful character for differentiating M. inornata from other Meloidogyne species. Reproduction is by mitotic parthenogenesis, 3 n = 54 - 58. In a soybean test, cv. Abura was susceptible and cv. LA 411219 was highly resistant.

5000|$|Females are swollen, pear-shaped pearly {{white and}} sedentary. They deposit their {{eggs in a}} {{gelatinous}} mass, which usually protrudes from galled root tissue. Females of this nematode are completely endoparasitic. [...] Mature females of M. arenaria are identified by the cuticular markings in the perineal area, stylet length, punctations on the cuticle. [...] When describing the morphology of M. arenaria race1, Eisenback et al., (1981) reported that in females, the dorsal arch is flattened and rounded. The striae in the arch are slightly indented at the lateral lines and generally form a shoulder on the arch. The stylet is very robust and the <b>cone</b> and <b>shaft</b> are broad. The labial disc and lips are dumb bell shaped and it has large lateral lips that are separated from the medial lips and the head region. [...] In a study in Argentina, perineal patterns of 100 females from a population of M. arenaria, race 2 growing on tomato plants were analyzed and moderate morphological variations observed. The overall shape was rounded in most cases, but it was oval-shaped in a small proportion (4%). Forty-six percent of females showed low dorsal arch while 38% depicted a high dorsal arc, while the rest were intermediate. Lines in the post-anal region were smooth or wavy, continuous or broken, occasionally forming shoulders (18% of females). Wings were generally not observed. Phasmids were visible in 25% of the patterns and the mean distance between them was 24.33 Â± 1.61 mm. Only seven out of one hundred females presented perineal patterns with lateral lines weakly demarcated by forked striae. Adult females were pyriform and lacking a terminal protuberance in the posterior area of the body. The female body lengths ranged between 465 mm and 1,129 mm. The excretory pore of the females was located closer {{to the base of}} the stylet than to the median bulb, at approximately 2-stylet lengths, in agreement with a typical M. arenaria specimen. The stylet was dorsally curved.|$|R
40|$|Formation of the {{mammalian}} brain {{requires the}} coordination of numerous events during embryonic development, the complexity of which {{is illustrated by the}} large number of defects that have been identified in humans. Analysis of both human genetic disorders and reverse genetically engineered mice have been invaluable in the endeavor to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying proper cortical development. Likewise, forward genetic screens have the potential of generating novel mouse models for human disorders, which can contribute by identifying novel genes and provide resources to investigate the molecular mechanisms of disease phenotypes. This study demonstrates that a genetic screen of ENU mutagenized mice identified a mouse pedigree that exhibits recessive primary microcephaly. Genetic mapping has identified a novel microcephaly locus for this mutation on chromosome 5 qB 1. Alternatively, doublecortin was identified as the gene disrupted in the human female disorder double cortex and the male disorder X-linked lissencephaly. This study identified spinophilin as a novel binding partner for doublecortin and used single and double knockouts of spinophilin and doublecortin to investigate the role of this interaction in cortical neurons. This approach allowed us to propose a novel model for microtubule condensation at the transition zone between the growth <b>cone</b> and neurite <b>shaft,</b> in this way helping to further our understanding of the role doublecortin plays in neuronal migration and axon outgrowt...|$|R
40|$|To {{ascertain}} the possible roles of Schwann cells in nerve regeneration, morphological changes of these cells at the proximal stump of the transected mouse sciatic nerve was examined. One or 2 days after transection, an extensive degradation of myelin sheath occurred near the cut {{end of the}} proximal stump. Schwann cells in this region contained variously-sized myelin balls in the cytoplasm. Three to five days after transection, Schwann cells in the proximal stump exhibited several sections of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and welldeveloped Golgi complexes in an abundant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures were often observed in these cells. In the mini-neuromas formed at the distal tip of the proximal stump, Schwann cells extended thin cytoplasmic processes along the regenerating growth <b>cones</b> and axonal <b>shafts.</b> Seven or ten days after transection, each Scwann cell encircled 1 or 2 thick axons with their thin cytoplasmic processes, and remyelination occurred in these axons. However, thin axons remained free from these processes, and some exhibited degenerative changes. After 14 and 21 days, regenerating axons gradually decreased in number, and each thick axon was encircled by its own myelin sheath of several layers. These findings suggest that Schwann cells at the proximal stump might be involved in several important events for nerve regeneration such as demyelination, trophic support, control of the extension and maturation of regenerating axons...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the stylet, "guiding apparatus," anti protractor muscles of males of Meloidogyne incognita and Heterodera glycines is ehtcittated and compared. In both nematodes, the stylet cone is of greater electron density than the <b>shaft.</b> The <b>cone</b> is heterogeneous; <b>shaft</b> material extends into it {{for most of its}} length, whereas the shaft proper and knob regions are relatively homogeneous. The stylet lumnen is round throughout its length in H. glycines, but in M. incognita changes from round, posteriorly, to irregular, triradiate, and oblong near the styler tip. The various layers of the lining of the stylet shaft are continuous with those of the cuticular lining of the esophageal lumen. Similarly, cuticular layers of the stomatal lining and vestibule extension are continuous with the body wall cuticle. The stylet "guiding apparatus" is formed by linings of the stomatal opening, vestibule, and vestibule extension, together with transversely folded membranes, which extend further posteriorly and attach near the junction of <b>shaft</b> and <b>cone.</b> Noncontractile regions of the three stylet protractor muscles originate in the esophagus. Contractile portions extend anteriorly from the stylet knobs and branch into a total of 10 elements that attach near the basal ring of the cephalic framework and the vestibule extension.

40|$|Interpretation of CPTU {{testing in}} silt is non-trivial {{because of the}} {{partially}} drained conditions {{that are likely to}} occur during penetration. A better understanding of the pore pressure generation/dissipation is needed in order to obtain reliable design parameters. Following a previous study using X-ray computed tomography (micro-CT) with volumetric digital image correlation (3 D-DIC) that clearly showed the formation of distinct dilation and compression areas around the cone; the present work takes a closer look at those areas in order to link volumetric behavior to changes in soil fabric. High-resolution 2 D backscattered electron images of polished thin sections prepared from frozen samples at the end of penetration are used. The images have a spatial resolution of 0. 4 Âµm/pixel that allow a clear identification of grains and pore spaces. Image processing techniques are developed to quantify local porosity and obtain the statistical distribution of the particle orientation for the zones around the <b>cone</b> tip and <b>shaft.</b> It is shown that the formation of compaction regions is related to the ability of the grains to rearrange and align along a well-defined preferred orientation forming a more closed-fabric characterized by high anisotropy values, while zones of dilation are associated with a more open packing with grains randomly oriented and with large voids within. These observations suggested that for a saturated soil, water will move from a compressive zone to a neighboring dilative zone, creating a short drainage path. By shedding light on the link between soil fabric and drainage patterns, this study contributes toward {{a better understanding of the}} measured macro-response during CPTU tests on silt...|$|R
40|$|Rubbish {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems nowadays. This problem related to the huge number of rubbish. Many ways have been conducted to solve this problem. One way of processing rubbish is by machine. Producing machine for rubbish commonly is crushing machine or pressing machine. The purpose of this thesis is to design pressing machine for organic rubbish by capacity 250 kg/hours. This design is based on the integrated concept of cutting system from pressing result. Crushing system is designed by using knives arrangement that is rotated in its axes. The pressing process is designed by using shaft wheel mechanism and pressing plate that is equipped by spring. While, cutting system by using 2 blades is positioned rotating in axes end. The design is initiated by calculation of machine capacity and is continued by calculation of driving force of electrical motor. Then, there is needed calculation of design machines components needed; they are knives, axes, pulley and belt, <b>cone</b> gearwheel, axis, <b>shaft</b> and crank mechanism. Besides, there is also needed supporting system planning contains knives seizer, crushing cylinder wall, frame and machine cover and pelat mechanism and spring. The result of design is machine that consists of 3 systems; they are crushing system, pressing system and cutting system. This machine needs driving force of electric motor by 2, 5 HP (1, 84 kW). Crushing system by using 7 movements of cutting knife in the axis by speed of rotation 300 rpm. Pressing system is using mechanism of shaft wheel boost pressing piston. Shaft movement has speed rotation of 60 rpm, it means there is 60 times rotation in a minute. Cutting system by using 2 blades is moved by axis in 30 rpm. By this speed, then in every minute there is 60 times of cutting process to compensate pressing movement...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue damage {{calculations}} {{are conducted}} as state-of-art design process for wind turbines. Fatigue analysis is performed on spar caps and trailing edge tape (UD material) considering uni-axial stress state. The main {{objective of the}} research project is to analyze the effect of various parameters like yaw errors, wind turbine design load cases and blade mass imbalances on fatigue damage of blade. Also, an overall structural study of the blade has been performed based on the guidelines of International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) 61400 - 1 Ed. 3 to understand the structural robustness of blade in terms of stiffness and strength. Loads based on an onshore site have been generated using aero-(servo) -elastic code, Fatigue Aerodynamics Structural and Turbulence (FAST). Based on these loads and predominantly linear Finite Element Model (FEM) calculations on a blade model in ANSYS (except for flapwise loading on spar caps), stress time series are calculated. Finally, using these stress time series, the fatigue damage at different blade sections are calculated in âOctaveâ environment using rain-flow cycle counting method and Minerâs rule. Results show that blade is stiff enough from blade-tower interference and resonance per- spective, but buckling is observed in the trailing edge close to the tip, with flapwise buckling mode coming out as the most critical one. Fatigue is not a structural issue based on state-of- art calculations and design load cases, even in the critical transition region (from circular to DU airfoil along the span of the blade). It was found that positive yaw errors are more detri- mental to fatigue life than negative ones for an anti-clockwise rotating turbine. Trailing edge tape is more affected by blade mass imbalance while spar caps are sensitive to changes in yaw errors in terms of fatigue life. Power production design load case is completely dominating fatigue life when compared to start up and shutdown load cases. All the results that have been presented here {{are based on a}} particular wind site conditions, a specific blade and a wind turbine model. The idea has been to give a qualitative and relative overview of different trends in the structural analysis, rather than coming to a conclusion in an absolute sense. Due to the presence of considerable <b>cone</b> angle, <b>shaft</b> tilt and rotor overhang, blade-tower interference is not an issue for the analyzed blade design. It should be, however, considered to increase the trailing edge tape length towards the tip region to prevent buckling issues. Also, extra core materials could be provided (thus increasing bending stiffness and thickness) to prevent buckling problems. Operation of turbine under other significant loading conditions like icing and heavy leading edge erosion should be incorporated to study fatigue in more detail. Fatigue life should be evaluated and validated with models other than Minerâs sum (for example, residual strength degradation model) along with full blade test (for an existent blade) for precise results. An aero-elastic stability analysis of full wind turbine model should be performed to understand the dynamics of whole system on blades. Finally, fatigue damage in bond lines between different components of blade is also a critical consideration for future work.
