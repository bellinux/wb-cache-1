25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was Matthew Murray's rack locomotive Salamanca {{built for the}} Middleton Railway in Leeds in 1812. This twin-cylinder locomotive was not heavy enough to break the edge-rails track and solved the problem of adhesion by a <b>cog-wheel</b> using teeth cast {{on the side of}} one of the rails. Thus it was also the first rack railway.|$|E
25|$|Special {{vehicles}} in Budapest, besides metros, include suburban rails, trams and boats. There {{are a couple}} of less common {{vehicles in}} Budapest, like the trolleybus on several lines in Pest, the Castle Hill Funicular between the Chain Bridge and Buda Castle, the cyclecar for rent in Margaret Island, the chairlift, the Budapest <b>Cog-wheel</b> Railway and children's railway. The latter three vehicles run among Buda hills.|$|E
25|$|A Wilkinson engine weighed about eleven tons, carried 160 {{gallons of}} water and had a bunker capable of {{carrying}} nine cubic feet of coke. It was a vertical engine with a vertical boiler. The cylinders were of small bore and acted upon a crankshaft through which motion was communicated to the four coupled wheels by <b>cog-wheel</b> gears. Exhaust steam was not condensed but was superheated in a patent contrivance in the firebox whence it escaped to the atmosphere through the chimney.|$|E
50|$|Earlier he {{designed}} and prepared {{a whole series}} of di-(9-triptycyl)X (X=CH2, NH, O, SiH2, S) as molecular <b>cog-wheels</b> and demonstrated that they undergo almost free correlated internal rotation (disrotation) by various physical and chemical measurements. Since the rapid internal rotation of the <b>cog-wheels</b> does not get off the track, the di-9-triptycyl compounds carrying different benzene ring(s) gave isolable stereoisomers due to the phase of the label in spite of the rapid internal rotation (1980).|$|R

500|$|The {{cumbersome}} chain-drive gearing {{was replaced}} with a simpler and by now proven <b>cog-wheel</b> arrangement, although the gearing of the engines to the propeller shaft remained {{at a ratio of}} one to three. The three large boilers were replaced with six smaller ones, operating at [...] or twice the pressure of their predecessors. Along with a new [...] cabin on the main deck, the smaller boilers allowed the cargo capacity to be almost doubled, from 1,200 to 2,200tons.|$|E
2500|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was the twin cylinder Salamanca, built in 1812 by John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray for the [...] gauge Middleton Railway. Blenkinsop {{believed that a}} locomotive light enough to move under its own power would be too light to generate sufficient adhesion, so he designed a rack and pinion system for the line. This was {{despite the fact that}} Trevithick had demonstrated successful adhesion locomotives a decade before. The single rack ran outside the narrow gauge edge-rail tracks and was engaged by a <b>cog-wheel</b> {{on the left side of}} the locomotive. The <b>cog-wheel</b> was driven by two cylinders embedded into the top of the center-flue boiler. Four such locomotives were built for the railway, and they worked until the early 1830s.|$|E
6000|$|Tiktok {{promptly}} {{walked in}} and faced the astonished Nome King, to whom he said: [...] "Good morn-ing. I want two new steel springs for my thought-works and a new <b>cog-wheel</b> for my speech-pro-du-cer. How a-bout it, your Maj-es-ty?" ...|$|E

60|$|Nobody {{heard the}} click and rattle of the <b>cog-wheels</b> as the third-floor {{front of the}} Frogmore flats buzzed its {{machinery}} back into the Order of Things. A band slipped, a spring was touched, the gear was adjusted and the wheels revolve in their old orbit.|$|R
5000|$|About {{the time}} of his arrival the first English flourmill in Canterbury was erected in Akaroa's Grehan Valley. [...] Charles Haylock, who had also come out on The Monarch with his wife and his four sons, cut the timber for the {{building}} and machinery, and formed a water race and an 18-feet overshot wheel. The <b>cog-wheels,</b> which were made of wood, being incorrectly geared, were crushed at the first trial. Farr, having studied the theory of <b>cog-wheels,</b> volunteered his assistance, and re-constructed the wheels, with the result that within three weeks the mill was smoothly working. Farr next made a miniature working model of a saw mill, and subsequently, in partnership with the family of his wife, erected sawmills at Robinsons Bay, Barrys Bay, the Head of the Bay, and Duvauchelle.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right; {{now work}} away for your lives, lads." [...] This {{was said to}} two men who had already seized {{spanners}} and were unscrewing the bolts of the bearings in order to enable the upper shafting to be lifted and the <b>cog-wheel</b> removed. Then Mr. Penrose returned to his friends.|$|E
6000|$|The wild, {{imperious}} {{song of the}} bell-metal <b>cog-wheel</b> had sung into Milton's ears till it {{had become}} a torture, and every time he lifted his eyes to the beautiful far-off sky, where the clouds floated like ships, a lump of rebellious anger rose in his throat. Why should he work in this choking dust and deafening noise while the hawks could sail and sweep from hill to hill with nothing to do but play? ...|$|E
60|$|In the afternoon, {{we had our}} grand {{rally at}} the Queen's Stair-way. Corny couldn't come, because her mother said she must not be running around so much. So she staid at home and worked on the new flag for the coronation. We {{designed}} this flag among us. It had a black ground, with a yellow sun just {{rising out of the}} middle of it. It didn't cost much, and looked more like a yellow <b>cog-wheel</b> rolling in deep mud than anything else. But we thought it would do very well.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{analysis}} of the processes based on the value analysis allows to evaluate of applied technologiesof production. In the paper there is presented the value analysis for chosen processes of <b>cog-wheels</b> productionas well as correlation of {{the functions of the}} product with the costs of operations creating them. An evaluationof applied technologies of production was done. Design/methodology/approach: Application of the method of value analysis with reference to productivechains including results of cost analysis. Findings: The study presents results of performed value analysis for chosen processes in particular withreference to costs of realized processes of <b>cog-wheels.</b> The analysis was done in the productive processes of thesame product in two different technologies. Research limitations/implications: Evaluation of costs of operations of the productive processes. Practical implications: Presented in the paper approach and application of the method of value analysisessentially influences evaluation and increasing of efficiency of realized productive processes. Originality/value: Presented method is based on the methodology by L. D. Miles, L. W. Crum...|$|R
60|$|A {{flight of}} marble stairs led {{from one of}} Coo-ee-oh's private rooms down to the basement, but when the party arrived all were puzzled by what they saw. In {{the center of a}} broad, low room, stood a mass of great <b>cog-wheels,</b> chains and pulleys, all {{interlocked}} and seeming to form a huge machine; but there was no engine or other motive power to make the wheels turn.|$|R

60|$|At first {{his legs}} bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and {{rush of the}} sunlit air dazzled him. He squatted by the white wall, the mind rummaging among the {{incidents}} of the long dooli journey, the lama's weaknesses, and, now that the stimulus of talk was removed, his own self-pity, of which, like the sick, he had great store. The unnerved brain edged away from all the outside, as a raw horse, once rowelled, sidles from the spur. It was enough, amply enough, that the spoil of the kilta was away--off his hands--out of his possession. He {{tried to think of}} the lama--to wonder why he had tumbled into a brook--but the bigness of the world, seen between the forecourt gates, swept linked thought aside. Then he looked upon the trees and the broad fields, with the thatched huts hidden among crops--looked with strange eyes unable to take up the size and proportion and use of things--stared for a still half-hour. All that while he felt, though he could not put it into words, that his soul was out of gear with its surroundings--a <b>cog-wheel</b> unconnected with any machinery, just like the idle <b>cog-wheel</b> of a cheap Beheea sugar-crusher laid by in a corner. The breezes fanned over him, the parrots shrieked at him, the noises of the populated house behind--squabbles, orders, and reproofs--hit on dead ears.|$|E
60|$|At {{this instant}} Rectus {{ran up the}} black flag with the yellow <b>cog-wheel,</b> and we white people gave a cheer. As soon as they got a cue, the darkeys knew what to do. They burst out into a wild yell, they waved their hats, they laid down {{on the grass and}} kicked, they jumped, and danced, and laughed, and screamed. I was afraid the queen would bolt, so I took a quiet hold of her shawl. But she stood still until the crowd cooled down a little, and then she made a {{courtesy}} and sat down.|$|E
60|$|Take {{first the}} more obvious case of materialism. As an {{explanation}} of the world, materialism has a sort of insane simplicity. It has just the quality of the madman's argument; we have at once the sense of it covering everything and the sense of it leaving everything out. Contemplate some able and sincere materialist, as, for instance, Mr. McCabe, and you will have exactly this unique sensation. He understands everything, and everything does not seem worth understanding. His cosmos may be complete in every rivet and <b>cog-wheel,</b> but still his cosmos is smaller than our world. Somehow his scheme, like the lucid scheme of the madman, seems unconscious of the alien energies and the large indifference of the earth; it is not thinking of the real things of the earth, of fighting peoples or proud mothers, or first love or fear upon the sea. The earth is so very large, and the cosmos is so very small. The cosmos is about the smallest hole that a man can hide his head in.|$|E
60|$|His hands got stiffer year by year, and his simple tunes became {{practically}} {{a series of}} squeaks and squalls. There came {{a time when the}} fiddle was laid away almost altogether, for his left hand got caught in the <b>cog-wheels</b> of the horse-power, and all four of the fingers on that hand were crushed. Thereafter he could only twang a little on the strings. It was not long after this that he struck his foot with the ax and lamed himself for life.|$|R
6000|$|In {{those days}} {{the machine was}} either a [...] "J. I. Case" [...] or a [...] "Buffalo Pitts," [...] and was moved by five pairs of horses {{attached}} to a [...] "power" [...] staked to the ground, round which they travelled pulling {{at the ends of}} long levers or sweeps, and to me the force seemed tremendous. [...] "Tumbling rods" [...] with [...] "knuckle joints" [...] carried the motion to the cylinder, and the driver who stood upon a square platform above the huge, greasy <b>cog-wheels</b> (round which the horses moved) was a grand figure in my eyes.|$|R
60|$|But how is a {{man with}} a capital of fifty pounds going to be philosophic when he is {{fighting}} an opponent whose assets, as a certain hoarding near Clapham Junction told him every morning, exceeded three millions of pounds. He treated it lightly to Maude, and she to him, but each suffered horribly, and each was well aware of the other's real feelings. Sometimes there was a lull, and they could almost believe that the whole thing was over. And then the old machine gave a creak, and the rusty <b>cog-wheels</b> took one more turn, and they both felt the horrid thing which held them.|$|R
60|$|It {{was more}} than twenty years since he had last seen Orde, his schoolmate, and their paths in the world had divided early. The one had quitted college to become a <b>cog-wheel</b> in the {{machinery}} of the great Indian Government; the other more blessed with goods, had been whirled into a similar position in the English scheme. Three successive elections had not affected Pagett's position with a loyal constituency, and he had grown insensibly to regard himself in some sort as a pillar of the Empire, whose real worth would be known later on. After a few years of conscientious attendance at many divisions, after newspaper battles innumerable and the publication of interminable correspondence, and more hasty oratory than in his calmer moments he cared to think upon, it occurred to him, as it had occurred to many of his fellows in Parliament, that a tour to India would enable him to sweep a larger lyre and address himself to the problems of Imperial administration with a firmer hand. Accepting, therefore, a general invitation extended to him by Orde some years before, Pagett bad taken ship to Karachi, and only overnight had been received with joy by the Deputy-Commissioner of Amara. They had sat late, discussing the changes and chances of twenty years, recalling the names of the dead, and weighing the futures of the living, as is the custom of men meeting after intervals of action.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, my good woman," [...] {{said the}} elderly gentleman, [...] "you are to {{understand}} that he came by some damage while doing so, but I give you the exact words of the pamphlet. It were desirable that a little more information had been given just to gratify our curiosity. Now, these that I have read are under the head of `Accidents at Home.' Under other `Heads,' we find a farmer suffocated by the falling in of a sand-pit, for which his representatives received 1000 pounds. Another thousand is paid to the heirs of a poor dyer who fell into a vat of boiling liquor; while, in regard to smaller matters, a warehouseman, whose finger caught in the <b>cog-wheel</b> of a crane, received 30 pounds. And, again, here is 1000 pounds to a gentleman killed in a railway accident, and 100 pounds to a poor woman. The latter had insured for a single trip in an excursion train at a charge of two-pence, while the former had a policy of insurance extending over a considerable period, for which he probably paid twenty or thirty shillings. These are but samples, madam, of the good service rendered to sorrowing humanity by this assurance company, which, you must observe, makes no pretensions to philanthropic aims, but is based simply on business principles. And I find that {{the total amount of}} compensation paid in this manner daring one year by this Company amounts to about 72,000 pounds." ...|$|E

500|$|The wagtail is very [...] "chatty" [...] and has {{a number}} of {{distinct}} vocalisations. Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid chit-chit-chit-chit, although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire. The alarm call is sounded to warn off potential rivals and threats from its territory and also seems to serve as a signal to its mate when a potential threat is in the area. John Gould reported that it sounded like a child's rattle or [...] "small <b>cog-wheels</b> of a steam mill". In his book What Bird is That?
