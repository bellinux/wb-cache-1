5|$|Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an indie puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Polytron Corporation {{and published by}} Trapdoor. The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world {{to be one of}} four sides of a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect <b>cubes</b> <b>and</b> cube fragments to restore order to the universe.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick. The player {{controls}} Q*bert, who starts each game {{at the top of}} a pyramid made of 28 <b>cubes,</b> <b>and</b> moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Mack 10 {{left the}} group {{due to a}} {{conflict}} with Ice <b>Cube</b> <b>and</b> the group subsequently disbanded. However, Ice <b>Cube</b> <b>and</b> WC continued to collaborate, having since appeared on each other's respective albums.|$|R
50|$|Note: The tetrahedron, <b>cube,</b> <b>and</b> {{octahedron}} {{are listed}} here with dihedral symmetry (as a digonal antiprism, square prism and triangular antiprism respectively), although if uniformly colored, the tetrahedron also has tetrahedral symmetry <b>and</b> the <b>cube</b> <b>and</b> octahedron also have octahedral symmetry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{show was}} {{produced}} and created by Ice <b>Cube</b> <b>and</b> R. J. Cutler. The series' theme song was [...] "Race Card", performed by Ice <b>Cube</b> <b>and</b> produced by Warren G. The series ran {{for five weeks}} ending with a double episode finale.|$|R
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of <b>cubes</b> <b>and</b> bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous <b>cubes</b> <b>and</b> put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E
5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect <b>cubes</b> <b>and</b> cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E

25|$|Meat plays a {{much more}} {{dominant}} role in Pakistani and Afghan cuisine, compared to other South Asian cuisines.

In these graphs, the {{vertices}} may {{be labeled}} by bitvectors, {{in such a}} way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding bitvectors differ in a single position. A bipartition may be formed by separating the vertices whose bitvectors have an even number of ones from the vertices with an odd number of ones. Trees and squaregraphs form examples of median graphs, and every median graph is a partial cube.|$|E
