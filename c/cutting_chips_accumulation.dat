40|$|In {{the field}} of ultra-precision machining, {{the study of the}} {{relation}} between chip morphology and tool wear is significant, since tool wear characteristics can be reflected by morphologies of <b>cutting</b> <b>chips.</b> In this research, the relation between chip morphology and tool flank wear is first investigated in UPRM. A cutting experiment was performed to explore chip morphologies under different widths of flank wear land. A geometric model was developed to identify the width of flank wear land based on chip morphology. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the occurrence of tool flank wear can make the <b>cutting</b> <b>chips</b> truncated at both their cut-in and cut-out sides, and reduce the length of <b>cutting</b> <b>chips</b> in the feed direction. The width of truncation positions of the <b>cutting</b> <b>chip</b> can be measured and used to calculate the width of flank wear land {{with the help of the}} mathematical model. The present research is potentially used to detect tool wear and evaluate machined surface quality in intermittent cutting process. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of tool wear can affect <b>cutting</b> forces, <b>cutting</b> <b>chip</b> morphologies, and machined surface quality in ultra-precision fly cutting (UPFC), {{there has been no}} research in this area due to the complex cutting mechanism of UPFC. The theoretical and experimental research described in this paper was therefore conducted to explore tool wear characteristics in UPFC and their relationship to <b>cutting</b> forces, <b>cutting</b> <b>chip</b> morphologies, and machined surface quality. Results from the study reveal that tool wear characteristics in UPFC include cutting edge fractures, workpiece material welding, wear land formation, sub-wear land formation, and micro-grooves. The cutting edge fractures lead to the formation of ridges on both the <b>cutting</b> <b>chips</b> and machined surface; the material welding increases the thrust force, crushes <b>cutting</b> <b>chips,</b> and deteriorates the machined surface quality; and the formation of wear land on the cutting edge makes the machined surface burred and fuzzy, and the micro-grooves leave some traces on the machined surface. By analyzing the captured cutting force, it is found that the progress of tool wear in UPFC can increase the cutting force and its power spectral density at the natural frequency of the dynamometer. Findings from the research provide rich insight into the relationships of tool wear characteristics to <b>cutting</b> forces, <b>chip</b> formation, and machined surface quality in intermittent cutting processes.

40|$|Tool wear {{monitoring}} is {{a popular}} research topic {{in the field of}} ultra-precision machining. However, there appears to have been no research on the monitoring of tool wear in ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) by using <b>cutting</b> <b>chips.</b> In the present research, monitoring tool wear was firstly conducted in UPRM by using <b>cutting</b> <b>chips.</b> During the <b>cutting</b> process, the fracture wear of the diamond tool is directly imprinted on the <b>cutting</b> <b>chip</b> surface as a group of 'ridges'. Through inspection of the locations, cross-sectional shape of these ridges by a 3 D scanning electron microscope, the virtual cutting edge of the diamond tool under fracture wear is built up. A mathematical model was established to predict the virtual cutting edge with two geometric elements: semi-circle and isosceles triangle used to approximate the cross-sectional shape of ridges. Since the theoretical prediction of cutting edge profile concurs with the inspected one, the proposed tool wear monitoring method is found to be effective.

40|$|The present {{authors have}} {{realized}} that <b>cutting</b> <b>chips</b> may be identified utilizable for the strengthening of materials due to large plastic strain accumulated during cutting. The authors have proposed up-grade recycling techniques in which severe plastic deformation in room temperature air is utilized to <b>cutting</b> <b>chip</b> mixture of dissimilar materials, thereby consolidation and further accumulation of strain are simultaneously achieved. In this study, such composite materials are produced and evaluated with combinations of 6061 aluminum/IF steel and 6061 aluminum/pure copper. It is clarified that appropriate second phase <b>cutting</b> <b>chip</b> is a BCC metal. The ultimate tensile strength of the 6061 alloy is improved approximately up to 500 MPa (about 1. 6 {{times that of the}} material before cutting) when the volume fraction of the IF steel is 20 %. To predict the attainable maximum tensile strength by the current method, the Eshelby equivalent inclusion model is employed. The present method is identified to have a potential of realizing 713 MPa (about 2. 3 times that of the material before cutting) {{in the case of the}} 6061 alloy/ 20 %IF steel composite by eliminating production defects adjusting the matrix/second phase combination and conditions for cutting and plastic working...|$|R
40|$|Although online {{surface quality}} {{evaluation}} {{is important in}} ultra-precision machining technologies, very {{little research has been}} reported on the topic. In this paper, <b>cutting</b> <b>chips</b> were employed to evaluate machined surface quality online under the occurrence of tool wear in ultra-precision raster milling. Cutting chips were collected and examined by a 3 D scanning electron microscope. The inspected cross-sectional shape of 'ridges' imprinted by the tool fracture was approximated into two geometric elements so that it could be determined by a mathematical model. The geometric elements for every ridge were assembled into a virtual cutting edge so as to rebuild the machined surface. A mathematical model was established to realize the rebuilt machined surface and calculate the surface roughness under the consideration of tool fractures effects. The theoretical and experimental results show that the ridges imprinted on the machined surface can be predicted by examining a section of the collected <b>cutting</b> <b>chips.</b> It {{is interesting to note that}} the quality of the machined surface is reflected in the location and the height of ridges. This demonstrates that the online surface quality evaluation using <b>cutting</b> <b>chips</b> is a novel method as compared to conventional methods, since it can evaluate the machined surface and simulate the machined surface topography without the need to stop the cutting process.
