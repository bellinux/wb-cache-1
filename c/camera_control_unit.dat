50|$|While shooting, the {{director}} and assistant director create a line cut by instructing the technical director (or vision mixer in UK terminology) to switch between the feeds from the individual cameras. In the case of sitcoms with studio audiences, this line cut is typically displayed to them on studio monitors. The line cut might be refined later in editing, as often the output from all cameras is recorded, both separately and as a combined reference display called the q&shy; split. The camera currently being recorded to the line cut is indicated by a tally light controlled by a <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (CCU) on the camera as a reference both for the actors and the camera operators.|$|E

50|$|For {{television}} productions {{with more}} than one camera in a multiple-camera setup, the tally lights are generally illuminated automatically by a vision mixer trigger that is fed to a tally breakout board and then to a special video router designed for tally signals. The video switcher keeps track of which video sources are selected by the technical director and output to the main program bus. A switch automatically closes the appropriate electrical contacts to create a circuit, this lights the tallys located in the <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (CCU).

5000|$|Block {{cameras are}} so called because the camera head {{is a small}} block, often smaller than the lens itself. Some block cameras are {{completely}} self-contained, while others only contain the sensor block and its pre-amps, thus requiring connection to a separate <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in order to operate. All {{the functions of the}} camera can be controlled from a distance, and often there is a facility for controlling the lens focus and zoom as well. These cameras are mounted on pan and tilt heads, and may be placed in a stationary position, such as atop a pole or tower, in a corner of a broadcast booth, or behind a basketball hoop. They can also be placed on robotic dollies, at the end of camera booms and cranes, or [...] "flown" [...] in a cable supported harness, as shown in the illustration.|$|E
50|$|Most {{television}} studio cameras {{stand on the}} floor, usually with pneumatic or hydraulic mechanisms called pedestals to adjust the height, and are usually on wheels. Any video camera when used along with other video cameras in a multiple-camera setup is controlled by a device known as CCU (<b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit),</b> {{to which they are}} connected via a Triax, Fibre Optic or the almost obsolete multicore cable. The CCU along with genlock and other equipment is installed in the production control room (PCR) often known as the Gallery of the {{television studio}}. When used outside a formal television studio in outside broadcasting (OB), they are often on tripods {{that may or may not}} have wheels (depending on the model of the tripod). Initial models used analog technology, but are now obsolete, supplanted by digital models. Studio cameras are light and small enough to be taken off the pedestal and the lens changed to a smaller size to be used on a Multiple-camera setup's shoulder. Cameras can be mounted on a tripod, a dolly or a crane, thus making the cameras much more versatile than previous generations of studio cameras. These cameras have a tally light, a small signal-lamp used that indicates, for the benefit of those being filmed as well as the camera operator, that the camera is 'live' - i.e. its signal is being used for the 'main program' at that moment.|$|E

It was also the camera of choice at Limehouse Television. As well as ITV company Television South (TVS) used the model in its Maidstone studios, which were still in use by those studios when they were sold off as an independent studio facility following the loss of TVS's franchise at the end of 1992.The 125 was a well thought out and well-built studio and OB camera developed from the Link 120 portable camera system. It also contained a comprehensive communications system and used a <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (CCU) based around the 110's but updated with auto black, white, iris and centering functions.The BBC preferred to use a mid range Schneider-Kreuznach lens as it gave good zoom angles. Some believed it produced one of the best images for a pickup tube camera, others believed it could never match the quality of the EMI 2001. Many BBC users felt that the image was soft and not easy to focus, it also produced an unusual image effect that formed the shape of a 'teardrop'The Link 125 was the most successful of all of Links cameras and the last studio to use them was BBC Pebble Mill which decommissioned the last four in 1994 from the news studio having upgraded to Sony BVP-375's and Ikegami HL-55's a few years before. These cameras have become collectable vintage items.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the field}} of Biomedical Optics {{measurement}} of tissue optical properties, like absorption, scattering, and reduced scattering coefficient, has gained importance for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Accuracy in determining the optical properties is of vital importance to quantitatively determine chromophores in tissue. There are different techniques used to quantify tissue chromophores. Reflectance spectroscopy {{is one of the}} most common methods to rapidly and accurately characterize the blood amount and oxygen saturation in the microcirculation. With a hyper spectral imaging (HSI) device it is possible to capture images with spectral information that depends both on tissue absorption and scattering. To analyze this data software that accounts for both absorption and scattering event needs to be developed. In this thesis work an HSI algorithm, capable of assessing tissue oxygenation while accounting for both tissue absorption and scattering, is developed. The complete imaging system comprises: a light source, a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF), a camera lens, a CCD <b>camera,</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and power supply for light source and filter, and a computer. This work also presents a Graphic processing Unit (GPU) implementation of the developed HSI algorithm, which is found computationally demanding. It is found that the GPU implementation outperforms the Matlab âlsqnonnegâ function by the order of 5 - 7 X. At the end, the HSI system and the developed algorithm is evaluated in two experiments. In the first experiment the concentration of chromophores is assessed while occluding the finger tip. In the second experiment the skin is provoked by UV light while checking for Erythema development by analyzing the oxyhemoglobin image at different point of time. In this experiment the melanin concentration change is also checked at different point of time from exposure. It is found that the result matches the theory in the time dependent change of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. However, the result of melanin does not correspond to the theoretically expected result...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{video cameras}} were mechanical flying-spot scanners {{which were in}} use in the 1920s and 1930s {{during the period of}} mechanical television. Improvements in video camera tubes in the 1930s ushered in the era of electronic television. Earlier, cameras were very large devices, almost always in two sections. The camera section held the lens and tube pre-amplifiers and other necessary electronics, and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics, usually mounted in a separate room in the studio, or a remote truck. The camera head could not generate a video picture signal on its own. The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission. By the fifties, electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate stand alone and even be handheld. But the studio configuration remained, with the large cable bundle transmitting the signals back to the <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (CCU). The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera's functions, such as exposure, system timing, video and black levels.The first color cameras (1950s in the US, early 1960s in Europe), notably the RCA TK-40/41 series, were much more complex with their three (and in some models four) pickup tubes, and their size and weight drastically increased. Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early 1970s - the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit (the body of the camera, containing the lens and pickup tubes, and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator) connected via a cable bundle to a backpack CCU. The Ikegami HL-33, the RCA TK45 and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early 1970s. For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera's video output. Typically this was either a portable 1" [...] reel to reel VTR, or a portable 3/4" [...] U-matic VCR. Typically, the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator, while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder. With the introduction of the RCA TK76 in 1976, camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal. A separate videotape recording unit was still required.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{perception}} {{is thought to}} provide us with the illusion of a stable visual world that is seamless in time and space while it is continuously explored with saccades. The oculomotor system ensures retinal image stabilization during head, object, and surround motion. Prior to manipulation, objects are fixated with topdown driven look-ahead saccades, and similarly, the locomotion path is visually inspected about two steps ahead. In human-human interaction tasks gaze is not only crucial for motor intention recognition but it is also essential in detecting the direction of social attention. A new prototype of a <b>camera</b> motion <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> was developed that provides a sufficiently short latency and a light-weight setup for both a wearable gazecontrolled and a humanoid stereo camera system. The camera system will serve as a binocular eye plant for a humanoid active vision system. The long-term aim is to integrate eye tracking capabilities into the vision system that will equip the humanoid with the ability to infer the target of gaze of a human in human-machine cooperation scenarios. The eye tracking technology has been improved by extending it into the direction of a calibration-free operation. The antropomorphic <b>camera</b> motion <b>control</b> system was integrated into the humanoid JOHNNIE. Thereby, a new experimental tool was created that will help to evaluate the relevance of gaze and look-ahead fixations in the interaction of humans with humanoids in social contexts or during (humanoid) locomotion. âThis work was supported in part within the DFG excellence initiativ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{synchronous}} navigation module for CT colonography (CTC) reading. The {{need for such}} a system arises because most CTC protocols require a patient to be scanned in both supine and prone positions to increase sensitivity in detecting colonic polyps. However, existing clinical practices are limited to reading one scan at a time. Such limitation {{is due to the}} fact that building a reference system between scans for the highly flexible colon is a nontrivial task. The conventional centerline approach, generating only the longitudinal distance along the colon, falls short in providing the necessary orientation information to synchronize the virtual navigation cameras in both scanned positions. In this paper we describe a synchronous navigation system by using the teniae coli as anatomical references. Teniae coli are three parallel bands of longitudinal smooth muscle on the surface of the colon. They are morphologically distinguishable and form a piecewise triple helix structure from the appendix to the sigmoid colon. Because of these characteristics, they are ideal references to synchronize virtual cameras in both scanned positions. Our new navigation system consists of two side-by-side virtual colonoscopic view panels (for the supine and prone data sets respectively) and one single <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (which controls both the supine and prone virtual cameras). The capability to examine the same colonic region simultaneously in both scanned images can raise an observerâs confidence in polyp identification and potentially improve the performance of CT colonography...|$|E

The test chip contained over 2400 active CID pixel structures with different geometries. The analysis is shown {{to be in good}} agreement with the experimental results. The charge injection device, CID 25, is presented. CID 25 is a color video sensor compliant with the NTSC TV standard. It has 484 by 710 displayable pixels and is capable of producing 30 frames-per-second color video. CID 25 is equipped with the active pixel technology combined with parallel row processing to achieve high conversion gain and low noise bandwidth. The on-chip correlated double sampling circuitry seres to reduce the low frequency noise components. CID 25 is operated by the camera system, ColoRAD, consisting of two parts, the head assembly and the <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> These two parts are separated by a cable that can be up to 150 meter long.
