40|$|Excerpt] In December 1985 the American Federation of State, County 2 ̆ 6 Municipal Employees (AFSCME) was <b>certified</b> as the <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> {{for more}} than 11, 000 State of Ohio {{clerical}} employees. This victory followed a string of similar successes: 1981, Florida, 23, 000, and Connecticut, 7, 500; 1983, California university clericals, 19, 500; 1984, Iowa, 6, 000...|$|R
50|$|In other words, when a {{labor union}} is <b>certified</b> as <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> under the Railway Labor Act, {{it becomes the}} {{exclusive}} bargaining representative for the entire craft or class of the employees. Consequently, minority members of the bargaining unit can neither choose another representative of their choice nor engage in individual, independent bargaining. This would then often lead to less power for them {{due to the fact}} that their interests would not be properly represented by the bargaining representative and thus they have no choice but to remain without proper representation. During the entire time under consideration in this case, the Brotherhood maintained that the employment rights of the plaintiff and the class represented by him are governed by the said collective bargaining agreement dated February 18, 1941. The Brotherhood initiated the negotiations without notifying the plaintiff, Tom Tunstall, or any other members of his class.|$|R
5000|$|As {{labour law}} is a provincial {{jurisdiction}} in Canada, the laws vary from province to province. However, there is some common ground. Despite opposition from open shop contractors, in Ontario, the Liberal government recently reinstituted the card-based certification system that was in place {{for most of the}} post-World War II period. Card-based certification was reinstated only for the construction industry. It allows workers to <b>certify</b> an exclusive <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> on the basis of membership, sometimes known as [...] "majority sign-up." [...] Some observers claim that this system creates a risk of employees being misled by business agents. Others assert that it overcomes the natural advantage that employers in opposition to unionization have over their employees.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{mobility}} of the workforce in the construction sector, most jurisdictions set out special rules for bargaining for workers and employers in that sector. In that sector, local unions receive <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> rights for a trade of workers at a single employer, similar to the industrial sector. However, union construction workers and unionized construction employers create provincial or regional <b>bargaining</b> <b>agents</b> with the authority to negotiate one contract that applies to all bargaining units. These regional bargaining units must be certified by the Labour Board of the jurisdiction and in making the decision regarding what group will be <b>certified</b> as the <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> for workers, the Boards will consider which unions have the preponderance of membership in a given trade. This method tends to reinforce the focus of construction sector unions upon the trade(s) {{in which they have}} historic strength and thereby militates against [...] "competition" [...] (i.e.: raiding) between worker organizations—a benefit to both workers and employers of the sector. As a result of the legal framework, a chartered local union within the construction sector will typically have a charter to represent all workers in a specified trade and within a specified region.|$|R
5000|$|Proponents of the {{legislation}} assert that the change is necessary to protect workers' rights to join unions. Under current law, employers {{are not required to}} take as determinative their workers' signed authorization forms designating a union as their representative [...] "and may insist that the workers use a secret-ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to establish their union [...] "even if 100% of the employees provide the NLRB with signed authorizations designating the union as their bargaining agent." [...] The EFCA would allow workers to have their union <b>certified</b> as their <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> by the NLRB if a majority of them have signed valid authorizations." [...] EFCA proponents state that under current law the union ballots are [...] "secret in name only" [...] by citing experts such as University of Oregon professor Gordon Lafer, who in testimony before the U.S. Congress stated: ...|$|R

In our model, each <b>bargaining</b> <b>agent</b> maintains a collection of strategies which is optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (EA). Such evolutionary agents learn in different ways: by selection and reproduction of successful strategies, and by random experimentation (by “mutating ” existing strategies) or by recombining or “crossing over ” previously-tested strategies. We show that game theory can be used successfully to interpret the equilibrium-selecting behavior observed in computational experiments with adaptive <b>bargaining</b> <b>agents.</b> Deviations from classical game theory, for instance the occurrence of highly nonlinear transients in the ultimatum game, are however observed in several experiments...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Unionization {{among college}} and {{university}} faculty continued its slow but steady increase in 1995.

We can now report 504 <b>bargaining</b> <b>agents</b> on 1, 115 campuses throughout the United States. These increases {{can be attributed to}} three sources.
