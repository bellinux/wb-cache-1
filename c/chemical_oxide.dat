40|$|In this article, {{focus has}} been made on two topics: the SiGe {{sensitivity}} to wet Front-End-Of-Line (FEOL) surface preparations and the SiGe/Oxide interface. Depending on the FEOL cleaning process, the <b>chemical</b> <b>oxide</b> growth on SiGe and the associated consumption can be tuned in order to precisely control the oxide thickness and the material loss. In this case, HF last surface preparation presents good performances but his final hydrogen passivation gives a SiGe surface too sensitive to furnace oxidation steps. Using SIMS, AR-XPS and AFM analyses, we show a Ge segregation at the interface or/and a Stranski-Krastanov (SK) relaxation. Finally, a wet clean process with a final hydroxyl passivation is preferred and presents a good compromise between material loss, <b>chemical</b> <b>oxide</b> growth and roughness at the SiGe/Oxide interface...|$|E

Therefore, steel sheets are inspected before they are drawn and the magnetic flux leakage testing is usually employed for the inspection [1]. When there are non-metallic inclusions in the steel sheet, magnetic fields produced by a magnetizer leak out around such defects because of the differences in material permeability. These leakage fields are detected by flux sensitive sensors such as Hall plates or magnetodiodes [2]...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of PbTe nanocomposites requires knowledge regarding the composition of their grain boundaries. Cathodoluminescence (CL), TOF-SIMS and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) were used to explore the composition of surface layers formed via thermal, electrochemical, and wet chemical oxidation of lead telluride. Surface layers obtained by these methods contained components with different degrees of oxidation. RBS and CL results show that thermal and anodic oxidation produced ternary PbTeO_{ 3 } and Pb_{ 2 }TeO_{ 4 } oxides, respectively. For the <b>chemical</b> <b>oxide</b> we observed a substantially lower concentration of oxygen described by PbO_{ 1 -x}TeO_{ 2 -x}, {{a significant amount of}} non-oxidized PbTe ions detected by SIMS, and low CL stability under electron beam radiation.

However, {{it has been reported that}} quality of an interfacial silicon sub oxide layer SiOx, which is usually observed during deposition of AlOx on Silicon, strongly impacts the silicon AlOx interface passivation properties [1]. The present work demonstrates that a convenient way to control the interface is to form thin wet <b>chemical</b> <b>oxides</b> of high quality prior to the deposition of AlOx a SiNx H stacks by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD. To evaluate quantitatively the effect of the preconditioning steps, we conducted measurements of the interface state density Dit E by means of the surface photovoltage technique immediately after the wet chemically preconditioned surfaces.
