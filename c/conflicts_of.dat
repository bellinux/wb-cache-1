5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E

5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007).

Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts.
