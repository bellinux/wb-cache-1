5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or <b>chassis</b> <b>mount</b> fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} hydraulic dampers to go into production was the Telesco Shock Absorber, exhibited at the 1912 Olympia Motor Show and marketed by Polyrhoe Carburettors Ltd. This contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers' mentioned above, but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction. The Telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring, {{in place of the}} rear spring to <b>chassis</b> <b>mount,</b> so that it formed part of the springing system, albeit a hydraulically damped part. This layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles, but it meant the hydraulic damping was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring, but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself.|$|E

40|$|Hand calculations, {{finite element}} (FE) {{analysis}} and experimental validation of <b>chassis</b> <b>mounted</b> platform design for defence and commercial off-road vehicles have been attempted in this work. The work was commenced with the thorough study of platform configuration, loading pattern, platform mount location & configuration on the vehicle chassis and relevant vehicle characteristics. Calculation of section modulus, shear force and bending moment of various structural members under specified loading {{has been carried}} out before proceeding with the FE modeling and analysis of platform. FE model of the <b>chassis</b> <b>mounted</b> platform has been made using shell elements and the boundary conditions have been imposed based on the loading pattern with an assumption of rigid vehicle chassis. Static and gradient analyses of the platform have been carried out for full scale and reduced scale prototype FE models. Experimental strain measurement at critical locations under different static and gradient loads {{has been carried out}} for design validation of <b>chassis</b> <b>mounted</b> platform using the scaled prototype. Close correlation has been found between the experimental stress values and FE stress analysis results for static and gradient load conditions. From the entire load tests conducted, it is observed that the strain values in rear portion are less as compared with those in front and mid portions of the platform in-spite of the rear overhang provision.

5000|$|Polecat - There was {{at least}} one trial version of a Fox <b>chassis</b> <b>mounting</b> the {{standard}} UK GPMG one-man turret (as used on the FV432 APC) and possibly one with a larger one-man turret mounting an M2 [...]5in heavy MG. Both types were proposed for use in Northern Ireland during the 1980s as patrol vehicles.|$|R
50|$|A rackmount {{model of}} the DEC 7000 AXP also existed.

The BA700-AA housed the LSB card cage, which contained five slots for one to three CPU modules, one or two memory modules and an I/O port module.|$|R
50|$|Most {{variants}} were {{fitted with}} a <b>chassis</b> <b>mounted</b> winch that was driven through the gearbox. This winch, which was intended for maneuvering of the towed field gun and for self-recovery of the vehicle; it proved extremely strong and reliable. The Militant gained the nickname 'Knocker' from its military crews {{which may have been}} due to the rhythmic sound of the slow-revving engines.|$|R
5000|$|Point-to-point hand-wiring {{tends to}} be used rather than circuit boards in low-volume {{high-end}} commercial constructions {{as well as by}} hobbyists. This construction style is satisfactory due to ease of construction, adapted to the number of physically large and <b>chassis</b> <b>mounted</b> components (valve sockets, large supply capacitors, transformers), the need to twist heater wiring to minimise hum, and as a side effect benefiting from the fact that [...] "flying" [...] wiring minimises capacitive effects.|$|R

A variety of body types can be fitted throughout the TG range, and in addition to the standard troop carrying/cargo-type body can include fuel or water tankers, shelter/box-type bodies, load handling systems or recovery hampers. Tractor trucks are also available.|$|R
5000|$|The 2S1 Gvozdika (2С1 «Гвоздика», [...] "Carnation") is a Soviet {{self-propelled}} howitzer {{based on}} the MT-LB APC <b>chassis,</b> <b>mounting</b> a 122 mm 2A18 howitzer. [...] "2S1" [...] is its GRAU designation. An alternative Russian designation is SAU-122 but in the Russian Army it {{is commonly known as}} Gvozdika. The 2S1 is fully amphibious with very little preparation, and once afloat is propelled by its tracks. A variety of track widths are available to allow the 2S1 to operate in snow or swamp conditions. It is NBC protected and has infra-red night-vision capability.|$|R

50|$|The brakes were {{unfamiliar}} to bus engineers who {{were used to}} cam-operated brakes and drivers complained that the buses could not pull-up in a straight line. In the Classic Bus reader poll for the worst bus of all time the RU {{failed to make the}} top ten but J. Whiteing summarises the type thus: 'Provided they started they would run and run, but stopping was a case for hope and prayer.' The Pennine bodies were found to be rather too light and tended to crack around the <b>chassis</b> <b>mounting</b> points, whilst the dual-door versions also had localised fractures around the centre exit door.|$|R

The gunner aimed the gun using the M76F telescope. The 90 mm gun M3 was the standardized {{version of the}} experimental T7, a derivative of the 90 mm gun developed as a vehicle-mounted antitank weapon. The M36 carried 47 rounds of main gun ammunition, 11 of which were stowed in the hollow counterweight, while 36 rounds were stowed in the sponsons.

5000|$|The {{howitzer}} {{was mounted}} on a modified M4 medium tank <b>chassis,</b> in <b>mount</b> M17. The resulting vehicle was initially designated 8 inch Howitzer Motor Carriage T89 and eventually standardized as the 8 inch Howitzer Motor Carriage M43. A total of 48 units were built.|$|R
5000|$|Fender {{amplifiers}} {{began making}} {{a name for}} themselves with the Tweed series, so called because of their cloth covering, which is actually varnished cotton twill (tweed is a coarse woollen fabric, commonly used for jackets, coats and caps; it is often woven in a twill pattern, which is likely {{the reason for the}} confusion over naming.) They were produced {{for more than a decade}} and are now eminently collectible and praised for their sound quality. The twill was first used in 1946 on the Dual Professional a twin 10" [...] 6L6 powered model of which only 400 were made before being renamed [...] "the Super Amp" [...] in 1948. These early models are commonly referred to as [...] "TV-Fronts" [...] due to the shape of the cabinet when viewed from above. The Dual Pro was the first twin speaker amp and also the first amp to employ a finger-jointed pine cabinet and the first amp with a top facing control panel. The construction of the amplifiers was changed as well: the <b>chassis</b> are <b>mounted</b> to the back with the tubes pointed down, as opposed to having the <b>chassis</b> <b>mounted</b> on the top of the cabinet. This has the benefit of providing ease of access to the inside while providing a strong top.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chassis</b> is <b>mounted</b> on two bogies, {{has four}} axles and every axle is {{connected}} to one traction motor. Traction motors are controlled via pulse converters.
