50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> is noncombustible, but it {{will still}} release {{dangerous}} fumes in a fire, including hydrogen fluoride, silicon tetrafluoride, and nitrogen oxides.

50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> finds {{use as a}} disinfectant, and it {{is useful}} in etching glass, metal casting, and electroplating.|$|R
50|$|Fluorosilicic {{acid and}} its salts are poisonous. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate,</b> however, {{is very rare}} in nature and {{apparently}} much easier to synthesize.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (also {{known as}} {{ammonium}} hexafluorosilicate, ammonium fluosilicate or ammonium silicofluoride) has the formula (NH4)2SiF6. It is a toxic chemical, like all salts of fluorosilicic acid. It {{is made of}} white crystals, which have at least three polymorphs and appears in nature as rare minerals cryptohalite or bararite.|$|R
50|$|Although bararite was {{claimed to}} be {{metastable}} at room temperature, {{it does not appear}} one polymorph has ever turned into another. Still, bararite is fragile enough that grinding it for spectroscopy will produce a little cryptohalite. Even so, <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> assumes a trigonal form at pressures of 0.2 to 0.3 GPa. The reaction is irreversible. If it is not bararite, the phase is at least very closely related.|$|R
50|$|Bararite is {{a natural}} form of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (also known as hexafluorosilicate or fluosilicate). It has {{chemical}} formula (NH4)2SiF6 and trigonal crystal structure. This mineral was once classified as part of cryptohalite. Bararite is named after {{the place where it}} was first described, Barari, India. It is found at the fumaroles of volcanoes (Vesuvius, Italy), over burning coal seams (Barari, India), and in burning piles of anthracite (Pennsylvania, U.S.). It is a sublimation product that forms with cryptohalite, sal ammoniac, and native sulfur.|$|R
50|$|In Barari, burning-coal gases {{go through}} a dike (igneous intrusion) of mica and peridotite. The sulfur dioxide must attack apatite in the dike, which {{produces}} hydrofluoric acid that attacks the abundant silicates. Silicon fluoride is formed. Ammonia also comes from burning coal. From there, <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> can form. A slight excess of ammonia {{could lead to the}} white lumps of silica and cryptohalite. Bararite and cryptohalite in their pure forms, for the most part, grow out of these nodules. Recrystallization from the rain is probably responsible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> {{has three}} major polymorphs: α-(NH4)2SiF6 form is cubic (space group Fm3m, No. 225) and {{corresponds}} to the mineral cryptohalite. The β form is trigonal (scalenohedral) and occurs in nature as mineral bararite. A third (γ) form was discovered in 2001 and identified with the hexagonal 6mm symmetry. In all three configurations, the SiF62− octahedra are arranged in layers. In the α form, these layers are perpendicular to 111 directions. In the β- and γ- forms, the layers are perpendicular to the c-axis. (Note: trigonal symmetry {{is part of the}} hexagonal group, but not all hexagonal crystals are trigonal.) The silicon atoms of α-(NH4)2SiF6 (alpha), have cubic close(st) packing (CCP). The γ form has hexagonal close(st) packing and the β-(NH4)2SiF6 has primitive hexagonal packing. In all three phases, 12 fluorine atoms neighbor the (NH4)+.|$|R

In addition to ammonium bicarbonate, this material <b>contains</b> <b>ammonium</b> carbamate (NH4CO2NH2), and ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3). It is sometimes called ammonium sesquicarbonate.

EVA materials <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> polyphosphate (20 wt%), with a sufficient amount of alumina trihydrate or melamine, were superior to the non-intumescent alumina trihydrate and melamine containing formulations in terms of the heat release rate, mass loss rate and smoke production. Melamine showed some smoke suppressant effect and significant CO reducing properties. However, the melamine-EVA and melamine-alumina trihydrate-EVA showed a very high heat release rate. Thermogravimetric studies showed that oxygen played a favourable role in enhancing the char formation by encouraging active participation of the polymer matrix in the interaction with polyphosphoric acid...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bipolar {{membrane}} electrodialysis (BMED) {{has been}} widely applied in the recovery/production of organic acids and {{in the treatment of}} wastewater <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate, sodium nitrate, sodium acetate and ammonium nitrate. However, membrane fouling {{is still one of the}} major problems in the electrodialysis process. Since calcium and amino acid are present naturally in fermentation wastewater, this study was carried out to determine the effects of calcium and amino acid on membrane fouling when simulated fermentation wastewater <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> sulfate was treated by BMED. RESULTS: Calcium formed a scale on the cation exchange membrane (CEM) surface in contact with the base cell, but this had no significant adverse effect on the BMED performance. Amino acid, however, caused CEM fouling of the inner membrane, which hampered the BMED process. The coexistence of calcium and amino acid aggravated the membrane fouling, as observed morphologically on the CEM surface on the base cell side. Elemental mapping analysis showed that the membrane foulant was composed of calcium hydroxide and amino acid. CONCLUSION: The CEM fouling caused by calcium and that due to amino acid, which were distributed differently on the membrane, had different effects on the BMED performance. The coexistence of amino acid and calcium deteriorated the CEM fouling during BMED.

40|$|International audienceA new {{approach}} to get ordered and highly amine-functionalized organosilicas is described. The method consisted in using the reversible reaction between CO 2 and amines giving rise to ammonium carbamate salts. Four amine containing precursors were selected for this study: 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 1, 11 -amino-undecyltrimethoxysilane 2, N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 3 and N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 4. CO 2 reacted with 1 and 2 giving rise to bis-silylated organosilica precursors <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> carbamate salts in the core while reaction between CO 2 and 3 or 4 led to a supramolecular network of silylated ammonium carbamate salts. The hydrolytic polycondensation of these carbamate derivatives by using the sol-gel process gave rise to hybrid materials with lamellar structure <b>containing</b> <b>ammonium</b> carbamate salts. Subsequent elimination of CO 2 upon heating generated materials with free amino groups in which the long-range order was maintained. We showed that the structuration was promoted by van der Waals interactions between the long alkylene chains. Some complexation reactions and chemical transformations were achieved in order to investigate the accessibility of amino {{groups as well as}} the chelating capability of the material...|$|R
