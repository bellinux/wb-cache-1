If Adam and Eve ever existed as distinct historical persons, they were members of a much larger population of the same species. [...] However, a common scientific explanation of human origins asserts that the population directly ancestral to all modern humans remained united as a single population by <b>constant</b> <b>gene</b> flow. Therefore, on the level of the entire human population, this explanation of human origin is classified as monogenism.

50|$|In the {{developing}} B cell, the first recombination event to occur is between one D and one J gene {{segment of the}} heavy chain locus. Any DNA between these two gene segments is deleted. This D-J recombination {{is followed by the}} joining of one V gene segment, from a region upstream of the newly formed DJ complex, forming a rearranged VDJ gene segment. All other gene segments between V and D segments are now deleted from the cell’s genome. Primary transcript (unspliced RNA) is generated containing the VDJ region of the heavy chain and both the constant mu and delta chains (Cμ and Cδ). (i.e. the primary transcript contains the segments: V-D-J-Cμ-Cδ). The primary RNA is processed to add a polyadenylated (poly-A) tail after the Cμ chain and to remove sequence between the VDJ segment and this <b>constant</b> <b>gene</b> segment. Translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the Ig μ heavy chain protein.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} microarray data {{is notoriously}} subject to high signal variability. Moreover, unavoidable {{variation in the}} concentration of transcripts applied to microarrays may result in poor scaling of the summarized data which can hamper analytical interpretations. This is especially relevant in a systems biology context, where systematic biases in the signals of particular genes can have severe effects on subsequent analyses. Conventionally {{it would be necessary}} to replace the mismatched arrays, but individual time points cannot be rerun and inserted because of experimental variability. It would therefore be necessary to repeat the whole time series experiment, which is both impractical and expensive. Results We explain how scaling mismatches occur in data summarized by the popular MAS 5 (GCOS; Affymetrix) algorithm, and propose a simple recursive algorithm to correct them. Its principle is to identify a set of <b>constant</b> <b>genes</b> and to use this set to rescale the microarray signals. We study the properties of the algorithm using artificially generated data and apply it to experimental data. We show that the set of <b>constant</b> <b>genes</b> it generates can be used to rescale data from other experiments, provided that the underlying system is similar to the original. We also demonstrate, using a simple example, that the method can successfully correct existing imbalancesin the data. Conclusion The set of <b>constant</b> <b>genes</b> obtained for a given experiment can be applied to other experiments, provided the systems studied are sufficiently similar. This type of rescaling is especially relevant in systems biology applications using microarray data. </p...|$|R
50|$|Local rearrangements affect {{specific}} loci only. Such rearrangements, for instance, {{help create}} genes that produce a great variation of immunoglobulins in vertebrates. During life, organisms {{have contact with}} a large number of antigens. Which means that the immune system needs to synthesize a wide range of antibodies. Each immunoglobulin is a tetramer consisting of four polypeptides connected by disulfide bridges. They form two long heavy chains and  two short light chains. But vertebrate genome does not code entire genes of heavy and light immunoglobulins, only gene segments. Segments of heavy chain are located on chromosome 14, they include 11 <b>constant</b> <b>gene</b> segments (CH), that are preceded by 123-129 variable segments (VH), 27 diversity gene segments (DH) and 9 joining segments (JH), coding different versions of components V, D, J. Loci of light chains on chromosome 2 (locus κ) and chromosome 22 (locus λ) have similar structure, but they do not contain D segments. At the early stage of lymphocyte B development, loci of immunoglobulins are rearranged. During rearrangement, segment VH on heavy chain locus is connected with one DH segment, then V-D group is combined with JH segment. Eventually, exon with open reading frame coding segments: VH, DH, JH of immunoglobulin. Through RNA splicing during transcription, this exon becomes connected to exon for CH segment. Complementary mRNA of heavy chain can be translated into immunoglobulin specific only for one lymphocyte.|$|E

For chromosomal mapping of the Ig and TcR loci including the IGK, IGL, and TRB on the cat genome, we performed PCR screening of DNAs from 37 cat × rodent somatic cell hybrids by using specific primers for the given genes. Consequently, three loci for IGH, TRA, and TRD, and two loci for TRB and TRG {{were found to be}} syntenic and assigned to cat chromosomes (FCA) B 3 and A 2, respectively. Further, IGK and IGL loci were mapped on FCA A 3 and D 3, respectively. These findings support the notion that the genetic linkages between the Ig and TcR genes are extensively conserved between humans and cats...|$|R

The gene consists of a variable region segment separated from a constant region segment by a 3. 5 -kb intervening sequence. The complete sequence of the <b>constant</b> region <b>gene</b> segment shows that this segment is split by intervening sequences into four coding segments corresponding to the four constant region domains of the protein. Using the cloned epsilon <b>constant</b> region <b>gene</b> segment as a probe we obtained evidence, from Southern hybridisation analysis, for three non-allelic epsilon <b>constant</b> region <b>genes.</b> An order on the chromosome for these three genes can be predicted from their pattern of retention in myeloma 266 B 1 DNA...|$|R

We {{propose that the}} SμTR provides closely spaced cleavage sites that can undergo switch recombination independent of Msh 2, whereas cleavages in sequences flanking the SμTR require Msh 2 processing to allow recombinational joining. We also find that changes in Sμ sequences alter the focus of switch junctions within Sγ sequences, indicating that sequences of switch regions act together {{in the choice of}} switch recombination junctions.

40|$|Class switch {{recombination}} (CSR) occurs by an intrachromosomal deletion {{whereby the}} IgM <b>constant</b> region <b>gene</b> (Cmu) {{is replaced by}} a downstream <b>constant</b> region <b>gene.</b> This unique recombination event involves formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immunoglobulin switch (S) regions, and requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which converts cytosines to uracils. Repair of the uracils is proposed to lead to DNA breaks required for recombination. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) is required for most CSR activity although its role is disputed. Here we use ligation-mediated PCR to detect DSBs in S regions in splenic B cells undergoing CSR. We find that the kinetics of DSB induction corresponds with AID expression, and that DSBs are AID- and UNG-dependent and occur preferentially at G:C basepairs in WRC/GYW AID hotspots. Our results indicate that AID attacks cytosines on both DNA strands, and staggered breaks are processed to blunt DSBs at the initiating ss break sites. We propose a model to explain the types of end-processing events observed...|$|R

The deletion created in the present work encompasses one of the two diversity gene segments of the mouse T-cell receptor beta-subunit locus, 10 out of the 12 joining gene segments, and both <b>constant</b> <b>gene</b> segments.
