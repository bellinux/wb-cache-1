These instruments are designed to simulate the dissolution of drug formulations in conditions most closely mimicking the gastrointestinal tract. In this work, we focused on the optimization of dissolution compartments/vessels for {{an updated version of}} the biorelevant dissolution apparatus—Golem v 2. We designed eight compartments of uniform size but different inner geometry. The dissolution performance of the compartments was tested using immediate release caffeine tablets and evaluated by standard statistical methods and principal component analysis. Based on two phases of dissolution testing (using 250 and 100 mL of dissolution medium), we selected two <b>compartment</b> <b>types</b> yielding the highest measurement reproducibility. We also confirmed a statistically ssignificant effect of agitation rate and dissolution volume on the extent of drug dissolved and measurement reproducibility...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDiffusion multi-compartment models (MCM) {{allow for}} a fine and {{comprehensive}} study of the white matter microstructure. Non linear registration of MCM images may provide valuable information on the brain e. g. through population comparison. State-of-the-art MCM registration however relies on pairing-based similarity measures where the one-to-one mapping of MCM compartments is required. This approach leads to non differentiabilties or discontinuities, which may turn into poorer registration. Moreover, these measures are often specific to one MCM compartment model. We propose two new MCM similarity measures based on the space of square integrable functions, applied to MCM characteristic functions. These measures are pairing-free and agnostic to <b>compartment</b> <b>types.</b> We derive their analytic expressions for multi-tensor models and propose a spherical approximation for more complex models. Evaluation is performed on synthetic deformations and inter-subject registration, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed measures...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of microbial activity to ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems is well established, but microbial diversity {{has been less}} frequently addressed. This review and synthesis {{of the hundreds of}} published studies on stream microbial diversity shows that factors known to drive ecosystem processes, such as nutrient availability, hydrology, metal contamination, contrasting land-use and temperature, also cause heterogeneity in bacterial diversity. Temporal heterogeneity in stream bacterial diversity was frequently observed, reflecting the dynamic nature of both stream ecosystems and microbial community composition. However, within-stream spatial differences in stream bacterial diversity were more commonly observed, driven specifically by different organic matter compartments. Bacterial phyla showed similar patterns in relative abundance with regard to compartment type across different streams. For example, surface water contained the highest relative abundance of Actinobacteria, while epilithon contained the highest relative abundance of Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This suggests that contrasting physical and/or nutritional habitats characterized by different stream organic matter <b>compartment</b> <b>types</b> may select for certain bacterial lineages. When comparing the prevalence of physicochemical effects on stream bacterial diversity, effects of changing metal concentrations were most, while effects of differences in nutrient concentrations were least frequently observed. This may indicate that although changing nutrient concentrations do tend to affect microbial diversity, other environmental factors are more likely to alter stream microbial diversity and function. The common observation of connections between ecosystem process drivers and microbial diversity suggests that microbial taxonomic turnover could mediate ecosystem-scale responses to changing environmental conditions, including both microbial habitat distribution and physicochemical factors...|$|E

40|$|Electricity {{generation}} from swine wastewater using microbial {{fuel cell}} (MFC) was investigated. Swine wastewater was collected into dual-chambered (aerobic and anaerobic) fuel cell. The maximum power output using copper and carbon electrodes were 250. 54 and 52. 33 µW, while 10. 0 and 5. 0 cm salt bridge length between the cathode and anode were 279. 50 and 355. 26 µW, respectively. Potassium permanganate and ordinal water gave a maximum power output of 1287. 8 and 13 9. 18 µW. MFCs utilize microbial communities to degrade organic materials found within wastewater and converted stored chemical energy to electrical energy in a single step. The initial bacterial and fungal counts were 7. 4 × 10 6 and 1. 1 × 10 3 CFU ml- 1. Bacterial counts steadily increased with time to 1. 40 × 10 7 CFU ml - 1 while fungal count declined to 4. 4 × 106 CFU ml - 1 after day 60. The declined in microbial counts {{may be attributed to}} the time necessary for acclimatization of microbes to the anode. The genera identified were Bacillus, Citrobacter, Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus and Rhizopus. These microbes acted as primary and secondary utilizers, utilizing carbon and other organics of the wastewater. Chemical parameters indicated that the biochemical oxygen demand ranged from 91. 4 – 23. 2 mg/L, giving 75 % while the chemical oxygen demand ranged from 243. 1 – 235. 2 mg/L, representing 3. 3 %.

40|$|Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause {{distinct}} phenotypes of {{muscular dystrophy}} {{known by the}} term “dysferlinopathy”. Nowadays, four subtypes of dysferlinopathies have been established: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2 B (LGMD 2 B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM), distal anterior <b>compartment</b> <b>type</b> and scapuloperoneal type. We report a girl with dysferlinopathy with an unusual involvement of muscles in lower extremities and her brother whose symptoms started after the diagnosis of his sister. Both of them had lower limb weakness, marked elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels and myopathic patterns in electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy of the girl who was diagnosed as having dysferlinopathy disclosed dystrophic changes and an absence of dysferlin. She had both proximal and distal weakness of the lower limbs presented in a 5 -year-period. However her brother had difficulty only in foot dorsiflexion {{at the beginning of}} the symptoms. In conclusion, phenotypic variability, particularly at onset is one of the features of dysferlinopathies.

40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} {{long-term}} outcome of surgical {{removal of a}} meniscus in the knee with regard to radiographic signs of osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Of the 123 patients who underwent an open meniscectomy due to an isolated meniscus tear in 1973 at Lund University Hospital, 107 were followed up 21 years later by clinical examination and by review of knee radiographs obtained with weight bearing. Seventy-nine of the 107 patients were men, and {{the mean age of}} the total study group at examination was 55 years (range 35 - 77). Sixty-eight sex- and age-matched individuals with healthy knees served as controls. Results. Mild radiographic changes were found in 76 (71 %) of the knees, while more advanced changes, comparable with a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 2 or higher, were seen in 51 (48 %). The corresponding prevalence values in the control group were 12 (18 %) and 5 (7 %), respectively. The relative risk for the presence of the more advanced radiographic changes representing definite radiographic tibiofemoral OA was 14. 0 (95 % confidence interval 3. 5 - 121. 2), using age- and sex-matched pairs for comparison. No correlation with sex, localization to <b>compartment,</b> <b>type</b> of meniscus tear, or work load was found. Knee symptoms were reported twice as often in the study group as in the controls.

40|$|In the liver, {{genes are}} {{expressed}} along a portocentral gradient. Based on their adaptive behavior, a gradient versus <b>compartment</b> <b>type,</b> and a dynamic versus stable type of gradient have been recognized. To understand {{at least in}} principle the development and maintenance of these gradients in gene expression {{in relation to the}} limited number of signal gradients, we propose a simple and testable model. The model uses portocentral gradients of signal molecules as input, while the output depends on two gene-specific variables, viz., the affinity of the gene for its regulatory factors and the degree of cooperativity that determines the response in the signal-transduction pathways. As a preliminary validity test for its performance, the model was tested on control and hormonally induced expression patterns of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK), carbamoylphosphate synthetase I (CPS), and glutamine synthetase (GS). Affinity was found to determine the overall steepness of the gradient, whereas cooperativity causes these gradients to steepen locally, as is necessary for a compartment-like expression pattern. Interaction between two or more different signal gradients is necessary to ensure a stable expression pattern under different conditions. The diversity in sequence and arrangement of related DNA-response elements of genes appears to account for the gene-specific shape of the portocentral gradients in expression. The feasibility of testing the function of hepatocyte-specific DNA-response units in vivo is demonstrated by integrating such units into a ubiquitously active promoter/enhancer and analyzing the pattern of expression of these constructs in transgenic mic...|$|R
40|$|The aging process, {{especially}} of the skin, is governed by changes in the epidermal, dermo-epidermal, and dermal <b>compartments.</b> <b>Type</b> I collagen, which is the major component of dermis extracellular matrix (ECM), constitutes a prime target for intrinsic and extrinsic aging-related alterations. In addition, under the aging process, pro-inflammatory signals are involved and collagens are fragmented owing to enhanced matrix metalloproteinase activities, and fibroblasts are {{no longer able to}} properly synthesize collagen fibrils. Here, we demonstrated that low levels of type I collagen detected in aged skin fibroblasts are attributable to an inhibition of COL 1 A 1 transcription. Indeed, on one hand, we observed decreased binding activities of specific proteins 1 and 3, CCAAT-binding factor, and human collagen-Krüppel box, which are well-known COL 1 A 1 transactivators acting through the - 112 /- 61 -bp promoter sequence. On the other hand, the aging process was accompanied by elevated amounts and binding activities of NF-κB (p 65 and p 50 subunits), together with an increased number of senescent cells. The forced expression of NF-κB performed in young fibroblasts was able to establish an old-like phenotype by repressing COL 1 A 1 expression through the short - 112 /- 61 -bp COL 1 A 1 promoter and by elevating the senescent cell distribution. The concomitant decrease of transactivator functions and increase of transinhibitor activity is responsible for ECM dysfunction, leading to aging/senescence in dermal fibroblasts...|$|R
