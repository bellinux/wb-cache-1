40|$|Henze and Blair [2] have {{successfully}} derived algorithms for enumerating {{the number of}} constitutional isomers of aliphatic compounds using alkyl radicals; however, the algorithms cannot be extended to enumerate constitutional isomers of <b>cyclic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Similarly, Read [4] has advocated the use of alkyl biradicals to enumerate constitutional isomers of aliphatic <b>compounds,</b> but not <b>cyclic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Apparently, the use of alkyl biradicals in the enumeration of constitutional isomers of <b>cyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> has been neglected.

50|$|<b>Cyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> {{that have}} both carbon and non-carbon atoms present are termed (heterocyclic compounds); {{alternatively}} the name {{can refer to}} inorganic <b>cyclic</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as siloxanes and borazines, that have more type of atom in their rings.

50|$|This {{is mainly}} {{based on the}} fact that cyclic {{compounds}} are possessing higher densities than their linear counterparts. This can be illustrated by a comparison of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons (see table). A hypothetical ring-opening process of cyclobutane to n-butane would result in a volumen expansion of approximately 15%. The polymerization of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>compound</b> causes therefore a smaller volume shrinkage because cyclic compounds are already relatively dense.|$|E
50|$|In Stevia rebaudiana, the {{biosynthesis}} of steviol {{is confined}} to green tissues. The precursors of steviol are synthesized via the non-mevalonate pathway located in plant cell plastids, which produces isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). IPP and DMAPP are converted to geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP), which is the precursor of many diterpenoids, by GGDP synthase. GPDP is made into a <b>cyclic</b> <b>compound,</b> copalyl diphosphate (CDP), by CDP synthase, after which kaurene is produced by another cyclization catalyzed by kaurene synthase.|$|E

When used as additives, all of them can significantly increase the ionic conductivity of lithium halide salts in THF solutions. This is due to the complexation between these compounds and halide anions. Ionic conductivity studies show that the complexation behavior is related to both the ring structure of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> and the characteristics of the halide anions. X-ray diffraction data show that the diffraction patterns of the complex crystals are different from the pure <b>cyclic</b> aza-ether <b>compounds.</b> New Bragg peaks representing a large d-spacing ({approx} 15 {angstrom}) are observed for the complex crystals which provides a clear evidence for complexation...|$|R
50|$|Common atoms can (as {{a result}} of their valences) form varying numbers of bonds, and many common atoms readily form rings. In addition, {{depending}} on the ring size, the bond order of the individual links between ring atoms, and their arrangements within the rings, <b>cyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> may be aromatic or non-aromatic; in the case of non-aromatic <b>cyclic</b> <b>compounds,</b> they may vary from being fully saturated to having varying numbers of multiple bonds. As a consequence of the constitutional variability that is thermodynamically possible in cyclic structures, the number of possible cyclic structures, even of small size (e.g., <17 atoms) numbers in the many billions.|$|R
