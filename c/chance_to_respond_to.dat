Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying {{that the lack of}} education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E

40|$|A huge {{importer}} of {{food aid}} in the post-independence years, India has rapidly reached selfsufficiency in grain in the late sixties, thanks to a pro-active policy oriented towards grain production in the indo-gangetic plains. However facing the today’s gigantic surpluses of grains, and the worrisome budget deficit {{of the central government}} and the Indian states, India ha come under pressure from various national and international institutions to shift state support from grain production to other productions. For the indo-gangetic plains, current grain basket of India, dairy is considered among the best alternatives. Grain producers of these regions are already the one contributing most, with producers form the North West (Gujarat, Maharastra), to the national dairy production and they are the ones with the better <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the increasing national demand for dairy products. The simulations developed in this study show that there is an important potential for crop livestock integration and that this integration can maintain agricultural incomes; partially compensate the likely reduction of subsidies and contribute to a better management of soil fertility. Whether national production will be able <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the demand in grain from both humans and animals, is a hot debate in India. On one hand, dairy production system is so extensive that production can be increased easily without much additional feeding of grain or concentrates but with cheaper sources of forages. On the other hand, the rapidly increasing poultry industry depends heavily upon maize, which is still a marginal production in India...|$|R

5000|$|Following the 9/11 {{terrorist}} attacks, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13224 under IEEPA {{to block}} the assets of terrorist organizations. The President delegated blocking authority to federal agencies led by the U.S. Treasury. In October 2001, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act which, in part, enhanced the IEEPA asset blocking provisions under §1702(a)(1)(B) to permit the blocking of assets during the [...] "pendency of an investigation."

40|$|Objective: Intravenous (iv) {{glucocorticoids}} (GC) (ivGC) and orbital radiotherapy (ORT) {{are commonly}} used in active Graves' orbitopathy (GO), with favorable outcomes in up to 80 % of patients. However, little is known on the factors that may affect GO outcome in the long term, an issue that we investigated here. Methods: We studied retrospectively 96 untreated patients with GO, identified out of 787 consecutive patients who came to our GO Clinic for a follow-up visit between September 2010 and June 2013. After the first observation, patients were treated with ivGC and ORT and were then re-examined after a median period of 55. 5 months. The primary end-point was the possible relation between GO outcome and several individual variables. Results: Exophthalmometry, eyelid aperture, CAS, diplopia and visual acuity (the latter only in patients with an initial reduction) improved significantly after treatment. Overall, 67. 7 % of patients had improved and were considered as responders, whereas the remaining (29. 1 % stable and 4. 5 % worsened) were considered as non-responders. Age, smoking, thyroid volume, thyroid treatment, serum anti-TSH receptor autoantibodies and individual GO features at first observation {{did not affect the}} outcome of GO, which, in contrast, was affected by gender and by the time elapsed between first and last observation. Thus, the prevalence of responders was higher in females (76. 4 vs 48 % in males, P = 0. 02) and the time elapsed between first and last observation was greater in responders (58 vs 39 months in non-responders, P = 0. 02). Whereas the prevalence of responders and non-responders was similar up to 36 months, there was an increase in responders beginning between 37 and 48 months and reaching a peak of ∼ 80 % between 61 and 72 months, to plateau thereafter. Conclusions: Given the limitations of retrospective investigations, our study confirms that the combination of GC and ORT is effective in GO and shows that females have greater <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> treatment. The notorious tendency of GO to improve spontaneously with time most likely contributes the long-term outcome of the eye syndrome...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the representation of}} home and hospitality in Zoë Wicomb’s Playing in the Light, Ishtiyaq Shukri’s The Silent Minaret, and Ivan Vladislavić’s Double Negative. It attempts to trace the un-homeliness of the central characters and to account for their feelings of discomfort. As such, it argues that the home is incapable of being inviolable because {{the invasion of the}} public is always a possibility. The implication is that master narratives such as race, history and politics are always entering the space one constructs as private. That said, this study also argues that the home and those things with which it is most closely associated, such as belonging, comfort and safety, may actually hide a form of violence. By this I mean that in the desire for homeliness, one may exclude others from one’s home. Consequently, this argument draws on Jacques Derrida’s writings on the aporia of conditional and unconditional hospitality to investigate what ethical possibilities might, somewhat unexpectedly, be created by the un-homely home. The study is therefore an exploration of the potentials that inhere in a certain kind of un-homeliness, the most important of which is the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> ethically <b>to</b> the alterity of the other. In sum, there is a necessity to extend hospitality beyond condition and beyond limit, and this ethical imperative is at odds with the desire for comfort and safety. The way in which post-transitional novels explore these issues of hospitality and home is the primary focus of this study...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Widespread and {{persistent}} medical and surgical practice variation is {{held to be}} {{a consequence of the}} failure of clinicians to incorporate research evidence in their everyday work. Practice guidelines are one of the key tactics advocated by the proponents of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to ensure that clinicians apply research evidence to their practice. The critics of EBM contend that there are fundamental differences between the formulised rules encapsulated in guidelines and the type of knowledge required to practise medicine. Much of the opposition to guidelines has been rooted in philosophical arguments about the tensions between "art" and "science", and surgeons, in particular have been quick to argue that the exercise of clinical judgement makes the use of guidelines problematic. The aim {{of this paper is to}} suggest why surgeons ignore guidelines. Methods A qualitative study of 34 surgeons practising urology, gynaecology or pelvic surgery in the UK and USA, involved in treating women with stress urinary incontinence. Qualitative interviews and observational methods were used to explore surgeons' views of surgical practice, to examine the nature of everyday surgical work and consider the applicability of guidelines to this area of medical work. Analysis used techniques of constant comparison to generate themes and categories. Results Surgeons view surgical work as contingent: they describe it as both dependent on conditional factors and subject <b>to</b> <b>chance.</b> They <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> contingency by drawing on tacit knowledge and instinctive responses. Surgical judgement provides a strong justification for resisting the imposition of guidelines. Conclusion The technical knowledge embodied in guidelines may be difficult to reconcile with the individual and practical nature of everyday surgical work...|$|R

40|$|Administrative law is {{animated}} by two complementary purposes: first, to protect participatory rights in public decision-making, and second, to ensure accountability for public decision-making. The Anti-Terrorism Bill, with its sweeping and vague goals related to combatting terrorism, raises important and complex {{questions regarding the}} scope of participatory rights and accountability in the national security decision-making context. This chapter explores {{the way in which}} the Anti-Terrorist Bill intersects with each of these purposes. Using the Charity Registration (Security Information) Act as a case study, Sossin demonstrates that procedural guarantees can and will be sacrificed in contexts of national security. Ministerial certificates indicating that a person or group is engaged in terrorist activities, may be based on secret evidence, and may be signed and applied in circumstances where the affected parties never have a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> know or <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the allegations made against them. While limited review is provided for some of these extraordinary ministerial powers (for example, Ministerial certificates are referred to Federal Court Judges to determine whether the Minister had a reasonable basis for signing them), Courts are likely to defer to the judgment of executive decision-makers exercising broad discretion in the context of national security. While the jurisprudence of administrative suggests both participatory rights and accountability measures may be sacrificed to promote national security, Sossin argues that they should not be so lightly set aside. Both procedural fairness and meaningful forms of public review lead to more accurate, more just and more legitimate decision-making, which in turn may well result in enhancing both national security and respect for the rule of law...|$|R
