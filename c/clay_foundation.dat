25|$|With over 20,000 extant pieces, Attic black-figure vases {{comprise}} {{the largest and}} at the same time most significant vase collection, second only to Attic red-figure vases. Attic potters benefitted from the excellent, iron-rich clay found in Attica. High quality Attic black-figure vases have a uniform, glossy, pitch-black coating and the color-intensive terra cotta <b>clay</b> <b>foundation</b> has been meticulously smoothened. Women’s skin is always indicated with a white opaque color, which is also frequently used for details such as individual horses, clothing or ornaments. The most outstanding Attic artists elevated vase painting to a graphic art, but a large number of average quality and mass-market products were also produced. The outstanding significance of Attic pottery comes from their almost endless repertoire of scenes covering a wide range of themes. These provide rich testimonials especially in regard to mythology, but also to daily life. On the other hand, there are virtually no images referring to contemporary events. Such references are only occasionally evident in the form of annotations, for example when kalos inscriptions are painted on a vase. Vases were produced for the domestic market on the one hand, and were important for celebrations or in connection with ritual acts. On the other hand, they were also an important export product sold throughout the Mediterranean area. For this reason most of the surviving vases come from Etruscan necropolises.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 5th century BC until 480 BC at the latest, all painters of repute were using the red-figure style. But black-figure vases continued to be produced for some 50 additional years, with their quality progressively decreasing. The last painters producing acceptable quality images on large vases were the Eucharides Painter and the Kleophrades Painter. Only workshops which produced smaller shapes like olpes, oenoches, skyphos, small neck amphoras and particular lekythos increasingly used the old style. The Phanyllis Painter used the Six technique, among other methods, and both the Edinburgh Painter and the Gela Painter decorated the first cylindrical lekythos. The former primarily produced casual, clear and simple scenes using a black-figure style on a white ground. The white ground of the vases was quite thick and no longer painted directly on the <b>clay</b> <b>foundation,</b> a technique which became the standard for all white-ground vases. The Sappho Painter specialized in funerary lekythos. The workshop of the Haimon Painter was especially productive; over 600 of their vases have survived. The Athena Painter (who is perhaps identical with the red-figure Bowdoin Painter) and the Perseus Painter continued to decorate large, standard lekythos. The scenes of the Athena Painter still radiate some of the dignity inherent {{in the work of the}} Leagros Group. The Marathon Painter is primarily known for the funerary lekythos found in the tumulus for the Athenians who died in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The last significant lekythos painter, the Beldam Painter, worked from around 470 BC until 450 BC. Except for the Panathenaic prize amphoras, the black-figure style came to a close in Attica at this time.|$|E
25|$|Other {{significant}} {{painters of}} the first generation were the Panther Painter, the Anagyrus Painter, the Painter of the Dresden Lekanis and the Polos Painter. The last significant representative {{of the first}} generation of painters was Sophilos (580–570 BC), who is the first Attic vase painter known by name. In all, he signed four surviving vases, three as painter and one as potter, revealing that at this date potters were also painters of vases in the black-figure style. A fundamental separation of both crafts seems to have occurred only {{in the course of the}} development of the red-figure style, although prior specialization cannot be ruled out. Sophilos makes liberal use of annotations. He apparently specialized in large vases, since especially dinos and amphoras are known to be his work. Much more frequently than his predecessors, Sophilos shows mythological scenes like the funeral games for Patroclus. The decline of the animal frieze begins with him, and plant and other ornaments are also of lower quality since they are regarded as less important and thus receive scant attention from the painter. But in other respects Sophilos shows that he was an ambitious artist. On two dinos the marriage of Peleus and Thetis is depicted. These vases were produced at about the same time as the François vase, which depicts this subject to perfection. However, Sophilos does without any trimmings in the form of animal friezes on one of his two dinos, and he does not combine different myths in scenes distributed over various vase surfaces. It is the first large Greek vase showing a single myth in several interrelated segments. A special feature of the dinos is the painter's application of the opaque white paint designating women directly on the <b>clay</b> <b>foundation,</b> and not as usual on the black gloss. The figure's interior details and contours are painted in a dull red. This particular technique is rare, only found in vases painted in Sophilos' workshop and on wooden panels painted in the Corinthian style in the 6th century BC. Sophilos also painted one of the rare chalices (a variety of goblet) and created the first surviving series of votive tablets. He himself or one of his successors also decorated the first marriage vase (known as a lebes gamikos) to be found.|$|E

The overall short- {{and long-term}} behaviour of the reinforced soil wall, including reinforcement strains and deformations, are discussed and compared with the expected design values. It is shown that the viscoplastic nature of some clayey soils can cause a decrease in the undrained shear strength with time by as much as 20 % and increase the reinforcement strains by as much as 45 % relative to expected design values...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{numerous}} {{investigations have}} been conducted to predict the lateral displacements which develop in soft <b>clay</b> <b>foundations</b> {{as a result of}} embankment construction. These studies focus on the prediction of lateral deformation at the toe of the embankment, and were prompted by observations of the damaging effects on adjacent structures by these deformations. The mechanisms of lateral deformations are not yet clearly understood, however, predictions of behaviour seem possible due to the distribution of lateral deformations with depth remaining similar during the settlement process. The finite difference program FLAC was used within this study to model the behaviour of a homogeneous elastic medium subjected to different conditions of embankment loading. An empirical relation has been developed to describe the variation of lateral deformations with depth, at various distances from the embankment toe. This empirical correlation compared well to predictions from a previously validated numerical model of an instrumented trial embankment...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of an earth structure on soft <b>clay</b> <b>foundations</b> {{is influenced by}} the stress-strain behaviour, drainage conditions and the associated failure mechanisms of the clay. The rapid increase of pore water pressure during construction, and the subsequent slow rate of pore pressure dissipation are often the main factors that dictate soft clay failure. Subsequently, ground improvement methods {{such as the use of}} prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) are becoming more popular for stabilisation of these soils. Calculations of soil behaviour commonly utilize the assumption of soil as an isotropic material regardless of the widely documented reality that soft clays exhibit significant anisotropy. The consolidation and permeability characteristics of two artificial clays were investigated within this study through a series of oedometer tests. These tests were conducted on both horizontally and vertically cut specimens, and values for anisotropy detailed. Such results will be helpful in approximating the anisotropy present in natural soils of similar plasticity...|$|R

50|$|The {{town was}} {{eventually}} deserted; a new town center was developed {{west of the}} area, built around a new railway station. The territory came under Soviet rule by the 20th century.

Hence, the mausoleum was closed to the devotees who came {{to pay homage to}} Yasawi. Nevertheless, the local khoja based at the mausoleum allowed pilgrims to secretly enter the structure at night. Beginning in 1922, several commissions took part in the technical investigation of the building. Regular maintenance has been in place beginning in 1938, while a series of restoration campaigns were started in 1945, with the last one being held from 1993 to 2000.

40|$|Abstract The {{case history}} of a failure of a RE wall has been presented. The wall failed {{immediately}} upon completion due to the overestimation of {{the strengths of the}} <b>foundation</b> <b>clay</b> layers and due to the underes-timation of the self weight of the fill materials. A typical cross-section of the wall along with the stabilizing embankment and the foundation are mod-eled numerically by the limit equilibrium method and by a finite element method. The strengths of the foundation soils are determined by field tests done after the failure of the wall. Both the analyses predicted failure of the wall. The deformations predicted by the finite element method are found to be comparable to the observed field data. The numer-ical analyses further indicate that by consolidating a <b>foundation</b> <b>clay</b> layer to a minimum undrained strength of 45 kPa, the required factor of safety for the wall along with the road embankment can be achieved theoretically. Accordingly, prefabricated vertical drains are used to expedite the drainage and consolidation of the <b>foundation</b> <b>clay</b> layers. After the field tests confirm that the required minimum undrained strength is achieved, the RE wall and the embankment have been rebuilt successfully and now in full operation...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the conditions {{that led to the}} failure of the Aznalcóllar dam is made in the paper. Pore water pressures prevailing in the <b>foundation</b> <b>clay</b> {{at the time of the}} failure have been established on the basis of piezometric observations made after the failure. A simplified consolidation analysis is first presented to interpret pore water pressure generation and dissipation and to evaluate the evolution of shear stresses along the potential failure plane. Both limit equilibrium and finite element analysis are used to back-analyse the failure and to derive representative strength parameters along the failure surface. Three-dimensional effects introduced by the layered natureof the <b>foundation</b> <b>clay</b> are then described. They provide an explanation for the location of the slide, which affected only the south-eastern portion of the embankment. The failure is examined in the final part of the paper from the perspective offered by the current knowledge of the strength behaviour of brittle clays. The significance of progressive failure is discussed, together with other factors that played a significant role in this case: the homogeneous nature and very low permeability of the <b>foundation</b> <b>clay</b> and the natural state of the clay, probably affected by some initial damage, which reduced the available strength along bedding planes.

40|$|Good quality {{geologic}} {{materials for}} construction are also becoming scarce. Due to these reasons {{and because of}} the environmental restrictions on certain public works, ground improvement is becoming an essential part of infrastructure development. As a result, Civil Engineers are forced to utilise even the poorest soft <b>clay</b> <b>foundations</b> for buildings, highways and railway tracks. Therefore, the application of prefabricated vertical drains with preloading has now become common practice {{and one of the most}} effective ground improvement techniques. The classical solution for vertical drains (single drain analysis) has been well documented in the literature, where there are many vertical drains, a true 3 -D analysis of the site becomes very difficult. Therefore, equivalent 2 -D plane strain models have been employed, using the methods of geometric and permeability matching concepts. The equivalent plane strain solution can now be used as a predictive tool with acceptable accuracy as a result of the significant process that has been made in the past few years through rigorous mathematical modelling and numerical analyses. In this paper, the equivalent 2 -D plane strain solution is described which includes the effects of smear zone caused by mandrel driven vertical drains. The equivalent (transformed) permeability coefficients are incorporated in finite element codes, employing the modified Cam-clay theory. Numerical analysis is conducted to predict the excess pore pressures, lateral and vertical displacements. Two case histories are discussed and analysed, including the sites of Muar clay (Malaysia) and the predictions are compared with the available field data. The research findings verify that the impact of smear and well resistance can significantly affect soil consolidation, hence, in order to obtain reliable consolidation predictions, these aspects need to be simulated appropriately in the selected numerical approach...|$|R
