25|$|While the {{earliest}} documented case of scurvy {{was described by}} Hippocrates around 400 BC, the first attempt to give scientific basis {{for the cause of}} this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the British Royal Navy, James Lind. Scurvy was common among those with poor access to fresh fruit and vegetables, such as remote, isolated sailors and soldiers. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on cider, vinegar, sulfuric acid or seawater, along with their normal rations. In the history of science, this is considered to be the first occurrence of a <b>controlled</b> <b>experiment.</b> The results conclusively showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease. Lind published his work in 1753 in his Treatise on the Scurvy.|$|E

A <b>controlled</b> <b>experiment</b> in lab mice did not find any difference in tumor growth between untreated mice and those given the Hoxsey tonic. An FDA review of 400 people claiming to have been cured by the Hoxsey method found that many of the patients never in fact had cancer, or had received successful medical treatment elsewhere before being treated with Hoxsey Therapy. Those who had cancer at the time they used Hoxsey Therapy were uniformly either deceased or alive with active cancer. There were no cases of actual cures among those promoted as such by the Hoxsey clinic.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} study {{predation}} and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator {{and the other}} being the prey. He set up a <b>controlled</b> <b>experiment</b> using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties {{similar to those of}} Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.|$|E
40|$|The web {{provides}} an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate ideas quickly using <b>controlled</b> <b>experiments,</b> also called randomized experiments (single-factor or factorial designs), A/B tests (and their generalizations), split tests, Control/Treatment tests, and parallel flights. <b>Controlled</b> <b>experiments</b> embody the best scientific design for establishing a causal relationship between changes and {{their influence on}} user-observable behavior. We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where end-users can help guide the development of features. Our experience indicates that significant learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen when development teams listen to their customers, not to the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO). We provide several examples of <b>controlled</b> <b>experiments</b> with surprising results. We review the important ingredients of running <b>controlled</b> <b>experiments,</b> and discuss their limitations (both technical and organizational). We focus on several areas that are critical to experimentation, including statistical power, sample size, and techniques for variance reduction. We describe common architectures for experimentation systems and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple in practice as is often assumed. <b>Controlled</b> <b>experiments</b> typically generate large amounts of data, which can be analyzed using data mining techniques to gain {{deeper understanding of the}} factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of improvements. Organizations that embrace <b>controlled</b> <b>experiments</b> with clear evaluation criteria can evolve their systems with automated optimizations and real-time analyses. Based on our extensive practical experience with multiple systems and organizations, we share key lessons that will help practitioners in running trustworthy <b>controlled</b> <b>experiments...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Some Greek {{philosophers}} of antiquity, {{among them}} Aristotle, founder of Aristotelian physics, {{may have been}} the first to maintain the idea that [...] "everything happens for a reason" [...] and that theoretical principles can assist in the understanding of nature. While to a modern reader, many of these preserved ideas come forth as eminently reasonable, there is a conspicuous lack of both mathematical theory and <b>controlled</b> <b>experiment,</b> as we know it.

2500|$|The {{scientific}} method seeks to objectively explain {{the events of}} nature in a reproducible way. An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as [...] "Occam's Razor") and are generally expected to seek consilience—fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena. This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress. This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might {{take the place of}} a <b>controlled</b> <b>experiment).</b> Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).|$|E

The Experimentation Platform (ExP) was built to accelerate innovation through trustworthy experimentation.
