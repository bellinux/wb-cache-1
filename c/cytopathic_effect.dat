40|$|CD 4 + T {{lymphocytes}} {{of individuals}} infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) exhibit a qualitative defect {{in their ability to}} mount memory responses to previously encountered antigens although their responses to mitogens remain normal. T cells responsible for memory responses can be distinguished from naive T cells based on differential expression of isoforms of the tyrosine phosphatase CD 45. It has been suggested that memory CD 4 + T cells from infected individuals have a greater virus burden than naive CD 4 + T cells and that this accounts for the loss of recall responses in infected individuals. However, it has been unclear whether naive and memory T cells are equally susceptible to infection and to the <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects</b> of the virus. We therefore infected highly purified resting naive and memory CD 4 + T cells from HIV- 1 -seronegative individuals with HIV- 1 (LAI). Infected cells were then stimulated with phytohemagglutinin to render them permissive for viral replication. Cell viability and growth rate were monitored for 8 to 10 days as indicators of <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects</b> induced by HIV- 1 (LAI). Our results indicated that naive and memory CD 4 + T cells display marked differences in susceptibility to the <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects</b> induced by HIV- 1 (LAI), infection. The <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects</b> induced by HIV- 1 (LAI) were much more severe in memory CD 4 + T cells than in naive CD 4 + T cells. Differential <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects</b> in naive and memory T cells were not due to differences in virus entry into and replication in these cell populations. Rather, memory cells were more susceptible to <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects.</b> Pronounced <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects</b> in memory cells were clearly detectable at 7 day postinfection. Cell death occurred at the single-cell level and was not accompanied by syncytium formation. The growth rate of infected memory CD 4 + T cells was also severely compromised compared to that of naive CD 4 + T cells, whereas the growth rates of both uninfected naive and memory CD 4 + T cells were approximately the same. At least a portion of the dying cells exhibited biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis. These results suggest that the selective functional defects present in the memory CD 4 + T-cell subset of HIV- 1 -infected individuals may in part be the result of the greater susceptibility of memory T cells to <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects</b> induced by HIV- 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} {{communication}} (I) {{it was pointed}} out that multiplication of viruses to high titer does not always lead to <b>cytopathic</b> <b>effects.</b> Hence the changes in nucleic acid and protein metabolism associated with virus replication are not necessarily damaging to host cells.
