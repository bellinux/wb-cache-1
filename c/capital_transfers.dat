5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in <b>capital</b> <b>transfers.</b> During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E

International factor movements occur in three ways: immigration/emigration, <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> through international borrowing and lending, and foreign direct investment.

50|$|The Saar Mark was a {{currency}} issued on 16 June 1947 by the French government {{for use in}} Saar. It was at par with the German Reichsmark, and composed of six denominations of banknotes, 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 Mark. The aim of its introduction was to prepare an economic union of the Saar with France.

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} growing {{investment}} effort, which included <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> {{to the public}} enterprises, government expenditure patterns since the revolution reflected rapid expansion {{in the number of}} civil servants and pressure to redistribute income, mainly through current transfers and subsidies, as well as burgeoning interest obligations. The category [...] "current transfers" [...] nearly tripled its share of GDP between 1973 and 1990, from under 5 percent to 13.4 percent, reflecting the explosive growth of the social security system, both with respect to the number of persons covered and the upgrading of benefits. Escalating interest payments on the public debt, from less than half a percent of GDP in 1973 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1990, were the result of both a rise in the debt itself and higher real effective interest rates.|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the desirability of implementing of a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax in South Africa. The implementation of a <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax system in South Africa should generate additional income without placing a further administrative or financial burden on the South African Revenue Services. A system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax will replace the current system of donation tax and estate duty in South Africa. Any new system will be based on the principles established by these two forms of taxation, but should simultaneously address many of the loopholes in these two systems. Since the Margo Commission's recommendation in 1986 that South Africa should implement a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax, much has been written about this form of capital tax but the government has never implemented the recommendations. However, it is certain that a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax will be implemented in South Africa in the future. The current system of donation tax and estate duty is not effective in levying the taxes and earning the income for the government for which it was originally designed. Over the years numerous ways have been developed to legally avoid these taxes, which is why they are referred to as voluntary taxes (Anon, 1988 : 17). This dissertation consists of three parts: The first part is a literature study in which capital taxes are discussed. The distinction between income and capital is reviewed. The various forms of capital taxes are identified and the arguments for and against introducing one of them are discussed. This part concludes with arguments for and against a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax for South Africa. The second part is an analysis of donation tax and estate duty as currently levied in South Africa. The shortcomings of the current legislation are discussed and legal ways to avoid estate duty are identified. The inheritance tax system in the UK and the donation tax and estate duty system in the USA are also briefly discussed. The anti-avoidance measures implemented in these countries are discussed in some detail in view of recommendations to implement similar measures in South Africa. In the third part a <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax system for South Africa is proposed. Precautions to minimise the avoidance of these taxes through interest-free loans and generation-skipping devises are discussed. Finally a conclusion is reached regarding the matters analysed in this dissertation...|$|R

5000|$|Beyond {{military}} measures, {{the official}} Portuguese {{response to the}} [...] "winds of change" [...] in the African colonies was to integrate them administratively and economically more closely with the mainland. This was accomplished through population and <b>capital</b> <b>transfers,</b> trade liberalization, {{and the creation of}} a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the Overseas Province of Angola and Mozambique, boomed.|$|E

As the ESM lending capacity depends {{on the amount of}} paid-in capital, it will start out only to be €200bn in Q4-2012, and then be increased with €100bn each time one of the remaining three <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> ticks in. If needed, a majority of the ESM board can also decide to accelerate the payment schedule. On 1 May 2013, ESM has reconfirmed the schedule for receiving paid-in capital, with the third tranch already received in April 2013 followed by the fourth in October 2013, with the final fifth tranch scheduled for April 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study in school finance {{was to examine the}} relationship between <b>transferred</b> <b>capital</b> funds and budgeting practices for select public school districts in Arizona. Three major research questions were derived to examine public school fiscal management relative to budgeting efficiency, lapsing and depletion funds. The three research questions are as follows: (1) What variables can identify and are likely to maximally contribute to school districts' budget expenditures falling within a plus/minus 2 % range of the adopted budget? (2) What factors would be maximally associated with school districts having either a credit or deficit ending fund balance in the general operations budget? (3) What variables are likely to maximally contribute to school districts budgeting practices leading to increased or decreased capital levy fund balance? A systematic stratified sample of 31 school districts constituted the study group. Discriminant Function Analysis was used in the statistical treatment of 11 discriminant variables for six budget classifications. Each hypothesis was rejected at the. 01 level of significance. <b>Capital</b> <b>Transfer</b> Funds indicated maximum contribution in differentiating school budget groups which were within the plus/minus 2 % range of the adopted budget.
