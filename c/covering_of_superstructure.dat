50|$|The Grubenhaus {{was erected}} over a {{rectangular}} pit, {{ranging in size}} from four square meters to twenty-five square meters of floor area. During the 6th and 7th centuries the sunken buildings east and south of the Carpathians, were under 15 square meters in floor surface.The experiments of the Archeological Open-Air Museum in Březno near Louny have reconstructed the living and temperature conditions in the dug houses.The building experiment consisted of two houses, which were exact replicas of two sunken buildings excavated on the site, one of the late sixth or early seventh century, the other of the ninth. The sixth- to seventh-century feature was relatively large (4.20 x 4.60 m) and deep (80 cm under the original ground). The excavation of the rectangular pit represented some ﬁfteen cubic meters of earth. The excavation, as well as other, more complex, operations, such as binding horizontal sticks on the truss or felling and transport of trees, required a minimum of two persons. The building of the house took 860 hours, which included the felling of trees for rafters and the overall preparation of the wood. Building the actual house required 2.2 cubic meters of wood (ash, oak, and beech). In itself, the superstructure swallowed two cubic meters of wood. Three to four cubic meters of clay were necessary for daubing the walls and reeds harvested from some 1,000 square meters, for the <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure.</b> Assuming sixty to seventy working hours per week and a lot more experience and skills for the early medieval builders, the house may have been built in three to four weeks.59 -Florin Curta.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Otosclerosis is {{a disease}} that causes bone {{resorption}} and deposition in the auditory structures, leading to deafness. Many studies have evaluated the histopathology of the stapes footplate in this disease (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, vascular proliferation, fibroblasts, and histiocytes), but we found no studies in the literature involving the histology <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> the stapes. Objectives To perform an analysis under optical microscopy of histopathologic findings <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> the stapes from patients with otosclerosis. Methods A contemporary cross-sectional cohort study of pathology analysis <b>of</b> <b>superstructures</b> <b>of</b> the stapes of patients with otosclerosis. Results Fifteen <b>superstructures</b> <b>of</b> stapes in patients with otosclerosis operated in our service and four stapes of cadavers used for dissection (controls) were evaluated. No areas of bone resorption or deposition or presence of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> the stapes were found. However, we found in themore distal portions of the crura areas with prominent cementitious lines and woven bone, which was different than the mature trabecular bone found in {{the head of the}} stapes or in the controls.

40|$|<b>Superstructure</b> <b>of</b> a RO-RO ship {{plays an}} {{important}} role to allocate things inside the ship, for instance passengers, cars, goods and so on. <b>Superstructure</b> consists <b>of</b> transversal and longitudinal deck beam to support the structure. It is well known that the superstructure has significant contribution to the longitudinal strength. The investigation <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> a RO-RO ship particularly its influence to longitudinal strength is very limited. In addition, this influence is not clearly explained in the regulation for the structural strength under longitudinal bending. In conjunction with this, the influence <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> is therefore must be considered. To investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> on the longitudinal strength of RO-RO ship, the Smith???s method implemented into Beam-HULLST is applied and the formulation in Beam-HULLST is based on the thin-walled beam theory.

40|$|The role <b>of</b> <b>superstructure</b> {{finiteness}} {{in improving}} the peak directivity and the directivity bandwidth (DBW) of electromagnetic band gap (EBG) resonator antennas (ERAs) is studied. Simple one- and two-layer <b>superstructures</b> consisting <b>of</b> unprinted dielectric slabs are used for this purpose. In the latter case, each dielectric slab is truncated individually to improve the ERA performance. Initially, existing analytical models that only {{take into account the}} reflection characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> are used to predict the peak obtainable directivity and the directivity bandwidth. Detailed numerical studies are then conducted to observe the validity of these analytical predictions and to study the ERA performance for various finite sizes <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure.</b> It is found that DBW as well as the peak directivity of the antenna is strongly influenced by the size <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure.</b> Moreover, in case <b>of</b> two-layer <b>superstructures,</b> carefully designing each layer to have a different finite size improved the DBW product of an ERA by more than 65 %.
