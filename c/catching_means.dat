40|$|Abstract — Most {{industrial}} robots nowadays still employ strategies that neglect or minimize {{the effects of}} task dynamics. Some tasks, however, are intrinsically dynamic and can only be accomplished by considering their dynamic aspects. We address ball catching as a prominent and widely studied example for such a task. The paper follows a special approach to accomplish the task: the nonprehensile <b>catching,</b> which <b>means</b> <b>catching</b> without a form- or force-closure grasp. Depending on the tracked ball velocity, two different catching methods are proposed: First, catching of the ball during the initial contact. Second, catching the ball after an initial rebounce during the subsequent contact. For both approaches, the ball trajectory is predicted with a recursive least squares algorithm. The dynamic manipulability measure {{is used for the}} contact point selection. Once a permanent contact between ball and end effector is established, a balancing control based on force/torque feedback is applied. Both methods are experimentally validated using a six DoF industrial robot...|$|R

This paper discusses the endeavor between Pennsylvania State University Wilkes-Barre and a class of students in a telecommunications program at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Ghana.

According to Bazin, a moving camera is the essence of filmmaking: “It should not cut up reality, but rather it should show reality in its temporal continuity.” Single Shot Cinema in documentary <b>means</b> <b>catching</b> real life moments while they are happening in one continuous shot with a camera that is moving around the subject. As a result, shots are not edited from one still moment to the next, but rather from one camera movement to the next. In practice this means that the camera movement must have a dramatic purpose. Ideally all footage shot should be usable for editing. In order to accomplish this, the filmmaker should always keep the center of attention within the camera frame.Bazin {{goes on to say that}} the camera must be equally prepared to move as to remain still. He describes camera movement in Italian Neorealism as having a human quality, as a projection of the hand and the eye, almost like a living part of the operator flowing directly from his awareness.|$|R

Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) describes the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions. Fishing at MSY levels <b>means</b> <b>catching</b> the maximum proportion of a fish stock, that can safely {{be removed from the}} stock while, at the same time, maintaining its capacity to produce sustainable returns, in the long term. In the case of a small stock, the annual yield potential is limited because there are too few adult fish producing too few young fish that can contribute to the renewal of the stock concerned. At the same time, when a fish stock is too large, the annual reproduction is low and growth slows down due to lack of food and the production of younger fish may decrease due to competition between them. Between these extremes is a stock size at which the sustainable catch is at the highest practicable level. This is the stock size that can produce the maximum sustainable yield...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{continuously}} harvest citrus fruit using on-going harvesting machines such as canopy shakers, the catching system should catch and collect fruits continuously. In this thesis, three concepts were explored for a catching system {{appropriate for the}} canopy harvesting system. The first concept is a brush catching concept applied to low profile catching systems. Strip brush brooms were mounted {{at the end of}} collecting beds to make seals around tree trunk and along the narrow space between trees. The strip brush brooms used in this project were originally manufactured for street sweeping vehicles. Each brush could tilt from 30 degrees up to 45 degrees using an electrical linear actuator. The second concept is to adjust catching unit to an irregular tree row using tree position measured by range sensor. Brush catching units are moved laterally using actuators controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC). As the tree approaches the front of catching system, its distance is measured by range sensor. An output signal from range sensor is filtered and modulated as continuous step signal. Based on this data, brush catching units can move to accommodate tree misalignment within the row. The last concept is a kind of selective catching concept. This concept was not fully completed in this project. It required two procedures to execute; 1) skip catching mode using actuators; and 2) identifying sensing for immature or diseased trees. The first required procedure could be solved by making enough space between brush catching units for the rejected tree to pass through without catching fruits. Actuating times for skipping mode were studied and preset to PLC. Otherwise, the maturity of trees can be determined using a DGPS based tree fruit harvest selection map. A timer-based method was used to order the trees for selective rejection of immature trees in this study. The efficiency of this catching system was measured in terms of collecting rate and skipping rate under the simulated <b>catching</b> environment. <b>Mean</b> percentage in <b>catching</b> tennis balls (substituted for fruits) was reported as 98. 55 %, while the effectiveness for skipping immature fruits was 68 %...|$|R

The success in productivity increasing depends on degree of competition and restructuring processes in industry. After period of transition Russia has reached own 1991 `s level of productivity (per worker) and per capita GDP in 2004 and 2005 - 2006 years respectively.

In contrast to previous works analysis captures dy-namics of wider country grouping on more detailed industry level. Productivity is calculated as value added per hour worked for the following industries: agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (A+B), mining, electricity, gas and water supply (C+E), manufacturing (D), construction (F), wholesale and re-tail trade, hotels and restaurants (G+H), transport (I) and others (J-P). 	After period of transition Russia has reached own 1991 `s level of productivity (per worker) and per capita GDP in 2004 and 2005 - 2006 years respectively. But if we measure Russia`s productivity or per capita GDP in terms of US levels, the question of reaching 1991 level has no unequivocal answer. It depends on preferred estimation methodology of catching up development, more precisely, on way of converting productivity and per capita GDP to common currency: use general accepted constant prices and constant PPP methodology (as in ((Maddison, 1995) and OECD, BLS USA, PWT calculations), or use current (benchmark) PPPs (WB data) to asses relative (to US) performance of Russia. 	Reasons of faster per capita GDP growth comparing to labor productivity in Russia in 2000 s are explained. 	In 2008 productivity (per hour) gap between Russia and US was approximately threefold, com-paring with European countries – twofold.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the risk factors associated with allergic sensitisation and various asthma phenotypes in poultry workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 230 currently employed poultry workers used a modified ECRHS questionnaire, spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, Phadiatop and ImmunoCAP for specific IgE to poultry farming associated allergens (chicken meat, feathers, serum protein, droppings, sunflower seeds, storage mite) and mould mix to investigate workrelated asthma. Results: The mean dust particulate concentration (geometric mean (GM) = 11. 04 mg/m³) was highest in the rearing department while mean (1 - 3) -ß-D-glucan (GM= 148 ng/ m³) and endotoxin levels (GM= 2298 EU/m³) were highest in the <b>catching</b> department. Worker's <b>mean</b> age was 37 ± 9 years, 68 % were male, 43 % current smokers, 34 % atopic and 5 % casual workers. The prevalence of non-atopic asthma (NAA= 10 %) was higher than atopic asthma (AA= 6 %) or probable occupational asthma (OA= 5 %). Sensitisation to at least one poultry work related allergen was 24 %, with sunflower seed and storage mite sensitisation being the most prevalent (13 %). In multivariate adjusted models, workers sensitised to chicken specific allergens were more likely to be atopic (OR= 20. 9, 95 % CI: 4. 7 - 93. 2) or have casual job status (OR= 6. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 35. 9). Workers with work-related chest symptoms were more likely to work in the rearing department (OR= 3. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 8. 3) and to report episodes of high gas/dust/fume exposures causing asthma symptoms (OR= 4. 8, 95 %CI: 2. 4 - 9. 6). Reversible obstructive airway obstruction was more strongly associated with employment in small broiler farms (OR= 11. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 129. 0) as well as casual work (OR= 6. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 28. 0). Furthermore, NAA was strongly associated with casual work (OR= 5. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 19. 0) as well as working in the automated egg laying system (OR= 8. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 68. 6). Further analysis revealed that the proportion of workers sensitised to at least one poultry work related allergen declined with increasing years of service (chi-square trend p= 0. 023), with workers having 6 years employment (OR= 4. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 13. 8). Conclusion: Non-atopic asthma is the most common asthma phenotype among poultry workers with work in the rearing department demonstrating an increased respiratory risk. The increased risk of reversible airway obstruction among workers in small broiler farms and the declining prevalence of sensitisation with increasing employment duration suggests a healthy worker effect. Preventive measures, including appropriate training, are recommended to reduce respiratory health risks, particularly in novice workers...|$|R
40|$|From Introduction] Urbanisation in sub-Saharan Africa: {{changing}} {{the locus of}} poverty. Urbanisation is a global phenomenon that is {{changing the}} face of the Earth, as well as how people earn a living and secure their livelihoods. In 2006 the number of urban people in the world surpassed the number of rural people, and this gap will continue to grow. In only 16 years (by 2030) just under two-thirds of the world's people will be urban dwellers. Whilst most of the developed world and large parts of Latin America already have more than threequarters of their populations living in cities and towns, most countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are still <b>catching</b> up. This <b>means</b> that they are experiencing massive migrations from rural to urban areas as rural people wish to swap the insecurities of rural living for the allure of secure employment and better services for health, education, sanitation and transport in towns and cities. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the most rapidly urbanising region of the globe. According to UN-Habitat, in 1990, only 28 % of the region's inhabitants lived in towns and cities; that increased to approximately 32 % in 2001 and 41 % in 2010. The size of the urban population is likely to surpass the rural one around 2025. Contrary to popular belief, most urban residents in SSA (and globally) live in small towns rather than massive megacities; with just over half living in towns of less than 200, 000 people and 78 % living in towns of less than 500, 000 residents. Only 14 % of urban dwellers live in cities of more than one million people. Many new urban households maintain strong links to relatives and clans in rural areas, with circular migration patterns emerging as the urban transition takes place over several decades. The implications of this extremely rapid urbanisation in SSA countries for livelihoods and poverty are widely debated. UN-Habitat highlights a relatively unique aspect of urbanisation in SSA as being the accompanying high rate of growth in informal settlements or slums. In other words, not all rural migrants to towns and cities find secure incomes or shelter. Some slum areas have become permanent features where inter-generational poverty is reproduced. Although urban areas are producing an increasing share of national wealth in SSA countries, some argue that slowly the nexus of poverty is shifting towards urban areas. Rates of poverty are high in rural areas of SSA, but migration and internal population growth means that in some countries the number of urban poor almost matches the number of rural poor, and it is likely to grow. The informal economy contributes an average of 40 – 45 % of total urban GDP, which is higher than any other region of the world...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing seemed {{practicable}} {{with these}} uncouth, distrustful beings, and the Captain therefore {{went on in}} search of a tribe of Patagonians, among which, he was told, was a Creole Spaniard named San Leon, who had acquired great influence by his reckless courage and daring, and through whom {{it might be possible to}} have some communication with them. The camp of these people on the main continent, near Cape Gregory, was discovered newly deserted, with hollow places in the ground where fires had been made, and many marks of footsteps. This extreme point of the continent was by no means so dreary as the Land of Fire; it bore thorny bushes ten feet high, wild celery and clover, and cranberry-bushes covered with red berries. Indeed, the Patagonians--so called because their big splay boots made Magelhaen conclude they walked on patas (paws), like bears--are a superior race to the Fuegians, larger in stature than most Europeans, great riders, and clever in <b>catching</b> guanacos by <b>means</b> of bolas, i.e. two round stones attached to a string. If the Fuegians are Antarctic Esquimaux, the Patagonians are Antarctic Tartars, leading a wandering life under tents made of skins of horses and guanacos, and hating all settled habits, but not so utterly inhospitable and impracticable as their neighbours beyond the Strait. In truth, the division is not clearly marked, for there are Fuegians on the continent and Patagonians in the islands. Ascending a height, the Captain took a survey of the country, and, seeing two wreaths of smoke near Oazy Harbour, sailed in, cast anchor, and in the morning was visited by the natives of their own accord, after which he returned with them to their camp, consisting of horse-hide tents, semicircular in form, and entirely open. They were full of men, women, and children, and among them San Leon, to whom it was possible to talk in Spanish, and indeed several natives, from intercourse with ships, knew a few words of English. San Leon had been with the tribe for twelve years, and said that American missionaries had visited them, but that they had gone away because the Fuegians who crossed the Strait were such thieves that they ate up their provisions and cut up their books. However, no objection was made to Gardiner's remaining, so he set up a tarred canvas tent, closed at each end with bullock-hides, and slept on shore, a good deal disturbed by the dogs, who gnawed at the bullock-hides, till a coat of tar laid over them prevented them. Not so, however, with another visitor, a huge Patagonian, who walked in with the words, [...] "I go sleep," [...] and leisurely coiled himself up for the purpose, unheeding Johnstone's discourse; but the Captain, pointing with his finger, and emphatically saying [...] "Go," [...] produced the desired effect. Then followed the erection of seventeen skin tents, all in a row, set up by the women. These Patagonians behaved well and quietly; but, in the meantime, the master of the schooner had asked San Leon to obtain some guanaco meat for the crew, and the natives who went in search of the animals insisted on being paid, though they had caught nothing. These however were Fuegians, and the Patagonians were very angry with them. Captain Gardiner even ventured to remain alone with Johnstone among this people, while San Leon went on to Port Famine in the Montgomery, which was in search of wood; but, in the meantime, he could do nothing but hold a little monosyllabic communication; and once, when he and his servant both went out at the same time, they lost their dinner, which, left to simmer over the fire, proved irresistible to the Patagonians. They, however, differed from the Fuegians in not ordinarily being thieves.|$|R
40|$| {{standardised}} form {{of writing}} (including writings {{stuck on the}} phenomenon of diasporas), but rather {{in the category of}} nuances, of hesitant steps, doubts reinstated by certain poetic or literary texts exhorting us to evoke a condition of survival linking a particular report to space-time, vacillating in the present, and whose written output perpetuates the very condition in question. We stress the idea of a 'repertory of practices' that form the body of the 'assets' of belonging, that is, a structure of action. At the same time, this repertory delineates an economy of language that avoids the tone of institutional doctrines, unconventional, subversive forms that resist all efforts at ideological or normative translation. The study of writings on violence is distributed over a broad spectrum; the texts are often characterised by their subordinate status in comparison to writings based on academic learning: reactive texts developed by organic intellectuals, between scholarly and political texts, oral testimonies, personal diaries, literary essays, family memoirs, psychoanalytical studies, aesthetic creations, poetic writings, epistolary exchanges, texts translated from one language to another. The writings of Charlotte Delbo, of Georges Pérec, through selected extracts, are not motivated by a cathartic literary intention, but by an impossibility, the impossibility of adhering to "this institution of bearing witness", and summon up voices, prolonging the existence of the "body" of the people, plunge into the ever-present indescribable and un-representable, approach the edges of the void and of the strangeness contained in a vaporisation of the subject that can no longer connect to the "other", where nothing now "holds the subject" anymore, and connecting at many points with my own journey as a subject placed at the crossroads of catastrophes that have occurred, unable to localise the place of a vague and intrusive anxiety. A place of extreme exile, a place where one is "beside oneself", a place of the crushing of the possibility of symbolising life and death. Distraction, loss of boundaries, wanderings in exile where points of departure and points of arrival cancel each other out. "Sewing the Fragments Back Together" is a project of reconfiguration of what cannot be expressed, and this has necessitated other methodological supports than the translation of denial by certain historians of the Armenian genocide whose colossal work around the search for proof and the historic meaning through archives has contributed to bringing to light a mechanism of negation, a historiographic perversion that makes use of the processes of rationalisation, of relativising and of trivialising, to refute the factor of intentionality {{at the heart of the}} genocidal principle, and produce, according to Richard Hovanissian, a hodgepodge of half-truths, of infinite circumlocutions that are infinitely more devastating than total negation. As an anthropologist, and returning by choice to my early literary training, making use of the particular sensibility that is developed after a long experience of psychoanalysis as an analyst, I have favoured the nomadic and perceptible ('felt') forms of exile, without in any way wishing to prove something, and I threw myself into the work of subjectivation, that of the process that calls for the maturation of the subject. I think it is necessary to free oneself from the injunction to 'prove' something, the order of the torturer, some would say, in the search for ultimate proof, a sort of tyranny set in motion by the actors of political power, the language of domination in which the status of the victim is transformed into a teary plaint, de-politicised to "make room" for polysemous subjectivisms, narrations, evocations. To leave the discourse of historic proof of the annihilation and of self-justification, and allow myself to move to a form of writing in which denial has struck me in my own autobiographical trajectory, my family novel, my researcher's journey, and whose seams I am attempting to sew. "Letting oneself go" <b>means</b> <b>catching</b> a glimpse of the freedom of the subject, allowing the subject to catch up with himself as he takes off his chains and frees himself from alienation in and through this crossing over. Leaving the context of proof as an element in a process of establishing a scientific reality that would provide support for a procedure of authentification and an imperative of veracity. Allowing oneself to be carried by the threads of the disconnection (narrative anthropology, poetic metaphor). In this way, the terrain in this case concerns not only the presence in a geographical place or in a social unit for the present-day analysis of social relations, but involves a much more complex configuration. The terrain is also the breadth of the links and associations with other temporalities that the signifieds collected in an empirical space will help to achieve with other temporalities, calling for other supports, other crossing places, in order to form a mixed semiotic. Gérard Althabe, who was my thesis supervisor (1993), in his theory of the position of the researcher 'on the ground', already favored a heuristic approach, which advances by trial and error and in stages, inviting us to carry out the 'to-ing and fro-ing' and the links between levels which add up cumulatively or are superimposed in the interpretation of an act or an event, at several levels of resonances, on several scales. Not a blending, but a mixed semiotic in which exile as a total social reality calls for a superimposition of planes, of levels of interpretation, giving rise to the use of multiple supports, as we have said, in order to create a text, a body of literature, a web peopled with voices and phantoms, from which would surge dissociations, cleavages, dismantlings, splinters, cries and quests, as well as heroic struggles, and which at the same time would offer a way [...] perhaps an aesthetic and utopian way [...] of seeing foreclosure as a reality in the past. Obviously the issue of the relationship of the researcher to his object is raised in the haunting question of distance and nearness, of "too much attachment" to the object, which could distort the way of seeing, or else contribute to an "ethnicisation", a reification, that would confuse the understanding of one's purpose. This would be to misunderstand the direction of my approach: not to formulate truths of the order of the propaganda discourse of a group, but to address a philosophical question: "How and why write about 'a devastation' " of a collective magnitude that has affected far more than the subjectivity of the researcher, obliging him/her to carry out the restoration of something unimagineable. There must be great constraint in this exercise, in my case not the constraint of the literature associated with the pleasure of the un-linking, but that of an existential pressure to glue the fragments back together, to sew them together, to fill in, not to repair or bring about recognition, but to reconnect with a dimension of the "normally alive". And at this point, psychoanalysis introduces a considerable theoretical contribution that works on dissociations, impossible means of access to the ordinary extended memory, in the sense of a diversionary release mechanism. I think of the work of the psychoanalyst Anne Lise Stern, a student of Lacan's, in her book Le Savoir Déporté after Auschwitz, in which the writing constructs the conditions of her release. On the contrary, I wish to say, that sort of proximity with the object, instead of being a place of enclosure, opens up the horizon, a sort of "unconscious of the text", distinct from that of both author and reader which, as Julia Kristeva, psychoanalyst and semiotician, specifies, opens towards "scenes of representations, of modalities, of psychic inscriptions, traces, marks, distinctiveness", breaches as well, which in my view are opposed to the smooth writing of the dissertation that slides over the signifier. What can we say of this 'engaged' [...] committed [...] writing that has been emphasised, and of my position as a 'committed' researcher? If we speak of 'engaged' literature in work about subjectivisms that reconsider the weight of a historiographical perversion, questioning again a dynamic of impunity, asking again the why of the genocide "without reason", then at this point I affirm that my writing is 'committed'. But if instead of that, one 'ethnicises'a cause, I would agree that it is a question of a return of perversion, in which 'commitment' becomes militancy, in the sense that the researcher becomes the mouthpiece of a community. Ethnocentrism in researchers has often been denounced, whether they be historians or others, who attempt to show the mechanism of perversion at work in the Armenian genocide of 1915 and its denial. Just as the leaders of the CUP (Ittihad or Committee of Union and Progress) used the shameful nationalist argumentation with respect to the Armenians and in the context of the First World War to justify the mass massacres that international law has difficulty qualifying as genocide, as is shown by the elimination of Paragraph 30 in 1979 in the report on the question of the prevention and suppression of the crime of genocide in the sub-commission on Human Rights at the U. N., when this same commission, in 1974, had recognized the genocide of the Armenians as the first genocide of the Twentieth Century. The stakes in the definition remain highly topical, and certain politicians prefer to evoke the expression 'incomparable atrocities' rather than use the term 'genocide'. I hope that this work in a meandering style that I claim as my own, conscious of complexity and the spiral, will contribute to restoring, under my pen, the substance of an unspeakable reconfiguring, in which denial has produced this type of knowledge, a body of writing, a notion that I and Maryse Tripier, as she accompanied me in this arduous labour, have attempted to theorise. Martine Hovanessian Résumé HDR " Traversée de lieux exilés : recoudre les fragments " 29 avril 2009 Ce mémoire souhaiterait contribuer au déploiement d'un paysage d'une intériorité tourmentée sous bien des aspects et que l'on ne peut imaginer si l'on s'applique au strict exercice monographique. Il s'agit d'une aventure apparentée à " une anthropologie des coins et des recoins " où je me propose de cerner l'enjeu structurel du fragment dans l'ordre des identités discontinues nées d'un déni, dont le support concerne le génocide des Arméniens perpétré en 1915 mais que j'élargis dans la comparaison avec la Shoah. La question philosophique et anthropologique " comment et pourquoi " écrire sur la destruction répondent à une immense contrainte, celle de la dette mais à travers cette réparation se dessine la réinvention d'un ordre du " normalement vivant ". Les témoignages capturés sur de longues années condensent le sens de mon projet : élaborer des figures d'un exil extrême où le thème de la migration contrainte est une notion insuffisante pour traduire une condition " de l'homme jetable " élaboré par Fethi Benslama et qui dans le cas d'une destruction collective, d'une violence d'Etat toujours non reconnue continue à " agir clandestinement " (Altounian) dans l'élaboration d'une position générationnelle (la transmission) à partir d'une scission radicale, sur un trou béant. Les expériences d'un effondrement qui hantent les imaginaires, souvent en manque de traduction possible, ont nécessité de traverser d'autres lieux que ceux de l'énonciation orale. Nous avons observé des lieux de la territorialisation représentant des lieux de " la communauté " autour d'une volonté de rétablir " une pensée du territoire ", un principe organisationnel, une culture matérielle, une addition de symboles, puis analysé un imaginaire nati...|$|R
