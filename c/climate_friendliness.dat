40|$|This paper {{complements}} {{previous work}} on the economics of different energy resources by examining the growth potential of alternative electricity supply infrastructures as constrained by innate physical limits. Coal-fired generation meets the criteria of longevity (abundance of energy source) and scalability (effective capability to expand to the multi-terawatt level) which are critical for a sustainable energy supply chain, but it carries a very heavy carbon footprint. Renewables and nuclear power meet both the longevity and <b>climate</b> <b>friendliness</b> criteria. However, they vary {{in terms of their}} ability to deliver net energy at a scale needed for meeting a huge global energy demand. The low density of renewable resources for electricity generation and the current intermittency of many renewables limit their ability to achieve high rates of growth. And a significant global increase in nuclear power deployment could engender serious risks related to proliferation, safety, and waste disposal. Unlike renewable sources of energy, nuclear power is an unforgiving technology because human lapses and errors can have ecological and social impacts that are catastrophic and irreversible. The transition to a low carbon economy is likely to prove much more challenging than some optimists have claimed.

40|$|The {{district}} heating sector is challenged in its {{traditional way of}} doing business by buildings increasingly more energy efficient (with low heat demand for space heating). This paper reports on work of mapping out such challenges connected to passive houses in Sweden. It {{should be noted that the}} conditions might be different in different geographical areas. To gain <b>climate</b> <b>friendliness</b> in the building sector a system perspective must be used both regarding energy and environmental issues. The levels of energy use in buildings in Sweden today and in the future are discussed together with marginal vs. average thinking regarding energy and heat production. From our findings we conclude that it is not necessarily so that electricity or natural gas should be the option of choice for hot water demand or peak loads that need to be externally covered also in energy efficient buildings. However, it will require active work by {{district heating}} companies to stay competitive. It will be increasingly important for district heating companies to communicate with their customers. It will also be important to identify new customers and new areas where heat can be utilized; the “district heating villa ” in Göteborg, Sweden is an example of investigating new possibilities of heat use. The study reported in this paper has identified a number of areas where further research and development is needed for district heating to improve the future market position of district heatin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCoffee {{production}} is impacting the climate by emitting greenhouse gasses. Coffee {{production is}} also vulnerable to climate change. As a consequence, the coffee sector {{is interested in}} climate-friendly forms of coffee production, {{but there is no}} consensus of what exactly this implies. Therefore, we studied two aspects of the climate impact of coffee production: the standing carbon stocks in the production systems and the product carbon footprint, which measures the greenhouse gas emissions per unit weight of coffee produced. We collected data from 116 coffee farms in five Latin American countries, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Colombia, for four coffee production systems: (1) traditional polycultures, (2) commercial polycultures, (3) shaded monocultures, and (4) unshaded monocultures. We found that polycultures have a lower mean carbon footprint, of 6. 2 – 7. 3  kg CO 2 -equivalent kg− 1 of parchment coffee, than monocultures, of 9. 0 – 10. 8  kg. We also found that traditional polycultures have much higher carbon stocks in the vegetation, of 42. 5  Mg per ha, than unshaded monocultures, of 10. 5  Mg. We designed a graphic system to classify production systems according to their <b>climate</b> <b>friendliness.</b> We identified several strategies to increase positive and reduce negative climate impacts of coffee production. Strategies include diversification of coffee farms with trees, the use of their wood to substitute for fossil fuel and energy-intensive building materials, the targeted use of fertilizer, and the use of dry or ecological processing methods for coffee instead of the traditional fully washed process...|$|E

40|$|Mr. Armstrong briefly {{explains}} {{how he got}} recruited {{from high school to}} play basketball for Coach Don Haskins; he explains that his desire to leave Missouri was to see {{a different part of the}} country; he describes the campus, <b>climate,</b> and <b>friendliness</b> of locals in El Paso and Texas Western College. Mr. Armstrong describes Don Haskins personality on and off the court as demanding but fair; he describes the 1965 - 66 team as very good and confident; he mentions how teams in the western U. S. did not receive the same coverage as eastern college teams at the time. Mr. Armstrong recounts how at the time he did not recognize the significance of an all-black starting lineup defeating the all-white line up from the University of Kentucky for the NCAA Championship; he notes other schools had black players but Texas Western was the first to have an all-black starting lineup. He states Don Haskins chose to start the black players due to them being the best players on the team in order to defeat Kentucky; he explains that Don Haskins molded the team together for years and that the players were very close to one another; he mentions that he saw no racism towards the black players nor experienced problems with them within the team. He describes that defense was the key to beating Kentucky including early steals in the first half by guard Bobby Joe Hill. Mr. Armstrong gives his opinion that publicity after the game as mostly positive, not personally witnessing any negative or racist backlash to their win...|$|R
40|$|Communities whose {{leadership}} and populace desire to increase bicycle friendliness sometimes seek {{recognition as a}} Bicycle Friendly Community (BFC). The most common tool used is from the League of American Bicyclists (LAB). Can this metric be used effectively to evaluate bicycle friendliness? If not, what changes would make a more effective metric? The reason for this examination {{is to ensure that}} communities, which receive BFC status from LAB and promote themselves as being bicycle friendly are being evaluated realistically, utilizing funds to ensure the best infrastructure for the needs of the community, and are genuinely bicycle friendly. If cities that desire to be bicycle friendly are able to call themselves bicycle friendly while not providing the right elements of bicycle friendliness in the right ways it can lessen the credibility of BFC designation from LAB and drive people away from looking at communities that are promoted as being bicycle friendly. The elements of bicycle infrastructure are explained along with the suggested uses for each example as suggested by national experts in alternative transportation infrastructure. A literature review is provided to explain the need for infrastructural elements to foster bicycle commuting. Economic impacts of bicycling for both transportation and recreation are explained. The role of culture, geographic size, topography, and <b>climate</b> on bicycle <b>friendliness</b> are also discussed. Recommendations for enhancement of the BFC metric are finally provided.

40|$|The {{situation}} in Karelia, a region in Northwest Russia, is analyzed {{in the context}} of forest energy. The annual potential energy available from wood harvesting is about 7 tera watt hours (TWh) (3. 6 million m 3), which is equal to the total need of Karelia in energy for municipal heating. We point out that the contribution to the municipal economy, the moderate heating cost, the enhanced energy security in the cold Russian <b>climate,</b> the environmental <b>friendliness,</b> the better access to the forests and the utilization of the proven Nordic forest energy solutions (NFES) might have important consequences for strategy-making processes in forest energy development. For this purpose, connecting Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with SWOT (internal strengths (S) or weaknesses (W) and external opportunities (O) or threats (T)) analysis is proposed to identify local operational strategies and assign priorities. Major threats include lack of government support, an insufficient road network, the dominance of extensive forest management, gasification and financial indiscipline. Analysis indicates that NFES are viewed positively for the Russian conditions. The forest biomass market has virtually unlimited opportunities for growth. Together, with the transition to intensive forest management, favorable policy in terms of forestry development programs can support bioenergy development. The advantageous location of existing power plants next to forests, increasing fossil fuel prices, the improvement of the road network and the availability of new technology are seen as potential opportunities for NFES. However, the results also indicate that there is substantial uncertainty and skepticism concerning how such markets benefit forest leaseholders who would like to adopt forest energy. The lack of bioenergy technology development, high transportation cost, low awareness of NFES, high demands for roads, the requirement for skilled specialists and wood fuel quality are the main weaknesses regarding the transfer of NFES to Karelia...|$|R
