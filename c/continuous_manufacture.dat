40|$|Biopolymer microgels {{produced}} in microfluidic devices via {{the formation of}} a water-in-oil emulsion are usually collected at the outlet of the device and thoroughly washed from the oil phase in an additional, lengthy processing step. This paper reports a microfluidic-based method which allows for <b>continuous</b> on-chip <b>manufacture</b> of aqueous-based biopolymer microparticles in an oily continuous phase and thereafter the transfer of these particles from the oily carrier phase to a second aqueous continuous phase. This was achieved by surface patterning the PDMS channel walls using UV polymerization of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) in order to obtain a hybrid device with distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic sections. The surface patterning was stable for at least 4 months. This selective surface patterning of the channel was shown to initiate and assist the transfer of the biopolymer particles from the oil phase into the aqueous phase. The flow conditions required for a stable biphasic flow in the transfer section of the device were evaluated based on the theoretical shear stress at the interface of the two fluids. Experimental outcomes were found to be in good agreement with the prediction. After the particles cross the liquid-liquid interface and are transferred into the aqueous phase, they are collected and characterized. The resulting suspension was found to be stable for several weeks and no aggregation was observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{operating}} conditions of three continuous high shear granulators on the internal structure and strength of granules has been investigated {{and the possibility of}} seeded granulation has been explored. In a recently concluded programme of research on the scale-up of a high shear granulator, Cyclomix (manufactured by Hosokawa Micron B. V., The Netherlands), a novel method of granulation called seeded granulation was introduced, where each granule contained, at its core, a large particle from the upper tail end of the feed particle size distribution. Seeded granulation is particularly useful for process control of continuous granulators as there is the potential to control granulation by the flow rate of the seed particles. Hence, the performance of three different types of continuous granulators in terms of granule strength and structure has been evaluated here; these are Extrudomix, Modulomix (manufactured by Hosokawa Micron, UK and The Netherlands, respectively) and the Nica M 6 Turbine <b>continuous</b> granulator (<b>manufactured</b> by GEA, UK). Calcium carbonate (Durcal 65) powder was granulated using an aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as binder in the same ratio as used previously in our batch granulation, to allow comparison between the continuous and batch processes. The crushing strength was characterised by quasi-static side crushing between two platens using a mechanical testing machine. The internal structure and morphology were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and the extent of seeding quantified. Granules produced in all the three continuous granulators were significantly weaker than those of the batch granulator tested previously. Among the continuous granulators only the Modulomix granulator produced some seeded granules. It is considered that longer residence time is necessary to produce seeded granules...|$|R

40|$|Complex nanostructured {{materials}} have {{great potential for}} applications {{in many areas of}} nanotechnology. This potential is being unlocked by precise control of their nanoscale architecture and properties. Most current methods of creating these nanostructures are expensive and difficult to control, with the majority of techniques resulting in non-continuous nanostructures and nanoparticles. Electrospinning is an economic nanomanufacturing method resulting in continuous nanofibers. The method consists of spinning fiber-forming liquids in high electric fields. In this work, a modified electrospinning process was analyzed. The process utilized two concentric liquids that resulted in integrated continuous hollow or composite nanofibers. A new adjustable co-axial spinneret nozzle was developed to provide greater control of the nanomanufacturing process. The nozzle was used to <b>manufacture</b> <b>continuous</b> hollow one-dimensional (1 D) nanostructures from several materials.

Process parameters effecting nanofiber dimensions were identified and their effects were analyzed in extensive systematic parametric studies.

Integrated creation of more complex continuous 1 D nanostructures that have never been produced before was explored by further process modifications.
