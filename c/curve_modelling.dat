40|$|A new {{approach}} of estimating parameters in multivariate models is introduced. A fitting function will be used. The {{idea is to}} estimate parameters so that the fitting function equals or will be close to its expected value. The function will be decomposed into two parts. From one part, which will be independent of the mean parameters, the dispersion matrix is estimated. This estimator is inserted {{in the second part}} which then yields the estimators of the mean parameters. The Growth <b>Curve</b> <b>model,</b> extended Growth <b>Curve</b> <b>model</b> and a multivariate variance components model will illustrate the approach.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine how interrelated changes in child Big Five {{personality}} characteristics and overreactive parenting during the transition from late childhood to adolescence, predict adolescent adjustment problems. The sample included 290 children, aged 8 - 9 years initially, who were assessed three times during a period of six years. Information was obtained from both parents, teachers and the target child. Univariate latent growth <b>curve</b> <b>modelling</b> showed that mean level personality change did not reflect a development toward maturity, and mean levels of overreactive parenting were stable over time. Multivariate latent growth <b>curve</b> <b>modelling</b> showed that decreases in Benevolence and Emotional Stability were related to increases in overreactive parenting. Furthermore, decreases in Extraversion and Emotional Stability predicted internalizing problems, whereas decreases in Benevolence, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability predicted externalizing problems. Increases in overreactive parenting predicted externalizing, but not internalizing problems. The investigated associations were similar for boys and girls. The results indicate that changes in child personality are more important than changes in overreactive parenting in the prediction of adolescent adjustment problems...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} light curve analysis of publicly available V band observations of 62 binary stars, mostly contact binaries, {{obtained by the}} All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) - 3 project between 2000 and 2009. Eclipsing binaries are important astronomical targets for determining the physical parameters of component stars from the geometry. They provide an independent direct method of measuring the radii of stars. We improved the ASAS determined periods, ephemeris and obtained the Fourier parameters from the phased light curves of these 62 stars. These Fourier parameters were used for preliminary classification of the stars in our sample. The phased light curves were then analysed {{with the aid of}} the Wilson-Devinney light <b>curve</b> <b>modelling</b> technique in order to obtain various geometrical and physical parameters of these binaries. The spectroscopic mass ratios as determined from the the radial velocity measurements available in the literature were used as one of the inputs to the light <b>curve</b> <b>modelling.</b> Thus reliable estimations of parameters of these binaries were obtained with combined photometric and spectroscopic data and error estimates were made using the heuristic scan method.

40|$|Recent ultra-high {{precision}} {{observations of}} eclipsing binaries, especially data {{acquired by the}} Kepler satellite, have made accurate light <b>curve</b> <b>modelling</b> increasingly challenging but also more rewarding. In this contribution, we discuss low-amplitude signals in light curves that can now be used to derive physical information about eclipsing binaries but that were unaccessible before the Kepler era. A notable example is the detection of Doppler beaming, which leads {{to an increase in}} flux when a star moves towards the satellite and a decrease in flux when it moves away. Similarly, Rømer delays, or light travel time effects, also have to taken into account when modelling the supreme quality data that is now available. The detection of offsets between primary and secondary eclipse phases in binaries with extreme mass ratios, and the observation of Rømer delays in the signals of pulsators in binary stars, have allowed us to determine the orbits of several binaries without the need for spectroscopy. A third example of a small-scale effect that has {{to be taken into account}} when modelling specific binary systems, are lensing effects. A new binary light <b>curve</b> <b>modelling</b> code, PHOEBE 2. 0, that takes all these effect into account is currently being developed...|$|E

40|$|This study reviews {{a variety}} of growth <b>curve</b> <b>models</b> and the {{theoretical}} frameworks that lay behind them. In many systems, growth patterns are, or must, ultimately be subjected {{to some form of}} limitation. A number of <b>curve</b> <b>models</b> have been developed to describe and predict such behaviours. Symmetric growth curves have frequently been used for forecasting fossil fuel production, but others have expressed a need for more flexible and asymmetric models. A number of examples show differences and applications of various growth <b>curve</b> <b>models.</b> It is concluded that these growth <b>curve</b> <b>models</b> can be utilised as forecasting tools, but are do not necessarily provide better predictions than any other method. Consequently, growth <b>curve</b> <b>models</b> and other forecasting methods should be used together to provide a triangulated forecast. Furthermore, the growth curve methodology offers a simple tool for resource management to determine what might happen to future production if resource availability poses a problem. In the light of peak oil and the awareness of natural resources as a basis for the continued well-being of society and mankind, resource management should be an important factor in future social planning...|$|R

40|$|Curran and Bollen {{combined}} {{two models}} for longitudinal panel data: the latent growth <b>curve</b> <b>model</b> and the autoregressive model.

This {{is a different}} model than a latent growth <b>curve</b> <b>model</b> with autoregressive relationships between the distur-bances. However, when the autoregressive parameter ρ is invariant over time and lies between − 1 and 1, it can be shown that these models are algebraically equivalent. This result can be shown to generalize to the multivariate case. When the autoregressive parameters in the autoregressive latent trajectory model vary over time, the equivalence between the autoregressive latent trajectory model and a latent growth <b>curve</b> <b>model</b> with autoregressive disturbances no longer holds. However, a latent growth <b>curve</b> <b>model</b> with time-varying autoregressive parameters for the disturbances could be considered an interesting alternative to the autoregressive latent trajectory model with time-varying autoregressive parameters...|$|R
40|$|Evaluating overall {{model fit}} for growth <b>curve</b> <b>models</b> {{involves}} 3 challenging issues.

(b) Traditional work on fit from the {{structural equation modeling}} (SEM) perspective has focused only on the covariance structure, but growth <b>curve</b> <b>models</b> have four potential sources of misspecification: within-individual covariance matrix, between-individuals covariance matrix, marginal mean structure, and conditional mean structure.
