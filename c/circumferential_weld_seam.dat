40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above.

These capabilities can be improved by operating such transducers as phased array search units, consisting of many transducer elements. Each of the array elements is pulsed with the appropriate time delays, thus controlling the shape and the sound beam direction on a large scale. This study describes the design and optimization of a multi-mode T/R (transmit/receive) phased array search unit generating longitudinal, shear and subsurface longitudinal (’creeping’) waves. The elaborated design can be operated with 12 or 16 transducer elements generating multiple wave modes for certain inspection ranges.

Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength.

In this research, the occurrence of defects related to material flow inside the extrusion tooling is studied. In lab-scale experiments, EN AW- 6060 and EN AW- 6082 aluminium alloy billets are formed into strips {{by means of the}} direct hot extrusion process.

Particles size and shape were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and correlated with the optical spectra. Mechanical tensile tests have shown that the tensile strength of the laser <b>welding</b> <b>seams</b> are comparable to conventional <b>welding</b> <b>seams</b> made by thermal contact welding...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the welding process {{and the quality of}} the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are strongly influenced by the following parameters: special type of process gas, gas flow, configuration of the nozzle, flow rate, laser induced plasma. The gas flow and the influence of the plasma and the melt on the gas flow can only be partially defined by mathematical models of the laser light sheet method to describe the gas flow and the welding process qualitatively. Correlations between the gas flow, the welding process {{and the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are demonstrated. The aim is to get a deeper understanding of the welding process as well as to optimize the {{effectiveness of}} the process and the quality of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> by optimizing the gas flow with respect to the processing parameters...|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} effort between NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center and the Michoud Unit of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company was undertaken to demonstrate assembly of a large-scale aluminum tank using <b>circumferential</b> friction stir <b>welds.</b> The hardware used {{to complete this}} demonstration was fabricated as a study of near-net- shape technologies. The tooling used to complete this demonstration was originally designed for assembly of a tank using fusion weld processes. This presentation describes the modifications and additions that {{were made to the}} existing fusion welding tools required to accommodate <b>circumferential</b> friction stir <b>welding,</b> as well as the process used to assemble the tank. The tooling modifications include design, fabrication and installation of several components. The most significant components include a friction stir weld unit with adjustable pin length capabilities, a continuous internal anvil for 'open' <b>circumferential</b> <b>welds,</b> a continuous closeout anvil, clamping systems, an external reaction system and the control system required to conduct the friction stir welds and integrate the operation of the tool. The demonstration was intended as a development task. The experience gained during each <b>circumferential</b> <b>weld</b> was applied to improve subsequent welds. Both constant and tapered thickness 14 -foot diameter <b>circumferential</b> <b>welds</b> were successfully demonstrated...|$|R
