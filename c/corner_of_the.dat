5|$|The Black Stone is {{attached}} to the east <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kaaba, known as al-Rukn al-Aswad (the <b>Corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stone). Another stone, known as the Hajar as-Sa’adah (Stone of Felicity) is set into the Kaaba's opposite corner, al-Rukn al-Yamani (the Yemeni Corner), at a somewhat lower height than the Black Stone. The choice of the east corner may have had ritual significance; it faces the rain-bringing east wind (al-qabul) and the direction from which Canopus rises.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} Fort at Lahaina, {{facing the}} Lahaina Harbor, is now {{represented by a}} partial reconstruction at the southern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park. Lahaina Fort was demolished in 1854. However, in 1964, the State Parks Department reconstructed a part of old fort wall in the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park which was the venue for the 1961 feature film, The Devil at 4 O'Clock.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two {{going up to}} the northeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection of Grand and Chrystie Streets, and one {{going up to the}} northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street stairs to the northeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn neighborhoods to Manhattan's Chinatown—the third staircase to the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> book <b>of</b> Leviticus in <b>the</b> Torah makes mention <b>of</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, and prohibits <b>the</b> marring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beard, with {{particular}} emphasis on priests not marring <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beard; as with many other parts <b>of</b> Leviticus, <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Ezekiel describes different regulations, stating that the priests should not shave their heads, or let their locks grow long.|$|R
50|$|The cheek bulges, and {{the wide}} and deep {{depression}} below them, suggest a muscular arrangement associated with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, whereby {{it is possible for}} such an animal to pull <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth forwards as is characteristic of mammals, while in true reptiles <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth are fixed and very close to <b>the</b> articulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw. This is a significant arrangement, because even with a secondary palate an animal {{would not be able to}} suck unless <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth can be brought forward, allowing the mouth as a whole to close properly around <b>the</b> teat <b>of</b> a milk gland.|$|R

Black can either remove {{one of those two}} black pieces, or remove a black piece from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board.) <b>The</b> four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board will also consist of two black pieces and two white pieces that are diagonally opposite from each other.|$|R
5|$|A pseudo-Egyptian obelisk {{near the}} {{south-east}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish church, {{similar to one}} in Leigh, was probably built for Robert Vernon Atherton in 1781. It was restored in 1867 twelve years before the church was finished. It is a Grade II listed structure.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{pyramidal}} roof on {{towers of}} square plan.

Each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower is topped with an even triangular gable from <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> which runs a ridge to <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof. Thus <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramidical roof do not correspond with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower but with <b>the</b> peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gables.|$|R

5|$|From 600,000 to 400,000years ago, eruptions built a large conical {{stratovolcano}} called Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano) {{in what is}} now {{the southwest}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park.
