40|$|Abstract. In the pantograph-catenary {{system of}} {{electric}} railroads, there is friction heat between high-speed moving pantograph sliders and the <b>contact</b> <b>wires,</b> {{leading to a}} temperature increase on the contact surface. On the contact surface under the current collecting conditions, there are also contact resistance heat and arc heat produced by the current effect, leading to further temperature increase of the pantograph sliders. This paper applies finite element method to analyze the steady heat transfer and transient heat transfer of the pantograph sliders of high-speed train and studies the transient heat transfer of sliders and <b>contact</b> <b>wires</b> in actual movement. The computing results determined the temperature fluctuation range and temperature distribution when sliders and <b>contact</b> <b>wires</b> are in normal working condition...|$|R

5000|$|As the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> makes {{contact with}} the {{pantograph}}, the carbon insert {{on top of the}} pantograph is worn down. The [...] "straight" [...] wire between supports will cause the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> to cross over the whole surface of the pantograph as the train travels around the curve, causing uniform wear and avoiding any notches. On straight track, the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> is zigzagged slightly to the left and right of centre at each successive support so that the pantograph wears evenly. The movement of the <b>contact</b> <b>wire</b> across the head of the pantograph is called the 'sweep'.|$|E

40|$|An exact {{relation}} between the conductance maximum G_ 0 at zero temperature and a ratio of lead densities is derived {{within the framework of}} the single impurity Anderson model: G_ 0 = R[n] 2 e^ 2 /h, where R[n]= 4 Δ N_ L,xΔ N_ R,x/(Δ N_ L,x+Δ N_ R,x) ^ 2 and Δ N_ L,x, Δ N_ R,x denote the excess density in the left/right lead at distance x due to the presence of the impurity at the origin, x= 0. The relation constitutes a parameter-free expression of the conductance of the model in terms of the ground state density that generalizes an earlier result to the generic case of asymmetric lead couplings. It turns out that the specific density ratio, R[n], is independent of the distance to the impurity x, the (magnetic) band-structure and filling fraction of the <b>contacting</b> <b>wires,</b> the strength of the onsite interaction, the gate voltage and the temperature. Disorder induced backscattering in the <b>contacting</b> <b>wires</b> has an impact on R that we discuss.
