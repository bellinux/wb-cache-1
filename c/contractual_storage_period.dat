40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of strains of local hens and egg <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> at temperature (25 °C) on egg quality traits. Twenty chickens of each genotype were kept in family pens and randomly distributed into two replicates. Nine eggs from each line were evaluated for external and internal egg quality. The correlations between external and internal egg quality traits were calculated; as well the regression of the traits on <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> was computed. The overall mean of egg weight (EW), egg index (EI), haugh unit (HU), albumin (AP) and yolk (YP) percentages were 58. 44 (g), 1. 31 %, 77. 67 %, 55. 22 % and 29. 26 % respectively. The differences between lines were significant (P< 0. 01) in EW and EI, while the differences in HU were significant due to <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> only. Differences in EW and EI due to the interaction between lines and <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> were significant, while the differences in HU were significant only between line (3) and (4) at <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> (1 day). It was shown that the differences between lines in albumin (AP) and yolk (YP) percentages were significant. <b>Storage</b> <b>period</b> {{has no effect on}} AP, whereas the differences were significant in YP. Also the differences in AP and YP due to the interaction between lines and <b>storage</b> <b>periods</b> were significant. Values of correlation ranged between - 0. 61 (P< 0. 01) between EI and AP and 0. 44 (P< 0. 01) between EW and AP. A non-significant regressions on <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> for all lines were - 0. 09, - 0. 01, - 0. 47, - 0. 16 and 0. 07 for EW, EI, HU, AP and YP respectively.

The first factor was packaging materials (paper, polyethylene and aluminum foil); the second factor was storage room conditions (ambient room, Air Conditioned (AC) room and refrigerator); the third factor was <b>storage</b> <b>periods</b> (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 weeks). The result of this research showed that packaging materials gave significant effect on the dry weight of normal seedling. <b>Storage</b> <b>periods</b> gave very significant effect on germination percentage, dry weight of normal seedling, maximum growth capacity, and vigor index. The interaction between packaging materials, storage room conditions and <b>storage</b> <b>periods</b> gave very significant efflect on germination rate. Based on the dry weight of normal seedling, polyethylene and aluminum foil package gave the same result, on the other hand paper package gave the lowest dry weight of normal seedling than that aluminum foil package. Based on the germination percentage, dry weight of normal seedling, maximum growth capacity, and vigor index the seed viability of caisin did not decrease, even after 15 weeks of <b>storage</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} ammonia {{treatment}} in field natural rubber (NR) latex with different <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> {{time on the}} properties of concentrated NR latex and stability of skim latex was investigated. Fresh NR latex was treated with various ammonia contents such as 0. 35, 0. 60 and 0. 80 % w/w, {{and then they were}} centrifuged to get the concentrated NR latex with 60 % dry rubber content (DRC) containing 0. 16, 0. 18 and 0. 25 % w/w, respectively and skim NR latex with roughly 5 % DRC containing 0. 42, 0. 60 and 0. 80 % w/w, respectively. The effect of storage times with ∼ 0, 15, 30 and 45 days for concentrated NR latex with different ammonia contents on their properties such as alkalinity, magnesium content and viscosity was observed. It was found that generally, magnesium content in field NR latex and latex concentrate decreased with <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> times. The alkalinity content in both concentrated NR and skim latex increased with increasing ammonia content in field latex. The viscosity of concentrated NR latex increased as a function of <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> time of field NR latex. The stability of skim latex depends on <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> time of field NR latex with different ammonias. The tensile strength of dipped films obtained from field NR latex with 0. 80 % w/w of ammonia was dependent on <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> time of field NR latex...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> of rock {{partridge}} eggs on hatchability characteristics and embryonic deaths were examined. In the study, a total number of 752 eggs which were obtained from a herd of rock partridges at 41 weeks of age were used. In different <b>storage</b> <b>periods</b> (1 - 14 days), no significant effect of <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> on hatchability performances of the partridge eggs was observed. Long storage time {{did not affect the}} hatchability of partridge eggs. It was observed that embryonic deaths in late period were more (not statistically significant) than early or medium periods. The least embryonic deaths were observed at early periods. As a result, it can be stated that, 14 days of partridge egg storage have no negative effect on hatchability results...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} (10 - 30 °C), relative humidity (RH, 50 - 90 %), and <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> (2 - 10 days) were studied {{on the production}} and sustainability of thiocyanate (SCN?) and hypothiocyanite-hypoiodite (OSCN?, OI?) components of a lactoperoxidase system (LPOSI) in chitosan film by applying response surface methodology and Doelhert experimental design. The results of analysis of variance indicated that the temperature and <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> exhibited {{a significant effect on}} the film properties. Temperature had a positive influence on OSCN?, OI?, while these products (OSCN?, OI?) decreased during the <b>storage</b> <b>period,</b> and SCN? disappeared after 2 days. Lactoperoxidase systems with iodine (LPOSI) or without iodine (LPOS), incorporated into chitosan films, showed inhibition of Xanthomonas campestris pv. Mangiferae indicae and did not changed the chitosan film permeability to gas and water vapor. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to compare white cheese (Gibna Bayda) made with {{partially}} purified Solanum dubium extract and rennet chemically, microbiologically and organoleptically, in addition to evaluating weight loss. Three batches of white cheese were made in duplicate, in two of which partially purified Solanum dubium fruit extract was used as coagulant, while in the third batch rennet {{was used as a}} coagulant. Results indicated that type of coagulant had no significant effect on weight loss, titratable acidity, protein, salt and ash contents of white cheese. However, there was a significant effect on total solids, fat, soluble protein, tyrosine and tryptophan contents. The interaction between the <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> and type of coagulant did not significantly affect all chemical components of cheese except tyrosine. <b>Storage</b> <b>period</b> had a significant effect on titratable acidity, total solids, protein and ash contents of whey. Total viable bacteria, streptococci and lactobacilli counts (cfu/gm) were significantly affected by <b>storage</b> <b>period,</b> and as the <b>storage</b> <b>period</b> increased their count decreased. No significant differences were observed in sensory characteristics in terms of colour, flavour, texture and saltiness between the two cheeses...|$|R
