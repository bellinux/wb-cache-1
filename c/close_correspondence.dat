5|$|The actual Burnt Norton is a manor {{located near}} the village of Aston Subedge in Gloucestershire that Eliot visited with Emily Hale during 1934. The {{original}} Norton House was a mansion burned down in 1741 by its owner, Sir William Keyt, who died in the fire. Even though Eliot was married, {{he spent a lot of}} time with Hale and might possibly have become involved with her had he not been married. Even after their time at Burnt Norton, Eliot stayed in <b>close</b> <b>correspondence</b> with her and sent her many of his poems. The actual manor does not serve as an important location within the poem. Instead, it is the garden surrounding the manor that became the focus.|$|E

25|$|The central {{relationship}} in Bellini's life {{seems to have}} been with Francesco Florimo, originally a student friend at the Naples Conservatory. Florimo came from a village near Catania. Throughout Bellini's lifetime, the two shared a <b>close</b> <b>correspondence,</b> the source of much of the information we have concerning the composer's life. Bellini wrote sometimes very long letters to him from the many places he lived and traveled to. Meanwhile, Florimo remained in Naples, ultimately becoming the Conservatory librarian.|$|E

25|$|In Old Chinese (and Classical Chinese, {{which is}} based on it), most words were monosyllabic and there was a <b>close</b> <b>correspondence</b> between {{characters}} and words. In modern Chinese (esp. Mandarin Chinese), characters do not necessarily correspond to words; indeed the majority of Chinese words today consist of two or more characters because of the merging and loss of sounds in the Chinese language over time. Rather, a character almost always corresponds to a single syllable that is also a morpheme.|$|E
25|$|Freud, like Josef Breuer, {{found the}} {{hypothesis}} that hysterical manifestations were generated by ideas {{to be not only}} warranted, but given in observation. Disagreement between them arose when they attempted to give causal explanations of their data: Breuer favored a hypothesis of hypnoid states, while Freud postulated the mechanism of defense. Richard Wollheim comments that given the <b>close</b> <b>correspondence</b> between hysteria and the results of hypnosis, Breuer's hypothesis appears more plausible, and that it is only when repression is taken into account that Freud's hypothesis becomes preferable.|$|E
25|$|The {{essence of}} the D/L method is 'resources'. Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use to make as many runs as possible: the number of overs they have to receive; {{and the number of}} wickets they have in hand. At any point in any innings, a team's ability to score more runs depends on the {{combination}} of these two resources. Looking at historical scores, there is a very <b>close</b> <b>correspondence</b> between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{consequences}} of viewing semantic association {{as the result of}} attempting to predict the concepts likely to arise in a particular context. We argue that the success of existing accounts of semantic representation comes as a result of indirectly addressing this problem, and show that a <b>closer</b> <b>correspondence</b> to human data can be obtained by taking a probabilistic approach that explicitly models the generative structure of language...|$|R

25|$|One {{measure of}} the quality of the fossil record is {{obtained}} by comparing the date of first appearance with the order of branching of a cladogram based on the shape of fossil elements. <b>Close</b> <b>correspondence</b> exists for ornithiscians, saurischians and subgroups. The cladogram link between coelophysids and ceratosaurs is an exception, it would place the origin of coelophysids much too late. The simplest explanation is convergent evolution - ceratosaur bones evolved independently into a shape that resembles that of the earlier coelophysids. The other possibility is that ceratosaurs evolved much earlier than the fossil record suggests.|$|E
25|$|The sober form of {{the roughly}} {{finished}} brick front {{can be seen in}} a fresco by Ambrogio Bergognone in the apse of the right transept, painted in 1492-1495, when work was commencing on the new facade, portraying Gian Galeazzo Visconti offering the model of the Certosa to the Blessed Virgin. Its profile, with roofs on three levels, has been compared to the churches of San Giovanni in Monza and San Petronio in Bologna; among the architects in <b>close</b> <b>correspondence</b> at all three projects, Borlini ascribes the {{form of the}} original facade at the Certosa to Giacomo da Campione, who was working at Pavia while his uncle Matteo was completing San Giovanni in Monza.|$|E
25|$|An India House {{was opened}} in Tokyo in 1907. The city– like London and New York– had {{by the end}} of the 19th century a {{steadily}} growing Indian student population, with whom Krishna Varma kept in close contact. However, Krishna Varma was initially concerned about spreading his resources too thin, especially since the Japanese centre lacked a strong leadership. He further feared interference from Japan, which was on friendly terms with Britain. Nonetheless, the presence of revolutionaries from Bengal and <b>close</b> <b>correspondence</b> between the London and Tokyo houses allowed the latter to gain prominence in The Indian Sociologist. The India House in Tokyo was a residence for sixteen Indian students in 1908; it accepted students from other Asian countries including Ceylon, aiming to build a broad foundation for Indian nationalism based on pan-Asiatic values. The movement gained new momentum after Barkatullah, on the advice of Krishna Varma and George Freeman, moved from New York to Tokyo in 1909. Taking up the post of Professor of Urdu at Tokyo University, Barkatullah was responsible for East Asian distribution of The Indian Sociologist and other nationalist literature from London. His work at the time also included the publication of Islamic Fraternity, which was financed by the Ottoman Empire. Barkatullah transformed it into an anti-British mouthpiece, invited contributions from Krishna Varma, and advocated Hindu–Muslim unity in India. He published other nationalist pamphlets which found their way to the Pacific coast and East Asian settlements. Further, Barkatullah established links with prominent Japanese politicians including Okawa Shumei, whom he won over to the Indian cause. British CID, concerned about the threat that Barkatullah's work posed to the empire, exerted diplomatic pressure to have Islamic Fraternity closed down in 1912. Barkatullah was denied tenure and was forced to leave Japan in 1914.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a period}} lasting {{approximately}} between 1390 and 1420 {{there was a}} particularly <b>close</b> <b>correspondence</b> between works produced far apart in Europe. In the north the miniatures of the Très Riches Heures Limbourg brothers, in Italy the Adoration of the Magi of Lorenzo Monaco, and sculpture and miniatures in many countries show very stylised tall figures, the older men with imposingly long beards and swaying figures. [...] Exotic clothes, based loosely on those of the contemporary Middle East or Byzantine Empire, are worn by figures in biblical scenes; many figures seem to be included just to show off these costumes. [...] The number of figures in many standard religious scenes is greatly increased; the Magi have large retinues, and the Crucifixion often becomes a crowded event.

25|$|As Van Slyck (1991) showed, {{the last}} years of the 19th century saw {{acceptance}} of the idea that free libraries should be available to the American public. But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a <b>closer</b> <b>correspondence</b> between the two.|$|R
