25|$|Charles K. Kao and George A. Hockham of the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) {{were the}} first, in 1965, {{to promote the}} idea that the {{attenuation}} in optical fibers could be reduced below 20 decibels per kilometer (dB/km), making fibers a practical <b>communication</b> <b>medium.</b> They proposed that the attenuation in fibers available at the time was caused by impurities that could be removed, rather than by fundamental physical effects such as scattering. They correctly and systematically theorized the light-loss properties for optical fiber, and pointed out the right material to use for such fibers— silica glass with high purity. This discovery earned Kao the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.|$|E
25|$|All {{organs and}} trade unions within the CNT may {{have their own}} media. Solidaridad Obrera ("Workers' Solidarity") is {{the journal of the}} Regional Confederation of Labour of Catalonia.

Other media are La tira de papel, the Graphic Arts, Media and Shows National Coordinator bulletin; the Cenit, newspaper of the Regional Committee of the Exterior; and BICEL, edited by the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation, which was created in 1987. The Foundation works autonomously, and its directorship is elected in a national plenary congress. Some of its duties are to maintain, catalogue and publicly display historic properties of the CNT, to publish books and other media, including BICEL, the Internal Bulletin of Centers of Anarchist Studies, to prepare cultural events during CNT or AIT congresses: lectures, debates, conferences, videoforums, book presentations, etc., and to coordinate with other similar projects.|$|E

2500|$|Bose' work {{in radio}} {{microwave}} optics was specifically directed towards studying {{the nature of}} the phenomenon and was not an attempt to develop radio into a <b>communication</b> <b>medium.</b> His experiments took place during this same period (from late 1894 on) when Guglielmo Marconi was making breakthroughs on a radio system specifically designed for wireless telegraphy and others were finding practical applications for radio waves, such as Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov radio wave base lightning detector, also inspired by Lodge's experiment. Although Bose's work was not related to communication he, like Lodge and other laboratory experimenters, probably had an influence on other inventors trying to develop radio as communications medium. Bose was not interested in patenting his work and openly revealed the operation of his galena crystal detector in his lectures. A friend in the US persuaded him to take out a US patent on his detector but he did not actively pursue it and allowed it to lapse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Old regime {{there were}} {{a small number of}} heavily censored {{newspapers}} that needed a royal licence to operate. Newspapers and pamphlets {{played a central role in}} stimulating and defining the Revolution. The meetings of the Estates-General in 1789 created an enormous demand for news, and over 130 newspapers appeared by the end of the year. Among the most significant of these newspapers in 1789 were Marat's L'Ami du peuple and Elysée Loustallot's Revolutions de Paris. The next decade saw 2000 newspapers founded, with 500 in Paris alone. Most lasted only a matter of weeks. Together they became the main <b>communication</b> <b>medium,</b> combined with the very large pamphlet literature. Newspapers were read aloud in taverns and clubs, and circulated hand to hand. The press saw its lofty role to be the advancement of civic republicanism based on public service, and downplayed the liberal, individualistic goal of making a profit. By 1793 the radicals were most active but at the start the royalists flooded the country with their press the [...] "Ami du Roi" [...] (Friends of the King) until they were suppressed. Napoleon only allowed four newspapers, all under tight control.|$|E

50|$|Media Richness Theory, {{sometimes}} referred to as information richness theory or MRT, is a framework used to describe a <b>communication</b> <b>medium's</b> ability to reproduce the information sent over it. It was introduced by Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel in 1986 as an extension of information processing theory. MRT is used to rank and evaluate the richness of certain communication media, such as phone calls, video conferencing, and email. For example, a phone call cannot reproduce visual social cues such as gestures which makes it a less rich communication media than video conferencing, which affords the transmission of gestures and body language. Based on contingency theory and information processing theory, MRT explains that richer, personal <b>communication</b> <b>mediums</b> are generally more effective for communicating of equivocal issues than leaner, less rich media.|$|R
