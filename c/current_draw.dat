25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{multi-core}} CPUs became commercially available. Content-addressable memory (CAM) {{has become}} inexpensive {{enough to be}} used in networking, and is frequently used for on-chip cache memory in modern microprocessors, although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages. Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS logic gates developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> of a gate based on other logic types, a CMOS gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states, except for leakage.|$|E
25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers {{should be the same}} as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> of an ionization {{smoke detector}} is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E

Mechanical sirens driven by an electric motor are often called [...] "electromechanical". One example is the Q2B siren sold by Federal Signal Corporation. Because of its high <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> (280 amps when power is applied) its application is normally limited to fire apparatus, though it has seen increasing use on type IV ambulances and rescue-squad vehicles. [...] Its distinct tone of urgency, high sound pressure level (123 dB at 10 feet) and square sound waves account for its effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|The C-rate is {{a measure}} of the rate at which a battery is being {{discharge}}d. It is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour. A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour. [...] A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer uninterruptible power supply, may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.|$|E
