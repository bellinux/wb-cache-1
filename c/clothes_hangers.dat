25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers,</b> park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. Currently, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK.|$|E

Development of this {{portable}} and foldable wet <b>clothes</b> <b>hanger</b> {{is to create a}} new model of <b>clothes</b> <b>hanger</b> that is foldable and portable and to fullfill current market needs. To design and fabricated this portable and foldable <b>clothes</b> <b>hanger,</b> it must be compared with other product that maybe available in the market. First, get an idea from internet, magazine, newspaper or other from available data. Form there the information and idea to design and fabricated can be created. The whole project involved various method and process that usually use in engineering such as concept design, analysis process and lastly fabrication process. This portable and foldable wet <b>clothes</b> <b>hanger</b> is made from aluminium. The height of this hanger can be adjusted according to users taste. It also can be easily moved because of its size and weight. When it is not used, it can be folded and only needed small place to store.

Asma wanted a divorce after he tied her and her (unnamed) co-wife together by their hair and beat both of them [...] "severely". Abu Bakr advised his daughter that Al-Zubayr was a [...] "righteous" [...] man, and therefore she should not leave him, or remarry after his death, because her reward for her patience would be {{to be reunited with}} him in Paradise. Asma also recalled: [...] "Whenever he reprimanded one of us, he would break off a branch from the wooden <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers</b> and beat her with it until he broke it over her." [...] Umm Kulthum asked him directly for a divorce, and when he refused, she tricked him into it by pestering him while he was busy with the ritual washing for prayer. Al-Zubayr complained, [...] "She tricked me, may Allah trick her!" [...] Muhammad advised him to propose to her again, but Al-Zubayr realized that , [...] "She will never come back to me." [...] Atiqa only agreed to marry him on condition that he would never beat her.|$|E

[...] It was around that time when he decided to focus on raising his family, and they moved to a horse farm in the nearby town of Maple Ridge, British Columbia. James worked as a youth counselor and Joanne continued her career as a paralegal in downtown Vancouver. On their seventh birthday, their father encouraged the twins to get a job. They looked through the help wanted ads, but ultimately began a business with their mother called JAM (for Jon, Andrew, and Mom) making nylon-wrapped <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers.</b> [...] In interviews, they have related how they would sell them door to door, eventually selling thousands to a woman who sold American paraphernalia in Japan.|$|E

5000|$|Linen {{should not}} be dried too much by tumble drying, and {{it is much easier}} to iron when damp. Linen {{wrinkles}} very easily, and thus some more formal garments require ironing often, in order to maintain perfect smoothness.

50|$|Some hangers have clips {{along the}} bottom for {{suspending}} skirts. Dedicated skirt and trousers hangers may not use the triangular shape at all, instead using just a rod with clips.

Foldable <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers</b> {{that are designed to}} be inserted through the collar area for ease of use and the reduction of stretching are an old, yet potentially useful variation on traditional <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers.</b> They have been patented over 200 times in the U.S. alone, as in U.S. Patent 0586456, awarded in 1897 to George E.

5000|$|Wire is versatile, {{and wire}} <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers</b> {{are often used}} as cheap sources of semi-tough wire, more {{available}} than baling wire {{for all sorts of}} home projects. The use of wire <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers</b> for use as makeshift welding rod has been common for nearly 100 years. Similarly, many similar do-it-yourself and children's projects use wire hangers as holders of various types, from keeping a brake caliper from hanging by the brake line during auto repair work, to securing a gate on a bird cage. The much-loved 'Advent Crown' made for children's TV programme Blue Peter was made from four wire coathangers. Coathangers {{can be used to make}} dowsing rods. After sanding, wire hangers also find uses as conducting wire for uses as varied as hot wiring cars to games [...] to testing hand steadiness. They are commonly used to gain forcible entry into older automobiles whose locks and entry systems are not protected from such methods. There is a long history of using wire coat hangers as replacement car radio antennas. <b>Clothes</b> <b>hangers</b> are also commonly used as an implement for roasting marshmallows or hot dogs at camp-outs.|$|E

50|$|A tunnel {{finisher}} is a machine to remove wrinkles from garments. Most garments are shipped by sea freight {{from the country}} of production.

50|$|More seriously, straightened-out wire <b>clothes</b> <b>hangers</b> have infamously been used, as {{mentioned}} above, to perform unsafe and/or illegal abortions (frequently self-administered) by inserting {{them into the}} uterus {{in an attempt to}} extract the embryo or fetus, a method that entails serious risks to the life and health of the woman undergoing the procedure.|$|E
