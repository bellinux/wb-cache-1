5|$|Until this time, <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>{{immunity}}</b> and {{humoral immunity}} {{were considered to}} be contending theories to explain effective immune response, but the former lagged behind owing to lack of advanced techniques. <b>Cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity</b> got an impetus in its recognition and study when in 1942, Merrill Chase successfully transferred immunity against tuberculosis between pigs by transferring white blood cells.|$|E
5|$|HIV infects vital {{cells in}} the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity</b> is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.|$|E
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity</b> and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
40|$|Innate {{and type}} 1 <b>cell-mediated</b> {{cytotoxic}} <b>immunity</b> function as important extracellular control mechanisms that maintain cellular homeostasis. Interleukin- 12 (IL 12) {{is an important}} cytokine that links innate immunity with type 1 <b>cell-mediated</b> cytotoxic <b>immunity.</b> We recently observed in vitro that tumor-derived Wnt-inducible signaling protein- 1 (WISP 1) exerts paracrine action to suppress IL 12 signaling. The objective of this retrospective study was three fold: 1) {{to determine whether a}} gene signature associated with type 1 <b>cell-mediated</b> cytotoxic <b>immunity</b> was correlated with overall survival, 2) to determine whether WISP 1 expression is increased in invasive breast cancer, and 3) to determine whether a gene signature consistent with inhibition of IL 12 signaling correlates with WISP 1 expression. Clinical information and mRNA expression for genes associated with anti-tumor immunity were obtained from the invasive breast cancer arm of the Cancer Genome Atlas study. Patient cohorts were identified using hierarchical clustering. The immune signatures associated with the patient cohorts were interpreted using model-based inference of immune polarization. Reverse phase protein array, tissue microarray, and quantitative flow cytometry in breast cancer cell lines were used to validate observed differences in gene expression. We found that type 1 <b>cell-mediated</b> cytotoxic <b>immunity</b> was correlated with increased survival in patients with invasive breast cancer, especially in patients with invasive triple negative breast cancer. Oncogenic transformation in invasive breast cancer was associated with an increase in WISP 1. The gene expression signature in invasive breast cance...|$|R

5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity,</b> complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E

30|$|In cancer {{patients}} lymphopenia is the surrogate of an impaired <b>cell-mediate</b> <b>immunity,</b> while neutrophilia is acknowledged {{as a response}} to systematic inflammation (Grivennikov et al. 2010). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is suggested as a marker for general immune response to various stress stimuli. NLR was described to be correlated with the severity of clinical progress in severely ill patients {{in the intensive care unit}} (Zahorec 2001); emerging evidences have shown that NLR has a prognostic value in patients with solid tumors (McMillan 2009); pretreatment high neutrophil count has been reported as a poor prognostic factor for survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma (Négrier et al. 2002), metastatic melanoma (Schmidt et al. 2005), and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (Teramukai et al. 2009); in addition to be a prognostic score in patients with cancer (Proctor et al. 2011; Wei et al. 2014; Rossi et al. 2015; Pinato et al. 2012), NLR was found to be an helpful tool in the prediction of response to treatment (Edge et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|T <b>cell-mediated</b> {{adaptive}} <b>immunity</b> {{is required}} to help clear infection with the facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen Sal-monella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), yet development of T <b>cell-mediated</b> adaptive <b>immunity</b> to S. Typhi-murium {{has been described as}} slow and inefficient. A key step in inducing T <b>cell-mediated</b> adaptive <b>immunity</b> is T cell priming; the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of naive T cells following initial encounter with Ag. We previously demonstrated that S. Typhimurium had a direct inhibitory effect on naive T cells from mouse, blocking their proliferation. In this study, we show that S. Typhimurium down-modulates expression of the TCR -chain, a molecule that is essential for Ag recognition and T cell function. Specifically, we demonstrate that reduced amounts of surface and intracellular TCR- protein and decreased levels of tcr transcript are expressed by T cells cultured in the presence of S. Typhimurium. We further show that the down-modulation of TCR- expression requires contact between S. Typhimurium and the T cells and that once contact occurs, a factor capable of reducing TCR- expression is secreted. These results provide new insight into the mechanism by which S. Typhimurium may inhibit T cell priming and avoid clearance by the adaptive immune system. The Journal of Immunology, 2008, 180 : 5569 – 5574. I nflammatory cells of the innate immune system, such as mac-rophages and neutrophils, provide a first line of defenseagainst pathogenic microorganisms (1 – 3).

In all three species, immune response genes are under positive selection, and genes of T <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity,</b> signal transduction, cell adhesion, and membrane proteins generally. Genes for keratin, which produce hair shafts, were rapidly evolving {{in all three}} species, possibly because of climate change or mate selection. The X chromosome has three times more rearrangements than other chromosomes. The macaque gained 1,358 genes by duplication.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{immunocompetence}} handicap hypothesis, sexually selected characteristics predict {{immune function}} and {{this relationship is}} mediated by testosterone. In the present study, we investigated whether bird song could predict immunity in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). We recorded the singing and reproductive behaviours of 16 adult male starlings in an outdoor aviary and then assessed their <b>cell-mediated</b> and humoral <b>immunity</b> in vivo. The males were observed in groups of four for 2 h each day over a 4 -day period. For each male, the number of songs produced was recorded and the average song-bout length was computed. Next, <b>cell-mediated</b> and humoral <b>immunity</b> were assessed via cutaneous swelling responses to the T-cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin and antibody responses to a novel antigen, keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Song rate and song-bout length were positively correlated with <b>cell-mediated</b> and humoral <b>immunity,</b> respectively. Additionally, a negative relationship between plasma testosterone concentration and antibody response was observed. These data demonstrate that male starling song {{can be used as}} a predictor of immunocompetence, with more robust singers exhibiting enhanced immunity.

40|$|Tumor {{immunity}} {{in patients}} with primary intracranial tumors was assessed {{in relation to the}} general status of host immunocompetence. Lymphocyte sensitization to tumor-specific membrane antigens was demonstrated by the proliferative response of lymphocytes in the presence of autochthonous tumor cells. Paradoxically, one-half of the patients could not be sensitized to a primary antigen, dinitrochlorobenzene; existing delayed hypersensitivity was also depressed, as measured by skin tests and lymphocyte transformation in response to common antigens. A heat-stable factor in patients' sera blocked <b>cell-mediated</b> tumor <b>immunity.</b> In addition, these "enhancing" sera consistently suppressed the blastogenic response of autologous and homologous lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin and to membrane antigens on allogeneic cells in the one-way mixed lymphocyte culture. When patients' leukocytes were washed and autologous plasma replaced with normal plasma, reactivity in the mixed lymphocyte culture increased to normal values. In vitro immunosuppressive activity in patients' plasma or sera correlated with depressed delayed hypersensitivity. After removal of the tumor, suppressor activity disappeared. IgG fractions of patient sera contained strong immunosuppressive activity. These data suggest that the suppressor factor may be an isoantibody elicited by the tumor that also binds to receptors on the lymphocyte membrane. In addition to specifically blocking <b>cell-mediated</b> tumor <b>immunity,</b> enhancing sera may broadly depress host immunocompetence...|$|R

Antibacterial activity was dependent upon the length and the temperature of the test incubation and on the concentration of monocytes.

25|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{also known}} as the acquired immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity</b> components.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of HIV presents an enormous challenge for researchers. And, because {{the virus has}} the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies produced by natural immunity, the standard vaccine strategy of mimicking natural infection to induce antibodies has so far proved impossible. Strengthening <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity</b> offers another possible route to success. About 90% of candidate HIV vaccines in development use this approach. These products will not prevent infection. But it is hoped that they will lower viral load and therefore progression to AIDS and secondary transmissions. Some observers believe that a vaccine to prevent HIV will never be achieved. Ultimately, even if an HIV preventive vaccine were to be developed, they are unlikely to be 100% effective. It has come to be realised that no single approach alone will be able to stem the spread of HIV. The future of HIV prevention will most likely involve combining new methods with existing approaches, such as condom use.|$|E
25|$|T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are {{the major}} {{cellular}} components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity,</b> whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific “non-self” antigens, during {{a process known as}} antigen presentation. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.|$|E

40|$|A {{synthetic}} heptadecapeptide, CKS- 17, {{represents the}} highly conserved amino acid sequences occurring within the transmembrane envelope protein of many animal and human retroviruses. CKS- 17 {{has been demonstrated}} to exhibit suppressive properties for numerous immune functions. We have recently shown that CKS- 17 acts as an immunomodulatory epitope causing an imbalance of human type 1 and type 2 cytokine production and suppression of <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunities.</b> cAMP, an intracellular second messenger, {{plays an important role}} in regulation of cytokine biosynthesis [...] i. e., elevation of intracellular cAMP levels selectively inhibits type 1 cytokine production but has no effect or enhances type 2 cytokine production. Here, we demonstrate that CKS- 17 induces dramatic rises in the intracellular cAMP levels of a human monocyte cell line and of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A peptide corresponding to the reverse sequence of CKS- 17, used as control, has no effect on intracellular cAMP levels. The cAMP-inducing ability of CKS- 17 is significantly blocked by SQ- 22536, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase. These results indicate that CKS- 17, a highly conserved component of the transmembrane proteins of immunosuppressive retroviruses, induces increased intracellular levels of cAMP via activation of adenylate cyclase and suggest that this retroviral envelope peptide may differentially modulate type 1 and type 2 cytokine production through elevation of intracellular cAMP levels...|$|R
500|$|The {{immune system}} is a host defense system {{comprising}} many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect {{a wide variety of}} agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunity.</b> [...] In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.|$|E

40|$|Contact {{hypersensitivity}} (CH) {{to simple}} haptens and acute allograft rejection are {{generally regarded as}} T cell-mediated responses. However, at the present time, considerable controversy exists concerning the precise phenotype of the effector cells that are the proximate causes of inflammation and tissue destruction. In transplantation immunity, the assumption of a decade ago [...] that cytotoxic T lymphocytes, predominately of the Lyt- 1 - 23 + type, are the mediators of acute allograft rejection-has been strongly challenged by recent data identifying the T cell subpopulation that mediates delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (TD-rn, Lyt-l+ 23 -) as an equally (if not more so) important participant in specific graft destruction (1, 2). Similarly, the general belief that TDTH cells mediate contact hypersensitivity (3) has been challenged by Tagart (4) and more recently by Sunday and Dorf (5), who have demonstrated a role for cytotoxic T cells in the deve!opment of CH reactions in the skin.

40|$|Immune reponses are {{influenced}} by a network of interacting cells: regulatory amplification and suppression are often mediated by subsets of T cells. Suppressor T cells, both antigen specific and nonspecific, have been studied extensively in experimental systems for humoral and <b>cell-mediated</b> <b>immunities</b> (1 - 4). Suppressor cell activity has also been reported in several parasitic diseases (5 - 10). However, {{in most of the}} latter, only nonspecific suppressor cells have been demonstrated. We reported previously (11) that mice infected with influenza virus by aerosol or injected with purified ultraviolet (UV) 1 -inactivated virus or viral subunits developed weak and transient levels of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to influenza virus. The DTH reaction was greatly enhanced when mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 - 200 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide (Gy) 2 d before immunization. The reaction was maximal 24 - 48 h after elicitation, had classical DTH histology, and was transferable by immune cells but not by immune serum. That pretreatment with Cy was necessary to induce significant and sustained levels of DTH suggests that suppressor cells for DTH may be preferentially induced during influenza virus infection (12 - 15). In this paper we report the detection of antigen-specific suppressor T cells for DTH to the viral hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza in virus-infected mice. This finding may explain why DTH has been difficult to detect during influenza infection. It may also lead to possible ways of modifying the host immune responses against this virus...|$|R

40|$|The immune {{response}} to xenogeneic organ transplants (grafts from other species) is more potent than to allogeneic tissues (1).

However, even in situations such as skin grafting, where antibody-mediated mechanisms are not thought to play a role, <b>cell-mediated</b> xenograft <b>immunity</b> is stronger than that to allografts (1, 2). To examine the cell-mediated response to xenogeneic compared with allogeneic antigens, we used anti-T cell antibodies in vivo in mice {{in an effort to}} prolong xenogeneic compared with allogeneic skin graft survival. The results of these studies show that in vivo treatment of mice with an anti-CD 4 antibody prolonged survival of skin xenografts from rabbits or monkeys without prolonging survival of whole MHC-mismatched allografts from other mice. These results represent the first achievement of better xenograft than allograft survival for such disparate species combinations.

On the other hand, the prolongation of xenograft survival by anti-CD 4 antibody is similar to the prolongation of minor antigen-disparate allograft survival by the same reagent.
