5|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{carried out at}} an Auckland emergency department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity. Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case of a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> BZP and MDMA by a 23-year-old from Greymouth, New Zealand. Ben Rodham, a DJ, ingested a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death.

40|$|There {{are so many}} {{researches}} {{and papers}} for radial linear <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> convex bodies, and many beautiful results of its properties are gotten. Based on these theories, the Lp-radial linear <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> convex bodies are inroduced. In this paper we deduce the size of these dual mixed volumes, and some properties for their mean width are studied. Meanwhile, the lower bound of the mean width <b>of</b> Lp-radial linear <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> convex bodies and their polar bodies are found. After many properties for Lp-radial linear <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> convex bodies are studied enough, we have found {{the connection between the}} Lp-radial linear combinations and Firey linear <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> convex bodies. Finally, supported by these theories, we got the lower bound of the mean width <b>of</b> Firey linear <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> convex bodies which are a more general from K,L∈K 0,real number p≥ 1,,u≥ 0,λ+u= 1,then **, with equality if and only if both K and L are unit balls.
