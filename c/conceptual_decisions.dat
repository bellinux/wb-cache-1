40|$|Neuropsychological and {{functional}} imaging studies have associated the conceptual processing of numbers with bilateral parietal regions (including intraparietal sulcus). However, the processes driving these effects remain unclear because both {{left and right}} posterior parietal regions are activated by many other conceptual, perceptual, attention, and response-selection processes. To dissociate parietal activation that is number-selective from parietal activation related to other stimulus or response-selection processes, we used fMRI to compare numbers and object names during exactly the same conceptual and perceptual tasks while factoring out activations correlating with response times. We found that right parietal activation was higher for <b>conceptual</b> <b>decisions</b> on numbers relative to the same tasks on object names, even when response time effects were fully factored out. In contrast, left parietal activation for numbers was equally involved in conceptual processing of object names. We suggest that left parietal activation for numbers reflects a range of processes, including the retrieval of learnt facts that are also involved in <b>conceptual</b> <b>decisions</b> on object names. In contrast, number selectivity in right parietal cortex reflects processes that are more involved in <b>conceptual</b> <b>decisions</b> on numbers than object names. Our results generate {{a new set of}} hypotheses that have implications for the design of future behavioral {{and functional}} imaging studies of patients with left and right parietal damage...|$|E

The Project Team conducted an exhaustive review of available literature. The complete listing of the documents, numbering several hundred and reviewed as a part of this task, is included in Appendix A. Even with the large amount of material written regarding the development and application of air sparging, there still are significant gaps in the technical community`s understanding of the remediation technology. The results of the literature review are provided in Section 2. In Section 3, an overview of seventeen conceptual, theoretical, mathematical and empirical models is presented. Detailed descriptions of each of the models reviewed is provided in Appendix B. Included in Appendix D is a copy of the questionnaire used to compile information about the models. The remaining sections of the document reflect the analysis and synthesis of the information gleaned during the literature and model reviews.

This paper describes how to generate and evaluate product life cycle scenarios. The Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method is employed because it has the ability to structure complex and multi-attribute problem hierarchically and can deal with the problem of inconsistency in decision-making during pairwise comparison and weighting. First product life cycle scenarios are generated by combination of different life cycle attributes. Then the hierarchy structure of AHP is formulated and essential criteria for evaluating life cycle scenarios are identified. After that pairwise comparison matrices with each criterion and sub-criteria are generated and weights for each criterion are determined. Finally the preferred solution can be selected after comprehensive evaluation. An example demonstrates the application of this methodology...|$|R

40|$|Repetition priming is a {{prominent}} example of non-declarative memory, and {{it increases the}} accuracy and speed of responses to repeatedly processed stimuli. Major long-hold memory theories posit that repetition priming results from facilitation within perceptual and conceptual networks for stimulus recognition and categorization. Stimuli can also be bound to particular responses, and it has recently been suggested that this rapid response learning, not network facilitation, provides a sound theory of priming of object recognition. Here, we addressed the relevance of network facilitation and rapid response learning for priming of person recognition {{with a view to}} advance general theories of priming. In four experiments, participants performed <b>conceptual</b> <b>decisions</b> like occupation or nationality judgments for famous faces. The magnitude of rapid response learning varied across experiments, and rapid response learning co-occurred and interacted with facilitation in perceptual and conceptual networks. These findings indicate that rapid response learning and facilitation in perceptual and conceptual networks are complementary rather than competing theories of priming. Thus, future memory theories need to incorporate both rapid response learning and network facilitation as individual facets of priming...|$|E

The lack of security metrics in general and the inability to uniformly combine different dimensions of security information prevents decision-makers from having a macro-level view of system security. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop a <b>conceptual</b> <b>decision</b> framework to address this shortcoming and to apply the approach to a current information system problem: the resource management of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). This framework, called the MANET Distributed Functions Ontology Management Mechanism (MMM), leverages the benefits of ontologies, Value Focused Thinking, and a specialized network flow optimization model in order to craft a holistic view of the configuration and security of an information system (e. g., a Mobile Ad Hoc Network). The resulting decision making capability allows for a better connected, more secure network of communications devices.

In addition to being an environmentally conscious action, remanufacturing has the potential to support circular economy within which significant profit opportunities exist. However, high levels of uncertainty can be experienced during, before and after remanufacturing. This makes its planning stochastic and hard to control.
