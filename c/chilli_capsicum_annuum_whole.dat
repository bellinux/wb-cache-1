An incubation study was carried out on a loam (slightly alkaline) soil with 12 treatments: T 0 – control; T 1 – RP; T 2 – SSP; T 3 – DAP; T 4 – PM; T 5 – 1 / 2 RP+ 1 / 2 SSP; T 6 – 1 / 2 RP+ 1 / 2 DAP; T 7 – 1 / 2 RP+ 1 / 2 PM; T 8 – RP+PSB; T 9 – 1 / 2 RP+ 1 / 2 SSP+PSB; T 10 – 1 / 2 RP+ 1 / 2 DAP+PSB; and T 11 – 1 / 2 RP+ 1 / 2 PM+PSB. Phosphorus mineralization was measured by analyzing extractable P from the amended soil incubated under controlled conditions at 25 °C for periods of 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 60 days. A complementary greenhouse experiment was conducted in pots with <b>chilli</b> (<b>Capsicum</b> <b>annuum</b> L.) as a test crop. Growth, yield, P uptake and PUE of the chilli was determined during the study. Results indicated that P mineralization in soil amended with RP was 6. 0 – 11. 5 mg kg − 1, while both soluble P fertilizers resulted in 68 – 73 mg P kg − 1 at day 0, which decreased by 79 – 82 % at the end of incubation. The integrated use of PSB and PM with RP in T 11 stimulated P mineralization by releasing a maximum of 25 mg P kg − 1 that was maintained at high levels without any loss. Use of PSB decreased soil pH. In the greenhouse experiment, RP alone or RP+PSB did not {{have a significant impact on}} plant growth. However, the combined use of RP, PM and PSB in T 11 resulted in similar growth, yield and P uptake of chilli as DAP. The PUE of applied P varied from 4 to 29 % and was higher in the treatments that included PSB.

Mixed viral infection among CMV, PYV and TMV caused a significant reduction in the chilli biomass and production. Although viral infection increased the plant height, the infected chilli seemed unhealthy. There existed interaction effects of mixed viral infection and growth stages on the chilli biomass. All viral infection and growth stages reduced significantly the biomass of the chilli, with the lowest found at the mixed viral infection of TMV+PYV (18. 5...|$|R

40|$|Hot peppers used {{as natural}} {{flavoring}} and coloring agents are usually irradiated in prepacked form for decontamination. The effects of gamma radiation on {{the stability of}} functional components such as capsaicinoids and antioxidant compounds (carotenoids, ascorbic acid and total phenolics) were investigated in hot peppers (<b>Capsicum</b> <b>annuum).</b> <b>Whole</b> dried peppers packed in polyethylene bags were gamma irradiated at 0 (control), 2, 4, and 6 kGy and subsequently stored at 25 °C for 90 days. The irradiation dose did not substantially affect the initial contents of capsaicinoids, ascorbic acid and total phenolics, though the concentration of carotenoids declined by 8 % from the control (76. 9 mg/ 100 g) to 6 kGy radiation dose (70. 7 mg/ 100 g). Similarly, during storage for 90 days at ambient temperature the concentrations of capsaicinoids and total phenolics remained fairly stable with mean percent reductions from 3. 3 % to 4. 2 %, while the levels of total carotenoids and ascorbic acid significantly (p < 0. 05) declined by 12 % and 14 %, respectively. Overall, neither irradiation nor subsequent ambient storage could appreciably influence the contents of functional components in hot peppers. These results revealed that gamma irradiation up to 6 kGy can be safely used for decontamination {{to meet the needs}} for overseas markets without compromising product quality...|$|R
40|$|Endophytic {{actinomycetes}} {{have shown}} unique plant growth promoting {{as well as}} antagonistic activity against fungal phytopathogens. In the present study forty-two endophytic actinomycetes recovered from medicinal plants were evaluated for their antagonistic potential and plant growth-promoting abilities. Twenty-two isolates which showed the inhibitory activity against at least one pathogen were subsequently tested for their plant-growth promoting activities and were compared genotypically using DNA based fingerprinting, including enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) and BOX repetitive elements. Genetic relatedness based on both ERIC and BOX-PCR generates specific patterns corresponding to particular genotypes. Exponentially grown antagonistic isolates were used to evaluate phosphate solubilization, siderophores, HCN, ammonia, chitinase, indole- 3 -acetic acid production, as well as antifungal activities. Out of 22 isolates, the amount of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) ranging between 10 - 32 μg/ml was produced by 20 isolates and all isolates were positive for ammonia production ranging between 5. 2 to 54 mg/ml. Among 22 isolates tested, the amount of hydroxamate-type siderophores were produced by 16 isolates ranging between 5. 2 to 36. 4 μg/ml, while catechols-type siderophores produced by 5 isolates ranging from 3. 2 to 5. 4 μg/ml. Fourteen isolates showed the solubilisation of inorganic phosphorous ranging from 3. 2 to 32. 6 mg/ 100 ml. Chitinase and HCN production was shown by 19 and 15 different isolates, respectively. In addition, genes of indole acetic acid (iaaM) and chitinase (chiC) were successively amplified from 20 and 19 isolates respectively. The two potential strains Streptomyces sp. (BPSAC 34) and Leifsonia xyli (BPSAC 24) were tested in vivo and improved a range of growth parameters in <b>chilli</b> (<b>Capsicum</b> <b>annuum</b> L.) under greenhouse conditions. This study is the first published report that actinomycetes can be isolated as endophytes from within these plants and were shown to have antagonistic and plant growth promoting abilities. These results clearly suggest {{the possibility of using}} endophytic actinomycetes as bioinoculant for plant growth promotion, nutrient mobilization or as biocontrol agent against fungal phytopathogens for sustainable agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to water}} scarcity, {{there is great}} {{interest}} in reusing various nutrient-rich wastewaters. The aim {{of this article is}} consequently to evaluate if domestic wastewater treated by various wetland systems can be successfully recycled to irrigate generations of commercial crops such as <b>Chilli</b> (<b>Capsicum</b> <b>annuum)</b> grown in compost within a laboratory environment to obtain a cultivar adapted to domestic wastewater. The corresponding objectives were to assess the irrigation water for long-term growth when applying recycled wastewater, the impact of various wastewaters subject to the wetland characteristics, the impact of treated wastewater volume for irrigation, and the economic return of different experimental set-ups in terms of marketable yields. The vertical-flow wetlands treated domestic wastewater well, meeting the irrigation water quality standards for most water quality parameters, except for phosphorus (4. 2 ± 0. 48 mg/l), ammonia-nitrogen (4. 2 ± 2. 64 mg/l), potassium (7. 0 ± 3. 03 mg/l) and total coliforms (69647 ± 64852. 6 CFU/ 100 ml), which showed high values significantly (p < 0. 05) exceeding common thresholds set for irrigation applications of 2 mg/l, 5 mg/l, 2 mg/l, and 1000 CFU/ 100 ml. Chilli generations were grown successfully when applying wastewater treated by wetlands and organic soil. High Chilli generation yields concerning economic return were linked with wetlands containing small aggregates with long contact and resting times and fed with a high inflow loading rate (undiluted wastewater), releasing more nutrients into their effluent producing the best fruit quality with respect to weight, length and width resulting in a greater marketable profit of about 46 % compared with the others. First generation Chilli plants were grown with considerably shorter heights and produced abundant fruit numbers, which were harvested earlier than their mothers due to the reduction (approximately 55 %) of irrigation water volume used for them compared to their mothers. However, excessive nutrients applied on mother plants via irrigation water resulted in better fruit quality regarding dimensions and weights compared with their corresponding first generation plants, leading to a greater marketable profit by about 25 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to produce an accurate estimate of the yields of green <b>chilli</b> (<b>Capsicum</b> <b>annuum</b> L.) grown under village management condition in Punakha district, western Bhutan. The study also considered important agronomic factors of productions such as types and usage of fertilizers, chilli varieties, planting density, spacing, methods of sowing and transplanting. A total of 50 farming households from two Gewogs (sub-districts) of Talo and Guma were selected in Punakha. Of these, 24 households cultivated chilli using farmyard manure (FYM) and 26 used FYM and inorganic fertilizers (FYM+I). Farmers were interviewed about their farming practices. Yields were recorded on a weekly basis for six weeks within demarcated plots of 5 x 5 meters in farmers' fields. Soil samples from the sites were collected and analysed for soil nutrient status. Results indicated a very large variation in the yields of fresh green chilli. The average yield was estimated to be 23 t/ha, with the highest yield 37. 6 t/ha and lowest 13. 6 t/ha. Fertilizer applications also showed wide variations in rates and types. No significant correlations could be established between yield and any factor of production, including fertilizer use and type. The weak relationships seem to derive from a number of issues including farmers' individual methods of cultivating chilli, differences in level of inputs, limited resources and labour shortage. The soil fertility status was found to be relatively low, although there was an abundance of some elements of soil nutrients in the FYM cultivated sites. It is suggested that research centres in the region should conduct more on-station research trials, to establish science-based extension advice for chilli farmers and narrow the variation in the yields of chilli. This will improve the predictability of chilli yields, which is of great interest to farmers. It should be possible to increase the current average yield from 23 t/ha to 30 - 35 t/ha, develop and recommend the optimum use of fertilizers for chilli production, preserve the local chilli provenance through breeding programs and develop simple, tested agronomic practices which suit farming system which have limited access to human labour.

40|$|The aim was {{to assess}} if {{domestic}} wastewater treated by different vertical-flow wetlands can be successfully recycled to water commercially grown crops. The growth of both Sweet Pepper (California Wonder; cultivar of <b>Capsicum</b> <b>annuum</b> Linnaeus Grossum Group) and <b>Chilli</b> (De Cayenne; <b>Capsicum</b> <b>annuum</b> (Linnaeus) Longum Group 'De Cayenne') fed with different treated and untreated wastewater types were assessed. The overall growth development of Sweet Peppers was poor due to the high concentrations of nutrients and trace minerals. In contrast, chilies did reasonably well but the growth of foliage was excessive and the harvest was delayed. High yields were associated with tap water and an organic growth medium, and a wetland with a high aggregate size, leaving sufficient space for biomass. Low fruit numbers correlated well with inorganic growth media and irrigation water contaminated by hydrocarbons. Findings indicate that nutrient concentrations supplied to the Chillies {{by a combination of}} compost and treated waste water are usually too high to produce a good harvest. However, as the compost is depleted of nutrients after about 8 months, the harvest increased for pots that received pre-treated wastewater. Findings will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of different wetland treatment processes...|$|R
