40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} {{treatment}} technique for craniospinal irradiation using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with improved dose homogeneity {{at the field}} junction(s), increased target volume conformity, and minimized dose to the organs at risk (OARs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five patients with high-risk medulloblastoma underwent <b>CT</b> simulation in <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> For each patient, an IMRT plan with daily intrafractionally modulated junction(s) was generated, {{as well as a}} treatment plan based on conventional three-dimensional planning (3 DCRT). A dose of 39. 6 Gy in 22 daily fractions of 1. 8 Gy was prescribed. Dose-volume parameters for target volumes and OARs were compared for the two techniques. RESULTS: The maximum dose with IMRT was 107) were < 1 cm(3) for IMRT compared with 3 - 9 cm(3) for the craniospinal and 26 - 43 cm(3) for the spinal-spinal junction with 3 DCRT. These observations corresponded with a lower homogeneity index and a higher conformity index for the spinal planning target volume with IMRT. IMRT provided considerable sparing of acute and late reacting tissues. V(75) for the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, and intestine was 81 %, 81 %, and 22 % with 3 DCRT versus 5 %, 0 %, and 1 % with IMRT, respectively. V(75) for the heart and thyroid was 42 % and 32 % vs. 0 % with IMRT. CONCLUSION: IMRT with daily intrafractionally modulated junction results in a superior target coverage and junction homogeneity compared with 3 DCRT.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} neuroaxis irradiation {{for adults}} in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> using head body thermoplastic mask fixation, from the aspects of dose distribution, patient comfort and set-up accuracy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine of the 12 adult patients were positioned for craniospinal axis irradiation in both prone and <b>supine</b> <b>positions.</b> After mask fixation and planning CTs in both positions, a questionnaire relating to the comfort was completed. The doses to the target and to the organs at risk of the 3 D conformal plans in the <b>supine</b> and prone <b>positions</b> were compared.

Methods: The records of obese patients (body mass index > 30) who underwent PCNL in the prone or complete <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> were reviewed. All patients had a noncontrast CT {{before and after the}} procedure. Stones were graded according to the Guy stone score and complications according to the Clavien grading. The stone-free rates, operative time, surgical complications, and hospital stay were analyzed. Results: A total of 56 PCNL were performed in 42 patients. Twenty-four PCNL were performed in the prone and 32 in the total <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> Stone-free rate on the first postoperative day was 50 % in the prone and 46. 9 % in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> (P = 1. 0). Final stone-free rates were 83. 3 % and 78. 1 %, respectively (P = 0. 74). Mean operative time was 164. 6 minutes in the prone and 120. 3 minutes in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> (P = 0. 0017), and hospital stay was 4. 38 and 2. 68 days (P = 0. 014), respectively. The transfusion rate was 20. 8 % in the prone and zero in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> patients (P = 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the effects of upright posture compared with <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> on the dominant atrial cycle length (DACL) in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. DESIGN: The power/frequency spectrum of QRST suppressed lead V 1 ECG was studied in 14 patients in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> and during the head up tilt table test. The DACL changes were compared with changes in heart rate and blood pressure. RESULTS: Compared with the <b>supine</b> <b>position,</b> the upright position reduced the DACL from 160 to 150 ms (p < 0. 01). The DACL was increased after returning to the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> from the upright position, from 147 to 154 ms (p < 0. 01). Heart rate increased from 91 beats/min in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> to 106 in the upright position (p < 0. 01). There was a decrease in heart rate from 109 beats/min in the upright position to 93 after returning to the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> (p < 0. 01). No significant changes were seen in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. There were indications of an inverse relation between DACL and heart rate when comparing the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> before and after tilt with the upright position (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The sympathetic stimulation and vagal withdrawal induced by rising to upright body position are associated with a decrease in DACL during chronic atrial fibrillation.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of the <b>position</b> (upright vs. <b>supine)</b> in the intraocular pressure (IOP) measured with a non-contact portable tonometer. Methods: Fifty university students with a mean age of 22. 3 ± 4. 2 years (mean±SD) were recruited to participate in this study. IOP was measured with the non-contact tonometer Keeler, Pulsair EasyEye. Measurements in upright and <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> were randomly obtained. In the upright position, 2 series of 3 measures (UP 1 and UP 2) and a series of 3 measures in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> were performed. Results: The values obtained in the positions UP 1 and UP 2 were compared, as well as the values of the upright and <b>supine</b> <b>positions.</b> No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the values obtained in the upright position (P> 0. 05). Instead, when the subjects were in the <b>supine</b> <b>position,</b> IOP increased 2. 47 ± 2. 12 mmHg (mean±SD), as opposed to the value obtained in the upright position (P< 0. 001).

Methods: One eye was randomly selected for evaluation by HRT II in each of eleven healthy subjects. Five images were obtained by each of two experienced operators at two separate visits with the subjects in both sitting and <b>supine</b> <b>positions.</b> A stand was constructed to allow stable, handheld operation of the HRT II head for imaging of the supine subjects. Measurements of optic disk parameters obtained in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> were compared with those obtained in the sitting position. The reliability of measurements in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> was evaluated by calculating both the coefficients of variation for measurements made by one observer on the first visit and the interobserver and intervisit intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs); the values obtained were compared with those obtained for the sitting position. Results: Measurements of all parameters made in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> were highly similar to those made in the sitting position. The coefficients of variation obtained for each parameter in the sitting and <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> ranged from 5. 67 % to 14. 16 % and from 2. 18 % to 16. 08 %, respectively. The interobserver ICC values in the sitting and <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> were ≥ 0. 978 and ≥ 0. 989, respectively.

Although surgical interventions under anaesthesia are often performed in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> the effects of this positioning on lung functionality in minipigs have not been systematically described. This study aimed to analyse the influence of <b>supine</b> <b>positioning</b> on the macrostructure of the lung and the pulmonary density by the use of computed tomography imaging in pre-adult Göttingen minipigs. Twelve pre-adult female minipigs were used in the study and lung density was investigated in both the prone and the <b>supine</b> <b>positions.</b> The time between the scans in prone and <b>supine</b> <b>positions</b> was less than 5 minutes (296 ± 6 sec). In the prone position lung density did not differ between the dorsal and ventral part of the lung (− 641 ± 72 Hounsfield units [HU]). However in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> there was a ventrodorsal gradient of decreasing density (ventral part of the lung: − 497 ± 106 HU, dorsal part of the lung: − 723 ± 51 HU). The changes in lung density were not accompanied by changes in lung volume (829 ± 191 ml). These results suggest an influence of the body position on the ventilation/perfusion ([(V) ]̇A/[(Q) ]̇) matching of the lung which could possibly result in lowered lung oxygenation as well as in an increased heart activity in the <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> Additionally, due to the steep course of the vena cava caudalis from the caval foramen in the diaphragm across to the heart (in contrast to the more shallow course in the prone position) the activity of the heart necessary to pump the venous blood to the right atrium has to be higher in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> than in the prone position. In pigs the capacity of the heart to increase frequency is limited due to a diastolic/systolic (D/S) ratio < 1. <b>Supine</b> <b>positioning</b> may possibly increase their risk of cardiovascular complications...|$|R
30|$|RDCT {{followed}} by LDCT and ULDCT were acquired with a 64 -row multidetector CT (Discovery CT 750 HD; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). All {{patients in the}} study were able to undergo abdominopelvic <b>CT</b> in the <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> with both arms elevated and with a single breath-hold for each acquisition. In this prospective clinical study, RDCT, LDCT, and ULDCT were acquired with minimal differences in data acquisition conditions (with the exception of radiation dose). For instance, to minimize the positional difference between the three acquisitions for each patient, the time between each scan was kept to a minimum (about 10  s or less). To avoid contrast enhancement bias owing to the delay in imaging {{from the start of the}} injection, only unenhanced CT images were included in this study. Scanning parameters other than tube current were held constant. The remaining scanning parameters were as follows: tube voltage of 120 kilovolt peak, helical scan acquisition mode, pitch of 1.375 : 1, gantry rotation time of 0.4  s, field of view of 360  mm (adjusted to patient size), and detector configuration of 64 × 0.625  mm. All images were reconstructed with 0.625  mm thick axial slices, and images with increased slice thickness of 2.5  mm (by averaging) were also used for interpretation as necessary. Images with coronal/sagittal reformats were not used for evaluation in this study, since the preliminary results of phantom experiments indicated that MBIR and ASIR behave differently in terms of image noise when reformatted into coronal and sagittal slices (unpublished data). The STANDARD kernel (a proprietary kernel of GE Healthcare) was used for image reconstruction for FBP and ASIR (there is no concept of kernel for MBIR).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Scoliosis is {{traditionally}} evaluated {{by measuring the}} Cobb angle in radiograph images taken while the patient is standing. However, low-dose computed tomography (CT) images, which are taken while the patient is in a <b>supine</b> <b>position,</b> provide new opportunities to evaluate scoliosis. Few studies have investigated how the patient's <b>position,</b> standing or <b>supine,</b> affects measurements. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the Cobb angle in images from patients while standing versus supine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients (97 females and 21 males; mean age 15. 5 [11 - 26] years) with late-onset scoliosis requiring corrective surgery were enrolled. One observer evaluated the type of curve (Lenke classification) and measured the Cobb angle in whole-spine radiography (standing) and scout images from low-dose <b>CT</b> (<b>supine)</b> were taken on the same day. RESULTS: For all primary curves, the mean Cobb angle was 59 ° (SD 12 °) while standing and 48 ° (SD 12 °) while in the <b>supine</b> <b>position,</b> with a mean difference of 11 ° (SD 5 °). The correlation between primary standing and supine images had an r value of 0. 899 (95 % CI 0. 860 - 0. 928) and an intra-class correlation coefficient value of 0. 969.

Prone <b>positioning</b> after <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> always improved oxygenation, whereas the decrement in Pa O 2 was relatively small when dogs were returned to the <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> Oxygenation improved in both groups after a RM, and the improvement was sustained (after 15 min) in the prone position at 8 cm H 2 O of PEEP, but 15 cm H 2 O of PEEP was required in <b>supine</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} whether the Achilles tendon reflex (ATR) in healthy infants is modulated {{by changes in}} body <b>position</b> (prone vs. <b>supine).</b> The amplitude of the ATR was compared at postnatal day 1, months 2, 3 and 6, while infants were placed in prone and <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> The ATR was considered "positive'' when at least 1 of 20 tendon taps evoked a visible contraction of the ankle plantar flexor muscles. At 6 months, the amplitude and latency of the ATR were evaluated by electromyographic (EMG) recordings of the (lateral and medial.) gastrocnemius muscle, with the infant in prone and <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> At postnatal day 1, the clinical ATR response was more frequently present in prone than <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> (14 / 16 or 88 % vs. 4 / 16 or 25 %, respectively, p < 0. 01). From 2 months onwards, the frequencies of positive ATRs were no longer significantly different between prone (14 / 14 or 100 %) and <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> (10 / 14 or 67 %). However, based on the EMG recordings at 6 months, the ATR amplitude was higher in prone compared to <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> (n= 8, median 5. 5 mV, range 4. 7 - 6. 6 mV; and median 3. 8 mV, range 2. 3 - 5. 6 mV, p < 0. 05). We conclude that the ATR response in healthy infants is more pronounced in prone than in <b>supine</b> <b>position,</b> either when clinically (visually) assessed during routine tendon tapping or when neurophysiologically assessed during surface EMG recording.

40|$|The {{influence}} of maternal {{position on the}} spread of local anesthetics in low concentration has not been well examined during epidural analgesia for labor. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the differences in sensory block, pain relief and incidence of supine hypotensive syndrome between parturients in the left lateral position and in a modified <b>supine</b> <b>position.</b> Sixty-seven parturients were randomly assigned to lie either in the left lateral position (n = 34) or in a modified <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> (n = 33), and received 0. 125 % bupivacaine 10 mL with epinephrine 1 : 800000 and sufentanil 7. 5 microg. At 20 min parturients in the modified <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> turned to the left lateral position and a second investigator, unaware of the initial position, measured the extent of the sensory block at 20 and 30 min and just before a second epidural injection was requested. More dermatomes were blocked on the dependent side when the dose was injected in the left lateral position (at 20 and 30 min: P < 0. 05; before the second epidural injection: P < 0. 0005). In the modified <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> the incidence of bilaterally blocked dermatomes T 10 -L 1 was greater at 20 and 30 min (P < 0. 05) and the pain on a visual analogue scale was better at 30 min (P < 0. 05). Three parturients in the modified <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> had signs and symptoms of supine hypotensive syndrome. We conclude that injecting in the modified <b>supine</b> <b>position</b> results in a more equal spread of local anesthetic and better pain relie...|$|R
