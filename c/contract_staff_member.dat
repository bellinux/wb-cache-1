40|$|Whether a {{microfinance}} institution {{should use}} a state-contingent repayment {{or not is}} very important since a state-contingent loan can provide insurance for borrowers. However, the classic Grameen bank used state non-contingent repayment, which is puzzling since it forces poor borrowers to make their payments even under hard circumstances. This paper provides an explanation to this puzzle. We consider two modes of lending, group and individual lending, and for each mode we characterize the optimal lending and supervisory <b>contracts</b> when a <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> (a supervisor) can embezzle borrowers' repayments by misrepresenting realized returns. We identify the main trade-off between the insurance gain {{and the cost of}} controlling the supervisor's misbehavior. We also find that group lending dominates individual lending either by providing more insurance or by saving audit costs. Microfinance Repayment Contract Group lending Embezzlement Insurance...|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{the first}} point, {{it has to}} be {{mentioned}} that the contracts were introduced at the instigation of the State Forestry Agency Department in Jalal-Abad, and signed by the heads of the forest enterprise and the pasture committee, respectively. Substantial discussions of the contracts’ contents and collective agreement on its contents did not take place within the forest enterprise or within the APU meetings (respondents EA 2013 / 2014, KB 2013, and TM 2013). At the same time, many pasture users see no incentive in being represented by a PC and feel no obligation to follow the imposed rules. Many sign individual <b>contracts</b> with leskhoz <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> instead. These <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> are structurally underpaid and often use the oral agreements for informal income generation, such as not intervening to prevent forbidden practices in order to obtain informal payments (respondents MA 2013, LO 2013, KB 2013, and TM 2013). Since the Beshik Jon and Bazar Korgon Local Municipalities’ APUs and PCs do not have any leverage to demand membership and support from the pasture users of their respective municipalities, they appear to be rather weak in terms of legitimation.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a self-protective strategy found in parents of children with cancer is also present in pediatric oncology staff.

We also explored the characteristics which <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> attribute to the children and the parents. A total of 76 <b>staff</b> <b>members,</b> 84 children with cancer, and their 163 parents participated in the study. Both gender and number of years working in oncology care were positively associated with increased self-protective reactions in <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> Male <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> rated medical procedures and the pain children experience in general as less painful than did female <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> Their judgements about experienced pain in general and the lumbar puncture procedure in particular tended to be lower than the children's ratings. Female <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> attributed more positive characteristics to children with cancer and their parents than did male <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> with more years of experience in oncology tended to rate all three medical procedures as less painful than those with less years of experience, and they also attributed more positive characteristics to the children. <b>Staff</b> <b>members</b> should be observant to their perceptions of children and parents, especially if their experience increase...|$|R
