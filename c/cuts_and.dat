Furthermore, for a substantial collection of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> project sets we show that the number of frequencies of patches of size r remains bounded as r tends to infinity. The latter result applies to a collection of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> project sets of full Hausdorff dimension. 1...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{software}} products available {{that can be used in}} the calculation of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> fill. A simple approach would involve defining different earthworks features in a software program and then adjusting elevations manually to calculate the optimal <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> fill. More sophisticated software is able to automatically balance <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> fill and take account for materials. Software that can do this would fall broadly under the category of earthworks estimation software.|$|R

5|$|About 40% of {{the subway}} system runs on surface or {{elevated}} tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of two lines in regular service are the 142nd Street junction, the Rogers junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose tracks both intersect at the same level.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} Coburg {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E

However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II — the first to be opened by any Canadian monarch — the government rapidly passed legislation, including tax <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> increases in old age pensions.

5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> locks, to enable small ships to trade on it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver sluices, just upstream of the junction. The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.|$|E

It was speculated that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series. However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of The Walking Dead spoke about the reasons for his firing.|$|E
