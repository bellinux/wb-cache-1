40|$|Equivalent Black Carbon (EBC) and Elemental Carbon (EC) are {{different}} mass metrics {{to quantify the}} amount of combustion aerosol. Both metrics have their own measurement technique. In state-of-the-art carbon analysers, optical measurements are used to correct for organic carbon that is not evolving because of pyrolysis. These optical measurements are sometimes used to apply the technique of absorption photometers. Here, we use the transmission measurements of our <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> for simultaneous determination of the elemental carbon concentration and the absorption coefficient. We use MAAP data from the CESAR observatory, the Netherlands, to correct for aerosol-filter interactions by linking the attenuation coefficient from the <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> to the absorption coefficient measured by the MAAP. Application of the calibration to an independent data set of MAAP and OC/EC observations for the same location shows that the calibration is applicable to other observation periods. Because of simultaneous measurements of light absorption properties of the aerosol and elemental carbon, variation in the mass absorption efficiency (MAE) can be studied. We further show that the absorption coefficients and MAE in this set-up are determined within a precision of 10 % and 12 %, respectively.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to autonomously determine concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and its carbon stable isotope ratio (δ 13 C–DIC) at high temporal resolution is presented. The simple method requires no customised design. Instead it uses two commercially available instruments currently used in aquatic carbon research. An inorganic <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> utilising non-dispersive infrared detection (NDIR) is coupled to a Cavity Ring-down Spectrometer (CRDS) to determine DIC and δ 13 C–DIC based on the liberated CO 2 from acidified aliquots of water. Using a small sample volume of 2  mL, the precision and accuracy of the new method was comparable to standard isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) methods. The system achieved a sampling resolution of 16  min, with a DIC precision of ± 1. 5 to 2  µmol kg − 1 and δ 13 C–DIC precision of ± 0. 14  ‰ for concentrations spanning 1000 to 3600  µmol kg − 1.

The laser in an OC/EC analyser, which measures organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), is {{used to measure the}} attenuation coefficient of a filter laden with aerosol. A single calibration to the Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP), which is in our study used as a reference method, is needed to link the attenuation by aerosol on the filter to the absorption coefficient of the aerosol in ambient air. We show that the attenuation coefficient with this method can be determined within a precision of 9. 6 %. The results of an independent data set show that the results of this methodology are comparable to widely distributed commercial absorption photometers. We further demonstrate that an unstable laser transmission signal in the Sunset Thermal/Optical <b>Carbon</b> <b>Analyser</b> possibly causes a bias in the fractioning of total carbon (TC) into OC and EC. The laser transmission signal during the analysis of instrument blank filters can give an indication of the possible bias.

It is therefore important to monitor the stability of the laser transmission signal during an instrument blank analysis frequently...|$|E

TSP was collected using a low volume sampler. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations were measured using a thermal–optical <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser.</b> Parallel samplers collected TSP for subsequent GC-MS analysis of thirty-nine combustion-associated organic compounds; 16 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 23 n-alkanes. OC and EC correlate well at all sites (r 2 = 0. 39 – 0. 65), although the London inter-site correlations were low, suggesting that local sources of OC and EC have a significant influence on local concentrations. Concentrations do not vary widely across the four urban sites, despite the significant differences in urban characteristics. Seasonal patterns of OCEC ratios were similar at the London and Vienna sites, with highest ratios in autumn and winter, and annual mean OCEC ratios were identical at these sites. The Carbon Preference Index (CPI) indicated vehicle emissions to have a stronger influence over particulate concentrations at the Vienna and central London sites; there was a stronger biogenic signature in north London and Porto.

A single particle soot photometer and a <b>carbon</b> monoxide <b>analyser</b> were deployed during the Chinese Lunar Year (CLY) and on weekdays at Xi’an, China, to investigate the characteristics of refractory black carbon aerosol (rBC). The rBC mass on weekdays (8. 4  μg·m− 3) exceeds that during the CLY (1. 9 μg·m− 3), presumably due to the lower anthropogenic emissions during the latter. The mass size distribution of rBC shows a primary mode peak at ~ 205 nm and a small secondary mode peak at ~ 102 -nm volume-equivalent diameter assuming 2 g·cm− 3 in void-free density in both sets of samples. More than half of the rBC cores are thickly coated during the CLY (fBC = 57. 5 %); the percentage is slightly lower (fBC = 48. 3 %) on weekdays. Diurnal patterns in rBC mass and mixing state differ for the two sampling periods, which are attributed to the distinct anthropogenic activities.

40|$|RATIONALE Quantifying the {{processes}} that control dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics in aquatic systems is essential for progress in ecosystem carbon budgeting. The development of a methodology that allows high-resolution temporal data collection over prolonged periods is essential and is described in this study. METHODS A novel sampling instrument that sequentially acidifies aliquots of water and utilises gas-permeable ePTFE tubing to measure the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration and δ 13 CDIC values at sub-hourly intervals by Cavity Ring-down spectrometry (CRDS) is described. RESULTS The minimum sensitivity of the isotopic, continuous, automated dissolved inorganic <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> (ISO-CADICA) system is 0. 01 [*]mM with an accuracy of 0. 008 [*]mM. The analytical uncertainty in δ 13 CDIC values {{is proportional to the}} concentration of DIC in the sample. Where the DIC concentration is greater than 0. 3 [*]mM the analytical uncertainty is ± 0. 1 ‰ and below 0. 2 [*]mM stability is[*]<[*]± 0. 3 ‰. The isotopic effects of air temperature, water temperature and CO 2 concentrations were found to either be negligible or correctable. Field trials measuring diel variation in δ 13 CDIC values of coral reef associated sea water revealed significant, short-term temporal changes and illustrated the necessity of this technique. CONCLUSIONS Currently, collecting and analysing large numbers of samples for δ 13 CDIC measurements is not trivial, but essential for accurate carbon models, particularly on small scales. The ISO-CADICA enables on-site, high-resolution determination of DIC concentration and δ 13 CDIC values with no need for sample storage and laboratory analysis.

40|$|The {{measurements}} of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in seawater are key in global change and coastal eutrophication studies. Nowadays, the high-temperature combustion (HTC) technique is a widely used method for DOC and TDN analysis. However, uncertainties exist about {{the operation of the}} catalyst in the conversion process of DOC and TDN in the HTC method. In this study, five different 'catalyst' materials were tested for their blanks, calibration slopes, and conversion efficiency of DOC and TDN using the Shimadzu TOC 5000 A total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> coupled to a Sievers NCD 255 nitrogen chemiluminescence detector. The materials included four metallic catalysts (Shimadzu and Johnson 0. 5 % Pt-alumina, 13 % Cu(II) O-alumina, 0. 5 % Pd-alumina) and quartz beads. The results indicated that DOC blank signals for the HTC approach using metallic catalysts with an alumina support are higher compared with quartz beads, {{as a result of the}} amphoteric nature of the alumina. However, the slopes of the standard calibration graphs were lowest for DOC and TDN determinations on the quartz beads. The DOC recoveries for the metallic catalysts were close to 100 % for all compounds tested, with the exception of ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Using quartz beads, poor recoveries were obtained for a range of organic compounds, including the commonly used calibration compounds potassium hydrogen phthalate and glycine. The TDN recoveries for all compounds were typically > 90 %, with the exception of NaNO 2. Furthermore, analysis using the CuO-alumina and Pd-alumina catalysts and quartz beads showed low recoveries for NH 4 Cl. This study showed that catalyst performance should be verified on a regular basis using model compounds and blank checks made during every run, and that the Shimadzu 0. 5 % Pt-alumina material was an efficient catalyst for DOC and TDN analyses using the coupled total organic carbon-nitrogen chemiluminescence detector (TOC-NCD) analyser...|$|E

Laser-based CO 2 carbon isotope analysis provides continuous measurement at high temporal resolution and is a promising alternative to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). We performed a thorough assessment of a commercially available CO 2 <b>Carbon</b> Isotope <b>Analyser</b> (CCIA DLT- 100, Los Gatos Research) that allows in situ measurement of δ 13 C in CO 2. Using a set of reference gases of known CO 2 concentration and carbon isotopic composition, we evaluated the precision, long-term stability, temperature sensitivity and concentration dependence of the analyser. Despite good precision calculated from Allan variance (5. 0 ppm for CO 2 concentration, and 0. 05 h for δ 13 C at 60 s averaging), real performances are altered by two main sources of error: temperature sensitivity and dependence of δ 13 C on CO 2 concentration. Data processing is required to correct for these errors. Following application of these corrections, we achieve an accuracy of 8. 7 ppm for CO 2 concentration and 1. 3 h for δ 13 C, which is worse compared to mass spectrometry performance, but still allowing field applications. With this portable analyser we measured CO 2 flux degassed from rock in an underground tunnel.

40|$|Abstract Background. Patients with stroke {{are at risk}} {{to become}} {{physically}} inactive, which could {{increase the risk of}} developing severe physical problems. Therefore, it is important {{to find a way to}} encourage people with stroke to become and stay physically active. Wii-Sports can be a powerful tool to reach this goal. Objective. The aim of this study is two-tailed: (1) to determine the feasibility of using the Wii-system and (2) to determine energy expenditure of adults with a stroke playing Wii-Sports. Design. A cross-sectional pilot study. Methods. Ten patients were recruited who had ischemic infarct 6 months ago. Feasibility was measured with a custom-made questionnaire. Energy expenditure was calculated from the oxygen uptake during rest, standing, and during gaming, measured with a portable oxygen and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>analyser.</b> Patients played 15 minutes Wii-tennis and 15 minutes Wii-boxing in random order. Perceived exertion was measured with the Borgscale. Results. Wii-tennis was not feasible for three patients, due to problems with timing and coordination. Wii-boxing was feasible for all patients, but some patients had difficulties using the affected arm. Energy expenditure during tennis and boxing was significantly (p = 0. 018 and p = 0. 012) higher than resting energy expenditure and energy expenditure while standing. Mean energy expenditure when playing Wii-tennis was 3, 5 MET (range 2. 7 to 5. 0) and 4. 1 MET for boxing (range 3. 4 to 5. 7). There was no significant difference between tennis and boxing. Limitations. No submaximal stress test was executed, so it cannot be concluded whether cardiorespiratory fitness can be improved. Conclusions. Wii-Sports Boxing was feasible for all patients in this study. Energy expenditure is of high enough intensity to contribute to an active lifestyle in patients with stroke. Tennis was not feasible for all patients in this study and energy expenditure during Wii- tennis is dependent of the way people play the game...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{dissolved}} {{inorganic carbon}} (DIC) {{accounts for more than}} half the annual flux of carbon exported from terrestrial ecosystems via rivers. Here, we assess the relative influences of biogeochemical and hydrological processes on DIC fluxes exported from a tropical river catchment characterized by distinct land cover, climate and geology transition from the wet tropical mountains to the low-lying savanna plains. Processes controlling changes in river DIC were investigated using dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon and DIC concentrations and stable isotope ratios of DIC (C- 13 (DIC)) at two time scales: seasonal and diel. The recently developed Isotopic Continuous Dissolved Inorganic <b>Carbon</b> <b>Analyser</b> was used to measure diel DIC concentration and C- 13 (DIC) changes at a 15 -min temporal resolution. Results highlight the predominance of biologically mediated processes (photosynthesis and respiration) controlling diel changes in DIC. These resulted in DIC concentrations varying between 3. 55 and 3. 82 mg/l and C- 13 (DIC) values ranging from - 19. 7 +/- 0. 31 parts per thousand to - 17. 1 +/- 0. 08 parts per thousand. In contrast, at the seasonal scale, we observed wet season DIC variations predominantly from mixing processes and dry season DIC variations due to both mixing processes and biological processes. The observed wet season increases in DIC concentrations (by 6. 81 mg/l) and C- 13 (DIC) values of river water (by 5. 4 parts per thousand) largely result from proportional increases in subsurface inflows from the savanna plains (C- 4 vegetation) region relative to inflows from the rainforest (C- 3 vegetation) highlands. The high DIC river load during the wet season resulted in the transfer of 97 % of the annual river carbon load. Therefore, in this gaining river, there are significant seasonal variations in both the hydrological and carbon cycles, and there is evidence of substantial coupling between the carbon cycles of the terrestrial and the fluvial environments. Recent identification of a substantial carbon sink in the savannas of northern Australia during wetter years in the recent past {{does not take into account}} the possibility of a substantial, rapid, lateral flux of carbon to rivers and back to the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 7 -week {{sampling}} campaigns {{were conducted in}} urban background sites of six European cities as follows: Duisburg (autumn), Prague (winter), Amsterdam (winter), Helsinki (spring), Barcelona (spring) and Athens (summer). The campaigns were scheduled to include seasons of local public health concern due to high particulate concentrations or findings in previously conducted epidemiological studies. Aerosol samples were collected in parallel with two identical virtual impactors that divide air particles into fine (PM 2. 5) and coarse (PM 2. 5 - 10) size ranges. From the collected filter samples, elemental (EC) and organic (OC) carbon contents were analysed with a thermal-optical <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> (TOA); total Ca, Ti, Fe, Si, Al and K by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF); As, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS); Ca 2 +, succinate, malonate and oxalate by ion chromatography (IC); and the sum of levoglucosan+galactosan+mannosan (&#x 2211;MA) by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The campaign means of PM 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 - 10 were 8. 3 - 29. 6 µg m - 3 and 5. 4 - 28. 7 µg m - 3, respectively. The contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) to PM 2. 5 ranged from 21 % in Barcelona to 54 % in Prague, while that to PM 2. 5 - 10 ranged from 10 % in Barcelona to 27 % in Prague. The contribution of EC was higher to PM 2. 5 (5 - 9 %) than to PM 2. 5 - 10 (1 - 6 %) in all the six campaigns. Carbonate (C(CO 3), that interferes with the TOA analysis, was detected in PM 2. 5 - 10 of Athens and Barcelona but not elsewhere. It was subtracted from the OC by a simple integration method that was validated. The CaCO 3 accounted for 55 % and 11 % of PM 2. 5 - 10 in Athens and Barcelona, respectively. It was anticipated that combustion emissions from vehicle engines affected the POM content in PM 2. 5 of all the six sampling campaigns, but a comparison of mass concentration ratios of the selected inorganic and organic tracers of common sources of organic material to POM suggested also interesting differences in source dominance during the campaign periods: Prague (biomass and coal combustion), Barcelona (fuel oil combustion, secondary photochemical organics) and Athens (secondary photochemical organics). The on-going toxicological studies will clarify the health significance of these findings...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of surface}} {{water in the}} {{presence}} of natural organic matters (NOM) becomes a challenging issue to meet stringent rules of Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane is emerging as an efficient technology for the purpose of potable water production. However, membrane fouling, ageing and chemical cleaning affect its performance and properties. The effects of ageing and chemical cleaning on performance and properties of the membrane were studied using UF membrane from full scale drinking water membrane filtration plant and simulated chemical cleaning sequences in laboratory. Organic and inorganic foulants, and membrane properties such as tensile strength, membrane morphology and surface functional groups were characterized using various analytical tools. The results from simulated chemical cleaning experiments were consistent with those from a full-scale plant, in terms of the effects of chemical cleaning on membrane properties. The results show that membrane ageing deteriorated the tensile strength and membrane integrity, and led to accumulation of foulants. Hypochlorite cleaning resulted in a decrease in membrane tensile strength, while citric acid cleaning had limited effect on membrane tensile strength. The decrease in membrane tensile strength correlated to a decrease in intensity of functional groups measured by FTIR. The results suggest that hypochlorite concentration and cleaning time should be minimized to reduce their impacts on membrane properties. Additionally, membrane cleaning strategies (cleaning agents? concentration, cleaning time, pH, backwash frequency, and production time) currently used in Bare Point Water Treatment Plant were studied using a ZW- 1000 pilot scale plant. The membrane performance in terms of permeability recovery was assessed using the recorded data; and organic and inorganic foulants were analyzed using Total Organic <b>Carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> (TOC) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). In sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) cleaning, lower concentrations combined with longer soak time achieved higher permeability recovery, with TOC results indicating that the major foulants responsible for permeability decrease were organic. Similarly, the results of citric acid cleaning suggest that lower pH was more effective in permeability recovery. Furthermore, the effect of production cycle or backwash frequency on the membrane performance was also studied to optimize water recovery; the results revealed that the membrane performances, fouling rate in terms of rate of change of TMP, recovery (%), and organic fouling depended on permeate cycle length or back wash frequency. This research concludes with the hypothesis that membrane fouling and ageing deteriorate membrane performance, whereas chemical cleaning agent (NaClO) enhances membrane performance and properties, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different apparatuses, procedures and calculations on the precision of the optimized carbon monoxide method. Total haemoglobin mass was determined twice on consecutive days in 11 subjects using both venous and capillary blood samples. To estimate loss of carbon monoxide due to exhalation, carbon monoxide concentration was measured by two portable <b>carbon</b> monoxide <b>analysers</b> (Fluke CO- 220, Fluke, Norwich, UK and Pac 7000 Carbon Monoxide, Draeger Safety, Northumberland, UK) and alveolar ventilation was specified using an automated metabolic gas analysis system (Cosmed Quark b 2, Cosmed, Rome, Italy). Blood volume was derived from total haemoglobin mass using haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit obtained in both the supine and the seated position. Two different formulae to calculate blood volume were also compared. Precision was good for both total haemoglobin mass and blood volume measurements performed on consecutive days (typical error &# 60; 2 %). Using Fluke CO- 220 analyser, an estimated alveolar ventilation and capillary blood, total haemoglobin mass (917 ± 136 g) was similar when compared to the Pac 7000 Draeger CO-analyser (904 ± 137 g; mean bias – 13 g with 95 % limits of agreement – 26 to + 1 g, P= 0. 76), specified alveolar ventilation (911 ± 132 g, mean bias – 6 g with 95 % limits of agreement – 18 g to + 6 g, P = 0. 87) and venous blood (917 ± 134 g, mean bias 0 g with 95 % limits of agreement – 38 to + 38 g, P= 0. 99), respectively. Blood volume determination was also not significantly affected by the supine vs. seated position (6. 7 ± 0. 8 l vs. 6. 6 ± 0. 8 l, P= 0. 56) but can deviate by ~ 0. 6 l (P= 0. 01) depending on the formula applied. Thus, the good precision of the assessment of total haemoglobin mass and blood volume using the optimized carbon monoxide rebreathing method is not significantly influenced by the make of CO analyser, method of obtaining alveolar ventilation, blood sampling method and subject position, but should for longitudinal monitoring purposes use the same formula...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{exercise on}} thermal-optical elemental carbon/organic <b>carbon</b> (ECOC) <b>analysers</b> {{was carried out}} among 17 European laboratories. Contrary to previous comparison exercises, the 17 participants made use of an identical instrument set-up, after correcting for temperature offsets with {{the application of a}} recently developed temperature calibration kit (Sunset Laboratory Inc, OR, US). Temperature offsets reported by participants ranged from − 93 to + 100 °C per temperature step. Five filter samples and two sucrose solutions were analysed with both the EUSAAR 2 and NIOSH 870 thermal protocols. z scores were calculated for total carbon (TC); nine outliers and three stragglers were identified. Three outliers and eight stragglers were found for EC. Overall, the participants provided results between the warning levels with the exception of two laboratories that showed poor performance, the causes of which were identified and corrected through the course of the comparison exercise. The TC repeatability and reproducibility (expressed as relative standard deviations) were 11 and 15 % for EUSAAR 2 and 9. 2 and 12 % for NIOSH 870; the standard deviations for EC were 15 and 20 % for EUSAAR 2 and 20 and 26 % for NIOSH 870. TC was in good agreement between the two protocols, TC NIOSH 870 = 0. 98 × TC EUSAAR 2 (R 2 = 1. 00, robust means). Transmittance (TOT) calculated EC for NIOSH 870 was found to be 20 % lower than for EUSAAR 2, EC NIOSH 870 = 0. 80 × EC EUSAAR 2 (R 2 = 0. 96, robust means). The thermograms and laser signal values were compared and similar peak patterns were observed per sample and protocol for most participants. Notable deviations from the typical patterns indicated either the absence or inaccurate application of the temperature calibration procedure and/or pre-oxidation during the inert phase of the analysis. Low or zero pyrolytic organic carbon (POC), as reported by a few participants, is suggested as an indicator of an instrument-specific pre-oxidation. A sample-specific pre-oxidation effect was observed for filter G, for all participants and both thermal protocols, indicating the presence of oxygen donors on the suspended particulate matter. POC (TOT) levels were lower for NIOSH 870 than for EUSAAR 2, which is related to the heating profile differences of the two thermal protocols...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Coal {{from the}} Highveld seam 4 deposit was studied to {{determine}} {{and understand the}} influence of density and particle size on the high temperature combustion characteristics. All of the charring, {{as well as the}} combustion experiments were conducted in a high temperature horizontal tube furnace where charring was done at 1100 °C and combustion at 1000 °C. The furnace was equipped with carbon monoxide and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>analysers</b> to monitor <b>carbon</b> conversion during experimentation. The parent coal was characterised in terms of proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, calorific value analysis and FTIR analysis. The chars were investigated with FTIR analysis. The coals were categorized according to density from + 1. 4 g. cm- 3 to - 2. 0 g. cm- 3 using 0. 2 g. cm- 3 intervals and the particle size effect was studied using particles of 20, 30 and 40 mm diameter. The characterization results showed that the moisture content of the coal samples tended to decrease as the particle density increased and that the smaller particles tended to have a higher moisture content. The volatile matter and fixed carbon content decreased as the coal density increased, while both had a relatively even distribution across the size ranges. The ash content was found to significantly increase as the density increased. Elemental analysis revealed that that carbon-, hydrogen- and nitrogen- content decreased as density increased with a relatively even distribution of the different size ranges. High sulphur values were observed in the high density particles. This was attributed to a higher pyrite content in this fraction. Smaller particles tended to have a higher oxygen content. Calorific value analysis showed that the high density fraction had a very low heating value and that the overall sample value would be improved by removing the high density fraction. FTIR analysis showed that the properties of density separated fractions varied significantly; this was most prominent in the substitution structures occurring on the aromatic structures. It was found that the chemical composition of the size separated particles remained relatively constant. The properties of char particles with different densities tended to become more similar, especially with regard to their aromatic substitution structures. The characterization of the different coal samples showed that the parameters were generally significantly different for the different density fractions but did not vary significantly across the particle size ranges. It was also found that significant shattering occurred at heating rates of 50 °C/min, while very little shattering was observed at 15 °C/min. The low density particles formed porous ash residues, while the high density particles formed very hard and solid ash residues that could contain unreacted carbon in the core. Combustion studies showed that particle density and size had a significant influence on the time required for complete conversion of the chars. The low density particles required less time for full conversion than the high density particles and the smaller particles reacted faster than the larger particles. Modelling of the experimental data showed that the shrinking unreacted core model can be used to describe the combustion characteristics of both the size and density separated particles. The controlling mechanism was found to be a combination of internal and external diffusion. From the modelling results it was found that effective ash layer diffusion became more prominent as the density increased and that the obtained mass transfer coefficients correlated well with values found in literature.
