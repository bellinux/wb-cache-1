5|$|Tbr1 is {{expressed}} mainly in early-born postmitotic neurons {{of the developing}} cerebral cortex—in particular, the preplate and layer VI neurons. The preplate forms the architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate. Successive migrations of neurons divide the preplate such that its inner cells form the <b>cortical</b> plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone. The <b>cortical</b> plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six <b>cortical</b> layers, known as the neocortex, present in the mature cerebral cortex. These layers are numbered I-VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first, while the remaining layers grow outward from it (from V to I). Layers II-VI develop from the <b>cortical</b> plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone. The subplate, intermediate zone, subventricular zone, and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing <b>cortical</b> layers. High expression of Tbr1 {{is seen in the}} marginal zone, <b>cortical</b> plate, and subplate of the developing cortex whereas little expression is seen in the subventricular zone. No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in <b>cortical</b> stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between <b>cortical</b> areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
5|$|Oscarsson in {{the late}} 1970s {{proposed}} that these <b>cortical</b> zones can be partitioned into smaller units called microzones. A microzone {{is defined as a}} group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic receptive field. Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the <b>cortical</b> folds. Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates, Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened {{in the same direction as}} the microzones extend, while parallel fibers cross them at right angles.|$|E
5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying <b>cortical</b> and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many <b>cortical</b> and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} proper {{neuronal}} migration through the <b>cortical</b> plate (CP) is an inside-out arrangement of neurons, where the younger neurons migrate past the older neurons to their proper locations. Studies in reeler mutant mice show that knocking out the reeler gene results in aberrant migration {{as well as}} outside-in layering, in which younger neurons are unable to travel past the older ones. Such abnormal layering is also seen in VLDLR−apoER2− and dab1- mutants, indicating {{the importance of this}} entire pathway in <b>cortical</b> migration of the developing embryo.|$|E
5|$|While {{language}} functions were traditionally {{thought to}} be localized to Wernicke's area and Broca's area, it is now mostly accepted that a wider network of <b>cortical</b> regions contributes to language functions.|$|E
5|$|ApoER2 plays a {{critical}} role as a receptor in the reelin signalling pathway, which is important for brain development and postnatal function of the brain. This pathway specifically affects <b>cortical</b> migration and long-term potentiation.|$|E
5|$|The living {{brain is}} very soft, having a gel-like {{consistency}} similar to soft tofu. The <b>cortical</b> layers of neurons constitute {{much of the}} brain's grey matter, while the deeper subcortical regions of myelinated axons, make up the white matter.|$|E
25|$|Although {{men have}} bigger brain size which is partly {{explained}} by their bigger bodies, women have greater <b>cortical</b> thickness, <b>cortical</b> complexity and <b>cortical</b> surface area (controlling for body size) which compensates for smaller brain size. Meta-analysis and {{studies have found}} that brain size explains 6–12% of variance among individual intelligence and <b>cortical</b> thickness explains 5%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cortical</b> organization, {{especially}} in sensory systems, {{is often described}} in terms of maps. For example, sensory information from the foot projects to one <b>cortical</b> site and the projections from the hand target another site. As a result, the <b>cortical</b> representation of sensory inputs from the body resembles a somatotopic map, often described as the sensory homunculus.|$|E

25|$|Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) {{images are}} the most sensitive. In about 24% of cases DWI shows only <b>cortical</b> hyperintensity; in 68%, <b>cortical</b> and {{subcortical}} abnormalities; and in 5%, only subcortical anomalies.|$|E
25|$|Various {{degrees of}} {{intensity}} and locations of epilepsy {{are associated with}} malformations of <b>cortical</b> development. Researchers suggest that approximately 40% of children diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy have some degree of <b>cortical</b> malformation.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between phantom limb sensation and neuroplasticity {{is a complex}} one. In the early 1990s V.S. Ramachandran theorized that phantom limbs {{were the result of}} <b>cortical</b> remapping. However, in 1995 Herta Flor and her colleagues demonstrated that <b>cortical</b> remapping occurs only in patients who have phantom pain. Her research showed that phantom limb pain (rather than referred sensations) was the perceptual correlate of <b>cortical</b> reorganization. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as maladaptive plasticity.|$|E
25|$|In a scoliotic patient, the {{vertebral}} column experiences extension {{forces on the}} convex side and compression forces on the concave side. At the apical vertebra, average bone density for the concave <b>cortical</b> bone is higher than for the convex <b>cortical</b> bone, and cancellous bone density is higher for the concave side than for the convex side. The concave side of a vertebra is less porous and has a thicker <b>cortical</b> bone than the convex side, {{which is consistent with}} Wolff’s law about bone remodeling.|$|E
25|$|However, extra-neuronal vacuolization {{can also}} be seen in other disease states. Diffuse <b>cortical</b> vacuolization occurs in Alzheimer's disease, and {{superficial}} <b>cortical</b> vacuolization occurs in ischemia and frontotemporal dementia. These vacuoles appear clear and punched-out. Larger vacuoles encircling neurons, vessels, and glia are a possible processing artifact.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Galaburda and Kemper and Galaburda et al. 1985, {{reported}} {{observations from}} {{the examination of}} post autopsy brains of people with dyslexia. Observed anatomical differences in the language center in a dyslexic brain, showing microscopic <b>cortical</b> malformations known as s and more rarely vascular micro-malformations {{and in some instances}} these <b>cortical</b> malformations appeared as a microgyrus. These studies and those of Cohen et al. 1989, suggested abnormal <b>cortical</b> development which was presumed to occur before or during the sixth month of foetal brain development.|$|E
25|$|Many {{research}} studies {{of individuals with}} amusia show {{that a number of}} <b>cortical</b> regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the primary auditory cortex, secondary auditory cortex, and limbic system are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other <b>cortical</b> areas, abnormalities in <b>cortical</b> thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to amusia. While various causes of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} an {{association}} between ocular <b>cortical</b> cataracts and UVB exposure, using crude approximations of exposure and various cataract assessment techniques. A detailed assessment of ocular exposure to UVB {{was carried out in}} a study on Chesapeake Bay Watermen, where increases in average annual ocular exposure were associated with increasing risk of <b>cortical</b> opacity. In this highly exposed group of predominantly white males, the evidence linking <b>cortical</b> opacities to sunlight exposure was the strongest to date. Based on these results, ozone depletion is predicted to cause hundreds of thousands of additional cataracts by 2050.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cortical</b> {{stimulation}} mapping is {{used for}} somatotopy to determine {{the areas of the}} cerebral cortex that connect through nerve fibers with different body parts. <b>Cortical</b> stimulation identifies which regions of the brain are vital for certain functions, thereby allowing a 'map' to be made which can be used to decide if brain areas are safe to remove. <b>Cortical</b> stimulation mapping {{led to the development of}} a homunculus for the motor and sensory cortices, which is a diagram showing the brain's connections to different areas of the body. An example is the <b>cortical</b> homunculus of the primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex, which are separated by the central sulcus. The diagram starts in the longitudinal fissure and continues out laterally from the center of the brain, representing the general pattern from lower extremities and genitals in the fissure up to the hands and face on outer edges of the brain.|$|E
25|$|DMSA {{scintigraphy}} is {{used for}} the evaluation of the paranchymal damage, which is seen as <b>cortical</b> scars. After the first febrile UTI, the diagnostic role of an initial scintigraphy for detecting the damage before the VCUG was investigated and it was suggested that VCUG can be omitted in children who has no <b>cortical</b> scars and urinary tract dilatation.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of <b>cortical</b> gyrification {{are just beginning}} to be understood. Mechanical buckling forces due to the expanding brain tissue probably cause the <b>cortical</b> surface to fold. This {{is an example of how}} pattern formation in nature can also take place due to elastic instabilities instead of the classical reaction-diffusion mechanism first proposed by Alan Turing.|$|E
25|$|Honokiol {{has been}} shown to promote neurite {{outgrowth}} and have neuroprotective effects in rat <b>cortical</b> neurons. Additionally, honokiol increases free cytoplasmic Ca2+ in rat <b>cortical</b> neurons. Honokiol is a weak cannabinoid CB2 receptor ligand but the naturally occurring derivative 4-O-methylhonokiol was shown to be a potent and selective cannabinoid CB2 receptor inverse agonist and to possess antiosteoclastic effects.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently, the multisensory neurons of the AES, {{although}} also integrally {{connected to}} unimodal AES neurons, {{are not directly}} connected to the SC. This pattern of division is reflected {{in other areas of}} the cortex, resulting in the observation that <b>cortical</b> and tectal multisensory systems are somewhat dissociated. Stein, London, Wilkinson and Price (1996) analysed the perceived luminance of an LED in the context of spatially disparate auditory distracters of various types. A significant finding was that a sound increased the perceived brightness of the light, regardless of their relative spatial locations, provided the light's image was projected onto the fovea. Here, the apparent lack of the spatial rule, further differentiates <b>cortical</b> and tectal multisensory neurons. Little empirical evidence exists to justify this dichotomy. Nevertheless, <b>cortical</b> neurons governing perception, and a separate sub <b>cortical</b> system governing action (orientation behavior) is synonymous with the perception action hypothesis of the visual stream. Further investigation into this field is necessary before any substantial claims can be made.|$|E

25|$|Each HTM region {{consists}} {{of a number of}} highly interconnected <b>cortical</b> columns. A region is similar to layer III of the neocortex. A <b>cortical</b> column is understood as a group of cells that have the same receptive field. Each column has a number of cells that are able to remember several previous states. A cell can be in one of three states: active, inactive and predictive state.|$|E
25|$|Amusia has {{recently}} been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities. Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that amusia is related to dyslexia and other similar disorders. Research {{has been shown that}} amusia may be related to an increase in size of the cerebral cortex, which may be a result of a malformation in <b>cortical</b> development. Diseases such as dyslexia and epilepsy are due to a malformation in <b>cortical</b> development and also lead to an increase in <b>cortical</b> thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} phenomenon involving plasticity of <b>cortical</b> maps is {{the phenomenon}} of phantom limb sensation. Phantom limb sensation is experienced {{by people who have}} undergone amputations in hands, arms, and legs, but it is not limited to extremities. Although the neurological basis of phantom limb sensation is still not entirely understood it is believed that <b>cortical</b> reorganization plays an important role.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity can be {{observed}} at multiple scales, from microscopic changes in individual neurons to larger-scale changes such as <b>cortical</b> remapping in response to injury. However, <b>cortical</b> remapping is more extensive early in development. Behavior, environmental stimuli, thought, and emotions may also cause neuroplastic change through activity-dependent plasticity, which has significant implications for healthy development, learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{neuronal}} migration {{involves the}} development of six <b>cortical</b> layers, each one performing distinct functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{depth of}} {{penetration}} differs between species, with some being superficially confined to the epidermis (such as in Eucalyptus and Alnus), whereas in other cases the hyphae extend to the <b>cortical</b> cells or to the endodermis (as {{is the case in}} most gymnosperms). In many epidermal types, radial elongation of epidermal cells occurs. However, this is largely absent in the <b>cortical</b> type, suggesting different strategies of increasing surface contact among species.|$|E

25|$|NMDs {{occur in}} the {{instance}} that 1) neuroblasts do not migrate {{from all of the}} ventricles or migrate only part of the way, 2) only some of the neuroblasts reach the <b>cortical</b> layer, 3) neuroblasts overshoot the appropriate <b>cortical</b> layer and protrude into the subarachnoid space, or 4) the late stage organization of the neuronal layer in the cortex is disrupted.
