5|$|After {{the release}} of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and {{keyboard}} player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he {{did not wish to}} continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, {{was in the process of}} setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Albert Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.|$|E
5|$|Downes was {{chairman}} of the Masseurs' Registration Board, a councillor of the Victorian division of the Australian Red Cross, and chairman of the Red Cross National Council. He was Victorian State Commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade for 25 years. He was also president of the St John Ambulance Association for eight years, and chairman of the Victorian Civil Ambulance Service from 1937 to 1938. In 1930, he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John, and later became a Knight of Grace of the order in 1937. At the same time, Doris became an Officer of the Order of Saint John, in recognition for her fund raising efforts for the Victorian branch. She also later served as a member of its council from 1942 to 1953. Downes was instrumental in persuading the various state branches to <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> a national organisation, arguing that without a national body, the organisation would be eclipsed by the Red Cross.|$|E

25|$|MD 564 {{begins at}} a partial {{interchange}} with MD 450 (Annapolis Road) in Lanham. There is no access from westbound MD 450 to eastbound MD 564 or from westbound MD 564 to eastbound MD 450. Eastbound MD 564 exits from eastbound MD 450, passes under MD 450, and meets westbound MD 564 at an intersection where heading straight leads to Cipriano Road. The two directions of MD 564 <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> Lanham Severn Road, a two-lane road heading northeast paralleling the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line at a distance. The state highway crosses Baldhill Branch and {{passes through the}} unincorporated community of Seabrook, where the road intersects Seabrook Road and passes the Seabrook MARC station. After passing through a commercial area in Seabrook, MD 564 passes several industrial properties on the railroad side of the highway. The state highway enters Glenn Dale, where the highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway for intersections with Glenn Dale Road (unsigned MD 953A) and MD 193 (Glenn Dale Boulevard).|$|E
25|$|The one-way pair of MD 129 passes {{between the}} Upton {{neighborhood}} {{to the southwest}} and Madison Park to the northeast. Both streets pass through Druid Heights, where they intersect North Avenue, which carries US 1 and US 40 Truck. MD 129's constituent streets pass between the Reservoir Hill neighborhood to the northeast and PennNorth to the southwest. McCulloh Street and Druid Hill Avenue <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> Auchentoroly Terrace (also known as Swann Drive) at Druid Park Lake Drive, where MD 129 starts to follow the southwestern edge of Druid Hill Park and the northeastern edge of the Woodbrook neighborhood. Northbound MD 129 has three to five lanes while the southbound direction has three travel lanes. The boulevard passes the Howard Peters Rawlings Conservatory and Botanic Gardens of Baltimore then intersects Liberty Heights Avenue, which becomes MD 26 west of MD 140, and Greenspring Avenue, which enters the park and provides access to The Maryland Zoo. One block north of that intersection, MD 129 meets MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at an oblique directional intersection that prevents direct access from northbound MD 129 to southbound MD 140 and from northbound MD 140 to southbound MD 129, movements which are provided via Liberty Heights Avenue.|$|E

She felt that Baldwin's great acting was [...] "not unique to this episode", and was what earned him the Golden Globe. Ward finished her review by {{saying that it was}} [...] "satisfying to see a show <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> 30 Rock [...] past few weeks- settling into its rhythm [...] finding its feet". Eric Goldman of IGN felt that this episode [...] "did a very skillful job of juggling three different storylines, all of which delivered solid laughs".

He also enjoyed Tracy and Kenneth's subplot, saying it [...] "was a decent one".|$|E
500|$|Richard Eisenbeis at Kotaku found Takumi very unlikable, to {{the point}} of being unsure whether the player is meant to sympathize with him.

Despite this, he found the plot and world gripping, and said that the game was not bad, but that it [...] "might as well be nothing" [...] compared to Steins;Gate. Jenni Lada at TechnologyTell recommended the game, calling it an interesting and mature story, but noted its lack of an English release as unfortunate. Game Informer included Chaos;Head on a list of games they wanted to see localized; they considered a localized version likely due to Steins;Gate English release in 2014.|$|E

[...] "He described them as these underlying platforms," [...] said Horowitz, [...] "that would then coalesce and then {{the way you would}} go from round to round in the game is you defeat someone, they kinda <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> you see in the movie." [...] After giving his intake, Kosinski sent various sketches of the scene to the writers and would often revise the script. Kitsis thought that illustrating the character's stories to be the most difficult task in writing Tron: Legacy. The writers collaborated with the creative process throughout production, which was helpful especially considering the difficulties of describing in a tangible way a digital world that [...] "in its very nature defies basic screenwriting conventions." ...|$|E
