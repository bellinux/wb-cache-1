40|$|Abortion among {{dairy cattle}} {{is one of}} the major causes of {{economic}} losses in the livestock industry. This study describes a 1 -step multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect Brucella spp., Leptospira spp. and <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>foetus,</b> these are significant bacteria commonly implicated in bovine abortion. ÃŸ-actin was added to the same PCR reaction as an internal control to detect any extraction failure or PCR inhibition. The detection limit of multiplex real-time PCR using purified DNA from cultured organisms was set to 5 fg for Leptospira spp. and C. foetus and to 50 fg for Brucella spp. The multiplex real-time PCR did not produce any non-specific amplification when tested with different strains of the 3 pathogens. This multiplex real-time PCR provides a valuable tool for diagnosis, simultaneous and rapid detection for the 3 pathogens causing abortion in bovine...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{observational study}} of a breeding season in a Saskatchewan community pasture was carried out to determine the cause or causes of a chronic infertility problem. There were 774 cows, from 27 herds, divided into 4 breeding groups (A,B,C,D) on the pasture. Cows entering the pasture in May were weighed, had their body condition scored and height measured. All bulls received breeding soundness examinations and a preputial wash, which was cultured for Tritrichomonas foetus and <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>foetus</b> subsp. venerealis. In July, cows were also weighed and had their body condition scored and again {{when they left the}} pasture. In addition, cows were pregnancy checked when they left the pasture. Bulls were tested again for Tritrichomonas foetus {{at the end of the}} grazing season. Two breeding groups had T. foetus-positive bulls and an average pregnancy of 84 %, which was significantly lower than that of the two T. foetus negative groups (93. 5 %) (P = 0. 0001). A cow was 2. 97 times less likely to be pregnant if she had been exposed to T. foetus-positive bulls. Cows with average daily gains above the mean for the pasture were 2. 12 times more likely to be pregnant. Body condition score upon entering and leaving the pasture, height, age, and breeding group were significant predictors of average daily gain...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} safety of semen two {{approaches}} can be applied: checking the end product, or continuous surveillance of the bulls before and after semen production. The first method is examination of semen {{for the presence of}} infectious agents. This method depends completely on a single investigation and therefore relies only on the sensitivity of the test method. The second method is testing the bulls for diseases before and after semen collection, based on sequential investigations for the absence of either pathogens or antibodies against infectious agents. The EU-Directive 88 / 407 prescribes that bulls in AI stations must be monitored for the absence of diseases, but only at 12 -monthly intervals, which is a severe disadvantage. Furthermore, the directive is specific neither in the tests to be carried out nor in the specification of some pathogens (e. g. <b>Campylobacter</b> <b>foetus).</b> A programme is presented based on monthly testing of a limited number of bulls for the absence of endemic diseases only, on the basis of Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). This method only applies to diseases with high transmission rates. Testing some 20 % of the animals on a monthly basis can monitor these highly contagious diseases (e. g. IBR). To monitor BVDv infections, however, monthly testing of all negative animals and semen culture or semen PCR of animals that have seroconverted for this virus seems necessary. Endemic diseases with slow transmission rates in bulls do not suit such a system and can only be monitored on an individual basis...|$|E
