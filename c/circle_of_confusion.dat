25|$|For 6x6 cm format {{enlarged}} to 8x8 {{inches and}} viewed at 25cm, the enlargement is 3.4X, hence the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> criterion is about 1/(3.4 x 4) = 0.07mm.|$|E

25|$|Several other factors, such {{as subject}} matter, movement, camera-to-subject distance, lens focal length, {{selected}} lens f-number, format size, and <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> criteria also influence when a given defocus becomes noticeable.

25|$|Cropping {{an image}} and {{enlarging}} {{to the same}} size final image as an uncropped image taken under the same conditions is equivalent to using a smaller format; the cropped image requires greater enlargement and consequently has a smaller <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> A cropped then enlarged image has less DOF than the uncropped image.|$|E

25|$|If the {{original}} image is enlarged {{to make the}} final image, the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> in {{the original}} image must be smaller than that in the final image by the ratio of enlargement. Cropping an image and enlarging to the same size final image as an uncropped image taken under the same conditions is equivalent to using a smaller format under the same conditions, so the cropped image has less DOF.

25|$|For full-frame 35mm still photography, the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> {{is usually}} {{chosen to be}} about 1/30mm. Because the human eye is capable of resolving a spot with {{diameter}} about 1/4mm at 25cm distance from the viewing eye, and the 35mm negative needs about an 8X enlargement to make an 8x10 inch print, it is sometimes argued that the criterion should be about 1/32mm on the 35mm negative, but 1/30mm is close enough.|$|E
25|$|For a given subject framing {{and camera}} position, the DOF is {{controlled}} by the lens aperture diameter, which is usually specified as the f-number, the ratio of lens focal length to aperture diameter. Reducing the aperture diameter (increasing the f-number) increases the DOF because the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> is shrunk directly and indirectly by reducing the light hitting the outside of the lens which is focused to a different point than light hitting the inside of the lens due to spherical aberration caused by the construction of the lens; however, it also reduces the amount of light transmitted, and increases diffraction, placing a practical limit {{on the extent to which}} DOF can be increased by reducing the aperture diameter.|$|E

5000|$|Similarly, {{out-of-focus}} points <b>of</b> light (<b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion)</b> {{appear as}} polygons {{with the same}} number of sides as the aperture has blades.

2500|$|Precise {{focus is}} {{possible}} at only one distance; at that distance, a point object {{will produce a}} point image. At any other distance, a point object is defocused, and will produce a blur spot shaped like the aperture, which {{for the purpose of}} analysis is usually assumed to be circular. When this circular spot is sufficiently small, it is indistinguishable from a point, and appears to be in focus; it is rendered as [...] "acceptably sharp". The diameter of the circle increases with distance from the point of focus; the largest circle that is indistinguishable from a point is known as the acceptable <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> or informally, simply as the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> The acceptable <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> is influenced by visual acuity, viewing conditions, and the amount by which the image is enlarged (Ray 2000, 52–53). The increase of the circle diameter with defocus is gradual, so the limits of depth of field are not hard boundaries between sharp and unsharp.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{f-number}} and <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> are constant, {{decreasing the}} focal length [...] increases {{the second term}} in the denominator, decreasing the denominator and increasing {{the value of the}} right-hand side, so that a shorter focal length gives greater DOF.|$|E

50|$|Real lenses do {{not focus}} all rays perfectly, {{so that even}} at best focus, a point is imaged as a spot rather than a point. The {{smallest}} such spot that a lens can produce {{is often referred to}} as the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> least <b>confusion.</b>|$|R
25|$|Traditional depth-of-field {{formulas}} {{and tables}} assume equal <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> for {{near and far}} objects. Some authors, such as Merklinger (1992), have suggested that distant objects often need to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, {{do not need to}} be so sharp. The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the hyperfocal distance, sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a traffic bollard in the foreground, this approach, termed the object field method by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.|$|R

We present a fast reconstruction filtering method for images generated with Monte Carlo-based rendering tech-niques. Our approach specializes in reducing global illumination noise {{in the presence of}} depth-of-field effects at very low sampling rates and interactive frame rates. We employ edge-aware filtering in the sample space to locally improve outgoing radiance of each sample. The improved samples are then distributed in the image plane using a fast, linear manifold-based approach supporting very large <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> We evaluate our filter by applying it to several images containing noise caused by Monte Carlo-simulated global illumination, area light sources and depth-of-field. We show that our filter can efficiently denoise such images at interactive frame rates on current GPUs and with as few as four to 16 samples per pixel. Our method operates only on the color and geometric sample information output of the initial rendering process. It does not make any assumptions on the underlying rendering technique and sampling strategy and can therefore be implemented completely as a post-process filter...|$|R
