40|$|Actin {{filaments}} form cortical {{patches and}} emanating cables in fermenting cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This pattern {{has been shown}} to be depolarized in glucose-depleted cells after formaldehyde fixation and staining with rhodamine-tagged phalloidin. Loss of actin cables in mother cells was remarkable. Here we extend our knowledge on actin in live glucose-depleted cells co-expressing the marker of actin patches (Abp 1 -RFP) with the marker of actin cables (Abp 140 -GFP). Glucose depletion resulted in appearance of actin patches also in mother cells. However, even after 80 min of glucose deprivation these cells showed a clear network of actin cables labeled with Abp 140 -GFP in contrast to previously published data. In live cells with a mitochondrial dysfunction (rho 0 cells), glucose depletion resulted in almost immediate appearance of Abp 140 -GFP foci partially overlapping with Abp 1 -RFP patches in mother cells. Residual actin cables were <b>clustered</b> <b>in</b> patch-associated <b>bundles.</b> A similar overlapping “patchy” pattern of both actin markers was observed upon treatment of glucose-deprived rho+ cells with FCCP (the inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation) and upon treatment with formaldehyde. While the formaldehyde-targeted process stays unknown, our results indicate that published data on yeast actin cytoskeleton obtained from glucose-depleted cells after fixation should be considered with caution...|$|R
40|$|Snow-melting {{pavement}} {{technique is}} an advanced preservation method, which can prevent the forming of snow or {{ice on the}} pavement surface by increasing the temperature using an embedded heating system. The main scope {{of this study is}} to evaluate the impact of conductive additives on the heating efficiency. The electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity were considered to investigate effects of conductive additives, graphite, and carbon fibers on the snow-melting ability of asphalt mixtures. Also, the distribution of the conductive additives within the asphalt concrete body was investigated by microstructural imaging. An actual test was applied to simulate realistic heating for an asphalt concrete mixture. Thermal testing indicated that graphite and carbon fibers improve the snow-melting ability of asphalt mixes and their combination is more effective than when used alone. As observed in the microstructural image, carbon fibers show a long-range connecting effect among graphite conductive <b>clusters</b> and gather <b>in</b> <b>bundles</b> when added excessively. According to the actual test, adding the conductive additives helps improve snow-melting efficiency by shortening processing time and raising the surface temperature...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method to build a spatial model of the white matter fiber tracts. Knowledge of intra-bundle point {{correspondence}} between trajectories is essential for building such a model. Using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, fiber trajectories are <b>clustered</b> into <b>bundles</b> <b>in</b> a gamma mixture model context. Point correspondence is efficiently obtained though computing a distance map and a label map for each cluster at each iteration of the EM algorithm. The output of the algorithm is a probabilistic assignment of the fiber trajectories to each cluster {{as well as a}} model of each bundle defined with the average trajectory and its spatial variation. The constructed model provides an efficient way to study inter-subject and temporal variations of the fiber tracts as well as a fast 3 -D visualization method for neurosurgical applications...|$|R
40|$|Spindle microtubules (MTs) in PtK 1 cells, fixed at stages from {{metaphase}} to telophase, {{have been}} reconstructed using serial sections, electron microscopy, and computer image processing. We {{have studied the}} class of MTs that form an interdigitating system connecting the two spindle poles (interpolar MTs or ipMTs) {{and their relationship to}} the spindle MTs that attach to kinetochores (kMTs). Viewed in cross section, the ipMTs cluster with antiparallel near neighbors throughout mitosis; this bundling becomes much more pronounced as anaphase proceeds. While the minus ends of most kMTs are near the poles, those of the ipMTs are spread over half of the spindle length, with at least 50 % lying > 1. 5 microns from the poles. Longitudinal views of the ipMT bundles demonstrate a major rearrangement of their plus ends between mid- and late anaphase B. However, the minus ends of these MTs do not move appreciably farther from the spindle midplane, suggesting that sliding of these MTs contributes little to anaphase B. The minus ends of ipMTs are markedly <b>clustered</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bundles</b> of kMTs throughout anaphase A. These ends lie close to kMTs much more frequently than would be expected by chance, suggesting a specific interaction. As sister kinetochores separate and kMTs shorten, the minus ends of the kMTs remain associated with the spindle poles, but the minus ends of many ipMTs are released from the kMT bundles, allowing the spindle pole and the kMTs {{to move away from the}} ipMTs as the spindle elongates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel statistical fuzzy-segmentation method for diffusion tensor (DT) images and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes, e. g. those based on fuzzy-C-means (FCM), incorporate Gaussian class models which are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal <b>clusters.</b> Fiber <b>bundles</b> <b>in</b> DT images, however, comprise tensors that can inherently lie on more-complex manifolds. Unlike FCM-based schemes, the proposed method relies on modeling the manifolds underlying the classes by incorporating nonparametric datadriven statistical models. It produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel information-theoretic energy in a Markov-randomfield framework. For DT images, the paper describes a consistent statistical technique for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian DT spaces that incorporates two very recent works. In this way, the proposed method provides uncertainties in the segmentation decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial voluming, and inhomogeneity. The paper shows results on synthetic and real, DT {{as well as}} MR images. ...|$|R

40|$|Young barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Arivat) {{leaves were}} {{examined}} anatomically and physiologically to infer the pathway of transpirational water movement and {{to explain why}} the growing region is more responsive to osmotic stress than the expanded blade. Vessels with open lumens extend from the intercalary meristem to the expanded blade, and all vessels are <b>clustered</b> <b>in</b> five vascular <b>bundles</b> that are separated by 20 closely packed mesophyll cells. Heat pulse transport data confirmed the anatomical suggestion that water moves through the growing region in vessels and not intercellularly, and also showed that stress reduces xylem water transport within 1 minute while transpiration remained unaffected. Water equal in volume to twice that expected in the xylem, and which exchanges more readily with water in the nutrient solution than with most water in tissues, can be extracted easily from growing tissues. It is hypothesized that this water is xylem plus cell wall water, that osmotic stress will quickly reduce its in situ water potential, and that stress causes growth to stop because cells in the growing region can respond rapidly to changes in water potential around them. In the expanded blade, bundles containing vessels are three and eight cells away from the closest and next substomatal cavities. This allows xylem water loss to occur predominantly through the closest stomata, and the expanded blade is believed to be less responsive because effects of stress on xylem water potential are confined largely to cells immediately around the vessels...|$|R

40|$|Several {{photochemical}} and spectral {{properties of}} maize (Zea mays) bundle sheath and mesophyll chloroplasts are reported {{that provide a}} better understanding of the photosynthetic apparatus of C 4 plants. The difference absorption spectrum at 298 K and the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of chlorophyll at 298 K and 77 K provide new information on the different forms of chlorophyll a <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath and mesophyll chloroplasts: the former contain, relative to short wavelength chlorophyll a forms, more long wavelength chlorophyll a form (e. g. chlorophyll a 693 and chlorophyll a 705) and less chlorophyll b than the latter. The degree of polarization of chlorophyll a fluorescence is 6 % <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath and 4 % in mesophyll chloroplasts. This result is consistent with the presence of relatively high amounts of oriented long wavelength forms of chlorophyll a <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath compared to mesophyll chloroplasts. The relative yield of variable, with respect to constant, chorophyll a fluorescence in mesophyll chloroplasts is more than twice that <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath chloroplast. Furthermore, the relative yield of total chlorophyll a fluorescence is 40 % lower <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath compared to that in mesophyll chloroplasts. This is in agreement with the presence of the higher ratio of the weakly fluorescent pigment system I to pigment system II <b>in</b> <b>bundle</b> sheath than <b>in</b> mesophyll chloroplast. The efficiency of energy transfer from chlorophyll b and carotenoids to chlorophyll a are calculated to be 100 and 50 %, respectively, in both types of chloroplasts.

The entire electron transport chain is shown to be present in both types of chloroplasts, as inferred from the antagonistic effect of red (650 nm) and far red (710 nm) lights on the absorbance changes at 559 nm and 553 nm, and the photoreduction of methyl viologen from H 2 O.
