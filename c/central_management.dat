Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these V-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. [...] Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high angle of attack (AoA) performance compared to legacy aircraft. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking. [...] To keep costs low despite the novel design, a number of [...] "commercial off-the-shelf" [...] components were used, including an F-15 nose wheel, F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit components of the F-15E Strike Eagle.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{during the}} Christmas season of 1928 and {{continuing}} on select holidays until 1958, an organist performed in Grand Central's North Gallery. Mary Lee Read initiated recitals on a borrowed Hammond organ. Grand <b>Central</b> <b>management</b> eventually bought an organ {{and a set}} of chimes for the station and began paying Mrs. Read an annual retainer. In addition to the weeks before Christmas, Mrs. Read would play during the weeks before Thanksgiving and Easter and on Mother's Day. A choir composed of Works Progress Administration employees performed with her one Easter. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, she attempted to lift spirits by playing [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", which brought the main concourse to a standstill. The stationmaster subsequently asked her to avoid selections that would cause passengers to miss their trains, and Mrs. Read became known as the only organist in New York who was forbidden to play the United States' national anthem.|$|E

2500|$|Penn <b>Central</b> <b>management</b> {{created a}} holding company, the Penn Central Company, {{and tried to}} diversify the troubled firm into real estate, pipelines, trucking, and other non-railroad ventures. However, in a slow economy, these {{businesses}} performed little better than the railroad assets. [...] In addition, these new subsidiaries diverted management {{attention away from the}} problems in the core railroad business. [...] To make matters worse, management insisted on paying dividends to shareholders to create the illusion of success. [...] The Pennsylvania Railroad had a gold-plated reputation on Wall Street since it had the longest record of dividend payment in American corporate history. It was this stellar reputation on Wall Street that permitted the PC to borrow money easily and cheaply. [...] The company had to borrow enormous sums to keep operating. [...] The interest on the loans became an unbearable financial burden, but this fact was kept hidden from shareholders and the general public.|$|E
2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The <b>Central</b> <b>Management</b> Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states {{to take a hard look}} at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E
