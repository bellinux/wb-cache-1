5000|$|Very strange experience, {{squeezing}} {{every morning}} into modern poetry, {{and sitting in}} there all day all curled up with book <b>clamped</b> over <b>mouth</b> inhaling deeply, then {{coming out in the}} five or six o clock dark. Many other poets find their inspiration in the library. It's truly a place where poets and readers meet. As well as poets laureate, though, we see school students, families with young children, casual readers, critics, academics, teachers and artists 'squeezing every morning into modern poetry.|$|R

They keep on pressing it down {{until it reaches}} your esophagus.

50|$|Batyr, on {{the level}} of natural blares, Batyr said words (including human slang) by {{manipulating}} his trunk. By putting the trunk in his mouth, pressing a tip of the trunk {{to the bottom of the}} jaw and manipulating the tongue, elephant said words. Besides, being in a corner of the cage (frequently at night) with the trunk softly hanging down, the elephant said words almost silentlyâ€”a sound comparable with the sound of ultrasonic devices used against mosquitoes or the peep of mosquitoes, which human hearing hears well until approximately the age of 40. While pronouncing words, only the tip of the elephant's trunk is <b>clamped</b> inside <b>mouth</b> and Batyr made subtle movements with a finger-shaped shoot on the trunk tip".|$|R
5000|$|Beverley sets up an {{appointment}} to tell him she knows the truth, but when she asks too many questions he realizes that she knows something. He goes behind her and sedates her with nitrous oxide. She finds herself duct taped to the dental chair and cries and begs him to let her go. He puts a <b>mouth</b> <b>clamp</b> in her <b>mouth</b> to keep it open and drills her bottom-right molar tooth to the raw nerve as a [...] "lie detector" [...] {{to find out who}} else she has told. If she lied, he would take a dental hook and painfully wiggle the tooth he drilled. Robbie comes to install some more drywall, and after Beverley screams Robbie goes to check on her. In the ensuing fight, Alan kills Robbie with a hatchet, turns back to Beverley and re-tapes her to the dental chair. He takes a pair of dental pliers and plays a game of [...] "truth or tooth". He asks her what did she tell Jeremy about Washington but he doesn't believe her then pulls out her left front tooth, then he asks her what she did tell Jamie. He then pulls her left incisor tooth out. Before finishing her off, Alan painfully extracts all of her teeth.|$|R
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being <b>clamped</b> over her <b>mouth</b> and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|R
50|$|Thorny-headed worms {{begin their}} life cycle inside {{invertebrates}} that reside in marine or freshwater systems. Gammarus lacustris, a small crustacean that feeds near ponds and rivers, is one invertebrate that the thorny-headed worm may occupy. This crustacean is preyed on by ducks and hides by avoiding light and {{staying away from}} the surface. However, when infected by a thorny-headed worm it becomes attracted toward light and swims to the surface. Gammarus lacustris will even {{go so far as}} to find a rock or a plant on the surface, <b>clamp</b> its <b>mouth</b> down, and latch on, making it easy prey for the duck. The duck is the definitive host for the acanthocephalan parasite. In order to be transmitted to the duck, the parasite's intermediate host (the gammarid) must be eaten by the duck. This modification of gammarid behavior by the acanthocephalan is thought to increase the rate of transmission of the parasite to its next host by increasing the susceptibility of the gammarid to predation.|$|R
40|$|Members of the actin {{family of}} {{proteins}} exhibit different biochemical properties when ATP, ADP-Pi, ADP, or no nucleotide is bound. We used molecular dynamics simulations {{to study the}} effect of nucleotides {{on the behavior of}} actin and actin-related protein 3 (Arp 3). In all of the actin simulations, the nucleotide cleft stayed closed, as in most crystal structures. ADP was much more mobile within the cleft than ATP, despite the fact that both nucleotides adopt identical conformations in actin crystal structures. The nucleotide cleft of Arp 3 opened in most simulations with ATP, ADP, and no bound nucleotide. Deletion of a C-terminal region of Arp 3 that extends beyond the conserved actin sequence reduced the tendency of the Arp 3 cleft to open. When the Arp 3 cleft opened, we observed multiple instances of partial release of the nucleotide. Cleft opening in Arp 3 also allowed us to observe correlated movements of the phosphate <b>clamp,</b> cleft <b>mouth,</b> and barbed-end groove, providing a way for changes in the nucleotide state to be relayed to other parts of Arp 3.

5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head <b>clamped</b> and his <b>mouth</b> muzzled.|$|R

50|$|In December 1943 the Japanese sent Coates to Thailand. There, from March 1944, he {{was chief}} medical officer of a prisoner-of-war {{hospital}} (10,000 beds) at Nakhon Pathom (Nakompaton). Through 'his initiative, resource and enthusiasm {{he was responsible for}} many improvisations which provided artificial limbs, transfusions and surgical appliances'. (Sir) Edward Dunlop recalled that Coates's 'short, upright figure with a ghost of a swagger, a Burma cheroot <b>clamped</b> in his <b>mouth,</b> and his staccato flow of kindly, earthly wisdom became the object of hero-worship and inspiration'. With the cessation of hostilities, Coates returned to Melbourne in October 1945, transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 6 December and was appointed O.B.E. in 1946. Coates was a key witness at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in '46, was appointed an OBE in '47, was an RSL delegate at the signing of the Peace Treaty in the USA in '51, and was knighted by the Queen in '55.|$|R
50|$|When Evelyn, Jack, Hawkins, and the {{crocodile}} farm manager {{go looking for}} {{the crocodile}}'s pit, Allison and Theo follow in a small boat. The Crocodile appears and snatches Allison from the boat, much to Theo's horror. Jack {{and the rest of}} the team continue searching for the pit underwater while Hawkins and Theo go to search on land. They find the pit and, to their relief, Allison, who is unconscious but still alive. She wakes up to find the Crocodile with its jaws right in front of her head, but it leaves when it hears Jack calling for her. It comes up behind Jack, gets a hold of his foot, and drags him underwater. As it's going down, Hawkins and Theo shoot at it, with Hawkins managing to shoot it in the brain. It dies with Jack's foot still firmly <b>clamped</b> in its <b>mouth</b> and him underwater. Stuck too high to get down to help, Hawkins advises Allison to cut off Jack's leg since they can't get the Crocodile's mouth open. Instead, the park manager uses a bang stick to blast it open his mouth and Jack gets to keep his leg.|$|R
5000|$|Vic did {{not appear}} on the front cover of any albums or {{compilations}} from 1991 to 2000. However, when Megadeth tried to bring back a more 'classic' vibe to their material, he returned for the 2001 album The World Needs a Hero, the 2004 album The System Has Failed, {{as well as the}} 2007 studio album United Abominations in a human form. He is identified by his visor, metal caps on his ears, and <b>clamps</b> on his <b>mouth.</b> Only Vic's face is shown in the mushroom cloud on the 2005 compilation Greatest Hits: Back to the Start. Vic was once again absent from the cover of Endgame, instead found in the album's booklet much like the inside cover of Youthanasia and Countdown To Extinction. His portrait image can also be found by joining the spine labels of the 7 albums Mustaine re-released in 2004. Vic was mentioned in the band's 2010 video [...] "The Right to Go Insane" [...] and featured on the cover art for the [...] "Sudden Death" [...] single. On Th1rt3en is shown with his back turned. Vic can be seen very faintly on the Super Collider album artwork as a reflection {{in the center of the}} particle collider, it is revealed inside the cover and on the back that Vic is the Super Collider. On Dystopia, a robot version of Vic Rattlehead is seen.|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho Ã© de natureza {{experimental}} e, visa apresentar uma contribuiÃ§Ã£o sobre o estudo da estimativa de vida Ãºtil de cabos condutores de energia elÃ©trica, tendo como referÃªncia a anÃ¡lise da resistÃªncia Ã  fadiga por fretting. Em particular, o levantamento de dados preliminares que possibilitem a determinaÃ§Ã£o da curva de durabilidade (Curva de WÃ¶hler ou S-N) da montagem do cabo CAA 397, 5 MCM - IBIS, com o grampo de suspensÃ£o monoarticulado, assim como, identificar as caracterÃ­sticas associadas ao aspecto e posicionamento das falhas encontradas neste tipo de cabo. Testes a uma mesma amplitude de tensÃ£o foram conduzidos, observando-se a ruptura do primeiro, segundo e terceiro fio de alumÃ­nio e registrando-se o nÃºmero de ciclos experimentado pela montagem atÃ© o instante de cada quebra. Repetindo-se o teste para diferentes amplitudes de deslocamento pode-se entÃ£o traÃ§ar uma curva da amplitude de tensÃ£o contra o nÃºmero de ciclos, a qual Ã© denominada de Curva S-N ou de WÃ¶hler. Para estabelecer a tensÃ£o gerada na regiÃ£o de falha utilizou-se a fÃ³rmula de Poffenberger-Swart (1965). Os ensaios foram executados, de acordo com as recomendaÃ§Ãµes da CIGRE (1985), EPRI (1979) e IEEE (1978), em uma bancada de 46, 8 metros de comprimento, em ambiente climatizado, com sistema de controle dos equipamentos totalmente informatizado. Para a combinaÃ§Ã£o cabogrampo usada, a Curva Limite de SeguranÃ§a da CIGRÃ‰ (CSBL) mostrou-se muito conservativa, isto Ã©, a vida do cabo Ã© de 5 a 10 vezes maior quando calculada utilizando a curva especÃ­fica do material como referÃªncia. AtravÃ©s do mapeamento das falhas contatouse que para amplitudes de deslocamento menores que 1, 0 mm, de maneira geral as falhas ocorreram na camada externa, jÃ¡ para amplitudes maiores a maior incidÃªncia atÃ© trÃªs falhas, foi na camada interna. O valor mÃ©dio das distÃ¢ncias das falhas na camada externa foi de 26, 7 mm e na camada interna foi de 26, 2 mm. Esta constataÃ§Ã£o evidencia que a previsÃ£o da vida Ãºtil em fadiga do cabo Ã© de grande importÃ¢ncia para as atividades de manutenÃ§Ã£o, isto porque, as quebras dos fios ocorrem dentro do grampo de suspensÃ£o e, portanto nÃ£o podem ser identificadas nas inspeÃ§Ãµes visuais. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe present wok {{consists of}} an experimental research on fretting fatigue of an ACSR IBIS overhead conductor, with the objective {{to contribute to the}} study of the estimated fatigue life of such components. More specifically, tests were conducted in the same bending displacement amplitude (peak to peak) at a position on the cable 89 mm away from the last point of contact between cable and the mono-articulated aluminium clamping system. The rupture of the first, second and third aluminum strands were monitored as well as the number of cycles experienced by the assembly until the moment of each break. Repeating the test for different levels of prescribed displacement amplitudes one can then plot a curve of stress amplitude versus fatigue life, the so called S-N or WÃ¶hler`s Curve. To correlate the prescribed displacement with stress amplitude Poffenberger-Swart equation was used. The tests were performed in accordance with the recommendations of CIGRE (1985), EPRI (1979) and IEE (1978), in a 46. 8 meters long span, in air conditioned environment and using a closed loop control system to assure the repeatability of the tests. The results of the tests showed that, for the conductor/clamp mounting used, the CIGRE Safe Border Line (CSBL) curve was extremely conservative. The actual conductor life was 5 to 10 times higher than the value estimated by the CSBL for the same level of stress amplitude. Such result emphasizes the need to raise specific laboratory S-N curves for different cable/clamp assemblies should accuracy of life estimates be pursued. Mapping the wire failures it was found that for displacement amplitudes smaller than 1 mm, the failures generally occurred in the outer layer, while for amplitudes larger than 1 mm, they preferably occurred in the inner aluminium layer, for up to three failures. Such wire breaks were localized inside the clamp at average distances of 26. 7 mm in the outer layer and 26. 2 mm in the inner layer, both measured from the <b>clamp</b> <b>mouth.</b> The fact that the broken strand occurs well within the suspension clamp means that it can not be identified by visual inspection and that even inspections by infrared thermography may not be effective, demonstrating the need to establish an accurate methodology to estimate the remaining conductor life in order to allow maintenance before a cathastrofic breakage of the whole cable...|$|R
60|$|The {{moonlight}} was {{so bright}} {{that through the}} thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near {{edge of the bed}} facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognized the Count, in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension. His right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare chest which was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion. The great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge, and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood dripping <b>mouth,</b> <b>clamped</b> together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky. And when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin. From her throat trickled a thin stream of blood. Her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room.|$|R
