In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly as a vehicle to organize support for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia among socialists in the union movement.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{which was}} {{launched}} in March 2009, collected photometric data continuously over a four-month period in a small area of sky, using a 0.95m Schmidt telescope. When the data collected during this period was analyzed, 1235 planetary candidates were identified amongst the observed 150,000 stars; all of these planetary candidates were suspected of transiting their host stars, in which the planetary body periodically crosses in front of and slightly dims its host star. Because the data collected on the transits of KOI-98 (later known as Kepler-14b) seemed very <b>clearly</b> <b>to</b> indicate a planet, Kepler identified KOI-98 early on in its mission. Data on the object of interest was forwarded to the Kepler Follow-up Program for a follow-up investigation.|$|E

25|$|As the {{inflammation}} progresses, the pain begins to localize more <b>clearly</b> <b>to</b> the right lower quadrant, as the peritoneum becomes inflamed. This peritoneal inflammation, or peritonitis, results in rebound tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure). In particular, it presents at McBurney's point, 1/3 {{of the way}} along a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. Typically, point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed, as well. Fever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis.|$|E

An experienced breeder can try to identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E

25|$|Homer {{describes}} a more-than-natural light around {{the heads of}} heroes in battle. Depictions of Perseus {{in the act of}} slaying Medusa, with lines radiating from his head, appear on a white-ground toiletry box in the Louvre and on a slightly later red-figured vase in the style of Polygnotos, ca. 450-30 BC, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On painted wares from south Italy, radiant lines or simple haloes appear on a range of mythic figures: Lyssa, a personification of madness; a sphinx; a sea demon; and Thetis, the sea-nymph who was mother to Achilles. The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the sun-god Helios and had his usual radiate crown (copied for the Statue of Liberty). Hellenistic rulers are often shown wearing radiate crowns that seem <b>clearly</b> <b>to</b> imitate this effect.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} and northwest, the Swiss Plateau is sharply delimited {{geographically}} and geologically by the Jura Mountains. In the south, {{there is no clear}} border with the Alps. Usually, the rising of the terrain to altitudes above 1500 metres AMSL (lime Alps, partly sub-alpine molasse), which is very abrupt in certain places, is taken as a criterion for delimitation. Occasionally the regions of the higher Swiss Plateau, especially the hills of the canton of Fribourg, the Napf region, the Töss region and parts of the Appenzell region are considered to form the Swiss Alpine foreland in a narrow sense. However, if a division into the three main regions Jura Mountains, Swiss Plateau and Alps is considered, the Alpine foreland belongs <b>clearly</b> <b>to</b> the Swiss Plateau. In the southwest, the Swiss Plateau is confined by Lake Geneva, in the northeast, by Lake Constance and the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|During the 2017 offseason, Anthony {{demanded a}} trade after {{multiple}} conflicts with then-team president Phil Jackson. Originally, the only teams {{for which he}} would waive his no trade clause were for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets. However, due to increasing concerns with the Cavaliers' stability within the organization, from the team having no general manager {{at the time to}} trade demands from Kyrie Irving, he later decided to seek a trade where he would only end up with the Rockets. Originally, the Rockets had a three-way trade with the Portland Trail Blazers setup involving Ryan Anderson, but with the Knicks changing its front office after parting ways with Phil Jackson, they decided to withhold the trade to the Rockets altogether. After more concerns with the Knicks and the new Knicks' front office stating their expectations <b>clearly</b> <b>to</b> the media, Anthony decided to expand his list of teams to include the Cavaliers again and the Oklahoma City Thunder.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} to mid-1970s Brezhnev had {{established}} a strong enough power base to effectively become leader. According to historian Ilya Zemtsov, the author of Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika, Kosygin [...] "began to lose power" [...] with the 24th Party Congress in 1971 which {{for the first time}} publicised the formula 'the Politburo led by Brezhnev'". Along with weakening Kosygin's position, Brezhnev moved to strengthen the Party's hold on the Government apparatus, weakening Kosygin's position further. Historian Robert Wesson, the author of Lenin's Legacy: The Story of the CPSU, notes that Kosygin's economic report to the 25th Party Congress [...] "pointed even more <b>clearly</b> <b>to</b> the end of struggle" [...] between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Kosygin was further pushed aside when Brezhnev published his memoirs, which stated that Brezhnev, not Kosygin, was in charge of all major economic decisions. To make matters worse for Kosygin, Brezhnev blocked any future talks on economic reform within the party and government apparatus, and information regarding the reform of 1965 was suppressed.|$|E

In January 1658 the local justices of the peace were petitioned concerning [...] "encroachments of the sea... since Michaelmas last [...] encroached on the land near six rods ], and will doubtless do more harm". The village's failure to support two [...] "beer shops" [...] in the 1660s points <b>clearly</b> <b>to</b> a declining population, and the village was mostly abandoned around the end of the 18th century, its residents moving to Hillborough, about [...] south-west of Reculver but within the same parish.|$|E
