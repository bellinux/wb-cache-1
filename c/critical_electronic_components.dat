5000|$|While some survivalists {{recommend}} {{living at}} a rural retreat year-round, most survivalists cannot {{afford to do}} so. Therefore, they rely on keeping a well-stocked retreat, and plan to go there [...] "at the 11th hour", as necessary. They keep a bug-out bag handy, and may have a dedicated bug-out vehicle (BOV). This is a vehicle that the owner keeps prepared {{in the event of}} the need for an emergency evacuation. Typically a BOV is equipped with a variation on the bug-out bag that includes additional automotive supplies, clothing, food and water. Survivalists tend to favor four wheel drive trucks and SUVs due to their greater off-road abilities. In the event of a nuclear catastrophe, survivalists may opt into maintaining an older vehicle since it most likely lacks <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> that would otherwise be damaged by the electromagnetic pulse that accompanies a nuclear explosion.|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{prediction}} {{of the electronic}} components used in industrial safety systems requires high accuracy and compatibility with the working environment. The traditional reliability prediction methods that draw on standard handbooks such as MIL-HDBK 217 F, Telcordia, PRISM etc., are not appropriate to determine the reliability indices of these components. For one thing, technology is constantly advancing; for another, the empirical data do not always match the actual working environment. The newest reliability prediction methodology, the physics-of-failure (PoF), emphasizes {{the root cause of}} failure, failure analysis, and failure mechanisms based on the analysis of parameter characteristics. It involves a focused examination of failure point locations, considering the fabrication technology, process, materials and circuit layout obtained from the manufacturer. This methodology is capable of providing recommendations for the increased reliability of components using intuitive analysis. However, there is a limitation: it is sometimes difficult to obtain manufacturer’s details for failure analysis and quality information. Several statistical and probability modeling methods can be performed on the experimental data of these components to measure the time to failure. These experiments can be conducted using the accelerated-testing of dominant stress parameters such as Voltage, Current, Temperature, Radiation etc. In this thesis, the combination of qualitative data from PoF approach and quantitative data from the statistical analysis is used to create a modified physics-of-failure approach. This methodology overcomes the limitations of the standard PoF approach as it involves detailed analysis of stress factors, data modeling and prediction. A decision support system is created to select the best option from failure data models, failure mechanisms, failure criteria and other factors to ensure a growth in reliability. In this study, the <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> used in certain safety systems from different technologies are chosen for reliability prediction: Optocoupler, Constant Fraction Discriminator, BJT Transistor, Voltage Comparator, Voltage Follower and Instrumentation amplifier. The study finds that the modified physics-of-failure methodology provides more accurate reliability indices than the traditional approaches using field data. Stress based degradation models are developed for each of the components. The modified PoF models developed using Response Surface Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) show better performance.

40|$|Advances in VLSI {{technology}} {{have led to}} fabrication of chips with number of transistors projected to reach 10 billion in the near future. Affordable fault tolerant solutions transparent to applications with minimal hardware overhead in the micro architecture are necessary to mitigate component level errors for emerging system-on-chip (SoC) platforms. Ridgetop Group and the University of Arizona have developed innovative methods and systems for _detection of anomalous conditions _ that lead to faults in highly-complex electronic systems. Through built-in self-testing and fault detection, isolation and recovery capabilities we can offer 100 % system availability and proactively avoid false or missed alarms, and estimate the remaining useful life of <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> and their associated subsystems. A novel self-healing mechanism for SoC using {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) technology that localizes and isolates the faulty area and then replaces the functionality through partial configuration of the FPGA is introduced. Prognostic techniques are leveraged to address resource allocation and distribution to enable a more fault-tolerant, time efficient, and robust system. When prognostic detection methods are combined with reconfiguration strategies, system reliability and availability improve, reducing the probability of failure without compromise of either service quality or performance or requiring redundant components on the chip...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A new {{vibration}} sensor {{for monitoring}} the operational status of exhaust fans in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and other ventilated structures {{was developed and}} tested. The sensor utilizes integrated Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (iMEMS) technology to accurately and reliably detect the vibration of agricultural fans, an indicator of fan operating status. When coupled with a sensor to measure pressure drop across the fan and an appropriate fan performance curve, the vibration sensor can enable the collection of real-time building ventilation airflow data. The sensor integrated an iMEMS accelerometer along with signal conditioning components to convert the cyclic acceleration signal into a filtered TTL digital signal appropriate {{for a wide variety}} of data acquisition equipment. Sensor current draw was 0. 9 mA, which allowed multiple devices to operate from a single power bus. Laboratory and field testing has shown that the sensor is 99 % effective in determining the total on-time of agricultural fans when compared with existing methods. Testing has also shown that the sensor response is not affected by changes in operating environment temperature. Sensor installation takes only a few minutes and requires only a single hole placed in the existing fan mounting structure. Furthermore, by encapsulating the sensor in a potting compound, all <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> can be sealed from the corrosive effects of moisture and gases common to CAFOs and other ventilated structures...|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of the microrover Nanokhod for the demanding surface environment of the Mercury night side, the rover made a huge advance towards a practical flight model. The rover was designed by the company von Hoerner & Sulger GmbH under an ESA contract to meet the flight-model requirements for a Mercury surface mission. This means it has to withstand such extreme environmental settings as temperatures down to − 180 ◦ C in vacuum conditions, a landing shock of 200 g for a duration of 20 ms and a surface material consisting of very fine regolith with an extremely low thermal conductivity. The hardware model based on these requirements was manufactured to an engineering level and is suitable for environmental testing of vibration, shock and thermal vacuum. The first thermal vacuum tests of the rover system were successfully conducted and the results provide {{a good understanding of}} the thermal behaviours within the system. In addition, these results are used for the validation of the detailed thermal model of the rover which has been developed in parallel to the Nanokhod model. This validated model thus presents a powerful tool which {{can be used as a}} baseline for the future design steps of the thermal concept. It provides detailed information on possible hot spots in vacuum condition and helps to avoid them. A good understanding on the temperature distribution within the rover also helps to reduce the risks and uncertainties for the scientific instruments and <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components...</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to propose a general {{numerical}} analysis methodology to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -safety of active implants. Numerical models based on the finite element (FE) technique were used to estimate if the normal operation of an active device was altered during MRI imaging. An active implanted pump was chosen to illustrate the method. A set of controlled experiments were proposed and performed to validate the numerical model. The calculated induced voltages in the important electronic components of the device showed dependence with the MRI field strength. For the MRI radiofrequency fields, significant induced voltages of up to 20 V were calculated for a 0. 3 T field-strength MRI. For the 1. 5 and 3. 0 OT MRIs, the calculated voltages were insignificant. On the other hand, induced voltages up to 11 V were calculated in the <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> for the 3. 0 T MRI due to the gradient fields. Values obtained in this work reflect to the worst case situation which is virtually impossible to achieve in normal scanning situations. Since the calculated voltages may be removed by appropriate protection circuits, no critical problems affecting the normal operation of the pump were identified. This study showed that the proposed methodology helps the identification of the possible incompatibilities between active implants and MR imaging, and can be used to aid the design of critical electronic systems to ensure MRI-safety...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} reducing transportation cycle time and consolidating aviation electronic component inventory management on the operational availability of the Brazilian Navy and Argentine Air Force AA fleets. The research {{is based on a}} scenario where the Brazilian Navy operates twenty A- 4 aircraft, while the Argentine Air Force operates thirty AAs, and both countries rely on manufacturers in the United States for depot-level maintenance. The transportation turn-around-time is extremely long and the cost of some inventory items is very high. A simulation model was developed representing the repair process of a selected group of A 4 <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components.</b> This particular model provides an effective managerial resource for long-term decision making to improve the readiness of aircraft fleet for both countries. We also developed a multiple regression analysis model (metamodel) to find the relationship between spare inventory levels and the operational availability. These results were applied to a linear programming model to find optimal spare levels for these critical components by minimizing the total cost while maintaining the desirable military readiness. Through a cost-effectiveness analysis, we compared the two situations, optimal spare levels with reduced transportation time and actual spare level with current transportation time. Our research concludes that both Armed Forces will improve readiness, while achieving significant savings, if they reduce the transportation time for the aviation electronic components sent to the United States for depot-level maintenance, and collaborate on the inventory management of their A- 4 fleets.

40|$|Objectives. A {{method for}} {{diagnosing}} <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> with minimally complicated control and measuring instrumentation {{and the ability}} to obtain information from internal control points of operating units is developed. Methods. The developed method for control of groups of <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> presupposes the passage of a controllable influence through a few control points, connected via several <b>electronic</b> <b>components.</b> In addition, each <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> contributes its share to the transformation of the parameter output, so the discrepancy of its allowable values for the identification of defective <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> are required to assess the implication of the expected value of the probable defect of each <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> in the schema with the aim of isolating it. The faulty <b>component</b> in the <b>electronic</b> circuit is identified by the minimum estimated variance, by which the magnitude of the defect will match the expected value of the <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> parameter. Results. As a result of the control no more than ten groups of electrical components on functional cell matrices can be assessed as having a defective element by comparing the calculated variance values for each electrical component and the corresponding electrical component parameter itself. Conclusion. Diagnosing groups of electric components on transient characteristics for the detection of defects in the functional cell matrices enables efficiency control operations improvement and troubleshooting in the search for modern electronic equipment reliability.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The Human Interface Branch - EV 3 - is {{evaluating}} Organic lighting-emitting diodes (OLEDs) as {{an upgrade}} for current displays on future spacecraft. OLEDs have many advantages over current displays. Conventional displays require constant backlighting which draws {{a lot of}} power, but with OLEDs they generate light themselves. OLEDs are lighter, and weight is always a concern with space launches. OLEDs also grant greater viewing angles. OLEDs {{have been in the}} commercial market for almost ten years now. What is not known is how they will perform in a space-like environment; specifically deep space far away from the Earth's magnetosphere. In this environment, the OLEDs can be expected to experience vacuum and galactic radiation. The intern's responsibility has been to prepare the OLED for a battery of tests. Unfortunately, it will not be ready for testing {{at the end of the}} internship. That being said much progress has been made: a) Developed procedures to safely disassemble the tablet. b) Inventoried and identified <b>critical</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components.</b> c) 3 D printed a testing apparatus. d) Wrote software in Python that will test the OLED screen while being radiated. e) Built circuits to restart the tablet and the test pattern, and ensure it doesn't fall asleep during radiation testing. f) Built enclosure that will house all of the electronics Also, the intern has been working on a way to take messages from a simulated Caution and Warnings system, process said messages into packets, send audio packets to a multicast address that audio boxes are listening to, and output spoken audio. Currently, Cautions and Warnings use a tone to alert crew members of a situation, and then crew members have to read through their checklists to determine what the tone means. In urgent situations, EV 3 wants to deliver concise and specific alerts to the crew to facilitate any mitigation efforts on their part. Significant progress was made on this project: a) Open channel with the simulated Caution and Warning system to acquire messages. b) Configure audio boxes. c) Grab pre-recorded audio files. d) Packetize the audio stream.
