40|$|Background: Response to {{treatment}} in anorexia nervosa entails various challenges, including {{an increased risk}} of relapse and re-admission in those treated as inpatients. A better understanding of patients’ experiences is paramount to improve treatment acceptability and outcome. This qualitative study aimed to explore the lived experiences of adult female inpatients undergoing a specialist inpatient treatment programme for anorexia nervosa. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 21 female participants (aged 18 - 41 years) with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, undergoing treatment in a specialist inpatient eating disorder unit. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results: Qualitative analysis highlighted 5 master themes which underpinned treatment experiences: (1) Shifts in control, (2) Experience of transition, (3) The importance of supportive staff relationships, (4) Sharing with peers and (5) Process of recovery and self-discovery. Conclusions: Overall, findings suggest patients experience a process of change and adjustment during inpatient treatment in relation to their levels of perceived <b>control,</b> <b>attachment</b> to the treatment environment and a sense of self-identity.

40|$|The {{oral cavity}} is host {{to a complex}} {{microbial}} community whose maintenance depends on an array of cell-to-cell interactions and communication networks, with little known regarding {{the nature of the}} signals or mechanisms by which they are sensed and transmitted. Determining the signals that <b>control</b> <b>attachment,</b> biofilm development and outgrowth of oral pathogens is fundamental to understanding pathogenic biofilm development. We have previously identified a secreted arginine deiminase (ADI) produced by Streptococcus intermedius that inhibited biofilm development of the commensal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis through downregulation of genes encoding the major (fimA) and minor (mfa 1) fimbriae, both of which are required for proper biofilm development. Here we report that this inhibitory effect is dependent on enzymic activity. We have successfully cloned, expressed and defined the conditions to ensure that ADI from S. intermedius is enzymically active. Along with the cloning of the wild-type allele, we have created a catalytic mutant (ADIC 399 S), in which the resulting protein is not able to catalyse the hydrolysis of L-arginine to L-citrulline. P. gingivalis is insensitive to the ADIC 399 S catalytic mutant, demonstrating that enzymic activity is required for the effects of ADI on biofilm formation.

40|$|A {{transposition}} mutant of Staphylococcus aureus {{was selected}} from the parent strain MT 23142, a derivative of strain 8325. The site of transposition was near the 5 ′ terminus of the gene arlS. ArlS exhibits strong similarities with histidine protein kinases. Sequence analysis suggested that arlS forms an operon with upstream gene arlR. The predicted product of arlR {{is a member of}} the OmpR-PhoB family of response regulators. The arlS mutant formed a biofilm on a polystyrene surface unlike the parent strain and the complemented mutant. Biofilm formation was associated with increased primary adherence to polystyrene, whereas cellular adhesion was only slightly decreased. In addition, the arlS mutant exhibited increased autolysis and altered peptidoglycan hydrolase activity compared to the parental strain and to the complemented mutant. As it has been shown for coagulase-negative staphylococci that some autolysins are able to bind polymer surfaces, these data suggest that the two-component regulatory system ArlS-ArlR may <b>control</b> <b>attachment</b> to polymer surfaces by affecting secreted peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Finally, the arlS mutant showed a dramatic decrease of extracellular proteolytic activity, including serine protease activity, in comparison to the wild-type strain and the complemented mutant, and cells grown in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (a serine protease inhibitor) showed an increased autolysin activity.

Also, the way in which women cope with the threat of breast cancer, how families are impacted by this disease, and post-traumatic growth among daughters was examined. METHODS: 142 daughters of women with breast cancer completed an online survey measuring their levels of anxiety, reported closeness to their mothers, exposure to their mother's cancer and involvement in caregiving, intrusive thoughts, self-reported predicted likelihood of getting breast cancer, self-reported likelihood of undergoing genetic testing, and personal ways of coping. In addition, these daughters completed 4 open ended questions addressing their reactions to their mother's cancer and positive coping strategies they used to deal with their mother's diagnosis. RESULTS: Daughters contact with their mothers during the mother's diagnosis and treatment was positively correlated with high levels of intrusive thoughts. Also, daughter's perception of the threat of the disease was not correlated with intrusive thoughts or a greater likelihood of seeking genetic testing. Qualitative analysis revealed daughters employed a variety of positive coping strategies and had a wide range of reactions to their mother's diagnosis as well as their personal threat of developing breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The daughters reacted in many different ways based on the different relationships they had with their mothers. Other important variables that affected participants' ways of coping were levels of anxiety, closeness to their mother, levels of personal <b>control,</b> <b>attachment</b> styles, and intrusive thoughts.

40|$|ABSTRACT Themotile-to-sessile {{transition}} {{is an important}} lifestyle switch in diverse bacteria and is often regulated by the intra-cellular secondmessenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP). In general, high c-di-GMP concentrations promote attachment to surfaces, whereas cells {{with low levels of}} signal remain motile. In the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, c-di-GMP controls attachment and biofilm formation via regulation of a unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) adhesin. The levels of c-di-GMP in A. tumefaciens are controlled in part by the dual-function diguanylate cyclase-phosphodiesterase (DGC-PDE) pro-tein DcpA. In this study, we report that DcpA possesses both c-di-GMP synthesizing and degrading activities in heterologous and native genetic backgrounds, a binary capability that is unusual among GGDEF-EAL domain-containing proteins. DcpA ac-tivity is modulated by a pteridine reductase called PruA, with DcpA acting as a PDE in the presence of PruA and a DGC in its absence. PruA enzymatic activity is required for the control of DcpA and through this <b>control,</b> <b>attachment</b> and biofilm forma-tion. Intracellular pterin analysis demonstrates that PruA is responsible for the production of a novel pterin species. In addition, the control of DcpA activity also requires PruR, a protein encoded directly upstream of DcpA with a predicted molybdopterin-binding domain. PruR is hypothesized to be a potential signaling intermediate between PruA and DcpA through an as-yet-unidentified mechanism. This study provides the first prokaryotic example of a pterin-mediated signaling pathway and a new model for the regulation of dual-function DGC-PDE proteins.

ATP[gamma S] interacts with actomyosin {{in a manner similar}} to ATP but is hydrolyzed (by a factor of 500) more slowly. Generation of ATP[gamma S] by photolysis of caged ATP[gamma S] within a permeabilized fiber in rigor in the absence of Ca 2 + relaxed tension and stiffness as occurs with ATP. The transient rise in tension prior to final relaxation observed with photolysis of caged ATP was absent with caged ATP[gamma S]. This result suggests that following detachment of a cross-bridge, ATP is normally hydrolyzed before force generation. In the presence of Ca 2 +, photolysis of caged ATP[gamma S] within rigor fibers caused tension to relax fully but significant stiffness remained. Stiffness also developed without concomitant tension when Ca 2 + concentration was raised from less than 1 nM to 30 microM in the presence of ATP[gamma S]. The amplitude of the tension response to ramp stretches in the presence of Ca 2 + and ATP[gamma S] increased with ramp stretch velocity, suggesting that the cross-bridges have detachment rate constants extending into the 10 (3) s- 1 range.

40|$|There is a void of {{existing}} measures assessing young adults’ perceptions of childhood disorganized and <b>controlling</b> <b>attachment.</b> The current research project aimed {{to fill this}} gap by developing a convenient self-report measure, the Childhood Disorganization and Role Reversal Scale (CDRR: Meier & Bureau, 2012), which comprehensively assesses for the complexity of those attachment constructs in young adults. The CDRR is a novel measure as it assesses the unique attachment representations of mother-child and father-child relationships. This research project had three main objectives. The first objective was {{the development of the}} CDRR. It was guided by the recommendations of various scholars in scale development using classical measurement theory. The items of the CDRR were informed by the attachment and family systems literature. The factor structure of the CDRR was determined through conducting principal components analyses (PCA). The second objective, constituting Study 1, aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the CDRR, namely, its structural stability, internal reliability, temporal reliability, convergent and discriminant validity and criterion-related validity. Lastly, the third objective, involving Study 2, sought to provide further support for the validity of the CDRR. It accomplished this goal by exploring the associations of the CDRR to psychological outcomes consistent with the attachment literature, namely, problems in the separation-individuation process, unresolved feelings towards caregiver, and current psychological well-being. The results of the PCA revealed a four-factor structure for both CDRR parent versions. The CDRR mother version includes the Disorganization/Punitive, Mutual Hostility, Affective Caregiving, and Appropriate Boundaries scales, while the CDRR father version includes the Disorganization, Affective Caregiving, Appropriate Boundaries, and Punitive scales. Overall, support was provided for the psychometric properties of the CDRR. The CDRR scales demonstrated adequate structural stability, internal consistency, temporal reliability and various forms of validity. Generally, the disorganized and controlling scales were positively related to problematic separation-individuation, unresolved feelings towards caregivers and psychological problems.

40|$|AbstractAdult {{stem cells}} reside in {{specialized}} microenvironments, or niches, {{that are essential}} for their function in vivo. Stem cells are physically attached to the niche, which provides secreted factors that promote their self-renewal and proliferation. Despite intense research {{on the role of}} the niche in regulating stem cell function, much less is known about how the niche itself is controlled. We previously showed that insulin signals directly stimulate germline stem cell (GSC) division and indirectly promote GSC maintenance via the niche in Drosophila. Insulin-like peptides are required for maintenance of cap cells (a major component of the niche) via modulation of Notch signaling, and they also <b>control</b> <b>attachment</b> of GSCs to cap cells and E-cadherin levels at the cap cell–GSC junction. Here, we further dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these processes. We show that insulin and Notch ligands directly stimulate cap cells to maintain their numbers and indirectly promote GSC maintenance. We also report that insulin signaling, via phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and FOXO, intrinsically controls the competence of cap cells to respond to Notch ligands and thereby be maintained. Contrary to a previous report, we also find that Notch ligands originated in GSCs are not required either for Notch activation in the GSC niche, or for cap cell or GSC maintenance. Instead, the niche itself produces ligands that activate Notch signaling within cap cells, promoting stability of the GSC niche. Finally, insulin signals control cap cell–GSC attachment independently of their role in Notch signaling. These results are potentially relevant to many systems in which Notch signaling modulates stem cells and demonstrate that complex interactions between local and systemic signals are required for proper stem cell niche function...|$|E

Metal adsorption is typically favored at high pH. Calcium and Mg adsorb in near-stoichiometric proportions except at high pH. Adsorption of Ca and Mg is diminished at high ionic strengths (e. g., 0. 5 M NaCl) pointing to association of Na{sup +} with the dolomite surface, and the possibility that Ca and Mg sorb as hydrated, outer-sphere complexes.

In addition to the previously mentioned studies on the association between maltreatment and locus of control, others have separately investigated the relationship between locus of <b>control</b> and <b>attachment.</b> These studies show that insecure attachment is mainly associated with attributive styles focused on reporting events as uncontrollable factors, in which the subject, therefore, cannot intervene (Di Pentima & Toni 2010; Gamble & Roberts 2005; Mickelson et al. 1997; Hexel 2003; Dan et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} short pulsed fiber lasers in surface texturing using MHz-repetition-rate, microjoule- and sub-microjoule-energy pulses. Texturing of titanium-based (Ti 6 Al 4 V) dental implant surfaces is achieved using femtosecond, picosecond and (for comparison) nanosecond pulses {{with the aim of}} <b>controlling</b> <b>attachment</b> of human cells onto the surface. Femtosecond and picosecond pulses yield similar results in the creation of micron-scale textures with greatly reduced or no thermal heat effects, whereas nanosecond pulses result in strong thermal effects. Various surface textures are created with excellent uniformity and repeatability on a desired portion of the surface. The effects of the surface texturing on the attachment and proliferation of cells are characterized under cell culture conditions. Our data indicate that picosecond-pulsed laser modification can be utilized effectively in low-cost laser surface engineering of medical implants, where different areas on the surface can be made cell-attachment friendly or hostile through the use of different patterns. © 2011 Optical Society of America...|$|R
