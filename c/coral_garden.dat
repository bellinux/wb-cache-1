5|$|Possibly {{the best}} ecologically studied {{seamount}} {{in the world}} is Davidson Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea <b>coral</b> <b>garden,</b> and many of the specimens noted were over a century old. Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Much of what is known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such seamount is Bowie Seamount, which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>Gardens</b> and Their Magic, {{properly}} <b>Coral</b> <b>Gardens</b> and Their Magic: A Study of the Methods of Tilling the Soil and of Agricultural Rites in the Trobriand Islands, is {{the final}} book in anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski's ethnographic trilogy {{on the lives of}} the Trobriand Islanders. It concentrates on the cultivation practices the Trobriand Islanders used to grow yams, taro, bananas and palms. It describes the gardens in which the Trobrianders grew food as more than merely utilitarian spaces, even as works of art. In 1988 Alfred Gell called the book [...] "still the best account of any primitive technological-cum-magical system, and unlikely ever to be superseded in this respect". The book has been described as Malinowski's magnum opus.|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} the distribution, species composition and environmental characteristics of benthic habitats and biotopes from 38 {{stations in the}} Hardangerfjord, based on observations using high-definition video. Faunal composition was primarily related to substrate composition, distance from open ocean and depth (water masses) by using Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Six different biotopes were observed at depths between 100 and 400 m: (1) Lophelia reef, (2) sponge garden, (3) seapen communities, (4) soft bottom <b>coral</b> <b>garden,</b> (5) hard bottom <b>coral</b> <b>garden</b> and (6) cerianthid stands. Three Lophelia reefs were observed between 140 and 230 m depth in the outer part of the fjord. Geodia spp. and other large sponges were abundant on morainic bottom, on sills. Seapen communities occurred on muddy bottoms mainly between 250 and 350 m depth. The soft bottom <b>coral</b> <b>garden</b> comprised the gorgonian Isidella lofotensis, locally with densities up to 167 colonies/ 100 m 2. Hard bottom coral gardens with Paragorgia arborea and Paramuricea placomus had a much lower density with a maximum of 33 colonies/ 100 m 2. Litter and lost fishing gear were observed on 49 % of the locations. Lophelia and sponges were covered with silt to a much higher degree than previously observed offshore. Whether this is caused by naturally higher particle flux in fjords or is due to an increased input from anthropogenic sources cannot be concluded from the present study. In general, anthropogenic activities have lead to increased particle flux in fjords and a demand for monitoring sensitive deep-water habitats to detect related trends of declining biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Live coral cover at Sempu Nature Reserve was {{decrease}} from 50 % in 2006 to 36 % in 2013. Adverse {{human activities}} such as: over-fishing, recreational activities, waste disposal, deforestation, reef mining and deforestation were suggested to be main factors for declining coral reef at this area. Restoration {{is defined as}} the act of returning an ecosystem, as nearly as possible, to its original condition. Coral on Sendang Biru laid on northern area of Sempu Island. <b>Coral</b> <b>garden</b> was establish in the end of 2013. Aim of this research was to know the growth (wide, number of branches, growth rate) of staghorn coral that was transplanted on steel frame at <b>coral</b> <b>garden</b> in different depth. Staghorn coral were tied on doom shaped steel in 6 m depth. The result showed that the average of increasing staghorn coral's area was 56. 91 cm 2, number of branch increase was 55 and growth rate was 5. 23 cm 2 /month respectively.

40|$|Reef {{restoration}} {{activities have}} proliferated {{in response to}} the need to mitigate coral declines and recover lost reef structure, function, and ecosystem services. Here, we describe the recent shift from costly and complex engineering solutions to recover degraded reef structure to more economical and efficient ecological approaches that focus on recovering the living components of reef communities. We review the adoption and expansion of the <b>coral</b> <b>gardening</b> framework in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic where practitioners now grow and outplant 10, 000 ’s of corals onto degraded reefs each year. We detail the steps for establishing a gardening program as well as long-term goals and direct and indirect benefits of this approach in our region. With a strong scientific basis, <b>coral</b> <b>gardening</b> activities now contribute significantly to reef and species recovery, provide important scientific, education, and outreach opportunities, and offer alternate livelihoods to local stakeholders. While challenges still remain, the transition from engineering to ecological solutions for reef degradation has opened the field of coral reef restoration to a wider audience poised to contribute to reef conservation and recovery in regions where coral losses and recruitment bottlenecks hinder natural recovery...|$|R
