Every electrically device has <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> causing unintentional interference to other electrical devices. All unwanted currents or voltages that may arise in a system generate electrical noise. All kinds of unexpected radio-frequency (RF) energy produce this kind <b>of</b> noise. <b>The</b> term Electromagnetic Interference [...] EMI [...] describes the situation that electrical noise destroys <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> systems. Therefore, emissions and immunity tests have to be performed according to the harmonized European norms like EN 55020 standard. In this thesis, immunity to radiated fields testing will introduce and <b>the</b> basic requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suggested test site which is a TEM stripline will also be mentioned. Stripline is a transmission line construction which provides a uniform electromagnetic field between its parallel plates. Radiated immunity can be defined as the product's ability to withstand EM energy that arrives via free-space propagation for its functionality. Design of a new TEM stripline for EMC testing is given in order to construct an alternative test site, a new <b>stripline</b> bigger than <b>the</b> one given by the standard was built. Main attention has been focused on the design parameters (characteristic impedance, field uniformity etc.) and <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designed <b>stripline.</b> Defined <b>stripline</b> in <b>the</b> standard has 80 cm height but it is not sufficient for big equipments under test (EUTs). Then an alternative stripline can be used if it fulfills the specifications required by the standard...|$|R
40|$|The Pre-Damping Rings (PDRs) and Damping Rings (DRs) of CLIC {{are needed}} to reduce the beam emittances to the small values {{required}} for the main linacs. The injection and extraction, from the PDRs and DRs, are carried out by kicker systems. In order to achieve both low beam coupling impedance and reasonable broadband impedance matching to <b>the</b> electrical circuit, <b>striplines</b> have been chosen for the kicker elements. <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> kicker was previously carried out by modelling <b>the</b> <b>striplines</b> with simulation codes such as HFSS, Quickfield and CST Particle Studio.

A coupled line and lumped element directional couplers were designed and simulated using Advanced Design System (ADS) and optimized to achieve the required coupling coefficient and isolation. The S-parameter plots were generated to characterize <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designed couplers. The simulation results showed the coupled line coupler in stripline substrate was more appropriate to use for this design project. The ADS generated plots proved that as coupling coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> coupler improves, its isolation deteriorates. The simulation also proved that <b>the</b> overall performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> was {{much better than the}} lumped element coupler.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{constructed}} a two-dimensional numerical model for calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response of metallic ferromagnetic films. We also conducted numerical calculations by using this software. The calculations {{demonstrated that the}} eddy current contribution to the FMR response decreases with a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> width. <b>The</b> most important manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductivity (eddy current) effect are excitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher-order standing spin waves across the film thickness in the materials for which the standing spin wave peaks would be absent in cavity FMR measurements and strong dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> off-resonance series conductance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> on <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> width. Whereas <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eddy currents to <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> FMR response can be very significant, because wide striplines (100 nm+) are conventionally used for the FMR measurements, it is negligible in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> excitation of spin waves, just because very narrow stripline transducers (0. 5 - 5 micron wide) are {{required in order to}} excite spin waves in metallic ferromagnetic films in a noticeable frequency/applied field range...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present CLIC Test Facility (CTF 3) is to {{demonstrate}} <b>the</b> technical feasibility <b>of</b> specific key issues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CLIC scheme. The extracted drive beam from the combiner ring (CR), a pulse of 35 A magnitude and 140 ns duration, {{is sent to the}} new CLic EXperimental area (CLEX). A Tail Clipper (TC) kicker is required, in the CR to CLEX transfer line, to allow <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beam pulse to be adjusted: the unwanted bunches are kicked into a collimator. The TC must have a fast field rise-time, of not more than 5 ns, in order to minimize uncontrolled beam loss. Striplines are used for the TC: to establish the required fields, the applied pulse wave front must fully propagate along <b>the</b> <b>striplines.</b> To reduce <b>the</b> wave front propagation time, <b>the</b> overall length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> assembly is sub-divided into 4 sections.

To achieve the luminosity requirements, predamping rings (PDRs) and damping rings (DRs) are required: they reduce the beam emittance before the beam is accelerated {{in the main}} linac. Several kicker systems are needed to inject and extract the beam from the PDRs and DRs. In order to achieve both low beam coupling impedance and reasonable broadband impedance matching to <b>the</b> electrical circuit, <b>striplines</b> have been chosen for the kicker elements. In this paper, we present <b>the</b> complete design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striplines</b> for <b>the</b> DR extraction kicker, {{since it is the}} most challenging from the field homogeneity point <b>of</b> view. <b>The</b> excellent field homogeneity required, as well as a good transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high voltage pulse through the electrodes, has been achieved by choosing a novel electrode shape. With this new geometry, it has been possible to benefit from all the advantages that the most common shapes introduce separately. Furthermore, a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different operating modes of a <b>stripline</b> kicker allowed <b>the</b> beam coupling impedance to be reduced at low frequencies: this cannot be achieved by tapering the electrodes. <b>The</b> optimum design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>striplines</b> and their components has been based on studies of impedance matching, field homogeneity, power transmission, beam coupling impedance, and manufacturing tolerances.

40|$|A novel design {{method for}} a {{stripline}} microwave matching line is developed in this paper.

These matching properties can be controlled by means of two different factors: <b>the</b> taper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stripline</b> inner conductor and the relative permittivity spatial variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dielectric material filling <b>the</b> <b>stripline.</b> Starting from <b>the</b> nonuniform transmission-line theory, a novel closed analytical form for the input reflection coefficient of such lines is derived, and design formulas for the matching line are carried out.
