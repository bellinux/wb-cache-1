50|$|The {{race was}} {{scheduled}} to start at 1:16 p.m. on Sunday, but the start was delayed by overnight showers and track drying. The field rolled off pit road shortly after 1:45 p.m. and {{made a number of}} laps around the track and down pit road under <b>caution</b> <b>speed.</b> Finally, nearly an hour after the scheduled start time, Joey Logano lead the field to the green flag at 2:12 p.m. He pulled out to a four-second lead until the first caution of the race flew on lap 26 for overnight showers. This caution was a saving grace for Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. who had a right-rear tire going down. Joe Nemechek stayed out to lead a lap before pitting and handing the lead back to Logano.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} styles of trials: Trial of Value, Trial of <b>Caution,</b> Trial of <b>Speed,</b> and Trial of Control.|$|R
50|$|In March 2011, Mark Martin gave Turner Scott Motorsports {{its first}} {{victory in the}} Nationwide at Las Vegas. The victory came after Brad Keselowski, who was leading on the last lap, blew his tire. Martin, who was running in the second position, {{inherited}} the lead from Keselowski and {{held on to the}} top spot to ultimately achieve the victory. Then, in June of the same year, Reed Sorenson gave the No. 32 team its second victory at Road America. After teammate Justin Allgaier and his No. 31 team ran out of gas as the race was ending under caution, road course ringer Ron Fellows sped past Sorensen under caution. After a review by NASCAR officials, it was found that Sorensen maintained proper <b>caution</b> <b>speed</b> and was therefore awarded with the race victory.|$|R

5000|$|... ===Start=== The {{race was}} set to start at 7:43 p.m. EDT but the start was delayed 90 minutes, and the cars were running under <b>caution</b> <b>speed,</b> Jeff Gordon was leading when the race {{restarted}} on lap 8, The second caution came out on lap 48, this was a planned competition caution, The race restarted on lap 52, and the third caution then came out on lap 53 for a one-car spin in the back straightaway, the race restarted on lap 57, {{and a couple of}} laps later, the fourth caution came out for rain on lap 139, by lap 153, the cars were brought down pit road the race was red flagged as rain returned again(the race was red flagged on lap 160 during the Daytona 500 for a cleanup after a jet dryer accident), After a delay of fifty-one minutes and 45 seconds, the cars started rolling again, and the race restarted on lap 156.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{white lights}} at a 45° angle: {{shunting}} movement signalled. The driver may pass this signal with <b>caution</b> and a <b>speed</b> {{that allows the}} train to stop short of any obstruction.|$|R
50|$|Under this <b>caution,</b> <b>Speed</b> got {{the free}} pass. Most {{of the drivers}} pitted under the caution on lap 9. As the caution period continued, John Andretti, Greg Biffle, and Ryan Newman each led a lap before making their pit stops. When the race {{restarted}} on lap 13, Logano claimed the lead. One lap later, Martin Truex, Jr. took it away from Logano with help from Earnhardt, Jr. Truex, Jr. continued to lead until lap 18, when Montoya passed him for it. One lap later, Busch, upon returned after the huge wrech on lap 6, took the lead from Montoya and led a lap before being passed by Hamlin. On lap 22, Jeff Burton took the lead and led for a lap before being passed by Hamlin. Burton repassed him for the lead on lap 24. On lap 27, Busch reclaimed the lead when Burton was shuffled out of line. As this took place, Burton reported having no voltage in his car. One lap later, the second caution was thrown for debris on the track. Burton was penalized for pitting early to replace his car battery.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{will then}} proceed at <b>caution,</b> at a <b>speed</b> which {{enables him to}} stop within the {{distance}} that he can see to be clear. Even if he {{can see that the}} entire section to the next signal is clear he must still exercise caution.|$|R
50|$|The {{sequence}} of aspects on {{the approach to}} a preceding train {{in areas where the}} Low Speed indication is in use is as follows: Clear, Medium, <b>Caution,</b> Low <b>Speed,</b> Stop. In some cases, the Medium indication will be exhibited at two consecutive signals. At some locations, the Low Speed indication will only be exhibited under reduced overlap conditions (e.g. owing to the presence of a train ahead). Under such a configuration, the {{sequence of}} aspects will be: Clear, Medium, Caution, Stop, provided the full overlap is available.|$|R
50|$|Red Bull Racing's No. 82 {{finished}} 36th in the 2009 owner's points standings, {{missing a}} guaranteed {{entry into the}} first five races of 2010 by one position. Speed successfully qualified for the 2010 Daytona 500. He led several laps late in the race after {{not going to the}} pits with about 19 laps to go. The next week at Auto Club Speedway, during a rain <b>caution,</b> <b>Speed</b> did not pit and ultimately ran out of gas. Speed was in the top 12 after the Food City 500 which guaranteed him a spot in the top 35. During the Michigan race in June, an incident occurred between Speed and his temporary teammate Casey Mears; when they were running 34th and 35th respectively, Mears collided with Speed and he spun out, causing a caution. Mears was replaced by Reed Sorenson {{for the remainder of the}} season. On November 26, 2010, Speed was released from his contract at Red Bull Racing to make room for the returning Brian Vickers who underwent heart surgery in June 2010; causing Speed to file a lawsuit against Red Bull accusing them of violating his contract. Speed's best finish with Red Bull Racing was fifth at Talladega in the 2009 Aaron's 499.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Fellows only raced in 1 event, {{driving his}} first race for JR Motorsports. Fellows, in his only start of 2008, won a rain-shortened NAPA Auto Parts 200 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in the No. 5 car at Montreal. He won after Marcos Ambrose was black-flagged for {{slipping}} across the soaked pit road too fast {{just before the}} red flag flew. This race made history as the first points paying race to be run on Goodyear rain tires. NASCAR races are generally red flagged for rain. This victory marked Ron's fourth NASCAR Nationwide series win, all coming on road courses. This also tied him for first in the Nationwide Series for most road course wins. He is tied with Terry Labonte with 4. Fellows was very emotional about his win because his lifelong childhood dream was to win a professional car race at Montreal since his childhood hero Gilles Villeneuve raced at the track when he watched from the stadium. As {{a result of his}} big win Fellows was given the No. 5 JR Motorsports crew for a multi-year deal. He drove for JR Motorsports through 2009 and 2010 for the road course races. Fellows didn't have any promising races in 2009, but came back to the No. 88 team in 2010 to finish second at Road America. Fellows returned to JR Motorsports in 2011 for the road course races, driving the #7 AER car. He was in contention to win the Bucyrus 200 at Road America. He took the lead from Justin Allgaier, who had run out of fuel previously, passing Reed Sorenson in the process. However, NASCAR ruled that Fellows had passed both drivers under the caution flag way too fast. Believing that Sorenson slowed due to also being out of fuel, Fellows drove past them at nearly race speed until he was leading the caution to the pace lap, though NASCAR rules stipulate that a driver must maintain reasonable speed while under the <b>caution</b> flag (<b>Speeding</b> is not reasonable <b>caution</b> <b>speed</b> anymore). As a result, Fellows was relegated to second place post-race, handing the win to Sorenson. To this day Fellows maintains that he should have won the race.|$|R
25|$|In {{auto and}} {{motorcycle}} racing, racing flags {{are used to}} communicate with drivers. Most famously, a checkered flag {{of black and white}} squares indicates the end of the race, and victory for the leader. A yellow flag is used to indicate <b>caution</b> requiring slow <b>speed</b> and a red flag requires racers to stop immediately. A black flag is used to indicate penalties.|$|R
50|$|In late 2007, Gordon {{had one of}} {{his most}} {{controversial}} and bizarre NASCAR finishes ever. Driving in his own No. 55 Camping World-sponsored car in NASCAR's inaugural race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Gordon passed the then-leader Marcos Ambrose for first place but was turned around by Ambrose in turn three just after the caution flew for a separate incident in turn one. During the caution period Gordon refired his car after slowing to avoid hitting the wall and drove to first place. However he was told that by freezing in place to avoid the wall was not reasonable <b>caution</b> <b>speed</b> and NASCAR told him to restart in 14th place which he refused to do. At the restart Gordon was immediately black-flagged for refusing to restart in 14th place, and tapped the leader Ambrose enough to send the Aussie into a spin in the second turn with two laps to go. He ignored the black flag on the white flag lap and even though he crossed the finish line first Kevin Harvick won the race. Gordon however did not leave the track as ordered and then celebrated on the track as if he won the event. Gordon did have a valid argument as he was spun by Ambrose while slowing down for the yellow flag that had already waived. He was visibly upset during his post-race interview and was adamant that he had indeed won the race. The next day NASCAR fined him $50,000 and put him on probation {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|R
50|$|India uses broad-gauge; {{the only}} other country which has the major broad-gauge R&D and {{manufacturing}} facility is Spain. During the trial run in Delhi-Mumbai route Spain's Talgo trains reached a peak speed of 150 km/h, observing laid-down <b>speed</b> <b>cautions</b> and halting at the usual stoppages as the Mumbai Rajdhani, Talgo clocked an average speed of 117.5 km/h to cover the distance. The Mumbai Rajdhani clocks 15 hours, 50 minutes at an average 87.7 km/h.|$|R
60|$|Beyond Chieveley it was {{necessary}} to observe more <b>caution.</b> The <b>speed</b> was reduced--the engine walked warily. The railway officials scanned the track, and often before a culvert or bridge was traversed we disembarked and examined it from the ground. At other times long halts were made while the officers swept the horizon and the distant hills with field glasses and telescopes. But the country was clear and the line undamaged, and we continued our slow advance. Presently Colenso came into view--a hundred tin-pot houses under the high hills to the northward. We inspected it deliberately. On a mound beyond the village rose the outline of the sandbag fort constructed by the Naval Brigade. The flagstaff, without the flag, still stood up boldly. But, so far as we could tell, the whole place was deserted.|$|R
50|$|The final caution {{came out}} on lap 97 for a turn 2 {{accident}} involving Jimmy Hensley, Rick Mast, Jeff McClure, and eliminating Derrike Cope. Midpack runner Harry Gantpitted while the leaders (Bill Elliott, Ernie Irvan, and Davey Allison) stayed out, not believing they could finish the race on one more pit stop. They had pitted under the previous <b>caution</b> when Lake <b>Speed</b> spun and severed a fuel line. Gant pitted under green at lap 149 and stayed out until the checkered flag waved.|$|R
5000|$|... 188 laps were {{accomplished}} on a paved oval spanning 2.66 mi; {{the race}} was completed in three hours and four minutes; the lead changed hands 49 times among ten drivers. Donnie Allison (who would lead 92 laps overall) needed relief help after drinking a soda during a pitstop and falling ill soon after. Darrell Waltrip relieved Allison and defeated Cale Yarborough by less than a lap under the <b>caution</b> flag. Notable <b>speeds</b> were: 162.524 mph for the winner's speed and 192.684 mph for the pole position qualifying speed. Sixty-five thousand people would attend this live race from the opening ceremonies to the final yellow flag (which marked its official finish).|$|R

30|$|Training {{individuals}} to make accurate decisions from medical images {{is a critical}} component of education in diagnostic pathology. We describe a joint experimental and computational modeling approach to examine the similarities and differences in the cognitive processes of novice participants and experienced participants (pathology residents and pathology faculty) in cancer cell image identification. For this study we collected a bank of hundreds of digital images that were identified by cell type and classified by difficulty by a panel of expert hematopathologists. The key manipulations in our study included examining the speed-accuracy tradeoff as well as the impact of prior expectations on decisions. In addition, our study examined individual differences in decision-making by comparing task performance to domain general visual ability (as measured using the Novel Object Memory Test (NOMT) (Richler et al. Cognition 166 : 42 – 55, 2017). Using signal detection theory and the diffusion decision model (DDM), we found many similarities between experts and novices in our task. While experts tended to have better discriminability, the two groups responded similarly to time pressure (i.e., reduced <b>caution</b> under <b>speed</b> instructions in the DDM) and to the introduction of a probabilistic cue (i.e., increased response bias in the DDM). These results have important implications for training in this area as well as using novice participants in research on medical image perception and decision-making.|$|R
