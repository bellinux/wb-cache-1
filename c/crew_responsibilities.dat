40|$|Medical {{support in}} a Martian {{expedition}} will {{be within the}} scope of <b>crew</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and maximally autonomous. Requirements to the system of diagnostics in this mission include considerable use of means and methods of visualization of the main physiological parameters, telemedicine, broad usage of biochemical analyses (including "dry" chemistry), computerized collection, measurement, analysis and storage of medical information. The countermeasure system will be based on objective methods of crew fitness and working ability evaluation, individual selection of training regimens, and intensive use of computer controlled training. Implementation of the above principles implies modernization and refinement of the countermeasures currently used by space crews of long-term missions (LTM), and increases of the assortment of active and passive training devices, among them a short-arm centrifuge. The system of medical care with the functions of prevention, clinical diagnostics and timely treatment will be autonomous, too. The general requirements to medical care during the future mission are the following: availability of conditions and means for autonomous urgent and special medical aid and treatment of the most possible states and diseases, "a hospital", and assignment to the crew of one or two doctors. To ensure independence of medical support and medical care in an expedition to Mars an automated expert system needs to be designed and constructed to control the medical situation as a whole. c 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance <b>crew's</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|R

5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases.

Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot.

Two competing flight deck design concepts were developed based on different directions that flight deck designs may take in the future because of unpredictable forces and factors. The first design path embodies pilot roles and responsibilities that represent the “pilot as pilot, ” and the second design path embodies roles and responsibilities that represent the “pilot as manager. ” The two flight deck concepts were developed from an analysis of the anticipated operational requirements of the NextGen environment, emphasizing requirements that are likely to have significant impact on flight deck and flight <b>crew</b> functions and <b>responsibilities.</b> The two design concepts were used to generate high level human factors flight deck design guidelines that apply to both design paths in a future “NextGen ” air traffic environment, focusing on those that are new or different from traditional human factors flight deck design guidelines...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} free flight is {{intended}} to provide increased flexibility and efficiency throughout the global airspace system. This idea could potentially shift aircraft separation responsibility from air traffic controllers to flight crews creating a `shared-separation' authority environment. A real-time, human-in-the-loop study was conducted using facilities at NASA Ames Research Center and the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center. The goal was to collect data from controllers and pilots on shared-separation procedures, information requirements, workload, and situation awareness. The experiment consisted of four conditions that varied levels of controller and flight <b>crew</b> separation <b>responsibilities.</b> Twelve controllers and six pilots were provided with enhanced traffic and conflict alerting systems. Results indicated that while safety was not compromised, pilots and controllers had differing opinions regarding the application of these new tools and the feasibility of the operational concept. This limited investigation demonstrated the need to further explore the shared-separation concept. 17. Key Words Free Flight Real-Time Simulation Self-Separation Shared-Separation 18.

40|$|NASA and the Aviation Industry {{is looking}} into reduced crew {{operations}} (RCO) that would cut today's required two-person flight crews down to a single pilot with support from ground-based <b>crews.</b> Shared <b>responsibility</b> across air and ground personnel will require highly reliable and secure data communication and supporting automation, which will be safety-critical for passenger and cargo aircraft. This paper looks at the different types and degrees of authority delegation given from the air {{to the ground and}} the ramifications of each, including the safety and security hazards introduced, the mitigation mechanisms for these hazards, and other demands on an RCO system architecture which would be highly invasive into (almost) all safety-critical avionics. The adjacent fields of unmanned aerial systems and autonomous ground vehicles are viewed to find problems that RCO may face and related aviation accident scenarios are described. The paper explores possible data communication architectures to meet stringent performance and information security (INFOSEC) requirements of RCO. Subsequently, potential challenges for RCO data communication authentication, encryption and non-repudiation are identified. The approach includes a comprehensive safety-hazard analysis of the RCO system to determine top level INFOSEC requirements for RCO and proposes an option for effective RCO implementation.

50|$|The Portuguese {{journalist}} José Milhazes, who {{has lived}} in Moscow since 1977 and currently works for the Portuguese newspaper Público and as a correspondent for the Portuguese television channel SIC, maintains that the plane crash {{had nothing to do with}} any attempt or any mechanical failure, but was due to several errors of the Russian crew (including the pilot), who, instead of diligently performing their duties, were busy with futile things, like sharing alcoholic and soft drinks unavailable in Mozambique that they had had the possibility to bring from Zambia. In Milhazes' opinion, both the Soviet and the Mozambican authorities had an interest to spread the thesis of an attempt by the South African government: the Soviets wanted to safeguard their reputation (exempting the plane and the <b>crew</b> from any <b>responsibility),</b> the Mozambicans wanted to create a hero.|$|R

Four-man umpire <b>crews</b> rotate officiating <b>responsibilities</b> after each game, and travel to several stadiums per year. This new fifth umpire would travel with the umpiring crew to score games and take his turn on the bases, but MLB has been reluctant to incur the increased cost. More recently, there have been suggestions to move the official scorer out of the press box and closer to the field behind the plate to get the best view of the game. MLB has conceded that this could be a good idea, but it is not currently feasible because of the design of most stadiums in the league.|$|R
