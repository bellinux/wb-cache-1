40|$|The {{concept of}} exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps {{has been put}} forward decades ago. With the ongoing push towards drastic heat loss {{reductions}} in the residential systems, it is put forward again by simple exhaust ventilation manufacturers as an alternative for the traditional heat recovery with an <b>air</b> to <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger that is common in mechanical ventilation systems. As with the latter form of heat recovery, the amount of effectively recovered energy is composed of different forms of energy, namely heat and power. The potential for exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps, compared to <b>air</b> to <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exhangers, is assessed by introducing the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness, combining both forms of energy into a single unit based on primary energy and consumer price. Based on lab measurements {{of the performance of}} the heat pumps and assumptions on domestic hot water usage derived from both literature and field measurements, a dynamic model for exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps in residential buildings was developed, providing detailed performance data for the assessment of the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness. The results show that the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness for these systems is low. Based on the results presented, we conclude that a thorough assessment of the specific boundary conditions is necessary to assess the potential of exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps in every single project...|$|R

The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} the investigation the aim of which was to find new easily to accessible materials which are possible to be used as absorbers in <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> sun collectors.

The experimental results of the sun following collector by air movement 0. 9 m·s- 1, show that in <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> cylindrical type boxes absorber with the size R= 2. 5 cm and H= 7 cm (7 boxes in line) is more effective, which is warming up air on average by 1. 6 ˚C on 100 W·m- 2 at the collector size 0. 1 x 0. 5 x 1. 0 m it is <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> level by 1000 W·m- 2 is reaching 16 ˚C.

The analysis were conducted for five different variants of <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> recovery turbine units: simple AHRTU, with air cooling by one intercooler, with air cooling by two intercoolers, with variable humidity before the compressor, with water injection into the compressor.

The compilation of the demands on the motor and analysis of suppliers indicated thatthere were no standard motors available to GTherms <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger.

40|$|If a {{building}} is heated by a heat pump, {{it is of}} high importance that the heat pump has a high coefficient of performance. An exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pump extracts heat from the building’s exhaust air. The air has a relatively high and constant temperature all year around, leading to a high seasonal coefficient of performance. This thesis examines whether it is profitable to complement an exhaust ventilation system with an exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pump in an apartment block that already has geothermal heat pump, district heating, oil- or biofuel heated system. To determinate the profitability, a reference building in Strömstad has been used and was considered a representative of Sweden’s other apartment blocks.

However it must be added that exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps are best suited for single-family houses since they provide relatively low energy compared to e. g. geothermal heat pumps...|$|R

40|$|Summary The paper {{shows that}} the two {{temperature}} ratios F, and F,, introduced in section A 9 (1979) of the C. I. B. S.

From this it follows that if for a building or room C AU c NV, the heat loss coefficient for any method of heating containing {{a significant proportion of}} radiation is smaller than that for warm <b>air</b> <b>heating,</b> for the same dry resultant temperature. This is confirmed by examples. The result is applied to factories built to satisfy part FF of the Building Regulations, and it is shown that only for small factories with little ventilation will the heat loss coefficient for warm <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> be less than for heating including radiation.
