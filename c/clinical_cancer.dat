25|$|Zelen {{was known}} for {{developing}} the statistical methods and study designs {{that are used in}} <b>clinical</b> <b>cancer</b> trials, in which experimental drugs are tested for toxicity, effectiveness, and proper dosage. He also introduced measures to ensure that data from the trials are as free as possible of errors and biases—measures that are now standard practice. Prof. Zelen helped transform clinical trial research into a well-managed and statistically sophisticated branch of medical science. His work in this area has led to significant medical advances, such as improved treatments for several different forms of cancer. His research also focused on improved early detection of cancer; on modeling the progression of cancer and its response to treatment; and on using statistical models to help determine optimal screening strategies for various common cancers, especially breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1978, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) - a major charity {{supporting}} cancer {{research in the}} United Kingdom at the time, decided to provide an £800,000 endowment to support creation of a Chair of Medical Oncology in the Faculty of Medicine in Edinburgh. Following an open competition, the University of Edinburgh appointed John F. Smyth (at the time a senior lecturer in medical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London) for that position on 1 April 1979. After a short visit to the University of Chicago, professor Smyth assumed his duties in Edinburgh on 1 October 1979 (a date that {{can be considered as}} the beginning of the Centre). Soon afterwards, additional posts were provided by the University and matched by appropriate staff positions by Lothian Health Board (NHS) to create first clinical service for medical oncology in Edinburgh. The service was based in the Western General Hospital where some beds and out-patient facilities were provided. In 1980 it was formally recognized as the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit in Edinburgh with professor John Smyth as its director. This resulted in additional funding that allowed building of a small research laboratory which was commissioned in 1981. The laboratory was located in a portable cabin on the Western General Hospital campus. The main focus of the Unit was the development of more successful drug therapies for all forms of cancer and looking for new ways of reducing the side-effects of anti-cancer drugs. With generous support from Imperial Cancer Research Fund and other organisations, the Unit was steadily growing enabling clinical trials for promising anticancer therapeutics. For example, the Unit was responsible for the very first clinical trial of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, heralding in the dramatic changes in emesis control that subsequently followed the development of that class of compounds. In 1984 the Unit moved to a new location at {{the top floor of the}} MRC Human Genetics Unit building which allowed for expansion of laboratory research activities. After a successful ICRF review in 1996, it had been recognized that further extension of scientific activities of the Unit required even more space and prof. Smyth obtained permission to rise funds to create a new purpose designed building. The work started in 2000 and the new £7M building was officially opened in 2002 by The Princess Royal. It provides 3000 square meters of gross internal space and is a current base for majority of ECRC researchers. At that time (in 2002), following reorganisation of faculties into schools within the University of Edinburgh, the name Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre was created and used with reference to the Unit and the new building. In 2004 the successor of ICRF, Cancer Research UK, also started to refer to the Unit as the CRUK <b>Clinical</b> <b>Cancer</b> Centre to emphasize its status as a comprehensive cancer centre. In 2007 ECRC became part of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine. In 2010, following a successful bid, ECRC has been formally recognized as Cancer Research UK Centre and is known as Edinburgh Cancer Research UK Centre.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{breast cancer}} {{resistance}} protein (BCRP) is a recently characterized xenobiotic half‑transporter protein {{that acts as}} an energy‑dependent efflux pump and {{may be associated with}} the multidrug‑resistant phenotype. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the association between BCRP expression and 5 ‑fluorouracil (5 ‑FU) resistance in <b>clinical</b> breast <b>cancer</b> tissue specimens. The BCRP expres-sion was investigated using quantitative reverse‑transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) by use of the Master SYBR-Green I reagent and immunohistochemistry (IHC) by use of the BXP‑ 21 anti‑BCRP monoclonal antibody in <b>clinical</b> breast <b>cancer</b> tissue specimens. Chemosensitivity to 5 ‑FU for BCRP‑positive <b>clinical</b> breast <b>cancer</b> tissue specimens was colorimetrically assessed with the cytotoxicity assay through methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) reduction. A total of 37 BCRP‑positive <b>clinical</b> breast <b>cancer</b> tissue specimens were identified with quantitative RT‑PCR and IHC. There was a significant correlation in BCRP expression between the results of quantitative RT‑PCR and IHC in the specimens. The fold resistance to 5 ‑FU was 7 ‑ 12 compared to sensitivity to pacli-taxel as determined by the colorimetric assay through MTT reduction in the 37 specimens. Our study results indicated that 5 ‑FU resistance may be mediated by BCRP expression in <b>clinical</b> breast <b>cancer</b> tissue specimens, which may help optimize the design of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>clinical</b> chemotherapy schemes in BCRP‑positive specimens...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution flow cytometric (FCM) DNA {{analysis}} was performed on 148 unfixed, frozen tissue samples from four groups of early breast cancers: invasive carcinomas (ICs) with predominance of carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (group I), small <b>clinical</b> <b>cancers</b> < or = 15 mm (group II), node-negative, <b>clinical</b> <b>cancers</b> (group III) and small screening-detected cancers < or = 15 mm (group IV). The median tumour size was 12 mm. The aim {{of the study was}} to support, with a larger sample, our recent findings with respect to DNA ploidy pattern in the selected group of ICs with predominance of DCIS (group I). Similar results to this group were found for both the small <b>clinical</b> <b>cancers</b> and the node-negative cancers, with respect to frequency of DNA aneuploidy (79 % and 90 %), DNA index (DI) distribution, intratumoral DNA heterogeneity and S-phase fraction. A high frequency of DNA hyperdiploid clones was found, in particular related to highly differentiated tumours. A significant difference was found compared with the screening-detected cancers, which were characterised by a much lower frequency of DNA aneuploid samples (49 %) and may represent a biologically specific group of low-malignant, slowly growing tumours. Associations were shown between histological grade and DI subclasses, and between lymph node status and DNA diploidy/aneuploidy, whereas DI was not correlated with tumour size. The DNA ploidy findings in this series of early cancers are concordant to our own results from preinvasive lesions as well as those reported from series of more advanced cancers...|$|R

40|$|Development {{of cancer}} {{requires}} {{the acquisition of}} multiple oncogenic mutations and selection of the malignant clone. Cancer evolves within a finite host lifetime and mechanisms of carcinogenesis that accelerate this process {{may be more likely}} to contribute to the development of <b>clinical</b> <b>cancers.</b> Mutator mutations are mutations that affect genome stability and accelerate the acquisition of oncogenic mutations. However, mutator mutations will also accelerate the accumulation of mutations that decrease cell proliferation, increase apoptosis, or affect other key fitness parameters. These “reduced-fitness” mutations may mediate “negative clonal selection,” i. e., selective elimination of premalignant mutator clones. Target reduced-fitness loci may be “recessive” (both copies must be mutated to reduce fitness) or “dominant” (single-copy mutation reduces fitness). A direct mathematical analysis is applied to negative clonal selection, leading to the conclusion that negative clonal selection against mutator clones is unlikely to be a significant effect under realistic conditions. In addition, the relative importance of dominant and recessive reduced-fitness mutations is quantitatively defined. The relative predominance of mutator mutations in <b>clinical</b> <b>cancers</b> will depend on several variables, including the tolerance of the genome for reduced-fitness mutations, particularly the number and potency of dominant reduced-fitness loci...|$|R
