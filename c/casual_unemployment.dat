This has led to the development of a substantial literature on the topic. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is not always clear what the root cause is. This is particularly true when considering a small geographic area with limited data. This article will explore what insights can be gained through the use of formal concept analysis and association rules. It is hoped that these techniques will be of use to both theoreticians and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} part of the employment creation in Australia between 1992 and 2008 has been of casual nature. Casual workers have low levels of job security, no holiday and/or sick leave, little opportunities to train, but may receive higher wages. If secure and permanent employment was available, casual work would only likely be the first-choice option to those who have no ambition to develop a career in that line of work. However, when secure and permanent employment opportunities are constrained, casual employment would also become an attractive alternative, if it provides a pathway to non-casual employment. The scant longitudinal research in Australia that has been conducted to date which adopts a supply-side approach, has failed to find any conclusive evidence to support the stepping stone hypothesis. In contradistinction, in a previous paper we allowed for include the impact of labour demand and the macro-economic influences on the transition rate towards non-casual employment. We showed that industry-type, occupation, firm size, overall macroeconomic labour market conditions and the degree of urbanisation of the region all affect the transition rate from casual to non-casual employment. In this paper, we test the duration dependence hypothesis in a hazard rate setting using information contained in the HILDA dataset, which refers to career developments before the inception of the data collection in 2001. We use this information to test whether duration dependence affects both the likelihood of transiting upwards (towards non-casual employment) and transiting downwards (towards unemployment). If both transition rates decrease over time, then it is reasonable to conclude that workers are locked into casual employment. If the former reduces over time and the latter increases or is unaffected by time in casual employment then it is reasonable to conclude that workers cycle through <b>casual</b> employment, <b>unemployment</b> and/or stay outside the labour force, without any realistic future to move upwards. The paper finds evidence that under certain circumstances, casual workers are locked-in to repetitive spells of casual work with little change of escape...|$|R
30|$|The {{population}} distribution analysis {{was applied to}} disaggregate {{the number of people}} at Sub District level into a particular land use types within the area. The temporal analysis of {{population distribution}} based on the types of occupation was also conducted in this stage. The main concept of this analysis is to breakdown the population data using dasymetric technique. The main equation used follows the equations  1, 2 and 3 above. The characteristic of livelihood of each village was also used to support the analysis. The result shows that the top 5 occupation types in research area are <b>casual</b> worker, student, <b>unemployment,</b> entrepreneur, and farmer. The percentage of people who work as casual workers reaches 17.92 %; 20.51 %; 18.86 %; 20.16 %; and 23.99 % in Wonokromo, Pleret, Segoroyoso, Bawuran and Wonolelo Village, respectively. The percentage of the students of every village are 16.03 %; 13.89 %; 12.60 %; 11.55 %; and 9.89 %. The unemployed people percentage reaches approximately 13.69 %; 12.89 %; 12.88 %; 13.32 %; 12.11 % and the entrepreneurs approximately 11.84 %; 12.88 %; 16.72 %; 16.12 %; 9.55 %. The farm workers only reach 8.86 % in Wonokromo, 11.03 % in Pleret, 12.17 % in Segoroyoso, 13.59 % in Bawuran, and 15.18 % in Wonolelo.|$|R
40|$|The {{impetus for}} this study was a concern for student {{selection}} of appropriate subject pathways for senior secondary studies. Data indicating that large numbers of students chose not to continue with training and education after leaving secondary education led to this research study. In Queensland, approximately 72 per cent of secondary students take an academic subject pathway for their senior secondary studies although only approximately 36 per cent attend a tertiary institution upon graduation (Department for Education and Industrial Relations, 2011; Department of Education Training and Employment, 2010). In addition, approximately 30 per cent of senior secondary students take a vocational subject pathway however only 25. 1 per cent undertake further vocational education and training after graduation (Department of Education Training and Employment, 2010). Following secondary schooling 40 per cent of secondary students do not transition to education or training and 10 per cent of this group are not employed in their first year after school (Department of Education Training and Employment, 2010). Thus, the majority of students take academic subject pathways but do not use the qualification for tertiary studies nor do the young Queenslanders who studied a vocational subject pathway capitalise on their decision and continue with further vocational education and training upon graduation from secondary schooling. This is a concern because studies on youth unemployment have identified increased risk of future of long term <b>casual</b> employment or <b>unemployment</b> {{for those who do not}} engage in training and education to enhance their employability skills soon after secondary schooling (OECD Secretariat, 2000; Queensland Government, 2002). Moreover, the youth in Queensland face challenges emanating from global and national factors that mean their employment prospects may not be as assured and the future economy may not be as robust as was previously the case. International factors such as globalisation, youth unemployment and economic recessions interact with the Australian and Queensland economies to affect career pathways of secondary school students. Policies and initiatives introduced by the Australian Government to provide secure career pathways for adolescents are affected by changes to the labour market and economic downturns and these affect the opportunities or constraints facing students upon leaving secondary school in Queensland. Exploration into the dissonance between subject pathway choices and eventual post secondary destinations commenced with this study situated in three selected secondary schools with diverse characteristics and locations in Queensland. This study included: two self-report surveys administered to a group of Year 10 students, and semi-structured interviews with nine students from this cohort. Quantitative data were analysed for general data which raised several unresolved issues. The three schools were compared and the unresolved issues explored with a thematic analysis of the interview transcripts and the outcomes combined and discussed. Results suggested: academic self-efficacy was a salient predictor of the subject pathways that students would pursue; preferences for activities, skills or interests were not predictors of the subject pathways students would choose; and the schools 2 ̆ 7 subject selection processes had a minimal effect on the career choices students made as most entered year 10 with a firm idea of their intended career. Students reported personal responsibility for their choice of subject pathway and future career at the same time as identifying their families as powerful agents in the choice of career; and teachers in the choice of subjects. Career Guidance Counsellors in the schools were under-utilised by the participants and had little impact on career choice or subject pathway choices. Overall students were found to assess the viability of information used in choosing subject pathways and career options according to how much they trusted the source and this was determined to some extent by the term of their relationship with that source and how closely that information resonated with their 2 ̆ 2 personal first-hand experiences, social networks and social identities 2 ̆ 2 (Dyke, Foskett, 2 ̆ 6 Maringe, 2008). Results of this study suggest several possible approaches that could be implemented by school administrators and policy makers to provide students with appropriate subject pathway and career advice to smooth the transition for students between secondary studies and their eventual post-school destinations...|$|R
