50|$|Radio {{communication}} {{was provided by}} a 1 W, 108.03 MHz telemetry transmitter and a 10 mW, 108 MHz beacon transmitter that sent a continuous signal for tracking purposes. A <b>command</b> <b>receiver</b> was used to activate a tape recorder that relayed telescope experiment data to the telemetry transmitter.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{spacecraft}} use {{a form of}} dead man's {{switch to}} guard against command system failures. A timer is established that is normally reset by the receipt of any valid command (including one whose sole function is to reset the timer.) If the timer expires, the spacecraft enters a [...] "command loss" [...] algorithm that cycles through a predefined sequence of hardware and/or software modes (such as {{the selection of a}} backup <b>command</b> <b>receiver)</b> until a valid command is received. The spacecraft may also enter a safe mode to protect itself while waiting for further commands.|$|E
50|$|TMCC {{utilizes}} {{the same}} command codes as Digital Command Control (DCC). However, unlike DCC, {{it uses a}} 455 kHz radio transmission to carry the command codes separate from track power. The locomotive decoders are dependent on AC track power (50 or 60 Hz) to synchronize the <b>command</b> <b>receiver.</b> Thus, TMCC can only operate on AC track power. Because TMCC utilizes the DCC command codes, {{it is possible to}} control TMCC with DCC compatible software. MTH Electric Trains included support to interface and control TMCC with its DCS system. Unlike DCC, TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives. Lionel ceased the sale of TMCC command systems in 2010, but continues to introduce models equipped with TMCC decoders. TMCC has been superseded by Lionel's Legacy command system.|$|E
50|$|The antenna {{couplers}} {{provide the}} proper impedance for radio frequency and {{ground support equipment}} <b>commands.</b> The <b>command</b> <b>receivers</b> are tuned to RSS command frequencies and provide the input signal to the distributors when an RSS command is sent. The command decoders use a code plug to prevent any command signal other than the proper command signal from getting into the distributors. The distributors contain the logic to supply valid destruct commands to the RSS pyrotechnics.|$|R

5000|$|The SNAP-10A was a {{space-qualified}} {{nuclear reactor}} power system. It was {{built as a}} research project for the Air Force, to demonstrate the capability to generate higher power than RTGs. The reactor employed two moveable beryllium reflectors for control, and generated 35 kWt at beginning of life. The system generated electricity by circulating NaK around lead tellurium thermocouples. To mitigate launch hazards, the reactor was never started until it reached a safe orbit. It was launched into earth orbit in April, 1965, and used to power an Agena-D research satellite, built by Lockheed/Martin. The system produced 500W of electrical power during an abbreviated 43-day flight test. The reactor was prematurely shut down by a faulty <b>command</b> <b>receiver.</b> It is predicted to remain in orbit for 4,000 years.|$|E
50|$|While {{having some}} {{similarities}} {{to a dead}} man's switch, this type of device (a command loss timer) is not actually a dead man's switch, because it aims to recover from a hardware failure rather than the absence of human operators. It is generally called a watchdog timer, and is also used extensively in nuclear power control systems. System components on a spacecraft that {{put it into a}} safe mode or cause it to execute default behaviors when no command is received within a predefined time window can be considered a dead man's switch, but hardware or software that attempts to receive a command from human operators through an alternate channel is an auto-recovering or adaptive communications system, not a dead man's switch. Voyager 2 recovered from a <b>command</b> <b>receiver</b> failure with a command loss timer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{optical scanner}} {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} obtain cloud-cover data between the equator and 35° to 45° N latitude. As the satellite circled Earth, two photocells, located at the focus of two optical telescopes aimed in diametrically opposite directions, measured the intensity of sunlight reflected from clouds (about 80%), from land masses (15 to 20%), and from sea areas (5%). The satellite motion and rotation caused the photocells to scan the Earth in successive [...] "lines". Separate solar batteries turned on a recorder only when the Earth beneath the satellite was in sunlight and about 50 min of data per orbit were obtained. The measured reflection intensities were stored on tape. Ground stations interrogated the satellite by signaling its <b>command</b> <b>receiver,</b> which caused the entire tape to be played back in 60 s. The tape was then erased and rewound.|$|E

50|$|The 67.5 kg MS-1 {{communications}} satellite was {{shaped like a}} small rectangular box. Within the box, electronics consisted of two <b>command</b> <b>receivers,</b> two minitrack beacons, two telemetry transmitters, an S- and C-band beacon, and antennas; all powered by a 1500 watt-hour battery. Also attached was the fourth stage instrument package. The battery could power the electronics for 18½ hours before running down. To extend the satellite life, the equipment would be powered off by a ground command after the first three orbits (5 hours). During power-down, data results would be analyzed. The satellite would then be powered up for another three orbits (5 more hours). This process would then be repeated a third time. Mercury planners thought that by shutting down and powering up the satellite, the Mercury Tracking Network would get data and experience from the equivalent of three Mercury orbital missions.|$|R
50|$|Galaxy 26, {{known as}} Telstar 6 at the time, {{had its share}} of {{problems}} since its February 15, 1999 launch. It had lost a backup <b>command</b> and control <b>receiver,</b> the back up computer, and had completely shut off twice.|$|R
50|$|The {{radio-frequency}} {{signal that}} {{is transmitted from}} the ground is received by the <b>command</b> <b>receiver</b> and is amplified and demodulated. Amplification is necessary because the signal is very weak after traveling the long distance. Next in the command system is the command decoder. This device examines the subcarrier signal and detects the command message that it is carrying. The output for the decoder is normally non-return-to-zero data. The command decoder also provides clock information to the command logic and this tells the command logic when a bit is valid on the serial data line. The command bit stream that {{is sent to the}} command processor has a unique feature for spacecraft. Among the different types of bits sent, the first are spacecraft address bits. These carry a specific identification code for a particular spacecraft and prevent the intended command from being performed by another spacecraft. This is necessary because there are many satellites using the same frequency and modulation type.|$|E
5000|$|Four terms always {{associated}} with the command pattern are <b>command,</b> <b>receiver,</b> invoker and client. A command object knows about receiver and invokes a method of the receiver. Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command, the receiver object to execute these methods is also stored in the command object by aggregation. The receiver then does the work when the execute (...) method in command is called. An invoker object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about command interface. Invoker object(s), command objects and receiver objects are held by a client object, the client decides which receiver objects it assigns to the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the invoker. The client decides which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaCommand Destruct Receivers {{are used}} on all launch {{vehicles}} {{for the purpose}} of initiating flight termination. The up-link command signal is a UHF carrier frequency modulated with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) audio tones. Typically three commands are used to control and terminate the flight: ARM, DESTRUCT, and OPTIONAL command. The combination and sequence of specified IRIG tones determines the command to be issued. The decoder portion of the <b>command</b> destruct <b>receiver</b> determines the presence and sequence of IRIG tones. Through the use of a microprocessor and digital signalprocessing-technology, Cincinnati Electronics has designed and developed a digital decoder which detects four IRIG tones simultaneously. The digital decoder provides stabilities and repeatabilities unattainable with analog decoders. Reliability and reproducibility are also superior when using the digital approach through the elimination of select and variable components. This improved performance of the decoder is a result of crystal controlled digital filtering and a constant false-alarm rate provided by the microprocessor. The digital filtering is achieved through Finite Impulse Response digital filters. There are a number of additional features provided by the digital decoder. Self-testing of portions of the receiver and correcting for temperature drift can be performed by the decoder. The digital decoder can have its command sequences reprogrammed in the field allowing separate control and termination of each vehicle in a multiple vehicle launch. Also, acceptance test data, date of manufacture, total time unit has been powered up, and other data can be stored inside the <b>Command</b> Destruct <b>Receiver</b> and recalled when needed...|$|R

40|$|This Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis was {{prepared}} by Motorola's Government Electronics Division as required under the Bendix/Motorola subcontract SC- 0721 for the ALSEP program. The ALSEP Redundant <b>Command</b> <b>Receiver</b> {{is a solid}} state receiver with active redundancy {{that may be used}} to receive either PM or PM-FM type signals. This receiver includes two identical electrically separate receivers, consisting of an r £ converter, and IF and Audio Amp, and a power isolator. In addition, the redundant receiver has an rf power divider referred to an an rf coupler, and a selection circuit referred as an audio combiner. The failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis shows, in a systematic way, the effect of part, pin, and receiver redundancy on system performance. Specifically these analyses have identified the only single point failure mechanism, have showed which piece part failure modes result in minor degradation at most and may be eliminated from the reliability calculation, and have verified that Receivers A and B are failure isolated.

40|$|SURFSAT {{is a small}} {{satellite}} designed {{primarily by}} students at the California Institute of Technology under Caltech 2 ̆ 7 s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program and {{is sponsored by the}} Telecommunications and Data Acquisition Office at JPL, the research and development arm for the Deep Space Network (DSN). The project was initiated in the summer of 1987 and has involved several dozen undergraduate students. SURFSAT is designed to radiate at either the milliwatt or microwatt level in four bands: Sband (2. 29 GHz), X-band (8. 45 GHz), Ku-band (15. 33 GHz) and Ka-band (32 GHz). The signals will be received by a new 34 -meter DSN research antenna at Goldstone, California. Performance of the new Ku-band link will be analyzed and compared to the performance of the more standard X-band link. The S-band and Ku-band signals will be used to support DSN spacecraft acquisition tests and training. Other experiment objectives have also been identified, including spacecraft position and orbit determination demonstrations utilizing ground-based connected-element interferometers. It will also carry an optical beacon to demonstrate the possibility of communicating at infra-red wavelengths. The basic SURFSAT satellite is a solar powered cube, 12 inches on each side, that will tumble through space. Attitude stabilization is not required, and the satellites will not have a propulsion subsystem or batteries. Signals are to be radiated in all directions. Redundant <b>command</b> <b>receivers</b> will enable transmit modes of one milliwatt, one microwatt, and OFF.

40|$|Traditional command uplink {{receivers}} {{are very}} limited in performance capability, {{take a long}} time to acquire, cannot operate on both uplink bands (NASA & AFSCN), and only support low-rate communications. As a result, transceivers end up on many programs critical paths, even though they should be a standard purchased spacecraft subsystem. Also, many missions are impacted by the low effective uplink throughput. In order to tackle these challenges, a transceiver was developed that will provide on-site frequency agility, support of high uplink rates, and operation on both NASA and AFSCN frequency bands.

50|$|RELP is {{inspired}} by RFC 3195 syslog and RFC 3080. During initial connection, sender and receiver negotiate session options, like supported command set or application level window size.

5000|$|The {{computer}} was also put into use generating tracking <b>commands</b> for the <b>receiver</b> dish antenna in Ottawa that downloaded data from Alouette. The antenna could not track through [...] "straight up", {{and had to}} be rotated 180 degrees to track back down to the opposite horizon. The movement was controlled by a simple system reading a paper tape, so the {{computer was}} used to produce the tapes so the dish would be slowly rotated as it tracked the satellite, thereby guaranteeing no [...] "dead time". Eventually a library of tapes was built up for any possible pass.|$|R
5000|$|The dishes {{worked by}} {{receiving}} a low-power C-Band (3.7-4.2 GHz) frequency-modulated analog signal {{directly from the}} original distribution satellite - the same signal received by cable television headends. Because analog channels took up an entire transponder on the satellite, and each satellite had a fixed number of transponders, dishes were usually equipped with a modified polar mount and actuator to sweep the dish across the horizon to receive channels from multiple satellites. Switching between horizontal and vertical polarization was accomplished by a small electric servo motor that moved a probe inside the feedhorn throat at the <b>command</b> of the <b>receiver</b> (commonly called a [...] "polarotor" [...] setup). Higher-end receivers did this transparently, switching polarization and moving the dish automatically as the user changed channels.|$|R
