40|$|Abstract. Hamming Code is {{the oldest}} and the most {{commonly}} used single error correcting and double errors detecting code. For implication, it is constructed over the field GF(2). For each r ≥ 2, there is a [n, k, 3] Hamming Code where = 2 − 1 and. A message word of length k is encoded using a generating matrix G into a codeword of length n. This amounts to inserting r parity check digits into the message word. The positions of the parity check digits in the codeword are called the check positions of the code (with respect to G). A received word is then r n k = 2 r − r − 1 th th th decoded using a parity check matrix H. If the check positions of the code are in the 1, 2,, r i i i � th th th coordinates of the codeword, then the i 1, i 2, �, ir rows of H are called the <b>check</b> <b>rows</b> of the code. We proved in this paper that for any parity check matrix of a Hamming Code, there exists a generating matrix G of the code, such that the <b>check</b> <b>rows</b> of the code are linearly independent. We believe that this fact is contained implicitly in a paper of Hamming [7] but we cannot find any explicit proof in existing literature. Using the above fact, we construct a 2 EC-AUED code. 1...|$|R

The factors included were: three varieties, {{three types of}} herbicides-broad-spectrum, broad leaf, grassy leaf herbicide and a control plots following row spacings of 18, 25 and 32 cm. The biological, grain and straw yield, net income and cost benefit ratio were significantly affected by varieties, herbicides and row spacings. Interaction between varieties and row spacings was significant for biological and grain yield and net income. Among varieties Bakhtawar- 92 had maximum biological yield, grain yield, straw yield, net income and benefit cost ratio over Ghaznavi- 98 and Inqilab- 91.

30|$|Early {{termination}} can {{be achieved}} with the TDMP algorithm using the standard schedule, in which each iteration consists of a phase with message passing for all rows of the parity-check matrix followed by a phase with parity <b>checks</b> for all <b>rows</b> of the matrix.

In this section, we consider three alternatives to the standard schedule for the offset-min-sum TDMP algorithm with early termination. Two of them are alternatives of practical interest that provide the same correctness guarantee as the standard schedule. The other alternative uses a naive approach that does not guarantee a valid decoded code word.

30|$|The next {{robustness}} <b>check</b> in <b>row</b> 8 of Table  4 is a {{bit more}} complicated. The Cook case was the law of the First Circuit before the ADAAA, and it remains good law there today. It was never explicitly agreed with by another circuit and in fact was distinguished or disagreed with by other circuits during the pre-ADAAA period. Thus, {{it is possible that the}} better specification is one that compares outcomes of the morbidly obese outside the First Circuit (where the law more dramatically changed after the ADAAA) to outcomes of the morbidly obese inside the First Circuit (where the ADAAA was less revolutionary) in the pre- and post-ADAAA periods. Carrying out such a comparison requires a triple-difference estimate, where the coefficient of interest is notinthefirstcircuit*post*morbidlyobese. 31 Even in this specification, the results are not substantially different from the baseline estimates. Apparently, the employment of morbidly obese men dropped much more dramatically outside the First Circuit than within the First Circuit during the post- 2008 period (hence, the point estimate in column 1 triples to − 0.065). The labor market participation rates for women also dropped more dramatically outside the First Circuit relative to within the First Circuit during the post- 2008 period. In general, the other results are statistically insignificant, with the exception of a very large, positive point estimate indicating an increase in morbidly obese women’s labor market participation outside the First Circuit during the post- 2010 period. Given that this result is somewhat of an anomaly compared to the other estimates and is so large (7.1 percentage points), it is difficult to conclude that the increase is solely the result of EEOC enforcement of the ADAAA after 2010. At best, this result suggests that EEOC enforcement of the ADAAA may have encouraged some morbidly obese women outside the First Circuit to enter the labor market after 2010.|$|R

The amount of light reflected by a surface is affected {{by a combination of}} factors including the surface’s reflectance properties and illumination conditions. The latter are not limited by the strength of the illuminant but also include the relative placement of the light illuminating the surface, the orientation of the surface and its 3 d shape, all of which result in a pattern of luminance gradients across the surface. In this study we explore how luminance gradients contribute to lightness perception. We introduce a novel, simple lightness illusion. It consists of six separate <b>checks,</b> organized in <b>rows</b> of two. Each check has a negative luminance gradient across it. The top and the bottom rows are the same: with the darker check on the left, and the lighter check on the right. Two checks in the middle row are identical; however, the check on the right appears darker than the check on the left. As there are no shared borders between the checks, simultaneous contrast cannot explain the effect. However, there are multiple possible explanations including spatial filtering (Blakeslee & McCourt, 2004) or some higher-order mechanism such as perceptual grouping or amodal completion. Here, we explore these possibilities by manipulating the luminance configurations and the gradient slopes of the checks...|$|R

The House of Shammai taught that one needed to check the two front rows of the entire wine cellar, but the House of Hillel taught that one needed to check only the two outer rows that were uppermost.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997[...] They did not worry that perhaps a weasel had dragged leavened bread from house to house, or from place to place, for if they had, {{they would have had to}} worry that the weasel had dragged leavened bread from {{courtyard}} to courtyard and from city to city, and there would have been no end to the matter.. Rabbi Judah taught that they searched for leavened foods on the evening of the 14th, and on the morning of the 14th, and at the time that they destroyed the leavened foods (in the sixth hour – between 11 a.m. and noon). But the Sages maintained that if they did not search on the evening of the 14th, they needed to search on the 14th; if they did not search in the morning of the 14th, they needed to search at the time that they destroyed the leavened foods; if they did not search at that time, they needed to search after that time. And what they left over for the last morning meal before the Festival, they needed to put away in a hidden place, so that they should not need to search after it. Rabbi Meir taught that they could eat leavened foods through the fifth hour of the morning, and needed to burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour. Rabbi Judah taught that they could eat it through the fourth hour of the morning, needed to keep it in suspense during the fifth hour, and needed to burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour. Rabbi Judah also told that they used to put two unfit loaves of the thank offering on the roof of the Temple portico, and as long as the loaves lay there, all the people would eat leavened foods. When they would remove one loaf, the people would keep leavened foods in suspense, neither eating nor burning it. And when they removed both loaves, the people began burning their leavened foods. Rabban Gamaliel taught that unconsecrated leavened bread ( [...] , chullin) could be eaten through the fourth hour of the morning, and leavened bread that was a heave-offering ( [...] , terumah) could be eaten through the fifth hour, and they burned them at the beginning of the sixth hour. The Mishnah taught that during the entire time that one was permitted to eat leavened food, one was allowed to feed it to cattle, beasts, and birds; sell it to a gentile; and otherwise to benefit from it. When its period had passed, benefit from it was forbidden, and one was not even allowed to fire an oven or a pot range with it. Rabbi Judah taught that there was no destruction of leavened food except by burning. But the Sages maintained that one could also crumble it and throw it to the wind or casts it into the sea.|$|R
