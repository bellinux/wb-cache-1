5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{moving to}} the prosperous Bel Air section of Los Angeles (specifically to an area known today as East Gate Bel Air), Weissmuller would later famously {{commission}} architect Paul Williams to design a large home with a 300-foot serpentine swimming pool that <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> the house (and which still exists).|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} {{transfer}} window closed on 31 January 2007, Maloney signed a pre-contract agreement with Aston Villa. Villa manager Martin O'Neill, who managed him at Celtic, was keen to bring Maloney to Villa {{for the second}} half of the season however and moments before the deadline he signed for the Midlands club for a reported fee of £1 million. He made his debut in the 2–0 defeat at Reading on 10 February 2007 On 28 April 2007, Maloney scored his first Villa goal in a victory against Man City at the City of Manchester Stadium from a free kick which was <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> the wall into the bottom right of the goal.|$|E

500|$|Michael Hubbard of musicOMH commented {{positively}} on it, writing [...] "the {{spine of}} the CD is entirely white, {{while the rest of}} the sleeve features innovative photography and artwork, preparing the listener before they even hear the album for something very special". Jason Killingsworth of Paste wrote: [...] "When I see the swan, my eye drifts past its beak to those pillowy white feathers, recalling the plushness and warmth of a down comforter. Feathers so white they evoke the purity of freshly fallen snow blanketing the ground outside while you sip a coffee by the fire, both hands <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> the mug's warm ceramic finish".|$|E
500|$|The sticks {{for playing}} taiko are called bachi, and {{are made in}} various sizes and from {{different}} kinds of wood such as white oak, bamboo, and Japanese magnolia. Bachi are also held {{in a number of}} different styles. In kumi-daiko, it is common for a player to hold their sticks in a relaxed manner between the V-shape of the index finger and thumb, which points to the player. There are other grips that allow performers to play much more technically difficult rhythms, such as the shime grip, which is similar to a matched grip: [...] the bachi are gripped at the back end, and the fulcrum rests between the performer's index finger and thumb, while the other fingers remain relaxed and slightly <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> the stick.|$|E
500|$|The inflorescences are {{generally}} globular and measure [...] in diameter, although larger forms, such as var. dolichostyla, are more oval in shape. Flowering from January to July, the blooms are yellow, orange or brownish in colour. They take {{five to eight}} weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering. Anthesis takes place over two weeks, as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence. Three weeks before the flowers open, the spikes develop a strong musky smell. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce {{so much that it}} drips to the ground. The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> the flower spike. Up to 60follicles develop on the globular spikes. The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour, measuring [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. The follicles are flat with pronounced 'shoulders', giving a rectangular appearance in cross section. Specimens of var. sphaerocarpa in the Whicher Range, Jarrah Forest and the vicinity of Nannup have larger follicles. The seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate), and measure [...] in length, containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring [...] long by [...] wide.|$|E

2500|$|Most shapes {{are simple}} but very elegant. The size and {{decoration}} of larger fine pieces increases from the Yuan onwards, {{with some very}} large vases and lidded wine jars being made by the 14th century. The [...] "mallet" [...] vase was a special favourite at Longquan, often with handles formed as animals or dragons. [...] Funerary vases, made in pairs, also often feature charmingly stylized animals, usually tigers and dragons, <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> {{the shoulders of the}} vessel. These were used in southern Chinese burial custom to store provisions for the afterlife. [...] Another distinct Longquan style was a dish with two or more fishes in low relief swimming in the centre, either in biscuit or glazed; these sometimes have holes drilled for metal handles, as mentioned in a late 14th-century source.|$|E
60|$|The {{shot was}} a poor one, the charge merely tearing across {{the side of the}} water snake. With another hiss it whipped around and in a {{twinkling}} had itself <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> Whopper's left leg.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{sat down}} with his big bushy tail <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> to keep his toes warm, cocked his head on one side, {{and looked up at}} Blacky the Crow {{as if he were trying}} to see right inside that black head to find out what was going on there.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] replied Guph, calmly, and he blew {{a wreath}} of smoke that <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> the King's nose {{and made him}} sneeze. [...] "You want to conquer the Emerald City, and I'm the only Nome in all your dominions who can conquer it. So you will be {{very careful not to}} hurt me until I have carried out your wishes. After that--" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} help seeing, however, that the crisp brown hair under {{the edges of the}} unclerical-looking cap <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> a remarkably well-shaped forehead, beneath which flashed out a pair of very fine dark-grey eyes; he had {{likewise}} a good mouth, which was resolute and looked as if it might be stubborn on occasion; and, although he was not exactly handsome, Frances decided that she liked his face.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{bracelet}} of hair, of some curious foreign workmanship. A green enameled serpent, studded thickly with emeralds and with eyes of ruby, was <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> the clasp. A crystal plate covered a wide flat braid of hair, {{on which the}} letters [...] "D.M." [...] were curiously embroidered in a cipher of seed pearls. The whole was in style and workmanship quite different from any jewelry which ordinarily meets one's eye.|$|E

60|$|The head of Miss Grant {{was covered}} by a neat little hat of green silk, and her modest eyes peered from under its shade, with the soft languor that {{characterized}} her whole appearance; but Miss Temple trod her father’s wide apartments with the step of their mistress, holding in her hands, dangling by one of its ribbons, the gypsy that was to conceal the glossy locks that <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> her polished fore head in rich profusion.|$|E
60|$|So as {{they sat}} there, Reddy Fox on the snow with his tail <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> his feet to keep them warm, and Blacky the Crow {{in the top of}} a little tree above Reddy's head, they were playing a sort of game. It was red wits against black wits. Reddy was trying to outguess Blacky, and Blacky was trying to outguess Reddy, and both were enjoying it. People with sharp wits always enjoy {{matching}} their wits against other sharp wits.|$|E
60|$|She had a {{reputation}} for cleverness and originality. She never talked much. So far today she had not said a word. She was sitting on the sill of the window across from Lucy Knox. She swung her hat on her knee, and loose, moist rings of dark hair <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> her dark, alert face. There was a sparkle in her grey eyes that boded ill to the men who were peaceably pursuing their avocations, rashly indifferent to what the women might be saying in the maple-shaded classroom.|$|E
5000|$|The matched grip is {{performed}} by gripping the drum sticks with one's index finger and middle finger <b>curling</b> <b>around</b> {{the bottom of}} the stick and the thumb on the top. This allows the stick to move freely and bounce after striking a percussion instrument.|$|R
500|$|This clade {{became the}} basis for new {{subseries}} Sphaerocarpae, which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers, styles loosely <b>curling</b> <b>around</b> the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in micrantha), and [...] "transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face". Other than the most basal B.grossa, these species also have shouldered follicles. Having found B.micrantha to be more closely related than B.sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla to the other varieties of B.sphaerocarpa, they promoted var. dolichostyla to species rank as Banksia dolichostyla. Morphological support for this was given {{by the fact that the}} old styles of var. dolichostyla are quite different from those of other varieties, being stouter, and tending not to <b>curl</b> <b>around</b> the infructescence as the others do.|$|R
5000|$|Trichostema purpusii, is a {{perennial}} {{plant in the}} mint family (Lamiaceae) native to Mexico. It has pink, bilaterally symmetrical flowers.

The first leaf he cut down released Scraps, and on seeing her the Shaggy Man threw back his shaggy head, opened wide his mouth and laughed so shaggily and yet so merrily that Scraps liked him at once.

60|$|The raindrops sparkled on her shining hair; its {{loosened}} rings <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> {{her neck}} and forehead. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes big and starry. Her companion {{looked down at her}} admiringly. She felt herself blushing under his gaze. Who could he be? Why, {{there was a bit of}} the Redmond white and scarlet pinned to his coat lapel. Yet she had thought she knew, by sight at least, all the Redmond students except the Freshmen. And this courtly youth surely was no Freshman.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{sure enough}} {{the next day}} she flung a little bunch of roses clear across the street into our door. O'Connor dived for it and found a piece of paper <b>curled</b> <b>around</b> a stem with a line in Spanish on it. He dragged the {{interpreter}} out of his corner and got him busy. The interpreter scratched his head, and gave us as a translation three best bets: 'Fortune had got a face like the man fighting'; 'Fortune looks like a brave man'; and 'Fortune favors the brave.' We put our money on the last one.|$|E
