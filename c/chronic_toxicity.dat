5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why <b>chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E

25|$|In general, acute {{toxicity}} occurs at doses of 25,000 IU/kg {{of body weight}}, with <b>chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> occurring at 4,000 IU/kg of body weight daily for 6â€“15 months.

In people with renal failure, 4000 IU can cause substantial damage. Signs of toxicity may occur with long-term consumption of vitamin A at doses of 25,000-33,000 IU per day.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to quantify the}} reduction in normal tissue complications resulting from the aggressive management of advanced head and neck cancers (AHNCs) utilizing tissue/dose compensation (TDC). Thirty-nine patients with AHNC were treated on an intensive chemotherapy radiation regimen. Eighteen of 39 patients were treated using TDC; the remaining 21 patients were radiated without TDC (NTDC). Acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>toxicities,</b> swallowing, speech function, {{and quality of life}} were assessed. The TDC group had a smaller radiation dose gradient across the entire treatment volume. Unscheduled treatment breaks were required in 11 % of TDC patients as compared with 43 % of the NTDC group (P 0. 04). The TDC group had fewer Grade 3 or 4 acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>toxicities</b> and lower SOMA scores. At 3 months posttreatment, patients in the TDC group had better oral intake, lower pharyngeal residue, and better oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency and were able to swallow more bolus types. Patients in the TDC group also had better articulation. Use of TDC resulted in reduced treatment-related interruptions, decreased acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>toxicities,</b> and better speech and swal-lowing functions.

25|$|Springtails are {{currently}} used in laboratory tests {{for the early}} detection of soil pollution. Acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> tests have been performed by researchers, mostly using the parthenogenetic isotomid Folsomia candida. These tests have been standardized. Details on a ringtest, on the biology and ecotoxicology of Folsomia candida and comparison with the sexual nearby species Folsomia fimetaria (sometimes preferred to Folsomia candida) are given in a document written by Paul Henning Krogh. Care should be taken that different strains {{of the same species}} mays be conducive to different results. Avoidance tests have been also performed. They have been standardized, too. Avoidance tests are complementary to toxicity tests, but they also offer several advantages: they are more rapid (thus cheaper), more sensitive and they are environmentally more reliable, because in the real world Collembola move actively far from pollution spots. It may be hypothesized that the soil could become locally depauperated in animals (and thus improper to normal use) while below thresholds of toxicity. Contrary to earthworms, and like many insects and molluscs, Collembola are very sensitive to herbicides and thus are threatened in no-tillage agriculture, which makes a more intense use of herbicides than conventional agriculture.|$|E

2500|$|While {{glyphosate}} and formulations such as Roundup {{have been}} approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist. Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that [...] "the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing" [...] with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified {{an increased risk of}} NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as [...] "probablynbsp&carcinogenicnbsp&in humans" [...] (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In November, 2015, the European Food Safety Authority published an updated assessment report on glyphosate, concluding that [...] "the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans." [...] Furthermore, the final report clarified that while other, probably carcinogenic, glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies [...] "that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect." [...] The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 confirming that the use of glyphosate formulations does not constitute a health risk and also gave admissible daily intake limits for <b>chronic</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) maintained their current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.|$|E

A lot of research on health effects, including genotoxic effect of <b>chronic</b> arsenic <b>toxicity</b> in humans, have been carried out in West Bengal during the last 2 decades. A review of literature including information available from West Bengal has been made to characterize the problem. Scientific journals, monographs, and proceedings of conferences with regard to human health effects, including genotoxicity, of <b>chronic</b> arsenic <b>toxicity</b> have been reviewed. Pigmentation and keratosis are the specific skin diseases characteristic of <b>chronic</b> arsenic <b>toxicity.</b> However, in West Bengal, it was found to produce various systemic manifestations, such as chronic lung disease, characterized by chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive and/or restrictive pulmonary disease, and bronchiectasis; liver diseases, such as non cirrhotic portal fibrosis; polyneuropathy; peripheral vascular disease; hypertension; nonpitting edema of feet/hands; conjunctival congestion; weakness; and anemia. High concentrations of arsenic, {{greater than or equal to}} 200 Â Î¼g/L, during pregnancy were found to be associated with a sixfold increased risk for stillbirth. Cancers of skin, lung, and urinary bladder are the important cancers associated with this toxicity.
