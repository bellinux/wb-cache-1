50|$|Common ways of {{applying}} an adhesive include brushes, rollers, using films or pellets, spray guns and applicator guns (e.g., <b>caulk</b> <b>gun).</b> All of {{these can be}} used manually or automated {{as part of a}} machine.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} itself involves {{insertion of}} a <b>caulk</b> <b>gun</b> device into the rectum with subsequent manual infusion of barium paste {{until there is}} adequate distension. The patient is then transferred to a portable plastic commode which is situated next to a fluoroscope which records the defecation. Positioning of the x-ray camera {{is of paramount importance}} as visualization of the buttocks, rectal vault, and lower pelvis is critical.|$|E
40|$|Highlights of Day 5 of the STS- 114 Return to Flight mission (Commander Eileen Collins, Pilot James Kelly, Mission Specialists Soichi Noguchi, Stephen Robinson, Andrew Thomas, Wendy Lawrence, and Charles Camarda) include video {{coverage}} of an extravehiclular activity (EVA) by Noguchi and Robinson. The other crew members of Discovery are {{seen on the}} flight deck and mid-deck helping the astronauts to suit-up. The objectives of the EVA are to test repair techniques on sample tiles in the shuttle's payload bay, to repair electrical equipment for a gyroscope on the International Space Station (ISS), and to install a replacement GPS antenna on the ISS. Noguchi and Robinson use a <b>caulk</b> <b>gun</b> and a putty knife to repair the sample tiles. The video contains several Earth views, including one of Baja California...|$|E

50|$|Construction {{adhesive}} is a general-purpose adhesive {{used for}} attaching drywall, tile, molding, and fixtures to walls, ceilings, and floors. It is most commonly available in tubes {{intended for use}} with a <b>caulking</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use {{of cream}} cheese defines the Seattle-style hot dog. Sellers {{sometimes}} have devices similar to <b>caulking</b> <b>guns</b> to quickly dispense the cream cheese. The owner of Dante's Inferno Dogs {{says that he}} was the first to introduce their use.|$|R
2500|$|Big Mac Sauce is {{delivered}} to McDonald's restaurants in sealed canisters designed by Sealright, {{from which it}} is meant to be directly dispensed using a special calibrated [...] "sauce gun" [...] that dispenses a specified amount of the sauce for each pull of the trigger. Its design is similar to a <b>caulking</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tools with pistol grips run {{the range}} from hand saws to {{pneumatic}} nailers. Often the word [...] "gun" [...] {{appears in the}} name of pistol-gripped tools such as the glue <b>gun,</b> <b>caulking</b> <b>gun</b> and nail gun. A number of tools, like firearms, have a forward pistol grip. Drills and grinders often include this feature for added control.|$|R
50|$|One-component {{sealants}} {{are commonly}} sold in cartridges which are loaded into a pistol-like <b>caulking</b> <b>gun</b> (opening at the side) or barrel gun (opening at the end) for application. During the tool-working time, which varies by chemistry, the bead can be {{pressed into the}} joint {{so that it can}} bond with the materials on both sides, and also be smoothed. The time it takes for a chemical sealant to become a rubber is known as the curing time and varies by temperature and humidity.|$|R
40|$|On-orbit repair {{technologies}} for reinforced carbon-carbon composite (RCC) structures are critically needed for space shuttle return to flight (RTF) efforts. These technologies are also critically {{needed for the}} repair and refurbishment of thermal protection system of future Crew Entry Vehicles (CEV) of space exploration programs. GRABER (Glenn Adhesive Refractory for Bonding and Exterior Repair) has shown multiuse capability for in-space repair of both large repairs and small cracks in space shuttle Reinforced Carbon Carbon (RCC) leading edge material. The concept consists of preparing an adhesive paste and then applying the paste tot he damaged/cracked area of the RCC composites with <b>caulking</b> <b>gun.</b> The adhesive paste cures at 100 - 120 C and transforms into a high temperature ceramic during vehicle re-entry conditions. Further development and testing are underway to optimize the materials properties and extend the application temperature...|$|R
40|$|Advanced in-space repair {{technologies}} for reinforced carbon/carbon composite (RCC) thermal protection system (TPS) structures are critically {{needed for the}} space shuttle Return To Flight (RTF) efforts. These technologies are also critical for the repair and refurbishment of thermal protection system structures of future Crew Exploration Vehicles of space exploration programs. The Glenn Refractory Adhesive for Bonding and Exterior Repair (GRABER) material developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center has demonstrated capabilities for repair of small cracks and damage in RCC leading-edge material. The concept consists of preparing an adhesive paste of desired ceramic in a polymer/phenolic resin matrix with appropriate additives, such as surfactants, and then applying the paste into the damaged or cracked area of the RCC composite components with <b>caulking</b> <b>guns.</b> The adhesive paste cures at 100 to 120 C and transforms into a high-temperature ceramic during simulated vehicle reentry testing conditions...|$|R
