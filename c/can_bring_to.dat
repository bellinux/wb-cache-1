5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the finished product was described as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{attempts}} {{to escape from}} Sid's house, but Buzz, finally realizing he is a toy, sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next day, Woody and Sid's mutant toy creations rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys by coming to life in front of him, and he runs into his house while devastated. Woody and Buzz then leave Sid's house just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.|$|E
25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E

The chain saw accelerated store expansion upon the collapse of Woolworths Group, where they took the opportunity to acquire 15 of these former stores, increasing their estate to 79 at that time.

25|$|The Saracens have invaded France and {{are laying}} siege to Paris. The Saracen king has a giant {{to whom he}} has promised the hand of his {{beautiful}} daughter Marsabelle if he <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> her {{the head of the}} French king, Dagobert. At this moment, the giant is leaning over the city wall of Paris, taunting the population and threatening to destroy them all. Everyone is terrified. Six knights have already sallied out and been slaughtered by this giant. Now he is leaning over the wall again and taunting them all once more.|$|E
25|$|In more {{sophisticated}} {{systems such as}} large cities, this concept is further extended: some streets are marked as being one-way, and on those streets all traffic must flow in only one direction, but pedestrians on the sidewalks are generally not limited to one-way movement. A driver wishing to reach a destination he already passed must use other streets in order to return. Usage of one-way streets, despite the inconveniences it <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> individual drivers, can greatly improve traffic flow since they usually allow traffic to move faster and tend to simplify intersections.|$|E

25|$|The canal {{is located}} within the {{boundaries}} of a number of local authorities, and such bodies are increasingly aware of the benefits and regeneration that a canal restoration project <b>can</b> <b>bring.</b> <b>To</b> this end, the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canals Regeneration Partnership was created as a collaborative effort between the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canals Trust, Torfaen County Borough Council, Newport City Council, Caerphilly County Borough Council, the Forestry Commission and British Waterways. The Regeneration Partnership submitted a bid to the Big Lottery Living Landmarks fund for £25million, this being 75 percent of the estimated cost of restoring the main line from Barrack Hill to Cwmbran, including {{the construction of a new}} aqueduct to take the canal over Greenforge Way, and of restoring the Crumlin Branch from Malpas Junction to the bottom of the Cefn Flight of fourteen locks, including improvements to its water supply. The bid reached the development stage, and the Partnership successfully obtained a grant of £250,000 to enable them to undertake a full cost and engineering study for the proposed community based regeneration of the waterway. The Partnership continues to meet to discuss the way forward to completing the restoration.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the graph}} to the right, the {{retailer}} has seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009. Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier because of the new empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they are now less reluctant to fill them with discount stores, as they are now being charged for stores which lie empty. Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, notes that landlords are now being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come and have a look at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected by the recession, allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago. Landlords are now regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> a location.|$|E

He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth.

500|$|The Secretary-General {{acts as the}} {{de facto}} {{spokesperson}} {{and leader of the}} UN.

The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues.|$|E
500|$|Golden Sun games {{generally}} have longer development cycles than their peer games on similar consoles {{due to the}} series' complex gameplay mechanisms and storylines.

2500|$|Photothyristors are {{activated}} by light. The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, {{which can cause}} faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically sensitive region in its gate, into which electromagnetic radiation (usually infrared) is coupled by an optical fiber. [...] Since no electronic boards need to be provided at {{the potential of the}} thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as HVDC. [...] Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high; [...] they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection, but not commercially. Despite the simplification they <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{implementation}} has issues; inclusion or exclusion of artisanal mining and small-scale mining (ASM) from the EITI {{and how to}} deal with [...] "non-cash" [...] payments made by companies to subnational governments. Furthermore, the disproportionate revenues the mining industry <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> the comparatively small number of people that it employs, causes other problems, like a lack of investment in other less lucrative sectors, leading to swings in government revenuebecause of volatility in the oil markets. Artisanal mining is clearly an issue in EITI Countries such as the Central African Republic, D.R. Congo, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – i.e. almost half of the mining countries implementing the EITI. Among other things, limited scope of the EITI involving disparity in terms of knowledge of the industry and negotiation skills, thus far flexibility of the policy (e.g. liberty of the countries to expand beyond the minimum requirements and adapt it to their needs), creates another risk of unsuccessful implementation. Public awareness increase, where government should act as a bridge between public and initiative for a successful outcome of the policy is an important element to be considered.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} the limitations of what procedural generation <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> a game. While the engine can produce {{a vast array of}} different planets, it is built atop a finite number of predetermined assets, such as basic creature shapes or planetary biomes, and one quickly exhausts these core assets even with the variations allowed by procedural generation. An evaluation of the game's code showed that Hello Games had the foresight to enable new predetermined assets to be added into the game through updates, which Gamasutra Alissa McAloon suggested that with more artists to provide more content, Hello Games or third-parties could exponentially expand the perceived uniqueness of each planet. Kate Compton, who worked on the procedural generation elements of Spore, called this issue [...] "procedural oatmeal", in that while you can pour a near infinite number of bowls of oatmeal with various differences, the end result still will look like a bowl of oatmeal. Compton noted that No Man's Sky lacks a quality of perceptual uniqueness, a problem that other game researchers are looking to try to solve to provide a more crafted but still procedurally generated experience to the player, placing less emphasis on the vastness of potential outcomes as No Man's Skys marketing relied on.|$|E
