The industry used Cantopop songs in TV dramas and movies, {{with some of the}} biggest soundtracks coming from films such as A Better Tomorrow(英雄本色). Sponsors and record companies became <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of lucrative contracts and million-dollar signings. There are also Japanese songs with Cantonese lyrics.|$|E

50|$|MotionVR is {{the name}} of a 3D imaging {{software}} application written by the programmer Jacob Uzon-Miller. The purpose of motionVR is to inexpensively and quickly create a photographic virtual tour of a real location. Another goal of the projects is to enable anybody with an internet connection to traverse photographed remote locations on a standard web page. The experience is similar to a first-person shooter video games, such as Counter-Strike and Quake. However, the software was written specifically for people who are not <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> technology. <b>The</b> main <b>idea</b> behind <b>the</b> software is to bypass difficult and expensive 3D modeling techniques, by using recent phenomena such as the widespread availability of high megapixel digital cameras and increasing PC processor power.|$|R

Thus, it is important to examine topics relevant to kidney donors such as communication leading to the donation decision and donor characteristics. This study reports personal characteristics and communication leading to the decision to donate among living kidney donors and a demographically matched quota sample. Donors had higher scores for compassion, while non‐donors reported more volunteerism. Donors and non‐donors did not differ in conversation or conformity orientations of family communication styles. Only 4. 7 % of donors reported being asked to donate directly. Matched respondents reported feeling more <b>comfortable</b> than unsettled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of being asked directly and indicated a preference to learn of the need directly or indirectly, giving them the option to volunteer. The majority of donors were giving to family members and friends, and the matched sample indicated greater willingness to donate to immediate family members, followed by friends. Practical implications of the findings are offered...|$|R

It was {{difficult}} for any one to understand Lucy's state of mind at present, and it can hardly be said that she understood it herself. She felt that she had received a severe blow in having been thus made the subject of remark with reference to Lord Lufton. She knew that her pleasant evenings at Framley Court were now over, and that she could not again talk to him in an unrestrained tone and without embarrassment. She had felt the air of the whole place to be very cold before her intimacy with him, and now it must be cold again. Two homes had been open to her; Framley Court and the parsonage; and now, as far as comfort was concerned, she must confine herself to the latter. She could not again be comfortable in Lady Lufton's drawing-room. But then she could not help asking herself whether Lady Lufton was not right. She had had courage enough, and presence of mind, to joke about the matter when her sister-in-law spoke to her, and yet she was quite aware that it was no joking matter. Lord Lufton had not absolutely made love to her, but he had latterly spoken to her in a manner which she knew was not compatible <b>with</b> that ordinary <b>comfortable</b> masculine friendship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of which she had once satisfied herself. Was not Fanny right when she said that intimate friendships of that nature were dangerous things? ...|$|R

Despite this, Friedman [...] "always kept her in mind" [...] and, as the pilot for The Sarah Connor Chronicles was being cast, she {{was called in to}} audition. Glau did not plan on auditioning, however, because she had a preconceived idea that the producers wanted [...] "statuesque, icy blondes" [...] for the role, and felt that she did not suit such an image.

2500|$|Jobs and Apple {{became more}} successful, and his {{relationship}} with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous.
