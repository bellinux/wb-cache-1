5|$|Lawsuits {{were filed}} against Barr by GOP members in Pennsylvania {{to prevent the}} {{candidate}} from appearing on the state's ballot on <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Libertarian Party tricked individuals into signing the state's ballot access petition. Commonwealth Court Judge Johnny Butler dismissed these allegations on September 16, allowing Barr {{to remain on the}} state's ballot. The Barr campaign filed a lawsuit to prevent John McCain and Barack Obama from appearing on the ballot in Texas, charging that the candidates' parties did not reach the state's August 26 deadline to report their nominations to the Secretary of State. Texas Secretary of State Esperanza Andrade reported that all the correct paperwork was filed, though neither the Democratic nor Republican parties formally nominated their candidates (at their respective conventions) until after the deadline.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} {{peace that}} Honduras had enjoyed {{for nearly two}} decades was shattered by a series of events during 1954, Gálvez's last year in office. Tension throughout the region had been increasing steadily as a confrontation developed between the United States and the left-leaning government of President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán in Guatemala. Part of the confrontation involved the expropriation of United Fruit Company lands and <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan government was encouraging agitation among the banana workers.|$|E

However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type that you would find on a police fingerprint index card. Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility of their being planted.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, a {{local court}} in Sibiu asked the Constitutional Court of Romania whether {{the article is}} constitutional.

All the churches which answered to the request condemned homosexuality, the Senate rejected the <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> article is contrary to the constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the academy announced that it will take time to analyse the issue, while the civil society asked for the ban to be removed.|$|E
25|$|Despite a busy schedule, Giuliani {{was highly}} {{active in the}} day-to-day {{business}} of the law firm, which was a high-profile supplier of legal and lobbying services to the oil, gas, and energy industries. Its aggressive defense of pollution-causing coal-fired power plants threatened to cause political risk for Giuliani, but association with the firm helped Giuliani achieve fund-raising success in Texas. In 2006, Giuliani acted as the lead counsel and lead spokesmen for Bracewell & Giuliani client Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, during their negotiations with federal prosecutors over <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pharmaceutical company misled the public about OxyContin's addictive properties.

25|$|The stadium laid dormant in {{the months}} after the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, with photos {{surfacing}} in early 2017 of a dried up playing field covered in brown spots and missing turf, ripped-out seats, and damage to windows and doors. A debt of 3 million reals ($939,937 USD) to the local energy company led to power being shut off in Maracana. At heart of the issue is legal wrangling between the stadium's owner, operator and the organizing committee for the Rio Olympics over responsibility for maintaining the grounds. Maracana SA, the operator, <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Olympic committee did not return the venue in an acceptable condition, while the committee says the things they need to fix shouldn't keep Maracana from operating.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, De Klerk and Mandela were jointly {{awarded the}} Nobel Peace Prize {{for their work}} in ending apartheid. The {{awarding}} of the prize to de Klerk was controversial, especially {{in the light of}} de Klerk's reported admission that he ordered a massacre of supposed Azanian Peoples' Liberation Army fighters, including teenagers, shortly before going to Oslo in 1993. It appears that this massacre may form part of the basis for criminal <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Anti-Racism Action Forum laid against de Klerk in early 2016. Further, de Klerk's role in the destabilization of the country during the negotiation process through the operation of a 'third force' {{came to the attention of}} the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and was never ultimately clarified.|$|E
25|$|In {{relative}} numbers {{the values}} lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 {{dollars worth of}} transactions (7 basis points). In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million. When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund {{some or all of}} the <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.|$|E

25|$|The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) {{announced}} a $12.5million settlement with Morgan Stanley on September 27, 2007. This resolved <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> firm's former affiliate, Morgan Stanley DW, Inc. (MSDW), failed {{on numerous occasions}} to provide emails to claimants in arbitration proceedings {{as well as to}} regulators. The company had claimed that the destruction of the firm's email servers in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York's World Trade Center resulted in the loss of all email before that date. In fact, the firm had millions of earlier emails that had been retrieved from backup copies stored in another location that was not destroyed in the attacks. Customers who had lost their arbitration cases against Morgan Stanley DW Inc. because of their inability to obtain these emails to demonstrate Morgan Stanley's misconduct received a token amount of money {{as a result of the}} settlement.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Saudis have been {{particularly}} energetic in catering {{to the needs of}} pilgrims. In 1988, a US$l5 billion traffic improvement scheme for the holy sites was launched. The improvement initiative resulted partly from Iranian <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Saudi government was incompetent to guard the holy sites after a 1987 clash between demonstrating Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police left 400 people dead. A further disaster occurred in 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims suffocated or were crushed to death in one of the new air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels built to shield pilgrims from the heat. The incident resulted from the panic that erupted in the overcrowded and inadequately ventilated tunnel, and further fueled Iranian claims that the Saudis did not deserve to be in sole charge of the holy places. In 1992, however, 114,000 Iranian pilgrims, close to the usual level, participated in the Hajj.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of that}} campaign, UE in December 2005 {{brought a}} {{complaint}} before the International Labour Organization, the UN’s labor agency, charging that the North Carolina bargaining ban violates international agreements on labor rights, which uphold the right of nearly all workers to form unions and bargain collectively. In March 2007 the ILO {{ruled in favor of}} UE, and called upon the United States and North Carolina to repeal GS 95-98 and begin discussions with unions to establish “a framework for collective bargaining.” UE’s Mexican ally the FAT, with the support of 52 other US, Mexican, Canadian and global labor organizations, filed a complaint in October 2006 with the Mexican National Administrative Office – a body established to address complaints of labor rights violations under NAFTA. The complaint <b>charges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> North Carolina bargaining ban violates the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), the labor-rights side agreement to NAFTA. In November 2007 the Mexican NAO launched an investigation into those charges.|$|E
