50|$|A {{blue box}} is an {{electronic}} device that simulated an operator by generating the same tones employed by a telephone operator's dialing console to, for example, switch long-distance calls. A blue box {{is a tool}} {{that emerged in the}} 1960s and '70s; it allowed users to route their own calls by emulating the in-band signaling mechanism that then controlled switching in long distance dialing systems. The most typical use of a blue box was to place free telephone calls. A related device, the black box, enabled one to receive calls which were free to the caller. The blue box no longer works in most Western nations, as modern switching systems do not use in-band signaling. Instead, signaling occurs on an out-of-band channel which cannot be accessed from the line the caller is using, a system <b>called</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Channel</b> Interoffice Signaling or CCIS.|$|R
40|$|In {{a simple}} multiple-access {{communication}} system, two geographically separated users attempt to communicate binary data to two data sinks over a <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>called</b> a multiple access channel. User one sends codewords from a block code C sub one, while user two sends codewords from a block code C sub two. The two users occupy the same frequency slot, transmit {{at the same}} time, and use {{the same type of}} modulation. Block codes which are uniquely decodable and capable of correcting errors are constructed for two multiple-access channel models. The first model is referred to as a noiseless multiple-access binary erasure channel. If the two transmitted bits from the two users are zeros, a zero is transmitted over the channel to the receiver; if the two transmitted bits are ones, a one is transmitted to the receiver; if the two bits are different, an erasure symbol is transmitted to the receiver. The second model is also a multiple-access binary erasure channel but with noise introduced...|$|R

5000|$|From the outset, the {{government}} attempted to regulate CB radio with license fees and call signs, but eventually they abandoned this approach. Enthusiasts rushed for licences {{when the doors}} opened at post offices around Australia in mid 1977 {{and by the end}} of the first quarter of 1978 there had been an estimated 200,000 licences issued (Australia's Population in 1978 was 14.36 Million). The regulations called for one licence per CB radio. The price for a licence in 1977 was AU$25, a not insubstantial amount for the average Australian wage-earner. Australian CB radio uses AM, USB, and LSB modes (No FM) on 27Mhz, allowed output power being 4 Watts AM and 12 Watts SSB. UHF is 477 Mhz, with an output power of 5 Watts. When CB was first legalised the 27 MHz CB Band was intended to be closedAustralian CBers in 1982 and only the 477 Mhz UHF band was to continue, but this did not eventuate. The first 477MHZ CB radio in 1977 was designed and made in Australia by Philips and was a 40 <b>channel</b> CB <b>called</b> the FM320. 27 MHz CB Channel Allocation in Australia is Channel 8 (27.055 MHz) Truckies or Highway Channel, Channel 9 (27.065 MHz) Emergency, Channel 11 (27.085 MHz) AM <b>Call</b> <b>Channel,</b> Channel 16 (27.155 MHz) LSB SSB <b>Call</b> <b>Channel,</b> 35 (27.355 MHz) LSB 2nd SSB <b>Call</b> <b>Channel.</b> UHF CB Channel Allocation is Channel 5 Emergency, <b>Channel</b> 11 <b>Call</b> <b>Channel,</b> Channel 40 Truckies or Highway.
