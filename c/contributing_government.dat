40|$|China’s Government {{succeeded in}} {{reducing}} inflation to single-digit levels in 1996 while maintaining {{one of the}} fastest GDP growth rates of any major economy. With weak external demand, domestic demand led economic growth last year. However, China’s foreign exchange reserves continued to increase; the trade surplus with the United States widened, and imports from the European Union and Japan fell, while exports to these two regions increased. As the austerity measures used to reduce inflation aggravated problems in the state sector, the country’s state-owned enterprises in 1996 registered their poorest performance since 1949 with nearly half losing money. The strategic position of the large- or medium-sized state-owned enterprises in China—providing urban employment and <b>contributing</b> <b>government</b> revenue through taxes—are two of the main reasons the government is cautious in reforming this sector. [Xinshen Diao, (202) 219 - 0690] China’s Government succeeded in reducing both growth and inflation to single-digit levels in 1996. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 9. 7 percent in 1996, a lower rate than those of former years, but still {{one of the fastest}} growth rates of any major economy. Central government leaders over the past 3 years have made progress in damp-ening inflation caused by dramatic economic expansion. The officially announced inflation rate (measured by retail prices) was 6. 1 percent in 1996. It was the first time since 1991 that China’s annual inflation rate fell to a single-digit number and lower than the GDP growth rate. Domestic demand led economic growth last year, but exter-nal demand was weak. In contrast with the stunning gains in the export sector during the previous 2 years, China’s ex-ports only grew by 1. 5 percent to $ 151 billion in 1996. Im-ports grew by 5. 1 percent and reached $ 139 billion in 1996. The slowdown in import growth reflected reduced demand for some commodities as well as government-man-dated restrictions over some types of imports. Although ex-ports grew slower than imports, China still ran a $ 12. 3 bil-lion foreign trade surplus in 1996, which was the third consecutive year for China to have an external trade sur-plus. China’s foreign exchange reserves reached $ 105 bil-lion at the end of 1996, $ 31. 4 billion more than at the be-ginning of the year...|$|E
