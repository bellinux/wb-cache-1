40|$|Competence {{development}} for engineers can be difficult, especially in small and {{medium sized enterprises}} (SMEs) where limited resources and scheduling issues may discourage participation in <b>continuing</b> <b>education.</b> Further, traditional <b>continuing</b> <b>education</b> programmes may not always {{meet the needs of}} engineers in SMEs. To address these issues, the <b>Centre</b> for <b>Continuing</b> Engineering <b>Education,</b> ELITE <b>centre</b> at Aalborg University, Denmark developed a unique educational programme directed towards engineers in SMEs called Lonely Wolf. Initially technical skill development was targeted in the programme, but a need for non-technical development quickly became apparent. The authors were given the challenge of classifying and fulfilling non-technical developmental needs of the engineers in the Lonely Wolf programme. This paper details the experiences with providing non-technical development to the Lonely Wolves, with focus on describing possible gaps in engineering education, and emphasizing the need to develop new methods of competency development that recognize the importance of “on the job training ” that may compensate for the limited resources that are often a barrier to traditional types of <b>continuing</b> <b>education.</b> The conclusion highlights the need to further investigate technical and non-technical competence development needs for engineers in SMEs and teaching methods for delivering education that is appropriate given resource constraints...|$|R
