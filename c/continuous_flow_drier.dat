40|$|Abstract]Grain harvest {{represents}} {{a period of}} high risk and is also a bottleneck in a grain production. This study develops a climate-based systems simulation model to investigate the economics of high moisture grain harvesting in Australia. The optimum harvesting and drying strategies were determined. The role of grain aeration cooling was also examined. The model software was developed in MATLAB. This model was run on an hourly basis using 15 years of historical weather data (1991 - 2005) for three main wheat production areas in Australia, represented by Goondiwindi (QLD), Tamworth (NSW) and Scaddan (WA). The Wheat Harvest System Simulation Model (WHSSM) consists of four submodels of weather data, machinery performance, crop loss and economic calculations. Each submodel is represented by mathematical functions and supported by available theoretical and field data. The weather submodel is used to predict dynamic grain moisture contents for a standing crop in the field. Machinery submodel was developed to calculate machinery performance and its operating costs at different grain and weather conditions. The main machinery involved are combine harvester, cooling aerator, and four categories of grain driers. Crop loss submodel is used to quantify grain losses involved during harvest and storage periods, including shedding (yield) losses, header losses, threshing losses, crop quality downgrading losses (due to rainfalls), and storage spoilage losses. The model {{has been used to}} predict and compare the possible return for different harvesting and postharvest management strategies. For the reference case (a 1000 ha farm with a high-capacity harvester and medium-capacity drier in Goondiwindi), it is found that the optimum harvest moisture content for using <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>drier</b> and batch drier is 14 and 13...|$|E

40|$|In-bin <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>drying</b> {{has become}} a popular high speed method for on-farm grain drying. ln this system the grain bin is {{normally}} used as a combination wetholding and drying bin. Wet grain from the harvest is loaded directly into the drying bin and as the grain becomes dry, it {{is removed from the}} bottom of the bin by a tapered sweep auger. These systems are designed to operate continuously, drying one day's harvest in time for the next. lmportant considerations in evaluating the performance of these systems include the daily harvest rate, the loading rate of wet grain into the drying bin and the selection of the appropriate drying fan and bin combination that will provide the necessary drying capacity. Equ ipment Requirements Typical equipment for this type of dryer should include a fan and heater unit, a full perforatedrying floor, a tapered sweep auger that removes dry grain {{from the bottom of the}} bin when drying, a vertical auger to transfer the dry grain from the bin to storage and a grain spreader (Figure 1).

40|$|The project goal is {{to develop}} the world's best grain dryer, where best is {{defined in terms of}} energy efficiency, grain quality protection, and minimal {{environmental}} impact. A technique was developed to recapture enthalpy from a <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>drying</b> system and to carry that energy back into the grain kernels. Process design assures that the recaptured energy is used to provide latent heat for evaporation of moisture from the kernels. Maximum kernel temperatures are tightly controlled by the design and can be selected through the system controls. The drying system process has been simulated, the mechanical design for a prototype was completed, and the prototype has been fabricated and installed. Simulation results show energy use that is a fraction of that required by the most efficient heat assisted grain dryer systems available at this time. Unfortunately, project time has expired, funding has been exhausted, and the system has yet to be fully run in order to validate the process design. Additional development work is required to run tests with the prototype, improve the simulation model, optimize the process and mechanical design, and bring this energy saving system to market...|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxin {{producing}} fungi {{are natural}} contaminants of cereals and their toxins are harmful to humans and animals. Ochratoxin A (OTA) {{is among the}} most important. Heat treatment by drum drying does not eliminate already formed mycotoxins but the technique can reduce the number of viable fungi on the grain. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a drying regime that kills fungal propagules on rye without reducing its quality for baking. Special attention was paid to some important mycotoxin producing species. As drying temperatures and retention time in the drum are essential, the drum drier must be equipped with an effective control unit. Two different control systems were tested. The results showed that fungi colonising the grain can be much more efficiently and precisely reduced by controlling the maximum grain temperature (MGT) than the fixed constant drying air temperature (FAT). Drum drying very efficiently reduced the fungal propagules colonising the grain, including the mycotoxin producing Penicillium verrucosum, Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. poae, F. sporotrichioides and F. tricinctum. Both temperature and retention time in the drum affected survival rate of the fungi. Using MGT, a retention time of 10. 5 min and a temperature of 64 ºC killed 99 % of the yeast propagules and 98 % of the filamentous fungi. Moisture contents were reduced to about 12 %. A similar drying regime in a supplementary trial reduced the number of P. verrucosum contaminated kernels from more than 70 % to 12 % but confirmed that drum drying did not destroy already formed OTA. The combination of a high drying capacity and a short but efficient heat treatment was obtained by drum drying as opposed to on-floor, batch and ordinary <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>drying,</b> and it reduced the risk of mould deterioration to almost zero when the grain was properly stored afterwards. At the same time a high quality for baking was maintained. The highest baking quality in rye was obtained at grain temperatures of about 62 °C and only at grain temperatures above 70 °C visual quality changes were detected...|$|R
50|$|The Umauma Falls and River {{has been}} forming since the Mauna Kea volcano on which flank it flows slowly {{emerged from the}} sea {{beginning}} millions of years ago. During this period, the volcano formed alternating layers of volcanic ash or solidified lava, forming distinct layers that can erode at different rates. Eventually, Mauna Kea reached its current height, and entered a 'final phase' of primarily cinder cone eruptions from the flanks of Mauna Kea, which also deposited a 10-meter thick layer of ash, which is now the fertile soil presently found on the relatively level or gentle-slope portions. Due to {{the flow of the}} trade-winds, the southern regions of the eastern flank of Mauna Kea have higher rainfalls than the northern regions. The Umauma River is at the dividing line between heavy rains to the south, and lighter rains to the north. The word Umauma means 'constantly flowing' in the Hawaiian language, and it is the most northernly river to have a <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> and not <b>dry</b> up during the dry season.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{prospective}} study of patients treated at the Center for Urgent Surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia. The patients {{were divided into}} two groups; i. e., the controls consisted of 30 subjects, who underwent conventional cholecystectomy, and studied group with 30 patients who had laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients were homogenized by ASA score (ASA I and ASA II) and on population basis. Hemodynamic parameters and 4 time-point pulmonary function tests were monitored in both groups. Peritoneal insufflation resulted in significant increase of systemic arterial pressure (23 %), mean arterial pressure (23. 8 %), systemic vascular resistance (65 %), pulmonary vascular resistance (90 %), and significant reduction of cardiac output (24 %) and cardiac index (51 %). Pneumoperitoneum caused transient restriction of pulmonary function by reducing the thoracic and lung compliance. Fall of pH concentration, increase of PaCO 2 and ET CO 2 without any changes of PaO 2, SO 2, base excess and bicarbonate ions concentrations were the sequelae of CO 2 absorption from peritoneal cavity. Postoperative 'hypothermi', i. e. lowering of body temperature for 0. 3 oC was the consequence of sudden gas expansion (Joule-Thompson phenomenon), which implies <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> of <b>dry</b> gas under pressure over peritoneal surface. Tissue damage factors (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, Protein C) were significantly lower in laparoscopic group, meaning that such mode of treatment resulted in minor postoperative pain and shorter period of recovery. Laparoscopy is a revolution in surgery. Definite success of any laparoscopic intervention depends on anesthesia as its crucial factor, at the same time meeting the patient's wish and expectations to be free from pain and discharged in no time from hospital...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{materials}} are widely diffused in industry {{as well as}} in nature, but a reliable and effective description of their motion is still at a rather early stage of development. Among the benchmark problems of granular dense flow, the rotating drum {{is one of the most}} challenging, yet intriguing and technologically relevant. In proper ranges of operating conditions, granular materials inside rotating drums display a continuum motion near their free surface. The motion of those discrete systems has been studied both experimentally and through Discrete Element Method (DEM) numerical simulations; however, it can also be regarded as the flow of a continuum medium, thus allowing a continuum mechanics approach. In this thesis, we solve the continuum dynamic equations by adopting the visco-plastic JFP constitutive model (Jop et al., Nature 441, 727 - 730, 2006) for the stress tensor, and study the <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> of <b>dry</b> grains inside axially rotating cylinders through 3 D Finite Volume simulations (FVM). We investigate the effect of the ratio D/dp between the diameters of cylinder and particles, of the aspect ratio of the cylinder AR=width/diameter, of the angular velocity omega, and of the slip between drum wall and particles. Numerical results are found to quantitatively agree with experimental results from different authors, and also catches some distinctive features of the drum flow of granular materials, such as, e. g., the existence of axial components of the surface velocity, or the differences of the flow fields near the lateral wall and at the center plane, ect. Our simulations demonstrate that the basic physics of the dense granular flow is captured by the simple JFP model, and that continuum mechanics can be used to get a physical insight in granular dense state phenomenology. CFD simulations may then be of help to rationalize the broad wealth of experimental results with these materials...|$|R

MethodsData from Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (June 23, 2006, to March 31, 2011) compared the durability of implanted pulsatile and <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> left ventricular assist devices. The durability issues included pump replacement for infection, thrombosis-hemolysis, driveline failure, or pump drive unit failure, and death from driveline or pump drive unit failure. ResultsA total of 3302 left ventricular assist devices were implanted (486 pulsatile, 2816 <b>continuous</b> <b>flow)</b> and 98 pump exchanges or deaths from durability issues (46 pulsatile, 52 continuous flow; 3 % of implants). The interval to device issue was greater for the <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> than for the pulsatile devices (P < . 001). A comparisons of the causes for pump exchange or pump-related death showed (1) greater freedom from pump failure in the <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> compared with the pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (10 events/ 2816 <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> implants vs 39 events/ 486 pulsatile implants; P < . 0001); (2) similar exchange or pump-related death for driveline failure (1 / 486 pulsatile vs 7 / 2816 continuous flow; P = . 82); (3) similar exchange or pump-related death for thrombosis-hemolysis (2 / 486 pulsatile vs 28 / 2816 continuous flow; P = . 25); and (4) fewer exchanges or pump-related deaths from infection in <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> left ventricular assist devices (4 / 486 pulsatile vs 7 / 2816 continuous flow; P = . 034).
