5|$|Midtown Madness {{supports}} multiplayer games via {{local area}} network, Internet, or serial <b>cable</b> <b>connection.</b> Multiplayer mode was originally supported by Microsoft's MSN Gaming Zone, but this service was retired on June 19, 2006. It is now supported by similar {{services such as}} GameSpy Arcade and XFire, via DirectPlay. Multiplayer mode includes a Cops and Robbers mode, a capture the flag-style game in which players form two teams and each team tries to steal the opposing team's cache of gold {{and return it to}} their own hideout.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{the rise of a}} number of {{scientific}} establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank in 1984. The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester. Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995, and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea Cable System opened, providing fiber optic <b>cable</b> <b>connection</b> to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of optical fiber <b>cable</b> <b>connection</b> to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was {{financed by the}} satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E

Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes {{self-conscious}} over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is discovered by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael to bond with Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E

25|$|Texas Tower 2 was {{the first}} to become operational, {{starting}} limited service in May 1956. It became fully operational in 1958, as did Tower 3; Tower 4 followed in April 1959. The original plan to integrate these radars into the SAGE system had to be modified when the direct <b>cable</b> <b>connection</b> was eliminated; instead, they were used to provide manual inputs.|$|E

Based on the digital technology behind SSL's C-Series consoles, Duende {{is designed to}} integrate into Digital audio workstation environments using a FireWire <b>cable</b> <b>connection,</b> though a PCI-e card is also available. The digital processing channels appear as audio plug-ins. The system supports Steinberg VST, Apple Audio Units and Digidesign RTAS, (support via Fxpansion wrapper).|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Telecom {{listed on}} the New Zealand, Australian and New York stock exchanges. The {{following}} year Telecom implemented a NZ$200 million fibre-optic <b>cable</b> <b>connection</b> between Australia and New Zealand. Also in this year, Roderick Deane was appointed CEO of the company. Then in 1993 Ameritech and Bell Atlantic reduced their share in Telecom to a combined 49.6% and BellSouth New Zealand Limited (BellSouth), subsequently acquired by Vodafone, set up the first mobile network to compete with Telecom.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, {{the name}} of the nightly news was changed to Douglas Edwards and the News, and the {{following}} year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>connection,</b> prompting Edwards to use the greeting [...] "Good evening everyone, coast to coast." [...] The broadcast was renamed the CBS Evening News when Walter Cronkite replaced Edwards in 1962. [...] Edwards remained with CBS News with various daytime television newscasts and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.|$|E

5000|$|Ethernet {{supports}} a direct <b>cable</b> <b>connection</b> between two network interface cards {{by the use}} of a crossover cable or through auto-sensing if supported. Token ring does not inherently support this feature and requires additional software and hardware to operate on a direct <b>cable</b> <b>connection</b> setup.|$|E

50|$|Blood, {{like many}} FPS {{games of the}} time, {{features}} multiplayer modes. When it was released, Internet play was not well established, so Blood used modem, LAN, or serial <b>cable</b> <b>connections</b> for multiplayer. Modem and serial <b>cable</b> <b>connections</b> only allow two player games, while an IPX network connection can support up to eight players. This can easily be achieved {{on a variety of}} platforms that support DOSBox and its IPX modes, coupled with VPN software such as Hamachi. Online multiplayer was also possible via the Total Entertainment Network and DWANGO.|$|R

50|$|In older systems, {{interactive}} video broadcasting was possible {{as a result}} of using physical cables for connectivity. However, in remote areas <b>cable</b> <b>connections</b> may be unavailable, two-way communication was then impossible via traditional means. One possible solution was to use a satellite linked connection for the return (uplink) channel in addition to the standard downlink channel. This option is more expensive to implement than with <b>cabled</b> <b>connections</b> in built-up areas, but may be more cost effective for remote areas where the costs of laying cable to users would not be recovered for a long time. Additional costs involved in RCS systems include the costs of a two-way satellite antenna and renting data bandwidth from a satellite communications provider.|$|R
