500|$|In the 1940s, new {{interpretations of}} John's reign began to emerge, based on {{research}} into the record evidence of his reign, such as pipe rolls, charters, court documents and similar primary records. Notably, an essay by Vivian Galbraith in 1945 proposed a [...] "new approach" [...] to understanding the ruler. The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about {{two of the most}} colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians. Interpretations of Magna Carta {{and the role of the}} rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, <b>constitutional</b> <b>value</b> for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between [...] "partisan" [...] factions. There has been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies. Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by Lewis Warren, suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed.|$|E
500|$|Eighteenth-century {{historian}} David Hume {{wrote that}} the Angevins were pivotal in creating a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. Interpretations of the Magna Carta {{and the role of}} the rebel barons in 1215 have been revised; although the charter's symbolic, <b>constitutional</b> <b>value</b> for later generations is unquestionable, for most historians it is a failed peace agreement between factions. John's opposition to the papacy and his promotion of royal rights and prerogatives won favour from 16th-century Tudors. John Foxe, William Tyndale and Robert Barnes viewed John as an early Protestant hero, and Foxe included the king in his Book of Martyrs. John Speed's 1632 Historie of Great Britaine praised John's [...] "great renown" [...] as king, blaming biased medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation. Similarly, later Protestant historians view Henry's role in Thomas Becket's death and his disputes with the French as worthy of praise. Similarly, increased access to contemporary records during the late Victorian era led to a recognition of Henry's contributions to the evolution of English law and the exchequer. William Stubbs called Henry a [...] "legislator king" [...] because of his responsibility for major, long-term reforms in England; in contrast, Richard was [...] "a bad son, a bad husband, a selfish ruler, and a vicious man".|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{compares the}} role that <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> {{according}} individuals {{the right to a}} fair process when the state seeks to restrict their liberty have played in the development of terrorism control order schemes in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia. The respective schemes are similar and both illustrate <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> under considerable tension. However, there are salient differences in the ways those values have managed to provide some resistance to incursions on liberty. These different reactions stem from broader jurisdictional distinctions, including the manner in which those values are articulated in law, that affect the capacity of <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> to ameliorate, if not eliminate, measures that are hostile to them. The systemic features in question expose the vulnerability of <b>constitutional</b> <b>values,</b> normalizing government incursions into areas beyond national security. The difference in the way that <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> have been used to limit state excess in the two jurisdictions is stark. In the UK, procedural rights are expressly protected by both the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’) and the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK) (‘HRA’). Consequently, ‘control orders’ – which impose a range of diverse restrictions, including substantial periods of home detention, upon suspected terrorists, often on the basis of secret evidence not disclosed to the ‘controlee’ – have been subject to significant challenge in the UK’s domestic court system and the European Court of Human Rights (‘ECtHR’). Significantly bolstered by the decisions of the latter, UK courts have diminished the executive’s ability to rely on secret evidenc...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. This study {{provides}} guidelines for teacher training {{to promote the}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> in schools. The purpose is not to question the <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> or develop {{a new set of}} values. For a meaningful analysis within the limitations of a Master's dissertation, the study focuses on the General Education and Training Band (Grades Reception to Nine). Compared to foreign countries, open debate regarding values in education is relatively new in South Africa. Values are usually abstract but sometimes also physical entities to which human beings attach worth. They are common in individuals or groups through physical exposure and genetic make-up. Teaching inevitably instils values in learners. Schools often adopt a values system, which should not be imposed upon any individual learner. Values, and in particular moral values, should be taught in schools because they influence attitudes, priorities, principles, norms, standards, morals and ethics, which in turn influence decision-making, learner performance and behaviour, which affect the future of learners. In the Manifesto on values, education and democracy, the National Department of Education promotes ten <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> - democracy, social justice and equity, equality, non-racism and non-sexism, ubuntu (human dignity), an open society, accountability (responsibility), the rule of law, respect and reconciliation - for teaching in South African schools. The ten <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> are not imposed but are intended to help learners develop into good citizens in line with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996). The ten <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> should not be the only values taught in schools, as there are many other values that form an inherent part of education. At South African universities, values are included in teacher-training programmes in different forms and to varying degrees. The Higher Education HIV/Aids Programme, Revised National Curriculum Statement training, Advanced Certificate in Education and the normal curricula for pre-service teacher training are implemented at the different universities investigated. The ten <b>constitutional</b> and other <b>values</b> are integrated into all the learning areas of the Revised National Curriculum Statement. They should also therefore be integrated into teacher-training programmes. Programmes narrowly focused on the ten <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> should not be discouraged, as they strengthen the teaching of values in general. Values should be contextualised and purposefully infused in all teacher-training curricula. The dissertation concludes with the guidelines for the training of teachers to promote the ten <b>constitutional</b> <b>values.</b> The guidelines consider the sixteen strategies for the teaching of the ten <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> as outlined in the Manifesto on values, education and democracy. communication, role-modelling, literacy, human rights, arts and culture, history, religion, multilingualism, school sport, equality, anti-racism, anti-sexism, HIV/Aids, school safety, the environment and respect for diversity. The purpose of these guidelines is to guide teachers regarding which values to teach; they are thus not intended to be prescriptions on how to teach them. Master...|$|R
500|$|While {{actual malice}} {{standard}} applies to public officials and public figures, in Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps (1988), the Court found that, {{with regard to}} private individuals, the First Amendment does [...] "not necessarily force any change {{in at least some}} features of the common-law landscape." [...] In Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc. (1985) the Court ruled that [...] "actual malice" [...] need not be shown in cases involving private individuals, holding that [...] "n light of the reduced <b>constitutional</b> <b>value</b> of speech involving no matters of public concern [...] [...] [...] the state interest adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive damages—even absent a showing of 'actual malice.'" [...] In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), the Court ruled that a private individual had to prove actual malice only to be awarded punitive damages, but not to seek actual damages. In Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988), the Court extended the [...] "actual malice" [...] standard to intentional infliction of emotional distress in a ruling which protected parody, in this case a fake advertisement in Hustler suggesting that evangelist Jerry Falwell's first sexual experience had been with his mother in an outhouse. Since Falwell was a public figure, the Court ruled that [...] "importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern" [...] was the paramount concern, and reversed the judgement Falwell had won against Hustler for emotional distress.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reference}} {{to an independent}} and impartial tribunal has also been taken as granting a measure of judicial independence to lower-court judges specializing in criminal law, judicial independence previously being a right held only by superior courts under the Constitution Act, 1867. [...] In the case Valente v. The Queen (1985), judicial independence under section 11 was held to be limited. [...] Although it would include financial security, security of tenure and some administrative independence, the Court found the standards enjoyed by higher-level judges was too high for the many tribunals covered by section 11(d). [...] In the Provincial Judges Reference (1997) expectations for judicial independence were heightened, with reference made to the preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867, which was said to imply judicial independence was an unwritten <b>constitutional</b> <b>value</b> applying to all judges in Canada. [...] The requirement of an independent and impartial tribunal applies also to juries. [...] Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has written that jury selection under the Criminal Code would undoubtedly create an independent tribunal. [...] However, he points to R. v. Bain (1992) in which the impartiality of the jury was questioned, since the Crown had more say in selection.|$|E

In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent [...] "undesirable developments in securities trading" [...] including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a [...] "laserdrome" [...] business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against [...] "playing at killing" [...] entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German <b>constitutional</b> <b>value</b> of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16, which the case law has developed.|$|E

That formal amendment rules may express <b>constitutional</b> <b>values</b> is both a clarifying and complicating contribution to the study of formal amendment rules. It clarifies the study of formal amendment rules by showing that formal amendment rules may serve a function that scholars have yet to attribute to them.
