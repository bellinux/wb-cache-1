30|$|Under {{the ground}} pressure, the top coal is {{fractured}} and caved. The size of coal is different {{depending on the}} coal hardness. During the process <b>of</b> top coal <b>discharge,</b> the increase in large coals causes a balanced arch above the support discharge window and blocks the coal flow. In this case, {{the base of the}} balanced arch should be fractured using the coal discharge device. In addition, the large coal blocks should be crushed to enable the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> coal <b>discharge.</b> Therefore, a high efficient and high recovery coal discharge device was developed with a strong disturbance capacity. Two jacks with a cylinder diameter of ϕ 180  mm were installed on the tail beam for operation. The force of a single jack was 1000 kN (P =  39  MPa) and 2000 kN with both. In order to increase the disturbance to top coals, the upswing of the tail beam can reach 19.5 ° to crush top coals, and the down swing can reach 41 ° to loosen coal flow. During the process <b>of</b> top coal <b>discharge,</b> the tail beam was swung continuously to disturb the awaited top coals and to achieve a high efficient and high recovery coal discharge.|$|R
40|$|Background. Review of the {{literature}} reveals a {{need to develop a}} questionnaire that measures patient perceptions <b>of</b> factors impacting <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care following <b>discharge</b> from hospital. Such a measure has the potential to guide quality improvement initiatives related to <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care. Objective. Our objective was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of a measure that would meet this need, the Patient <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> Care Questionnaire (PCCQ). Method. The PCCQ was administered to 204 inpatients 4 weeks after discharge. The questionnaire was assessed by item and principal components analysis. Factors derived from principal components analysis were assessed for internal consistency and construct validity. Results. A principal components analysis resulted in six subscales including perceptions of: (1) relationships with providers in hospital, (2) information transfer to patients, (3) relationships with providers in community, (4) management of written forms, (5) management of follow-up and (6) management of communication among providers. These subscales were intern-ally consistent in our sample and demonstrated construct validity through correlations with other related constructs. Conclusion. This initial study supports {{the reliability and validity of}} the PCCQ for measuring patient perceptions of factors central to <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care. The questionnaire subscales correspond to the theoretical components <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care that have been proposed in {{the literature}}, namely informational, relational and management continuity.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the association <b>of</b> physician <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care with length of stay, likelihood <b>of</b> weekend <b>discharge,</b> in-hospital mortality and 30 -day readmission. Design. A cohort study of hospitalized medical patients. The primary exposure was the weekend usual provider continuity (UPC) over the initial weekend of care. This metric was adapted from an outpatient <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care index. Regression models were developed to determine the association between UPC and outcomes. Setting. An academic medical center. Main outcome measure. Length of stay which was calculated as the number of days from the first Saturday of the hospitalization to the day <b>of</b> <b>discharge.</b> Results. <b>Of</b> the 3391 patients included in this study, the prevalence of low, moderate and high UPC for the initial weekend of hospitalization was 58. 7, 22. 3 and 19. 1 %, respectively. When compared with low <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, both moderate and high con-tinuity of care were associated with reduced length of stay, with adjusted rate ratios of 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 86 – 1. 00) and 0. 64 (95 % CI 0. 53 – 0. 76), respectively. High <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care was associated with likelihood <b>of</b> weekend <b>discharge</b> (adjusted odds ratio 2. 84, 95 % CI 2. 11 – 3. 83) but was not significantly associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 29 – 1. 80) or readmis-sion (adjusted odds ratio 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 68 – 1. 14) when compared with low <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care.

Materials and methods: A qualitative approach with semi-structured interviews was adopted. A gatekeeper from National Health Service Wales Informatics Service identified 35 pharmacies, of the 43 pharmacies where the CPA had been implemented, that had completed at least one DMR, and these were therefore invited to an interview. Results: A total of 17 pharmacists were interviewed. Overall, the results were positive and CPA and e-DAL were perceived to facilitate <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care between care settings. The design and usability were perceived as good as pharmacists could navigate the CPA without problems; many felt this was due to the level of training they had received. Many pharmacists were happy for other services to be included on the platform due to its ease of use and automatic reimbursement. Several pharmacists felt that communication between primary and secondary care can be further improved as the uptake of e-DAL increases. Conclusion: CPA was found to streamline the completion of online DMR improving <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care between primary and secondary sectors, which in turn should improve patient safety on discharge from hospital.

In the UK, an estimated 200, 000 individuals have active HCV infection, {{most of whom are}} injecting drug users (IDUs). Many IDUs spend time within the prison system therefore screening for HCV infection in this setting is important. However, uptake of testing within prisons is very low. Methods Qualitative interview study. 30 interviews with 25 male and 5 female prisoners with a history of injecting drug use. Results Personal and institutional barriers to uptake of testing for HCV were identified. Personal barriers included: prisoners' fears and lack of knowledge about HCV, low motivation for testing, lack of awareness about the testing procedure, and concerns about confidentiality and stigma. Institutional barriers included: the prisons' applications procedure for testing, inadequate pre- and post-test discussion, lack of pro-active approaches to offering testing, and lack <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care on <b>discharge</b> and transfer. Conclusion This study highlights potential areas of development in the management of HCV in prisons. Further research is needed to evaluate care pathways for HCV in the prison setting and to develop and assess interventions to improve the uptake of testing for HCV by prisoners. </p...|$|R
40|$|Discharge {{planning}} is an interdisciplinary approach to provide <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care; it {{is a process}} that includes identification, assessment, goal setting, planning, implementation, coordination, and evaluation. Discharge planning has been viewed as a major way to enhance a smooth transition for patients from the hospital to home or other chronic care units and as a solution to solve problems associated with postdischarge care. The promotion <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> planning began in the United States in the 1960 s. Nursing scholars from Taiwan learned about the concept <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> planning from the United States in the early 1980 s and subsequently introduced it to Taiwanese medical institutions in 1985. A policy to promote discharge planning in Taiwan was announced by the Executive Yuan, Department of Health in 1993. Following the healthcare reforms in 1995, discharge planning has since been strongly promoted. Studies concerning discharge planning in Taiwan showed some promising results, including increased satisfaction of patients and their families, improved preparation of caregivers, and improved quality of life for patients. However, patients receiving interdisciplinary discharge planning services were still in the minority. There was no standard evaluation procedure for interdisciplinary discharge planning, and a high percentage of patients thought that hospitals handled the postdischarge long-term care services referral procedure inadequately. Despite the positive attitudes toward discharge planning, many physicians still demonstrate an unsatisfactory level of knowledge and behaviors with regard to discharge planning. To enhance the implementation <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> planning, a standard evaluation procedure for interdisciplinary discharge planning and improved physician awareness concerning the importance <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> planning are needed. In Taiwan, the improvement <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> planning in the foreseeable future is promising with the accreditation of the procedure and the participation of doctors in efforts to ensure the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> postdischarge care for patients...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this paper is how <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care is related to characteristics of psychiatric services, previous events in a patient's pattern of care and patient characteristics. The present paper {{is a part of}} a Nordic Comparative Study on Sectorized Psychiatry in seven catchment areas in four Nordic countries. One-year-treated-incidence cohorts were used. Each patient was followed for 1 year after the first contact with the psychiatric service. <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> care was measured by the time from discharge from hospital to the first subsequent day-patient or outpatient contact. Notable findings were large differences in the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care in the seven services, high proportions <b>of</b> <b>discharges</b> without any aftercare contacts and long time lags between discharges and aftercare contacts in most of the catchment areas. A Cox regression analysis revealed that aftercare following hospitalisation seems to be more probable if the outpatient services are located geographically close to the patients, if the hospitalisation lasted between 2 and 4 weeks, if there was a community care contact shortly before the hospital admission and if the patient is not retired and not divorced.

40|$|When {{individuals}} with serious mental illness are discharged to the community, continuous and coordinated care are both desirable and necessary. A lack <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> places the individual {{at risk for}} becoming lost to further services. This study explores <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care for persons discharged from state psychiatric facilities in Virginia to communities. <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> care {{is defined as the}} successful initiation and maintenance of face-to-face contact by CSB staff with individuals to be discharged from state hospitals, and the subsequent provision of services post-discharge. This study identifies factors that influence <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, examines the degree to which these factors play a role and the relationships between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care and client characteristics. Predictor variables include characteristics of the population-at-risk: predisposing factors (i. e., age, gender, race), enabling factors (i. e., living situation, catchment area change, and geographic location of the CSB) and need factors (i. e., length of stay, legal status, and primary diagnoses). Data sources include two large data bases, 1) survey of CSB staff on the outcome <b>of</b> individuals <b>discharged</b> to their area in FY 1992, and 2) demographic information from state mental health authority. Findings from the survey show that 83 % <b>of</b> persons <b>discharged</b> had a record <b>of</b> the <b>discharge</b> at the CSB. Inhospital contact by CSB staff prior to discharge was lower (54 %). Results show that individuals are more likely to receive <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care if they are discharged to a CSB in a rural area, have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and do not have a primary diagnosis of substance abuse. The theoretical framework, based on the Community Support System principles and the notion of vulnerability, leads to important policy and practice implications. For example, the study suggests that new and different programs might be more effective for {{individuals with}} substance abuse diagnoses, especially in urban areas.

OBJECTIVES—To describe the discharge process from the perspective of housestaff physicians, and to generate hypotheses about quality-limiting factors and key strategies for improvement. METHODS—Qualitative study with in-depth, in-person interviews with a diverse sample of 29 internal medicine housestaff, in 2010 – 2011, at 2 separate internal medicine training programs, including 7 different hospitals. We used the constant comparative method of qualitative analysis to explore the experiences and perceptions of factors affecting the quality <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> care. RESULTS—We identified 5 unifying themes describing factors perceived to limit the quality <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> care: (1) competing priorities in the discharge process; (2) inadequate coordination within multidisciplinary discharge teams; (3) lack <b>of</b> standardization in <b>discharge</b> procedures; (4) poor patient and family communication; and (5) lack of postdischarge feedback and clinical responsibility.

We developed a text mining system to analyze a collection <b>of</b> 413 <b>discharge</b> letters <b>of</b> heart failure patients and checked their compliance with standard 3. 2. We built a domain-specific ontology and a thesaurus and mined the collection with CASOS AutoMap. After validation, the system sensitivity was 0. 484; specificity was 0. 834; {{positive predictive value}} was 0. 555; negative predictive value was 0. 790. Improving these results requires more powerful natural language processing tools, but text mining seems a promising way to evaluate the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> information and of care...|$|R

40|$|Hospital <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> elderly patients: Needs and {{challenges}} <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care. In Brazil {{the growth of}} longevity has increased the prevalence of chronic diseases, which can cause functional dependency and require repeated hospitalizations. Specifically, this research aimed at understanding and analyzing {{the perception of the}} elderly on hospital discharge defined as hospital-domicile transition. Th e sample consisted of 30 elderly patients admitted to a public hospital. Before discharge (hospital) and after (home), the Patient <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> Care Questionnaire was applied, translated and adapted. Th ere was a significant correlation among subscales. Th e results reaffirmed the importance of planning and coordinating the hospital <b>discharge</b> to ensure <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care and provide comprehensive care in the field of elderly health. It is recommended to validate the instrument adopted in order to facilitate multicenter studies...|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> care is {{considered}} foundational to high-quality care. Traditional <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care constructs may adequately characterize care quality in general populations, but may merit reconceptualization {{for patients with}} multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, interactions between multiple chronic condition patients and providers involve complex medication management; therefore care continuity measurement may be more relevant if focused on the provider subset who prescribes essential medications for chronic conditions—a construct we call <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management. Our objective was to explore conceptual distinctions between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, survey existing evidence in this area, and discuss implications of our findings for future research and intervention development. Methods: In this topical review, we discuss conceptual distinctions between <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> care, review the limited <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management–related empirical evidence, and discuss implications for future research and interventions. Results: <b>Continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management represents a potential conceptual and measurement advance by reflecting interpersonal continuity and management continuity, and may provide a means of identifying patients at high-risk of adverse events. Empirical evidence also establishes support for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management as a meaningful measure <b>of</b> care <b>continuity.</b> Finally, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management {{may also be a}} potential target for future intervention to improve care delivery among multiple chronic condition patients. Conclusion: If <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> medication management is validated in diverse populations, correlated with patient outcomes, and responsive to change, then it may be an important target for improving the health and health care of multiple chronic condition patients...|$|R
