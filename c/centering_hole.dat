25|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{can accept}} quick-detachable rails and adapters used to mount optics (STANAG 2324 compliant). The scope mounting system {{consists of a}} <b>centering</b> <b>hole</b> located on the front face of the rear sight assembly and a dovetail-like mounting point at {{the front end of}} the receiver. Swiss Arms (respectively Brügger & Thomet) offer several types of quick-release scope mounts and Picatinny rails. A version of the rifle with an integral receiver-mounted Picatinny rail is also offered; in this configuration the weapon is fitted with flip-up emergency battle sights—a rear aperture sight which folds down into a recess in the rail and a folding front blade.|$|E
5000|$|The saw {{consists}} of a metal cylinder, usually steel, mounted on an arbor. The cutting edge either has saw teeth formed in it or industrial diamonds embedded in it. The arbor can carry a drill bit to bore a <b>centering</b> <b>hole.</b> After the first few millimeters of cut, the centering mechanism {{may no longer be}} needed, although it will help the bit to bore without wandering in a deep hole. The sloping slots in the cylinder wall help carry the dust out. The [...] of the cut is designed to be slightly larger than the diameter {{of the rest of the}} hole saw so that it does not get jammed in the hole.|$|E

40|$|Mode {{characteristics}} for equilateral triangles, squares, and hexagonal resonators with a <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> are numerically simulated by the finite-different {{time domain}} (FDTD) technique. The <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> does not break the symmetry {{behavior of the}} original resonators and can result in modification of the mode field patterns and mode Q factors. In an equilateral triangle resonator the <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> can suppress the symmetry state of degenerate states with the merit of single mode operation. In a square resonator, the Q factor can be enhanced for some modes with a suitable size of the hole. For a hexagonal resonator with a side length of 1 mu m and a refractive index of 3. 2, the mode Q factors first gradually decrease {{with the increase of}} the hole diameter for modes at a wavelength of about 1500 nm, then the modes transform to that of a microdisk with a jump of the mode wavelength as the hole diameter approaches 0. 7 mu m. Finally, the mode Q factors greatly enhance as the hole diameter reaches about 1 mu m. The results indicate that the <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> can greatly modify mode characteristics, especially that of the mode Q factor. (C) 2009 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} measure the {{eccentricity}} of auto-hub’s <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> and bolt holes, a machine vision system is proposed in this article. Instead of normally used telecentric lens, a perspective lens {{is used in the}} vision system because of the large field of view. The eccentricity is calculated by sub-pixel edge extracting and circle-fitting algorithm. A correction method is put forward to compensate the systematic error resulting from the different perspective distortions of the <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> and the bolt holes because of the height difference between the <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> and the bolt holes, as well as the offset between the hub’s center shaft and the optical axis of the imaging system. The maximum variation and the standard variation are calculated to analyze the measurement uncertainty. Experiments had shown that the maximum variation and the standard deviation of the corrected measured eccentricity were reduced to 1 / 6 and 1 / 8 of those without correction...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} strain induced {{martensite}} on the fatigue life {{was investigated in}} the air and brine by using metastable austenitic steels. A <b>center</b> <b>hole,</b> double edge key-hole or groove notches were introduced in tensile and fatigue specimens as elastic and plastic strain concentrators. Smooth specimens tested in tension exhibit the transformation product more in brine than in the air both in SUS 301 and 302. The induced martensite distribution around a <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> in tension shows a butterflywing type extent in the alloy D. In the air and brine a fatigue crack propagates in three stages both in SUS 301 and 302. The fatigue life in brine is always shorter than that in the air. The volume of induced martensite in brine is usually more than that {{in the air and}} it is confirmed that the transformation strats at the earlier cycle in brine than in the air in SUS 301. The crack growth rate per unit cycle in the second stage increases with the designed stress concentration factor on the key-hole and groove notch specimens and the complete reversed relationship is observed on the <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> specimen in which the stress gradient is seemed to be another important factor.
