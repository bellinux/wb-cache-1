25|$|Apoptosis. During {{programmed}} {{cell death}} the ICE/ced-3 family of proteases (one of the interleukin-1β-converter proteases) degrade actin into two fragments “in vivo”; one of the fragments is 15 kDa and the other 31 kDa. This {{represents one of the}} mechanisms involved in destroying cell viability that form the basis of apoptosis. The protease <b>calpain</b> has also been shown to be involved in this type of cell destruction; just as the use of <b>calpain</b> inhibitors has been shown to decrease actin proteolysis and the degradation of DNA (another of the characteristic elements of apoptosis). On the other hand, the stress-induced triggering of apoptosis causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (which also involves its polymerization), giving rise to structures called stress fibers; this is activated by the MAP kinase pathway.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>calpain</b> {{originates}} in 1964, when calcium-dependent proteolytic activities {{caused by a}} “calcium-activated neutral protease” (CANP) were detected in brain, lens of the eye and other tissues. In the late 1960s the enzymes were isolated and characterised independently in both rat brain and skeletal muscle. These activities were caused by an intracellular cysteine protease not associated with the lysosome and having an optimum activity at neutral pH, which clearly distinguished it from the cathepsin family of proteases. The calcium-dependent activity, intracellular localization, along with the limited, specific proteolysis on its substrates, highlighted calpain’s role as a regulatory, rather than a digestive protease. When the sequence of this enzyme became known, it was given the name “calpain”, to recognize it as a hybrid of two well-known proteins at the time, the calcium-regulated signalling protein, calmodulin, and the cysteine protease of papaya, papain. Shortly thereafter, the activity {{was found to be}} attributable to two main isoforms, dubbed μ("mu")-calpain and m-calpain (a.k.a. <b>calpain</b> I and II), that differed primarily in their calcium requirements in vitro. Their names reflect {{the fact that they are}} activated by micro- and nearly millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ within the cell, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{characterization}} of the caspases allowed the development of caspase inhibitors, {{which can be used}} to determine whether a cellular process involves active caspases. Using these inhibitors it was discovered that cells can die while displaying a morphology similar to apoptosis without caspase activation. Later studies linked this phenomenon to the release of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) from the mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus mediated by its NLS (nuclear localization signal). Inside the mitochondria, AIF is anchored to the inner membrane. In order to be released, the protein is cleaved by a calcium-dependent <b>calpain</b> protease.|$|E
25|$|Cells can undergo necroptosis in {{response}} to perturbed homeostasis in specific circumstances. In response to DNA damage, the RIPK1 and RIPK3 are phosphorylated and lead to deterioration of the cell {{in the absence of}} caspase activation. The necrosome inhibits the adenine nucleotide translocase in mitochondria to decrease cellular ATP levels. Uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain leads to additional mitochondrial damage and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which releases mitochondrial proteins into the cytosol. The necrosome also causes leakage of lysosomal digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm by induction of reactive oxygen species by JNK, sphingosine production, and <b>calpain</b> activation by calcium release.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the actual}} process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, {{apoptotic}} signals must cause regulatory proteins {{to initiate the}} apoptosis pathway.

Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: the targeting of mitochondria functionality, or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms. An extrinsic pathway for initiation identified in several toxin studies is an increase in calcium concentration within a cell caused by drug activity, which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium binding protease <b>calpain.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although the {{physiological}} role of calpains is still poorly understood, {{they have been}} shown to be active participants in processes such as cell mobility and cell cycle progression, as well as cell-type specific functions such as long-term potentiation in neurons and cell fusion in myoblasts. Under these physiological conditions, a transient and localized influx of calcium into the cell activates a small local population of calpains (for example, those close to Ca2+ channels), which then advance the signal transduction pathway by catalyzing the controlled proteolysis of its target proteins. Other reported roles of calpains are in cell function, helping to regulate clotting and the diameter of blood vessels, and playing a role in memory.

25|$|Although most injury {{responses}} {{include a}} calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is rapid {{separation of the}} proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury.

Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation.

The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and <b>calpain</b> proteases (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process. Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and longer in the CNS.
