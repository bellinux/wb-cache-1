40|$|For over WO years, {{the company}} network {{was a major}} feature of {{organized}} corporate govemance in Germany. This paper uses network visualization techniques and qualitative-historical analysis to discuss the structure, origins and development of this network and to analyse the reasons for its recent erosion. Network visualization {{makes it possible to}} identify crucial entanglement pattems that can be traced back historically. In three phases of network formation - the ISSOs, 1920 s and the 1950 s ~ capital entanglement resulted from the interaction of company behaviour and government policy. In its heyday, the company network was de facto encompassing and provided its core participants, especially the hanks, with a national, macroeconomic perspective. In the 1970 s, increased competition among financial companies set in. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, declining returns from hlockhotding and increased opportunity costs made network dissolution a thinkable option for companies. Because of the strategic reorientation of the largest banks toward investment banking, ties between banks and industry underwent functional changes. Since the year 2000, the German government's tax policy has sped up network erosion. Vanishing <b>capital</b> <b>ties</b> imply a declining degree of strategic co-ordination among large German companies...|$|E

40|$|We {{would like}} to {{acknowledge}} the Pelagic Fisheries Research Program for funding support. Social networks and social capital can facilitate or constrain collaborative arrangements which can enhance resource governance and adaptability in complex social-ecological systems such as fisheries. Yet, the impact of ethnic diversity among resource users on social network capital in the context of resource governance has not been previously examined. To explore this effect, a social network analysis of the entire population of resource users in Hawaii’s longline fishery was performed, which is currently characterized by a division along ethnic lines and competition over resource use. Results show that ethnicity significantly influences social network structure and is responsible for a homophily effect, with higher levels of bonding and bridging ties found within ethnic groups. In contrast to previous research on social capital, the greatest evidence of linking social <b>capital</b> <b>ties</b> was found in a minority ethnic group rather than the dominant ethnic group. However, results suggest that ethnic fragmentation may be responsible for the marginalization of another minority group, which reported a significantly low level of linking ties to industry leaders, government or management officials, and the scientific community. This study provides the first empirical evidence of the effect of ethnic diversity on social network capital in the fisheries literature, and has implications for the success of collaborative management...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss how social capital is {{developed}} in the internationalization process of small and medium-sized family enterprises (family SMEs). Design/methodology/approach – This paper reports findings from an in-depth multiple case study with four Finnish manufacturing family SMEs. The data were analyzed through the perspectives of (i) structural holes, (ii) network closure, and (iii) the interplay between these two mechanisms. Findings – Our material demonstrated that family entrepreneurs had a large number of structural holes when launching international operations, but also after several years of running international operations. Instead of trying to span structural holes, they concentrated merely on developing the network closure with agents and subsidiary staff. The case firms spent a lot of resources on finding suitable network ties and on developing good network closure with the selected social <b>capital</b> <b>ties.</b> Research limitations/implications – There are some aspects that might differ depending on the home and target country of firms. For instance, firms in some Asian countries are able to utilize emigrant relationships that help them with networking, which was not the case here with Finnish family SMEs. Practical implications – Family entrepreneurs seem to have a tendency to concentrate on a limited number of foreign partners, and to neglect the building of new relationships that could help them in future challenges. Originality/value – In this study, we (i) respond to calls for more research on network development in the entrepreneurial process, especially in the context of internationalization, (ii) we introduce the notions of network closure and structural holes to the internationalization context, and (iii) we reveal how social capital restricts and facilitates family SMEs’ international operations...|$|E

40|$|This {{theoretical}} and empirical investigation has its own contributions to solve one of critical question of the time: Do local culture, knowledge and traditional institutions (ICBOs) matter to integrate global anticorruption policies with local community {{in the era of}} globalization? How? The study is conducted with objectives of assessing the nature, causes and effects of corruption on the development of southern Ethiopia, and to come up with better solutions. The study presents {{theoretical and}} empirical evidences that corruption affects the well beings of poor countries through misuse of existing limited financial resources, particularly in southern Ethiopia. Like many developing countries, southern Ethiopia focuses on formal institutions such as anticorruption institutions and laws to combat corruption. The current government of Ethiopia has established ethics and anticorruption commissions at federal and regional levels to implement anticorruption laws and programs. Even though these institutions have been working for long time, corruption has been still one of the main challenges of development in Southern Ethiopia. After analyzing existing literatures and first hand information from SNNPRS, this thesis develops new approaches towards combating corruption in the public sectors. In addition to secondary sources, primary sources were collected by using unstructured and in depth interviews, group discussions and personal observations during field work in southern Ethiopia. The findings shows that truly independent anti-corruption institutions that focus on informal institutions such as indigenous community based organizations can make tremendous impacts towards increasing effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts in order to minimize or if possible to eradicate corrupt practices in the community. The findings also indicate that local knowledge and cultures play robust roles to integrate global anticorruption policies and strategies with local communities. This glocalization process is important to implement best experiences of global communities in combating corruption with values and cultural practices of local communities in southern Ethiopia. To facilitate this glocalization process and to increase effectiveness of anticorruption efforts in SNNPRS, ICBOs can make tremendous contributions by establishing social <b>capital</b> <b>ties</b> between global best experiences, and local values and cultural practices.

40|$|Diani (1997) {{argues that}} the {{influence}} and impact of social movements are defined by “the solidity of the linkages within the movement sector as well as—more crucially—of the bonds among movement actors, the social milieu in which they operate, and cultural and political elites” (Diani, 1997 : 129). The impact of a social movement can thus be assessed “in the light of changes in its components' relative centrality in various social networks. The broader the range of social <b>capital</b> <b>ties</b> emerging from a period of sustained mobilization, the greater the impact” (Diani, 1997 : 129). Building on Lobina et al. (forthcoming), we adapt Diani’s (1997) analytical framework to investigate the determinants of social movement outcome. The proposed paper looks at the relationship between changes in relative actor centrality and the outcome of an anti-water privatisation campaign in Cochabamba, Bolivia. More precisely, we assess the centrality of actors participating in the campaign and their links with the social milieu. Centrality is assessed {{by looking at the}} participation of campaign members in episodes characterised by the adoption of different mobilisation tactics. Links among campaign members are also analysed in terms of brokerage. The links between the campaign and the social milieu are assessed by looking at: a) the internal membership of actors participating in the campaign; b) the diversity of interests represented by campaign members; and, c) formal or informal ties with actors external to the campaign. Finally, the magnitude of mass mobilisation in different phases of the campaign is used as an indicator of the strength of links between the campaign and the social milieu. For the purposes of our paper, mass mobilisation is defined as the number of actors who decide to join campaign initiatives without belonging to any campaign member. The Cochabamba campaign is atypical when compared to other anti-water privatisation campaigns in Latin America, as observed by Lobina et al. (forthcoming). In fact, it is characterised by the intensity of events {{in a short period of}} time, and by the disruptive nature of the tactics adopted. We test the validity of our analytical framework for application to five anti-water privatisation campaigns resulting in successful outcome (Brazil, Peru, Uruguay) and unsuccessful outcome (Chile, Colombia). We expect this exercise to contribute to strengthening operationalisation as well as the generality of our findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to inquire}} into how states balance economic motivations and security concerns when pursuing sovereignty at borders. More precisely, the dissertation examines tradeoffs between interdependence sovereignty -control over transborder flows [...] and Westphalian sovereignty defined as exclusion of external actors from states' authoritative space. Focusing on control over cross-border human mobility as the issue area, I put forward the securitized interdependence framework as a theory that encompasses economic and security logics of policy-making. Because migration control rests at the nexus of economic/material and geopolitical/military dimensions of state security, it provides an ideal testing ground for observing the interaction of economic and security motives. The theoretical framework draws on the literature on complex interdependence and {{the logic of the}} trading state to postulate empirically verifiable propositions on migration control policies. The central claim of the dissertation is that human mobility is conditionally securitized and that security logics are modulated by material/economic incentives. Facing informational asymmetries vis-à-vis transnational terrorists, states rely on migration and border control strategies to screen and deter non-state threats to security. However, economic interdependence [...] trade and <b>capital</b> <b>ties</b> [...] mitigates fears over transnational terrorism by reconfiguring state preferences, bolstering the relative salience of material concerns in policy-making, tempering perceptions of threat, and creating vested interests at the domestic level. To test the theory I have collected and compiled data on i) visa restrictions for pairs of 207 X 207 directed dyads ii) visa rejection rates for European Union and/or Schengen member countries for the period 2003 - 2007, and iii) asylum recognition rates for 20 select OECD recipient states for the period 1980 - 2007. I then use this data to test the implications of the theory by distinguishing between economic/voluntary and political/involuntary migration. Additionally, I tease out the distinct effects of two different types of security concerns over transnational terrorism: a reputational effect that considers origin country citizens' involvement in terrorism incidents worldwide and a targeted/directed impact through which states take into account past experience as targets of terrorism. To illustrate the effect of economic interdependence, I analyze trade and capital flows separately and illustrate that both types of commercial ties facilitate liberalization of controls over human mobility through direct and indirect mechanisms. I employ a variety of statistical techniques to study the effect of economic and security concerns including several cross-sectional time series techniques, structural break and recursive residual tests for temporal change, and maximum likelihood. Furthermore, I complement my quantitative empirical analysis with an in-depth process tracing approach that traces the evolution of Turkey's migration policies in the context of Turkey's post- 1980 economic liberalization. The qualitative analysis makes use of primary and secondary resources obtained from archival field work in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey. The dissertation demonstrates that the impact of security concerns over transnational terrorism is contingent on the type of migration policy under consideration. In particular, policies of control over involuntary/political migration are guided by humanitarian and normative motives, limiting the effect of security concerns. Furthermore, the securitization of visa policies is strongest if recipient states are directly targeted by incidents of transnational terrorism perpetrated by origin country nationals. While states take into account incidents of global terrorism [...] -attacks against other country nationals or territories by origin country citizens [...] this channel of impact is more modest. Additionally, empirical results show that economic interdependence effectively undercuts the effect of global terrorism, driving migration control policies towards liberalization. In sum, the dissertation demonstrates that ways in which states assert interdependence sovereignty exhibit temporal and cross-sectional variation as well as functional differentiation across types of border and migration control policies.
