Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher <b>crude</b> <b>fibre</b> and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

The sum of the nitrogen free extracts (NFE) and crude protein (CP), on the other hand, constituted 91 % to 92 % of the dry matter of the grains. In all varieties, the nutritive values of the grains, therefore, depend mainly on their contents of NFE and CP. In animal feeding, sorghum grains are usually used as energy sources, whereas groundnut seed cake is used as CP source.

50|$|Cooking {{treatments}} do {{not lead}} to variance in total protein and carbohydrate content. Soaking and cooking of dry seeds possibly induces chemical modification of protein-fibre complexes, which leads {{to an increase in}} <b>crude</b> <b>fibre</b> content. Thus, cooking can increase protein quality by inactivating or destroying heat-labile antinutritional factors. Cooking also increases protein digestibility, essential amino acid index, and protein efficiency ratio. Although cooking lowers concentrations of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, total aromatic, and sulphur-containing amino acids, their contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference. Diffusion of reducing sugars, raffinose, sucrose and others into cooking water reduces or completely removes these components. Cooking also significantly reduces fat and mineral contents. The B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and pyridoxine dissolve into cooking water at differing rates.|$|E

During the spring and summer, they feed on soy, clover and corn poppy as well as grasses and herbs. During autumn and winter, they primarily choose winter wheat, and are also attracted to piles of sugar beet and carrots provided for them by hunters. They also eat twigs, buds and the bark of shrubs and young fruit trees during winter. Cereal crops are usually avoided when other more attractive foods are available, the species appearing to prefer high energy foodstuffs over <b>crude</b> <b>fibre.</b> When eating twigs, hares strip off the bark to access the vascular tissues which store soluble carbohydrates. Compared to the European rabbit, food passes through the gut more rapidly in the hare, although digestion rates are similar.

50|$|The outer {{coverings}} of the cottonseed, {{known as}} cottonseed hulls, {{are removed from}} the cotton kernels before the oil is extracted. Cottonseed hulls serve as {{an excellent source of}} feed for the livestock as they contain about 8% of cotton linters which have nearly 100% cellulose in them. They require no grinding and easily mix with other feed sources. As they are easy to handle, their transportation cost is fairly low, as well. Whole cottonseed is another feed product of cottonseed used to feed livestock. It is the seed left after the separation of long fibres from cotton, and serves as a good source of cellulose for ruminants. Whole cottonseed leads to high production of milk and fat, if it is being fed to a high-producing dairy cow. It can be cost effective and provides nutrients such as high protein value of about 23%, <b>crude</b> <b>fibre</b> value of 25%, and high energy value of 20%. Whole cottonseed serves as a highly digestible feed which also improves the reproductive performance in livestock. Pima cottonseed, which is free of linters by default, and delinted cottonseed are other types of cottonseed feed products.|$|E
50|$|The jute {{trade is}} centred mainly around Bangladesh and the Indian State of West Bengal. The major {{producing}} country of jute is Bangladesh, {{due to its}} natural fertile soil. Bengal Jute was taken to Europe early in the 17th century by the Dutch and the French and later by the East India Company to Britain. By the 1790s a much larger trade had developed in the Scottish city of Dundee, the European home of jute spinners. Introduced to the British by the East India Company, <b>crude</b> <b>fibre</b> was the bulk still exported from Bengal after 1790, but a thriving trade did not really begin until after 1850 through mechanised processing, to meet rising demand. Raw jute was imported from Bengal by the British East India Company. British Jute Barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company began to set up jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and even more during WWII and also exported to the Americas, especially the United States southern region to bag cotton and coffee. It {{was used in the}} fishing, construction, art and in the arms industry. India, China, Thailand, Myanmar also produce Jute in low quantities. India {{is one of the largest}} importers of Jute in South Asia and also produces processed jute products in the world, while Bangladesh is the largest producer and exporter of raw jute. Therefore, the local price of raw jute in Bangladesh is the international price. Ironically, the local price of jute goods produced in India set their own price.|$|E

All sampling was performed after pre-treatment {{in order to obtain}} more homogeneous and representative samples. The sampling included both the pre-treated waste and the reject from the pre-treatment allowing for estimation of the composition of the original waste. A total of 40 waste samples were chemically characterised with respect to 15 parameters. The waste generally consisted of around 88 % VS of which an average of 80 % was easily degradable. The average content of N, P and K in the dry matter of the organic waste was 2. 5 %, 0. 4 % and 0. 9 %, respectively. A general analysis of variance was applied to show the influence of the collection system, dwelling type and annual season on the waste composition. The content of plastic and <b>crude</b> <b>fibres</b> in the waste differed the most among the samples, probably due to use of different bag types (plastic and paper) in the different collection systems. Variations in the ash content and the calorific value might be explained by differences in the sorting instructions (whether soil and cat litter are allowed in the organic fraction). Significant seasonal variations were seen for ash, S and Cl. Dwelling type showed no statistically significant influence on any waste components. A test for uniform distribution of the p-values from the analysis of variance (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) showed that the overall composition of the collected waste was strongly affected by the collection system (city) and season, while dwelling type had no significant influence.

Lochman (1975) stated the digestibility of organic matter, <b>crude</b> protein, <b>fibre</b> and nitrogen-free extract in meadow hay to be 56 and 38 %, 37 and 31 %, 57 and 31 % and 57 and 35 % in roe does and bucks, respectively. At a body weight of 20 kg the daily dry matte...|$|R

The contents of proteins ranged from 8. 66 % to 17. 11 % for all the cultivars. IKMP 3, IKMP 5, SOSAT C 88 and L Zatiib were reveled to be excellent sources of proteins. Water-soluble proteins ranged from 1. 81 % to 3. 18 %. Fat content in the grains values ranged from 6. 76 % to 10. 24 %, the best cultivars for fat were IKMP 3, IKMP 5, SOSAT C 88 and KM. The carbohydrates are the major components of these cultivars, values ranged between 71. 82 % to 81. 02 % and samples IKMP 1, IKMP 2, TK, B 1, B 2 contained more carbohydrates than all others cultivars. The energy values of cutivars flours ranged from 426. 21 Kcal/ 100 g to 446. 53 Kcal/ 100 g. Results of Technological properties showed capacities of swelling in water (V /V) ranged from 2. 33 and 8. 28. Masses of 1000 grains ranged from 5. 53 g to 13. 13 g; cutivarsI F IKMV 8201, IKMP 5, B 1 had the highest masses of 1000 grains and consequently present better outputs potential millers. Starch is present in relatively significant quantity of 51. 49 % at 79. 07 % and cultivars IKMP 1, B 1, and SG have the most raised contents. The <b>crude</b> <b>fibres</b> also are present in high quantity 8. 06 % to 12. 40 % and cultivars IKMP 3, SOSAT C 88 are provided greater quantity. The cultivars contents of phytates from 5. 45 to 14. 26 mg / g and in polyphenols from 2. 27 to 3. 20 mg / g. The energy values of cultivars flours lies between 426. 51 kcal / 100 g and 446. 53 kcal / 100 g. Samples IKMP 3, IKMP 5, SOSAT C 88 and KM ar...|$|R
40|$|The chemical, bioactive, and {{antioxidant}} {{potential of}} twenty wild culinary mushroom species being {{consumed by the}} people of northern Himalayan regions has been evaluated {{for the first time in}} the present study. Nutrients analyzed include protein, <b>crude</b> fat, <b>fibres,</b> carbohydrates, and monosaccharides. Besides, preliminary study on the detection of toxic compounds was done on these species. Bioactive compounds evaluated are fatty acids, amino acids, tocopherol content, carotenoids (β-carotene, lycopene), flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanidins. Fruitbodies extract of all the species was tested for different types of antioxidant assays. Although differences were observed in the net values of individual species all the species were found to be rich in protein, and carbohydrates and low in fat. Glucose was found to be the major monosaccharide. Predominance of UFA (65 – 70 %) over SFA (30 – 35 %) was observed in all the species with considerable amounts of other bioactive compounds. All the species showed higher effectiveness for antioxidant capacities...|$|R
