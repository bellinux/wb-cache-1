It is {{necessary}} to maintain ecological balance between soil and vegetation in this region where the terrain is very steep and rugged; thus, subject to significant soil erosion. Many native plants distributed in a wide range in the region. Some of these are Acer divergens Pax. var. divergens (Divergent maple), Arbutus andrachne L. (Hawthorn), Capparis ovata Desf. (Caper), Cistus creticus L. (Rock rose), Colutea armena Bois & Huet. (Bladder-senna), Cotinus coggyria Scop: (<b>Common</b> <b>smoketree),</b> Cotoneaster nummularia Fisch and Mey. (Cotoneaster), Crataegus L. (Grecian strawberry tree), Eleagnus angustifolia L. (Russian olive), Ephedra major Host. (Ephedrine, Ma Huang), Jasminum fruticans L. (Wild Jasmine), Juniperus L.

(Elm-leaved sumac) and Zizyphus jujuba Mill. (Common jujube). This species are important seed and seedling material sources for erosion control efforts in the region...|$|E
