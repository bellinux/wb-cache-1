30|$|However, {{most of the}} <b>cold</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> are 6 -high UCM <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> or 4 -high CVC <b>rolling</b> <b>mills.</b> Given {{that the}} 4 -high CVC mill has work roll {{shifting}} function, it can use the K-WRS technology to realize similar function of the 6 -high UCMW mill [79].
