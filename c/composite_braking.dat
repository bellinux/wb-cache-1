40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{comparison}} of the frictional characteristics of three different samples of brake block materials. Two commercial <b>brake</b> blocks (<b>composite</b> and grey iron/metallic) and a non-commercial <b>composite</b> <b>brake</b> block were extracted to form pins (specimens), and then their frictional properties were evaluated using a pin-on-disc apparatus. The non-commercial <b>composite</b> <b>brake</b> block that was investigated in this work was developed as a substitute for the grey iron brake block. The results revealed that the <b>composite</b> <b>brake</b> blocks had a higher wear resistance and were more stable in terms of their coefficient of friction at various contact pressures and sliding speeds compared to the grey iron brake block. The non-commercial <b>composite</b> <b>brake</b> block that was developed in this research had a coefficient of friction that was close to that of the grey iron brake block, and hence, it can be considered as a substitute for the grey iron brake block...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different modes of braking. At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and braking distance size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and braking distances were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and braking distances amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, <b>composite</b> <b>braking</b> blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic braking (emergency, full service and adjusting braking) of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated. As the calculation results were obtained values of the longitudinal forces, braking distances amounts and reduction time in speed at various braking modes. Originality. Waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on the longitudinal forces level and braking distances amount in freight trains were investigated. Also the longitudinal loading of freight trains at various pneumatic braking was investigated. Practical value. Obtained results can be used to assess the level of largest longitudinal forces and braking distances in the freight trains of different lengths by mathematical modeling of different braking modes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} {{brake rotors}} {{are made with}} cast iron.

With the development of commercial aluminum <b>composites,</b> <b>composite</b> <b>brake</b> rotors are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made for brake application and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property.
