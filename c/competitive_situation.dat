25|$|Hans Mayer, {{along with}} Walter Benjamin, {{who was also}} {{with him at the}} Collège de Sociologie, and some others, belongs to the most {{important}} literary critics of the 20th century. Perhaps there is some correlation to a former <b>competitive</b> <b>situation,</b> which Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote about in an obituary, which shows Mayer's life in an unflattering light. Reich-Ranicki describes the story of Hans Mayer's life as a tragic story, as the story of a person who did not find a home anywhere.|$|E
25|$|New New Trade Theory {{analyses}} individual {{enterprises and}} plants {{in an international}} <b>competitive</b> <b>situation.</b> The classical trade theory—i.e., the Heckscher–Ohlin model—has no enterprises in mind. The new trade theory treats enterprises in an industry as identical entities. New New Trade Theory gives focus on the diversity of enterprises. It {{is a fact that}} some enterprises engage in export and some that do not. Some enterprises invest directly in the foreign country in order to produce and sell in that country. Some other enterprises engage only in export. Why does this kind of differences occur? New New Trade Theory tries to find out the reasons of these well observed facts.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{the museums}} have {{experienced}} simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have {{been marked by}} a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience {{and led to a}} 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning”. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This <b>competitive</b> <b>situation</b> is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.|$|E

Using data from a realistic competitive risk-taking setting, Jeopardy’s Tournament of Champions (TOC), we test whether players choose the strategic best response when making their betting decisions. Analyses show that the percentage of players choosing the strategic best response is very low, a surprising finding because the TOC is contested by the best and most experienced players of the game. We conjecture that performance aspiration and survival targets that guide risk-taking behavior in <b>competitive</b> <b>situations</b> may lead players to select inferior competitive strategies. ...|$|R
