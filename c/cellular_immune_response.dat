HCV-specific <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> in seronegative subjects {{have been the subject of}} only limited prior study, in part due to the lack of appropriate recombinant antigens and assay systems. Therefore, this thesis described the development and validation of an interferon-? (IFN-?) ELISPOT assay using overlapping peptides (n= 441). Using this assay, HCV-specific <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> were detected in 5 / 10 (50 %) of chronically infected subjects. Responses were identified more frequently, and were directed against more regions of the HCV genome, than with traditional assay systems. This IFN-? ELISPOT assay, a comparable interleukin (IL) - 2 ELISPOT assay, and a multiplex in vitro cytokine production assay were then used to evaluate HCV-specific <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> in three cohorts of seronegative subjects at high-risk of exposure to HCV &# 150; babies born to infected mothers, multiply-transfused subjects with thalassaemia, and high risk injecting drug users. <b>Cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> were evaluated in 23 infants born to HCV-antibody positive women. Responses were not detected in infants born to HCV-PCR negative mothers.

HCV-specific <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> were assessed in a cohort of multiply transfused subjects with thalassaemia using assays for cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, IFN-? and IL- 2 ELISPOT, as well as lymphocyte proliferation and in vitro cytokine production. Responses were detected in 6 / 13 chronically infected subjects (46 %), 4 / 7 subjects who had cleared infection (71 %), and 14 / 17 seronegative subjects (82 %). The seronegative subjects had responses which were broader and higher in magnitude than those with chronic HCV infection, although lower and narrower than in subjects who had cleared prior HCV infection. IFN-? and IL- 2 ELISPOT assays, in additional to in vitro cytokine production assays, were performed on 41 injecting drug users (IDUs), with responses detected in 6 (15 %). Seronegative IDUs with HCV-specific <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> had been injecting for a mean of 7. 7 years, and reported multiple risk factors for exposure to HCV. The combined data from these three cohorts indicate that the HCV-specific <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> detected in seronegative subjects were generally broad in specificity. Cytokine production was generally Th 1 -biased, a pattern which has previously been associated with an increased likelihood of clearance in primary infection. The findings also suggest that responses can be maintained for decades after exposure, and may provide protection against repeated exposures. In summary, cellular immunity against HCV is evident in some seronegative high risk subjects, suggesting that the <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> may efficiently facilitate viral clearance. Understanding the mechanisms of this <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> pattern will allow better understanding of the host response to HCV and may provide key insights into vaccine design...|$|R

[...] Aside from its role in promoting glycolytic flux and anearobic energy production, {{it has been shown}} to induce a specific humoral and <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> On all levels, hypoxia-induced over-expression of enolase 1 may possess important roles in hypoxic tumors including the most straightforward increase in anearobic respiration.|$|E
40|$|Norovirus (NoV) P domain complexes, the 24 mer P {{particles}} and the P dimers, induced effective humoral immunity, but {{their role in}} the <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> remained unclear. We reported here a study on <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> of the two P domain complexes in comparison with the virus-like particle (VLP) of a GII. 4 NoV (VA 387) in mice. The P domain complexes induced significant central memory CD 4 (+) T cell phenotypes (CD 4 (+) CD 44 (+) CD 62 L(+) CCR 7 (+)) and activated polyclonal CD 4 (+) T cells as shown by production of Interleukin (IL) - 2, Interferon (IFN) -γ, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -α. Most importantly, VA 387 -specific CD 4 (+) T cell epitope induced a production of IFN-γ, indicating an antigen-specific CD 4 (+) T cell response in P domain complex-immunized mice. Furthermore, P domain complexes efficiently induced bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (BMDC) maturation, evidenced by up-regulation of co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules, as well as production of IL- 12 and IL- 1 β. Finally, P domain complex-induced mature dendritic cells (DCs) elicited proliferation of specific CD 4 (+) T cells targeting VA 387 P domain. Overall, we conclude that the NoV P domain complexes are efficiently presented by DCs to elicit not only humoral but also <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> against NoVs. Since the P particle is highly effective for both humoral and <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> and easily produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli), it is a good choice of vaccine against NoVs and a vaccine platform against other diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection, {{there is}} accumulating data suggesting {{the presence of}} <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to HCV in exposed but seemingly uninfected populations. Some studies have suggested cross-reactive antigens rather than prior HCV exposure as {{the main reason for}} the <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> In this study we address this question by analyzing the <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> of chimpanzees that have been sequentially exposed to increasing doses of HCV virions. The level of viremia, as well as the <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to HCV at different times after virus inoculation, were examined. Our data indicate that HCV infective doses as low as 1 – 10 RNA (+) virions induce detectable <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> in chimpanzees without consistently detectable viremia or persistent seroconversion. However, increasing the infective doses of HCV to 100 RNA (+) virions overcame the low-inoculum-induced <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> and produced high-level viremia followed by seroconversion...|$|R
40|$|Background. {{the genetic}} {{diversity}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) {{raises the question of}} whether vaccines that include a component to elicit antiviral T cell immunity based on a single viral genetic clade could provide <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> protection against divergent HIV- 1 clades. Therefore, we quantified the cross-clade reactivity, among unvaccinated individuals, of anti-HIV- 1 T cell responses to the infecting HIV- 1 clade relative to other major circulating clades. Methods. <b>Cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to HIV- 1 clades A, B, and C were compared by standardized interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays among 250 unvaccinated individuals, infected with diverse HIV- 1 clades, from Brazil, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States. Cross-clade reactivity was evaluated by use of the ratio of responses to heterologous versus homologous (infecting) clades of HIV- 1. Results. <b>Cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> were predominantly focused on viral Gag and Nef proteins. Cross-clade reactivity of <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to HIV- 1 clade A, B, and C proteins was substantial for Nef proteins (ratio, 0. 97 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 89 - 1. 05]) and lower for Gag proteins (ratio, 0. 67 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 62 - 0. 73]). the difference in cross-clade reactivity to Nef and Gag proteins was significant (P <. 0001). Conclusions. Cross-clade reactivity of <b>cellular</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> can be substantial but varies by viral protein.
