On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning.|$|E

25|$|A {{method of}} helical {{broaching}} {{was developed in}} the 2010s that shortens the toolpath of tapping. To a casual observer (without slow motion), it looks rather similar to traditional tapping but with faster movement {{into and out of the}} hole. It uses a specific tool geometry and toolpath to position rapidly, broach the thread in a single half-turn, and then retract rapidly, shortening the cycle time and consuming less energy. It reduces the cost of threading for any holes that can safely allow the two small fast-helix grooves that it leaves behind along with the thread, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> in many applications.|$|E
25|$|After obtaining scores, {{researchers}} {{are able to}} use the information to determine if there is a difference in the average risk estimate of the individual compared to the average risk estimate of their peers. Generally in negative events, the mean risk of an individual appears lower than the risk estimate of others. This is then used to demonstrate the bias' effect. The optimistic bias can only be defined at a group level, because at an individual level the positive assessment <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> Likewise, difficulties can arise in measurement procedures, as {{it is difficult to determine}} when someone is being optimistic, realistic, or pessimistic. Research suggests that the bias comes from an overestimate of group risks rather than underestimating one's own risk.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E

500|$|James Schellenberg {{writing in}} Challenging Destiny, a Canadian science fiction and fantasy magazine, was {{impressed}} by Shikasta [...] "grand sense of perspective" [...] and the context of humanity set in a [...] "vaster scale of civilization and right-thinking". He liked the concept of SOWF as a [...] "metaphor of community connectedness", but felt it was an unusual way to build a utopia. The book's fractured storytelling leads to Lessing breaking the [...] "famous dictum of writing – show, don't tell", and while that may work in certain circumstances, Schellenberg felt that that approach does not work very well in Shikasta. The online magazine Journey to the Sea found Lessing's inclusion of stories from the Hebrew Bible [...] "entertaining and intriguing", and said she challenges the logical thinker's rejection of these sacred texts, suggesting that it is [...] "imaginatively possible" [...] that they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
500|$|Edward Hasted, {{the local}} {{historian}} of Kent, has dismissed {{the story of}} the Biddenden Maids as a folk myth, claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that {{the story of the}} conjoined twins was [...] "a vulgar tradition" [...] invented to account for it, while influential historian Robert Chambers accepted that the legend <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> but believed it unlikely. Throughout most of the 19th century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend. Despite the doubts among historians, in the 19th century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of Biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every Easter. In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.|$|E
500|$|Miller is {{considered}} one of the founders of psycholinguistics, which links language and cognition in psychology, to analyze how people use and create language. His 1951 book Language and Communication {{is considered}} seminal in the field. His later book, The Science of Words (1991) also focused on language psychology. He published papers along with Noam Chomsky on the mathematics and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also researched how people understood words and sentences, the same problem faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. [...] The book Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan and do things. Miller is also known for coining Miller's Law: [...] "In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume it is true and try to imagine what it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> of".|$|E

2500|$|Gladys Hunt, in Read for Your Life, gives two themes for the book. The first {{speaks of}} the {{possibility}} of magical happenings in the real world. Though Jenny at first refuses to imagine that Peter's talk of visions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> other characters are not so certain. Mr. Evans the farmer maintains that there are [...] "things as can't be explained", despite the skepticism of his family. Later in the story Jenny visits Professor Rhys and tells him about Peter's visions, hoping he will give her a reasonable explanation for them. Instead he shocks her by admitting he believes magical occurrences are possible and superstitions may be rooted in facts, saying [...] "the more I learn the less I know... Why should there not be forces we do not understand?" [...] The second theme Hunt mentions is that people's lives form patterns, sometimes woven together so that the actions of one may affect another's, even centuries apart, as Peter returning Taliesin's key brings peace to both of them.|$|E

[...] Ilfi asked how both <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> At first, God exhibits [...] "truth," [...] and at the end, [...] "abundant [...] [...] [...] goodness." [...] Rabbi Johanan said that were it not written in [...] it would be impossible for mere humans to say such a thing took place. But [...] teaches that God drew a prayer shawl around God's self like the leader of congregational prayers and showed Moses the order of prayer. God told Moses that whenever Israel sins, they should recite the passage in [...] containing God's 13 attributes, and God would forgive them. The Gemara interpreted the words [...] "The Lord, the Lord" [...] in [...] to teach that God is the Eternal (exhibiting mercy) before humans sin and the same after they sin and repent. Rav Judah interpreted the words [...] "a God merciful and gracious" [...] in [...] to teach that with the 13 attributes, God made a covenant that Jews will not be turned away empty-handed when they recite the attributes, for soon thereafter, in [...] God says, [...] "Behold I make a covenant.".
