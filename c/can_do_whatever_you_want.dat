Moreno described the song: [...] "The title comes from a Kool Keith song. We {{just thought it was}} some funny stuff. The song is meant to be triumphant. I'm trying to spread a little confidence.

5000|$|While {{writing her}} next novel, which {{would turn out}} to be an eighteen-year process, Segal took a break and wrote Lucinella, a {{whimsical}} novella depicting the lives of New York poets through the eyes of an effervescent heroine. Within Segal's work, the novella stands out as experimental, involving elements of magical realism. [...] "It was a lark and the lark got a bit serious…I think I would not have been able to do it if I hadn't thought of it as an interlude. I was braver because it was something I was doing while I was gathering my life, my forces. Also, one had read Garcia Marquez, right? And you suddenly realized all the stuff you could do. Everyone spoke of magical realism with a frown, and I thought, oh, that's great I love it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want," [...] Segal said in an interview.

Yes, this city that has elected some of the most conservative tea party darlings to congress, where admonishments against working on Sundays still exist and deep pocketed individuals work behind the scenes to block gay marriage, is a fertile garden for the growth of diverse and creative subcultures that taunt the genteel and mainstream folks that managed to shape the persona of this city. In other words, Bland Rapids has a dark side. My talk will explore through the medium of photography the many homegrown and locally-supported subcultures from the roller derby to the burlesque to the semi-legal home concerts in Grand Rapids. Why do these exist and how do they meet a need left unfulfilled by the heavily funded activities and institutions of culture in town are some of the questions I will attempt to address...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to write and record an EP not long after Nocturnes release, Tatum noted: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with EP, like it’s a free pass. People don’t really expect as much from an EP, so you’re free {{to do what you}} want to do. And that is what was so empowering about this particular experience for me. I never needed to take a step back and obsess over what kind of music I was making. I didn’t think that some people might think it’s weird that I’m making this electronic pop song or I’m making this really ambient, droney song. I just did what I wanted to do and it felt good not to think about the outside perspective. I do that so much. I spend a lot of time worrying about what other people think.

5000|$|The band's {{music has}} {{primarily}} {{been described as}} hard rock. Each member's previous smaller local bands they had played in had influenced their approach to making music as well - Eubanks and Odell coming from a heavy metal background, Nimmo coming from a rock and country music background, and Andrews and Frye coming from pop punk background. Odell in particular has mentioned James Hetfield of Metallica as his biggest influence in his guitar-work, mostly notably the track [...] "Sad But True". Odell explained the meaning behind the band's name, and how it ultimately reflected the positive aspect of their music, stating: It has this underdog theme to it, which is like an anthem to people who don’t feel like they can beat the odds but they can, you know? It’s like, you have those people in life that no one thinks that they’re capable of doing things, and then — you know, {{we want to be}} the people who say, “Yeah, you can do it. You’re not stuck. You <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do.” Similarly, he stated that the band's album First World Problems was indeed related to the concept of a first world problem, criticizing society's tendency to focus on and complain about ultimately insignificant problems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project had}} {{initially}} originated with Bandai's toy division as a sponsor, {{with the goal}} of selling spacecraft toys. Watanabe recalled his only instruction was [...] "So long as there's a spaceship in it, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> want." [...] But upon viewing early footage, it became clear that Watanabe's vision for the series didn't match with that of Bandai's. Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise, Bandai pulled out of the project, leaving it in development hell until sister company Bandai Visual stepped in to sponsor it. Since {{there was no need to}} merchandise toys with the property any more, Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series. Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults. During the making of Bebop, Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later. While some of them were doubtful of that at the time, Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect. He joked that if Bandai Visual hadn't intervened then [...] "you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right now." ...|$|R

L responded, 2 ̆ 2 people should come to work 2 ̆ 2 (personal communication, February 3, 2003).

But I want to argue for these metaphors because as Nietzsche (1979) suggested, metaphors have life spans: once a metaphor dies, it is time for a new metaphor. The rhizome and the cyborg do what metaphors help us do; think creatively and imaginatively about a previously known idea-in this case the Cartesian seeing subject and seen object. Too frequently art education and democracy get linked at the most superficial level. I argue for new complex metaphors, which require work, to help us understand the relationship of these ideas on a more profound level...|$|R
