25|$|The Individual (personal) Tooth-Wear Index was {{developed}} to objectively quantify the degree of tooth wear in an individual, without being affected {{by the number of}} missing teeth. Bruxism is not the only cause of tooth wear. Another possible cause of tooth wear is acid erosion, which may occur in people who drink a lot of acidic liquids such as <b>concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juice,</b> or in people who frequently vomit or regurgitate stomach acid, which itself can occur for various reasons. People also demonstrate a normal level of tooth wear, associated with normal function. The presence of tooth wear only indicates that it had occurred {{at some point in the}} past, and does not necessarily indicate that the loss of tooth substance is ongoing. People who clench and perform minimal grinding will also not show much tooth wear. Occlusal splints are usually employed as a treatment for bruxism, but they can also be of diagnostic use, e.g. to observe the presence or absence of wear on the splint after a certain period of wearing it at night.|$|E

It is observed that the pressure is uniformly distributed when an integral number of waves is there in the oesophagus; but it is non-uniform when a non-integral number of waves is present therein. It is further observed that as the plug flow region widens, the pressure difference increases, which indicates that the averaged flow rate will reduce for a Casson fluid.

40|$|SUMMARY: Osmophilic yeasts {{are found}} in the film of {{molasses}} on the crystals of raw sugars and in intermediate sugar-refining products {{of a wide range of}} concen-tration. They are allied to yeasts found in similar situations such as <b>concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> etc., and can be made to spore more or less freely under dry conditions, usually with conjugation. They are unable to destroy sucrose in strongly buffered solutions; some are able to produce sufficient acid from traces of invert sugar present gradually to invert the sucrose. During this process multiplication takes place. Previous workers have shown that the majority of organisms of this group is highly acid resistant. Organisms which grow in a wide range of concentration of dissolved solids (salts, sugar) show, at acid pH values, an adaptation to growth in higher concentrations accompanied by a diminished metabolic rate. This is lost after a period of 6 - 8 weeks in dilute media, but can be revived in many cases by increasing the sugar concentration in not less than two steps. Temperature resistance is also increased in concentrated media...|$|R

In this research,dragon fruit juice was concentrated by using freeze concentration process. <b>Concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> can be preserved longer than non <b>concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juice.</b> Besides,due to its small capacity storage,concentrated fruit juice also can minimize the transportation cost to import or export it. Freeze concentration process was used because it eliminates water from the juice at temperature below the water’s freezing point,thus preserving the aromatic compound that originally contained in the fruit juice. In addition to research objective,two process parameters and its effect on the fruit juice final concentration were studied. The process parameters were stirring rate and cooling medium temperature. The apparatus used to done the freeze concentration process was crystallizer unit. Dragon fruit juice that was blended and standardized its initial concentration was put into the crystallization unit. The fruit juice spent 12 hours in the crystallizer unit. During the time spent in the crystallizer unit,stirring rate and cooling medium temperature were varied in the range of (600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400) rpm and (- 6, - 8, - 10, - 12 and - 14) °C. To determine the best stirring rate,the temperature of the cooling medium in the crystallizer unit was constant at - 10 °C while the stirring rate of the fruit juice was varied. Then,the best stirring rate was used to determine the best cooling medium temperature. The dragon fruit juice initial concentration was standardized at 7 °Brix. After 12 hour spent in the crystallization unit,the concentration of the fruit juice increased. For the first study where the temperature of the cooling medium was remaining constant, the highest <b>concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was 17 °Brix.

40|$|During {{production}} of <b>concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> {{both physical and}} chemical losses of aroma compounds occur due to heat treatment such as pasteurisation and evaporation. This leads to an inferior quality of the final product. By recovering the aroma complex from fresh juice and then adding {{it back to the}} processed juice, heat treatment can be avoided. Hydrophobic pervaporation is an emerging membrane technique, which provides an interesting alternative when volatile organic compounds are to be separated from dilute aqueous mixtures. The intention of this thesis was to model and to optimise the pervaporation process for the application of aroma recovery from <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> with focus on apple juice. Pervaporation was shown to be a promising alternative for the application of aroma recovery from natural apple juice, as it offers very high separation efficiency at mild process conditions. The operating conditions were shown to {{have a major impact on}} the performance of the process. Improved hydrodynamic conditions in the feed channel, increased feed temperature and decreased permeate pressure favour the aroma recovery. However, this has to be balanced with the energy input. Furthermore, due to the heat sensitivity of the aroma compounds, the temperature has to be kept at a reasonable level. There is also a possibility of controlling the composition of aroma compounds in the permeate via the process conditions. Optimum separation properties could be obtained when applying membranes designed with relatively thin selective layers using a modified silicone rubber polymer with a low degree of crosslinking in combination with a porous support of low resistance. A model for a poly[octylmethyl siloxane] membrane, which can predict the influence of permeate pressure for any permeant within the chemical groups of alcohols, aldehydes and esters was developed. The model provides a better understanding of the plastication phenomena inside the membrane and its effect on permeabilities. By use of the hydrophobicity, the molecular size and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, it was possible to predict the general trends regarding the permeabilities and their influence on temperature for the organics studied...|$|R
30|$|Different {{models are}} {{suggested}} {{to express the}} constitutive equations of non-Newtonian fluids. Amongst these fluid models, there is one known as Casson fluid which was originally introduced by Casson [27]. We can define a Casson fluid as a shear thinning liquid which is assumed to have infinite viscosity at zero rate of shear, and a yield stress below which no flow occurs and a zero viscosity at an infinite rate of shear. The non-linear Casson’s constitutive equation {{has been found to}} describe accurately the flow curves of suspensions of pigments in lithographic varnishes used for preparation of printing inks. In particular, the Casson fluid model describes the flow characteristics of blood more accurately at low shear rates and when it flows through small blood vessels [28]. Some famous examples of the Casson fluid include jelly, tomato sauce, honey, soup, and <b>concentrated</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> etc. Many researchers [29 – 38] studied the Casson fluid under different boundary conditions. Some find the solutions by using either approximate methods or numerical schemes and some find its exact analytical solutions. The solutions when the Casson fluids are in free convection flow with constant wall temperature are also determined. On the other hand the flow of the Casson fluid in the presence of heat transfer is also an important research area. Motivated by Khalid et al. [39] we focused on the unsteady flow of a Casson fluid past an oscillating vertical plate with constant wall temperature under the non-slip conditions. In the present paper, we extended the work of Khalid et al. by applying the slip condition at the boundary. Exact solutions are obtained by applying the Laplace transform technique and it is found that the results in the absence of slip are fully agreed with that of [39].|$|R

40|$|Osmotic {{evaporation}} (or osmotic distillation) {{was carried}} out on roselle extract, apple and grape juices. The industrial pilot plant used had a hydrophobic, polypropylene, hollow-fiber membrane with an area of 10. 2 m 2 and an average pore diameter of 0. 2 ?m. It was suitable for concentrating vegetable extracts and <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> and controlled various parameters such as temperature, flow velocity, and brine concentration. The final total soluble solids (TSS) contents achieved were 660, 570, and 610 g kg? 1 for grape juice, apple juice, and roselle extract, respectively. Temperature and concentration of solutions significantly influenced evaporation flux, which, for roselle extract, was 1. 5 kg h? 1 m? 2 at 610 g TSS kg? 1 and 45 °C. The physico-chemical, biochemical, and aromatic qualities of concentrates obtained by osmotic evaporation were much {{higher than those of}} thermal concentrates, and close to those of the initial products. Industrial relevance: Membrane processes are increasingly used to <b>concentrate</b> thermo-sensitive <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> and plant extracts. Their capacity to operate at moderate temperatures and pressures means that their energy consumption is low, while they produce good quality concentrates. Nonetheless, the main disadvantage of baromembrane processes is their inability to reach the concentration levels standard for products of thermal evaporation because of limitations resulting from high osmotic pressure. Actually, reverse osmosis membranes and equipment limit the final concentration of <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> to about 25 - 35 °Brix. Osmotic evaporation has attracted considerable interest, as it can concentrate juices to as much as 65 °Brix. This process, when applied to various juices, better preserves the quality of raw materials. However, because of the geometrical limitations of commercially available membranes and modules, juices must first be clarified. To our knowledge, only a few studies on osmotic evaporation have so far been conducted at a semi-industrial scale and never with roselle extracts. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
