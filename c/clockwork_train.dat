2500|$|Hornby Railways is a British {{model railway}} brand. Its roots {{date back to}} 1901, when founder Frank Hornby {{received}} a patent for his Meccano construction toy. The first <b>clockwork</b> <b>train</b> was produced in 1920. [...] In 1938, Hornby launched its first 00 gauge train. In 1964, Hornby and Meccano were bought by their competitor, Tri-Ang, and sold on when Tri-ang went into receivership. Hornby Railways became independent in the 1980s, and became listed on the London Stock Exchange, but due to recent financial troubles is presently majority owned by turnaround specialist Phoenix Asset Management.|$|E
6000|$|The gardens {{contain the}} {{inevitable}} elephants, camels (which we breed, {{and which are}} therefore in considerable numbers), a sitting bear, brought from last game's caves, goats from the same region, tamed and now running loose in the gardens, dwarf elephants, wooden nondescripts, and other rare creatures. The keepers wear a uniform not unlike that of railway guards and porters. We wander through the gardens, return, descend the hill by the school of musketry, where soldiers are to be seen shooting at the butts, pass through the paddock of the old farm, and so return to the railway station, extremely gratified by all we have seen, and almost equally divided in our minds between the merits and attractiveness of either ward. A <b>clockwork</b> <b>train</b> comes clattering into the station, we take our places, somebody hoots or whistles for the engine (which can't), the signal is knocked over in {{the excitement of the}} moment, the train starts, and we [...] "wave a long, regretful farewell to the salubrious cheerfulness of Chamois City." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the back}} is a 1940s English working model {{fairground}} automaton, which goes into action when one purchases a token {{and puts it}} in the slot placed under the window. See it working here. There is also a Hornby <b>clockwork</b> <b>train</b> lift.|$|E

50|$|Ives {{released}} its first electric trains in 1910, partially {{in response to}} companies such as American Flyer undercutting its prices on <b>clockwork</b> <b>trains.</b> Ives initially produced electric trains in O gauge and 1 gauge.|$|R

50|$|Although {{best remembered}} for the S gauge trains of the 1950s {{that it made}} as a {{division}} of the A. C. Gilbert Company, American Flyer was initially an independent company whose origins date back nearly a half century earlier. Chicago, Illinois-based toymaker William Frederick Hafner developed a clockwork motor for toy cars in 1901 while working for a company called Toy Auto Company. According to the recollections of William Hafner's son, John, he had developed a <b>clockwork</b> <b>train</b> running on O gauge track by 1905.|$|E
5000|$|William R. Haberlin {{is the man}} {{who made}} all of the tools and dies for the {{original}} Ives O-gauge ("O" [...] gauge) <b>clockwork</b> <b>train</b> line in 1901! Everything (Except the patterns for the iron locomotives bodies, which were made by Charles A. Hotchkiss, mentioned in Model Craftsman - March 1944, and the clockwork mechanisms themselves, manufactured by an outside company (The Reeves Manufacturing Company in New Haven, Connecticut and later in Milford, Connecticut) that went into this line was tooled up by Mr. Haberlin, and his partner, T.F. Hayes (Timothy F. Hayes), in their tool shop, the Hayes & Haberlin Machine Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Hafner {{left the}} company. Believing {{he would be}} given a {{significant}} portion of the company if the trains proved successful, Coleman refused when Hafner asked to exercise this option. Hafner started the Hafner Manufacturing Company, which sold a line of trains called Overland Flyer. Sommers immediately stopped carrying the American Flyer trains in favor of Hafner's brand. Initially, the Hafner and American Flyer product lines were very similar, suggesting they may have been built using the same tooling. This suggests the possibility of the two companies continuing to collaborate. Hafner's business survived as a manufacturer of <b>clockwork</b> <b>trains</b> until 1951, when he sold his business to All Metal Products Company.|$|R

50|$|Artillery Time fuzes {{detonate}} after a set {{period of}} time.

25|$|Toy maker Unique Art {{produced}} {{a line of}} inexpensive O gauge trains from 1949 to 1951, but found itself unable to compete with Marx. Marx continued to make <b>clockwork</b> and battery-powered <b>trains</b> and lithographed cars into the 1970s, along with more realistic offerings that were sometimes difficult to distinguish from Lionel.|$|R
