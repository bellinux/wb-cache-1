5000|$|In 1948, the {{point-contact}} transistor was independently {{invented by}} German physicists Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker {{while working at}} the Compagnie des Freins et Signaux, a Westinghouse subsidiary located in Paris.

By June 1948, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, Mataré produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947.

Connecting the antenna directly to the spark gap produced only a heavily damped pulse train. There {{were only a few}} cycles before oscillations ceased. Braun's circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the energy encountered less losses swinging between coil and Leyden Jars. And by means of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was better matched to the generator. The resultant stronger and less bandwidth consuming signals bridged a much longer distance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{envelope}} detector {{is a very}} simple method of demodulation that {{does not require a}} coherent demodulator. It consists of an {{envelope detector}} that can be a rectifier (anything that will pass current in one direction only) or other non-linear component that enhances one half of the received signal over the other and a low-pass filter. The rectifier may be {{in the form of a}} single diode or may be more complex. Many natural substances exhibit this rectification behaviour, which is why it was the earliest modulation and demodulation technique used in radio. The filter is usually an RC low-pass type but the filter function can sometimes be achieved by relying on the limited frequency response of the circuitry following the <b>rectifier.</b> The <b>crystal</b> set exploits the simplicity of AM modulation to produce a receiver with very few parts, using the <b>crystal</b> as the <b>rectifier</b> and the limited frequency response of the headphones as the filter.|$|R
40|$|Ion {{channels}} {{control the}} movement of ions allowing specific ions to pass across biological membranes. This apparently simple process is used to control many essential physiological processes including the generation and propagation of neuronal excitation, regulation of insulin secretion, heartbeat and cell volume. Ion channels {{are able to do}} this by having multiple means of controlling the opening and closing of the ion conduction pathway. Several recent ion channel structures have shed light on the important process of ion selectivity as well as providing clues on channel gating. However, it is not yet completely clear how ion channels control the passage of ions across the membrane. My work is centred on understanding the gating process through structural analysis mostly using X-ray crystallography. In order to get to this point, crystals of the target ion channels need to be grown. This thesis presents four projects that were aimed at developing the techniques for over-expression, purification and crystallisation of ion channels or transporters making them amenable for structural studies. One of the difficult steps in the structure determination pathway is obtaining well-ordered crystals of the target membrane protein. Crystals of the EcCLC channel (now found to be a transporter) from E. coli were initially unacceptable for structure determination. It was shown that the process of dehydration improved the quality and diffraction limit of the EcCLC crystals. This simple method provides a possible procedure for improving the resolution limit of soluble and membrane protein <b>crystals.</b> Inward <b>rectifier</b> potassium channels (Kir channels) are a distinct subfamily that preferentially allows K + ions to move into the cell. Two bacterial homologues of Kir channels, KirBac 1. 1 and KirBac 3. 1, were crystallised in 3 -D and 2 -D forms, respectively. As the crystal structure revealed the full-length model provided an excellent starting point for understanding the gating process in these channels. The 3 -D structure of KirBac 1. 1 was captured in the closed state. This K + channel prevents ion movement by using hydrophobic residues to occlude the ion conduction pathway, altering the conformation of selectivity filter, misaligning the pore helices and decreasing the volume of the cavity. The 2 -D projection maps of KirBac 3. 1 were obtained in both closed and a potentially open conformations. These two maps provided evidence as to how the structural elements of the inner, outer, slide helices and the C-terminal domains change relative to one another as the channel moves between these two gating states. These motions were modelled as rigid body movements. They included bending of the inner helices, a rotation of the outer helices as they straighten in the membrane, translocation of the slide helices and C-terminal domain rotations. It is hoped that the information gained from these projects, the plasmids construction, the expression systems and the protocols that were established for crystallisation of the ion channels and transporter will provide guidelines for future structural studies of membrane proteins. </p...|$|R

Additionally {{to the massive}} pool of techniques {{that have already been}} developed within the machine learning and data processing fields, specific applications in bioinformatics have <b>crystal</b> <b>rectifier</b> to a wealth of freshly projected techniques. One of the objectives of coming up with feature choice learning algorithms is to get classifiers that rely on a little number of attributes and have verifiable future performance guarantees. There are a unit few, if any, approaches that with success address the two goals at the same time. In this article, we tend to build the interested reader awake to the possibilities of feature selection, providing a basic taxonomy of traditional feature selection techniques, and discussing the premise of conjunction of decision stumps in Occam’s Razor, Sample Compression, and PAC-Bayes learning setting for distinctive a little set of attributes that may be accustomed perform reliable classification tasks.

40|$|An {{investigation}} is undertaken into methods of fast modulation and detection of submillimetre radiation. Detection {{at room temperature}} was achieved with travelling wave antennae coupled to a <b>crystal</b> <b>rectifier.</b> Metal-oxide-metal and metal-oxide-semiconductor rectifying junctions were studied. Generation of submillimetre radiation was performed {{by means of a}} hydrogen cyanide laser, operating primarily at a wavelength of 337 mum. The investigation was motivated by a need for an increase in output power from the laser which requires a fast switch operative at submillimetre wavelengths. Evaluation of a Q-switching technique, utilizing the near coincidences between absorption features in various vapours and the 337 mum emission line of the HCN laser was made. Further investigations were carried out on the transient properties of the plasma that forms the active medium of a pulsed excited HCN laser. Shift of the resonance condition by means of an ancillary discharge is undertaken as a Q-switching technique. Magneto-optical modulation as an alternative switching technique was also studied. To this end, the temperature-dependence of the magneto optical constants of seven different rare-earth iron garnets were studied at a wavelength of 337 mum. The properties investigated include the Faraday rotation, absorption coefficient and the room temperature refractive index. The theory of the magneto-optical effects at microwave and optical frequencies is reviewed and extended into the sub-millimetre region. Effects of magnetic anisotropy are discussed. <p...|$|E
