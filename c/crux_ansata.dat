Good," [...] and at her bidding the priests took cold-chisels and hammers and roughly cut upon its surface {{the symbol of the}} looped cross--the <b>crux</b> <b>ansata.</b>|$|E
60|$|Next {{we found}} clean ducks among our store of spare clothes, for the Orofenans had brought these with our other possessions, {{and put them}} on, even adding silk cumberbunds and neckties. My tie I {{fastened}} with a pin that I had obtained in Egypt. It was a tiny gold statuette of very fine and early workmanship, of the god Osiris, wearing the crown of the Upper Land with the uraeus crest, and holding in his hands, which projected from the mummy wrappings, the emblems of the crook, the scourge and the <b>crux</b> <b>ansata,</b> or Sign of Life.|$|E
6000|$|CROSS, n. An ancient {{religious}} symbol erroneously {{supposed to}} owe its {{significance to the}} most solemn event {{in the history of}} Christianity, but really antedating it by thousands of years. By many it has been believed to be identical with the <b>crux</b> <b>ansata</b> of the ancient phallic worship, but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that, to the rites of primitive peoples. We have to-day the White Cross as a symbol of chastity, and the Red Cross as a badge of benevolent neutrality in war. Having in mind the former, the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape smites the lyre to the effect following: ...|$|E
60|$|I looked, {{and there}} {{high in the}} sky was the same curious glow which we had seen upon the {{previous}} night. There was more than this indeed, for beneath it, almost on a line with us and just above the crests of the intervening peaks, appeared a faint sheet of fire and revealed against it, something black. Whilst we watched, the fire widened, spread upwards and grew in power and intensity. Now against its flaming background the black object became clearly visible, and lo! it was the top of a soaring pillar surmounted by a loop. Yes, we could see its every outline. It was the <b>crux</b> <b>ansata,</b> the Symbol of Life itself.|$|E
60|$|At Dana Da's {{dictation}} the Englishman wrote {{nothing less}} than a formal challenge to the Old Man of the Mountains. It wound up: 'And if this Manifestation be from your hand, then let it go forward; but if it be from my hand, I will that the Sending shall cease in two days' time. In that day there shall be twelve kittens and thenceforward none at all. The people shall judge between us.' This was signed by Dana Da, who added pentacles and pentagrams, and a <b>crux</b> <b>ansata,</b> and half a dozen swastikas, and a Triple Tau to his name, just to show that he was all he laid claim to be.|$|E
60|$|The man was young, perhaps six {{or eight}} and twenty years of age. His dark skin, burnt almost to {{blackness}} by {{the heat of the}} sun, together with the fashion of his short, square-cut beard and of his garments, proclaimed him of Jewish or Egyptian blood, while the gold collar about his neck and the gold graven ring upon his hand showed that his rank was high. Indeed this wanderer was none other than the prince Aziel, nick-named the Ever-living, because of a curious mole upon his shoulder bearing a resemblance to the <b>crux</b> <b>ansata,</b> the symbol of life eternal among the Egyptians. By blood he was a grandson of Solomon, the mighty king of Israel, and born of a royal mother, a princess of Egypt.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{simplicity}} of the design (two intersecting lines), cross-shaped incisions make their appearance from deep prehistory; as petroglyphs in European [...] cult caves, dating {{back to the beginning of}} the Upper Paleolithic, and throughout prehistory to the Iron Age.Also of prehistoric age are numerous variants of the simple cross mark, including the crux gammata with curving or angular lines, and the Egyptian <b>crux</b> <b>ansata</b> with a loop.|$|E

S. edition was copyrighted and published in 1944 by Agora Publishing Company, New York, with a portrait frontispiece and an appendix of an interview with Wells recorded by John Rowland.

50|$|Cyäegha is an earth elemental, and {{is said to}} be {{a cousin}} of Nyogtha, another earth elemental. Cyäegha is also {{believed}} to be related to the Great Old One Othuyeg, because each appear alike and have similar habits. Like all the other Derlethian earth elementals, Cyäegha is adversely affected by the Ankh or <b>Crux</b> <b>Ansata,</b> the Vach-Viraj ritual, and the Tikkoun Elixir. References to Cyäegha are found in the Necronomicon, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten, the R'lyeh Text, the Cthäat Aquadingen, and a few more obscure grimoires.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emblem of}} the Theosophical Society {{includes}} seven symbols of particular importance to the Society's symbology: 1) the motto of the Society; 2) a serpent biting its tail (ouroboros); 3) the swastika; 4) the hexagram; 5) the cruxansata (Ankh); 6) the pin of the Society, composed of <b>crux</b> <b>ansata</b> and serpent entwined, forming together [...] "T.S.", and 7) Om (or aum). The seal of the Society contains all of these symbols, except aum, and thus contains, in symbolic form, the doctrines its members follow.|$|E
5000|$|The Tau and {{the circle}} {{together}} make {{one form of}} the Rosy Cross, the uniting of subject and object which is the Great Work, and which is symbolized sometimes as this cross and circle, sometimes as the Lingam-Yoni, sometimes as the Ankh or <b>Crux</b> <b>Ansata,</b> sometimes by the Spire and Nave of a church or temple, and sometimes as a marriage feast, mystic marriage, spiritual marriage, [...] "chymical nuptials," [...] and in a hundred other ways. Whatever the form chosen, it is {{the symbol of the}} Great Work.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{associated}} symbol is the ansated cross (ankh or <b>crux</b> <b>ansata)</b> used {{in ancient}} Egypt. It was often {{depicted in the}} hands of the goddess Sekhmet, and as a hieroglyphic sign of life or of the living. Egyptian Christians (Copts) adopted it as the emblem of the cross. In his book, The Worship of the Dead, Colonel J. Garnier wrote: [...] "The cross in the form of the 'Crux Ansata' ... was carried {{in the hands of}} the Egyptian priests and Pontiff kings as the symbol of their authority as priests of the Sun god and was called 'the Sign of Life'." ...|$|E
50|$|Things {{start to}} look bad for Peter when his {{laboratory}} is uncovered. He {{is committed to the}} Bethlem Royal Hospital. Before being brought away, he rushes to Helen's room, where she places a <b>crux</b> <b>ansata</b> to remind him of her love for him. While being taken away, lighting strikes again and Peter is back in present life. There, Forsyth tells him he has been acting like a mad man for the past seven weeks. Peter is shocked when he meets Forsyth's sister Martha (also Ann Blyth), who resembles Helen. He rushes out to the graveyard in front of his house, where he not only discovers Helen's grave, but that she died of grief shortly after he was taken away to the asylum.|$|E
5000|$|But cross's {{peculiar}} {{meaning in}} this Degree, is that given {{to it by}} the Ancient Egyptians. Thoth or Phtha is represented on the oldest monuments carrying in his hand the <b>Crux</b> <b>Ansata,</b> or Ankh, (a Tau cross, with a ring or circle over it). ... It was the hieroglyphic for life, and with a triangle prefixed meant life-giving. To us therefore it is the symbol of Life—of that life that emanated from the Deity, and of that Eternal Life for which we all hope; through our faith in God's infinite goodness.The ROSE, was anciently sacred to Aurora and the Sun. It {{is a symbol of}} Dawn, of the resurrection of Light and the renewal of life, and therefore of the dawn of the first day, and more particularly of the resurrection: and the Cross and Rose together are therefore hieroglyphically to be read, the Dawn of Eternal Life which all Nations have hoped for by the advent of a Redeemer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{triangle}} {{with its}} apex up {{was typical of}} the Trinity, figures that occur in several religions. In India, China and Japan, its three angles represent Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer or Re-generator. In ancient Egypt, it represented the deities Osiris, Isis and Horus. In Christianity, it represented the Holy Trinity. As a whole it stands for the elements of fire and spirit, composed of the three virtues (love, truth, and wisdom). The triangle with its apex downward symbolized the element of water, and typified the material world, or the three enemies of the soul: the world, the flesh, and the Devil, and the cardinal sins, envy, hatred and malice. Therefore, the two triangles interlaced represent the victory of spirit over matter. The early cultures that contributed to Western civilization believed that the Seal of Solomon was an all-powerful talisman and amulet, especially when used with either a Cross of Tau, the Hebrew Yodh, or the Egyptian <b>Crux</b> <b>Ansata</b> in the center.|$|E
