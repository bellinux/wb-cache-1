In 1981, Protecteur served in CARIBOPS81 {{off the coast of}} Puerto Rico, along with at least two Canadian destroyers. Protecteur and her CH-124 helicopters performed a nighttime rescue of the crew of a disabled Norwegian <b>chemical</b> <b>tanker</b> in June 1982. The Norwegian crew was forced to abandon their ship after a fire had broken out. For the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy, Protecteur hosted a dinner with the captains of 35 ships, including ships from Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States, as well as then Governor General Jeanne Sauvé and Prince Andrew.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} any charter party is the freight rate, or the price {{specified}} for carriage of cargo. [...] The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate. In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible {{to pay for all}} port costs and other voyage expenses. [...] Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in <b>chemical</b> <b>tanker</b> chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs and voyage expenses are generally paid by the charterer. Time charter arrangements specify a daily rate, and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the charterer.|$|E

2500|$|Operation Dawn of Gulf of Aden (...) was a naval {{operation}} by the Republic of Korea Navy against Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea. The {{operation was}} {{spurred by the}} pirates' seizure of the South Korean <b>chemical</b> <b>tanker</b> Samho Jewelry. In response, the South Korean government sent a destroyer and 30 naval commandos to retake the ship and rescue its crew. After trailing the tanker for several days and fighting a preliminary engagement that neutralized four of the pirates, the South Korean forces retook the ship by force on January 21, 2011 in a successful boarding action {{that resulted in the}} death of eight and the capture of five out of thirteen pirates.|$|E
2500|$|On January 15, 2011, the Norwegian-owned <b>chemical</b> <b>tanker</b> Samho Jewelry was sailing {{through the}} Arabian Sea from the United Arab Emirates to Sri Lanka {{when it was}} {{attacked}} {{by a group of}} Somali pirates [...] southeast of the port of Muscat, Oman. Tanker captain Seok Hae-gyun changed the ship's course to keep in international waters as long as possible. The pirates eventually seized the tanker and used it as a base from which to launch attacks on other ships. The South Korean operator of the vessel, the Samho Shipping Company, was facing huge losses because it was obligated to continue paying Norwegian investors under its charter even while the vessel was held by pirates. However, the Norwegian government had no military presence in the area at the time. Eight South Koreans, eleven Burmese, and two Indonesians were among the 21 crewmembers being held hostage.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, <b>chemical</b> <b>tankers</b> are {{transporting}} a {{wide variety}} of chemical products. These products have different characteristics, and some are toxic. In literature several studies suggest an increased incidence of various forms of cancer for crew members on tankers. Most of these studies are based on medical statistics, rather than on effective measurements on board. The aim {{of this study is to}} monitor the average concentrations of toxic vapours on board of <b>chemical</b> <b>tankers.</b> Therefore we went on board of two <b>chemical</b> <b>tankers</b> for a 14 -day trip and performed measurements during the normal operation of the vessel, in order to find out whether cargo vapours are traceable in the atmosphere in and around the vessel. The concentrations measured clearly show that there is a relationship between the cargoes transported and the concentration of the cargo vapour in the atmosphere in and around the vessel. The results further show an elevated concentration of the analyzed substances in the engine room and an important influence of the relative wind direction. Tank vents situated in the gas-safe zone influenced the results as well...|$|R
