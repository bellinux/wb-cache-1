5|$|The {{affected}} {{animals are}} mostly young Asian elephants {{that had been}} born in captivity, with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years (and three-quarters between one and eight years old). Some <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> affected newborns or adult elephants born in the wild (oldest aged 40 years), and three recorded <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> affected African elephants. The first documented fatal case for African elephants was Kijana, an eleven-month-old male in 1996. Since 2008, a number of <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> been attributed to EEHV1 among wild Asian elephants.|$|E

40|$|Clinical and imaging data of 4 {{cases of}} primary Sjögren's {{syndrome}} (pSS) combined with {{central nervous system}} (CNS) lesions were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical symptoms of 4 patients were as follows: 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> fever; 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> blurred vision; 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> lower extremity weakness; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> single lower limb weakness; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> unilateral limb weakness; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> hemisensory reduction; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> bilateral abducens paralysis; 3 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> peripheral neuropathy. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed increased CSF pressure (210 - 270 mm H 2 O) in 3 cases, increased number of leukocyte [(50 - 380) × 10 6 /L] in 3 cases, and increased protein (1. 30 - 2. 56 g/L) in 3 cases. Brain MRI showed multiple lesions in white matters. After high-dose steroid therapy, 3 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> good prognosis, and one had recurrent lower extremity weakness after 6 months. pSS combined with CNS lesions is rare. Lumbar puncture and brain MRI is important for diagnosis, and high-dose steroid therapy may have good therapeutic effect.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2015. 04. 014 </p...|$|R
30|$|Material and Methods 39 {{patients}} were identified. 13 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> abdominal scans, 11 vaginal, 7 had both modalities. 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> CT scans only and 11 had CT and ultrasound while 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> MRI. 26 laparoscopies were done and 14 laparotomies.Six of the laparotomies were performed for large cysts (> 10 cms) and 3 for suspected malignancy.|$|R
40|$|Objective: We had {{evaluated}} {{our experience}} {{in the treatment of}} Morrey Modified Masons type III and IV radial head fractures with radial head prosthesis. Materials and Methods: From April 2011 to September 2014, modular radial head prostheses were performed in thirty patients. There were twenty female and ten male with mean age of forty years. The follow-up was a mean of 25 months. Fractures of the radial head have been classified by Morrey Modified Masons classification. The indications for a radial head replacement were type III fractures in 24 cases, type IV fractures in 6 cases, and comminuted radial fracture associated with disruption of the medial collateral ligament in 3 cases. Patients were assessed postoperatively and on follow-up based on Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) Score. Results: By using the MEPI, out of thirty <b>cases,</b> twenty <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> excellent results, seven <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> good results, two <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> fair results, and one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> poor result. Twenty-eight <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> no complications, one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> infection, and one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> implant failure. Conclusion: Modular radial head prosthesis can be used successfully for treatment of the Morrey Modified Masons type III and IV radial head fractures...|$|R
5|$|A few ASD <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> {{been linked}} to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> been known to cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical {{trauma to the}} neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels.

5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} {{people have always}} been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Beginning work in 2011, the TIRC has {{referred}} 17 cases to {{the circuit court}} for judicial review for potential relief. Three convicts have been freed based on review of their cases. Individuals may initiate claims to the commission. As of April 2016, another 130 <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> been heard of torture that was not committed by Burge or his subordinates. The city and state are struggling {{to determine how to}} treat this high number of torture victims in a just way.

40|$|Fifty-two {{cases of}} nocturnal {{enuresis}} (37 males and 15 females) were clinically evaluated. A total of 19 cases {{were classified as}} poly-uric type (36. 5 %), 1 case was unskilled bladder type (2 %) and 32 cases were combined (poly-uric and unskilled bladder) types (61. 5 %). A total of 34 cases were treated; 14 cases (43. 8 %) received clomipramine hydrochloride, 13 cases (40. 6 %) received imipramine hydrochloride, and 5 cases (15. 6 %) received amitriptyline hydrochloride. Of the 52 cases studied, 35 cases (67. 3 %) had associated complications; 6 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> epilepsy (11 %), 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> spina bifida occulta (3 %), 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> obesity (3 %), 11 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> bronchial asthma (26 %), 6 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> allergic rhinitis (13 %), 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> atopic dermatitis (2 %), and 1 <b>case</b> each <b>had</b> febrile convulsion, cerebral palsy, acute glomerulonephritis, turner syndrome, congenital malformation syndrome and hepatitis C (2 %). There were 16 cases (30 %) without any complications. All 6 epilepsy cases were diagnosed as primary enuresis with a normal level of arginine vasopressoin (AVP), but 2 cases, antiepileptic drugs (sodium valproate, carbamazepine) increased enuresis.

5|$|<b>Cases</b> <b>have</b> been {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases {{provide evidence for}} its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has {{been recorded}} under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E
5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E

40|$|We report six {{patients}} with array deletions encompassing 12 q 14. Out {{of a total}} of 2538 array investigations carried out on children with developmental delay and dysmorphism in three diagnostic testing centres, six positive cases yielded a frequency of 1 in 423 for this deletion syndrome. The deleted region in each of the six cases overlaps significantly with previously reported cases with microdeletions of this region. The chromosomal range of the deletions extends from 12 q 13. 3 q 15. In the current study, we report overlapping deletions of variable extent and size but primarily comprising chromosomal bands 12 q 13. 3 q 14. 1. Four of the six deletions were confirmed as de novo events. Two <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> deletions that included HMGA 2, and both children had significant short stature. Neither <b>case</b> <b>had</b> osteopoikilosis despite both being deleted for LEMD 3. Four <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> deletions that ended proximal to HMGA 2 and all of these had much better growth. Five <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> congenital heart defects, including two with atrial septal defects, one each with pulmonary stenosis, sub-aortic stenosis and a patent ductus. Four <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> moderate delay, two had severe developmental delay and a further two had a diagnosis of autism.
