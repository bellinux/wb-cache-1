50|$|Heterodera carotae is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode {{commonly known}} as the carrot root nematode or <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode.</b> It is found in Europe, Cyprus and India and is considered an invasive species in the United States. It causes damage to carrot crops and is very specific in its choice of hosts, only infecting Daucus carota and Daucus pulcherrima.|$|E

40|$|Some factors {{interfering with}} plant {{protection}} from phytoparasitic nematodes are reviewed {{in the light}} of changes brought about by the global warming in action. The mechanisms mainly concern changes in temperature and water regimes. The effects of climate changes on the epidemiology and management of the main phytoparasitic species occurring in Mediterranean environments include the alteration of the reproductive cycles due to plants productivity, the geographic dispersion by more northern or higher altitude shifts, the spread of vectors. Other related indirect mechanisms are feedback effects due to the reactions of cultivated species or weeds, and those related to natural enemies. The potential management of some operational tools are briefly discussed, including the development and application of models and monitoring. An exemple of modeling changes induced by increasing temperatures on the <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> Heterodera carotae is briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|Brassicaceae Burnett (syn. Cruciferae A. L. de Jussieu) {{include many}} {{important}} economic plants used as edibile or ornamental. They are {{commonly known as}} the “mustard” plant family due to the sharp, potent flavour of their main metabolites, the glucosinolates (GLSs) which contain sulfur. Glucosinolates coexist in vivo with glycosylated thioglucosidases, myrosinase(s), responsible of their hydrolysis with the production of bioactive cognate isothiocyanates (ITC). GLSs and ITCs function as defence bioactive metabolites against plant pathogens, insects and herbivores. The present review paper focus on GLSs role as bionematicides. The current knowledge on the efficacy of these phytochemicals against the most common phytoparasitic nematodes affecting crops of agriculture importance such as tomato, potato and grapevine is reported. Data from our ongoing research on the in vitro biocidal activity of glucosinolate extracts, and their main components, against the virus-vector nematode Xiphinema index Thorne & Allen and the <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> Heterodera carotae Jones are also described...|$|E
40|$|Medicago sativa L., alfalfa, is {{the most}} known plant species within the Medicago genus. The plant has been {{extensively}} studied for its content of saponins, mainly consisting of triterpene glycosides of medicagenic acid, possessing several biological properties including a biocidal activity on different soil microorganisms. Phytoparasitic nematodes are responsible for heavy economic damages to numerous agricultural crops and, due to their large distribution, {{they are among the}} most difficult crop pests to control. Attention on environmental safety and human and animal health has led to the progressive dismission of many synthetic formulations for the control of those pests and to the search of alternative strategies, including the use of natural metabolites from plants. Saponins from M. sativa may be good candidates for natural nematicide formulations, as in our in vitro studies the saponin mixtures from M. sativa tissues have been found effective in vitro against the virus-vector nematode Xiphinema index, the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and the potato cyst parasite, Globodera rostochiensis. A structure-activity relationship among saponins and related prosapogenins and sapogenin, respectively, has also been analyzed. The nematicidal efficacy differed among the three assayed nematode species, G. rostochiensis being the most susceptible to the active compounds from alfalfa. The in vitro results were also confirmed by experiments in potting mixes infested by M. incognita or G. rostochiensis and amended with dry top and root material from M. sativa, and in field trials on M. incognita and <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> Heterodera carotae with M. sativa pelleted meal.

40|$|The effectivenes of {{chestnut}} tannin aqueous solutions {{was tested}} against the <b>carrot</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> Heterodera carotae {{in a field}} experiment at Zapponeta (province of Foggia) in Apulia region (Italy). A sandy soil infested by the cyst nematode was deeply ploughed, rotavated and subdivided in 2 m x 3 m plots distributed in a randomized block design with five replications per each treatment. Chestnut aquoeus solution treatments were: a) 25 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence, b) 25 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence and 30 days after carrot emergence, c) 45 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence, d) 45 g/m 2 in 4 l water/m 2 applied in pre-emergence and 30 days after carrot emergence. Untreated soil and and the nematicide fenamiphos (60 l c. p. /ha) were used as controls. At harvest, number and weight of marketable tap-roots from the central square metre of each plot were recorded. Soil samples, each a composite of 20 cores, were collected in the same central area of each plot. Cysts from a 100 g dried sub sample were extracted with a Fenwich can and crushed to count eggs and juveniles. All data were statistically analysed and means compared by LSD’s test. Treatments with tannin solutions at 45 g/m 2 applied in pre or in pre and post carrot emergence significantly increased carrot marketable yield in comparison to untreated control. All treatments significantly increased the average weight of carrots, {{with the exception of}} the lowest dose of tannin applied before emergence, in comparison to untreated control. No significant differences were observed in the number of cysts/ 100 g soil among the different treatments including the fenamiphos and the untreated controls. The final nematode population density observed in the untreated control was significantly higher than those observed in all other treatments in which no differences were observed. On the base of results, the use of tannin should be favourably considered for plant protection against phytoparasitic nematodes although some aspects remain to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|When {{nematodes}} invade {{and subsequently}} migrate within plant roots, they generate cell wall fragments (in {{the form of}} oligogalacturonides; OGs) that can act as damage-associated molecular patterns and activate host defence responses. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating damage responses in plant–nematode interactions remain unexplored. Here, we characterized {{the role of a}} group of cell wall receptor proteins in Arabidopsis, designated as polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs), during infection with the <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> Heterodera schachtii and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. PGIPs are encoded by a family of two genes in Arabidopsis, and are involved in the formation of active OG elicitors. Our results show that PGIP gene expression is strongly induced in response to <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> invasion of roots. Analyses of loss-of-function mutants and overexpression lines revealed that PGIP 1 expression attenuates infection of host roots by <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes,</b> but not root-knot nematodes. The PGIP 1 -mediated attenuation of <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> infection involves the activation of plant camalexin and indole-glucosinolate pathways.

40|$|In-vitro {{methods were}} {{developed}} to test fungi for production of metabolites affecting nematode egg hatch and mobility of second-stage juveniles. Separate assays were developed for two nematodes: root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) and soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> (Heterodera glycines). For egg hatch to be successfully assayed, eggs must first be surface-disinfested to avoid the confounding effects of incidental microbial growth facilitated by the fungal culture medium. Sodium hypochlorite was more effective than chlorhexidine diacetate or formaldehyde solutions at surface-disinfesting soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> eggs from greenhouse cultures. Subsequent rinsing with sodium thiosulfate to remove residual chlorine from disinfested eggs did not improve either soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> hatch or juvenile mobility.
