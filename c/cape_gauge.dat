25|$|In 1911, the Lüderitzbucht Eisenbahn (Lüderitzbucht Railway) placed two <b>Cape</b> <b>gauge</b> 0-6-0T {{locomotives}} {{in service}} as shunting engines. They were apparently {{no longer in}} service when all railways in the territory came under {{the administration of the}} South African Railways in 1922.|$|E
25|$|The {{line from}} Kimberley reached Bulawayo in 1897, and a {{connection}} to Salisbury was completed in 1902. By then Southern Rhodesia already had a rail outlet to the Mozambican port of Beira. This was completed by the Beira Railway Company, a subsidiary company of the BSAC, as a narrow gauge railway as far as Umtali in 1898. In the next year, a line from Salisbury to Umtali was completed which, like the Kimberley to Bulawayo line, was at the <b>Cape</b> <b>gauge</b> of 3 feet 6 inches. The Umtali to Beira section was widened to <b>Cape</b> <b>gauge</b> in 1899 and 1900. These lines were proposed before the economic potential of the Rhodesias was fully known, and {{in the hope that}} the expected gold discoveries would promote economic development. Rhodesia's gold deposits proved disappointing, and it was the coal of Wankie that first provided the traffic and revenue to fund railway construction to the north. After the discovery of its huge coal reserves, a branch to Wankie from the main line from Bulawayo (which had been extended to cross the Victoria Falls in 1902) was completed in 1903.|$|E
25|$|Coupling and {{uncoupling}} {{were done}} manually, which posed {{a high risk}} of serious injury or death to crew members, who had to go between moving vehicles to guide the link into the coupler pocket during coupling. Johnston couplers gradually began to be replaced on the South African Railways from 1927, but not on narrow gauge rolling stock. All new <b>Cape</b> <b>gauge</b> locomotives and rolling stock acquired from that year were equipped with AAR knuckle couplers. Conversion of all older rolling stock was to take several years and both coupler types could still be seen on some vehicles into the late 1950s. During the transition period, knuckle couplers on many locomotives had a horizontal gap and a vertical hole in the knuckle itself to accommodate, respectively, a link and a pin, to enable it to couple to vehicles which were still equipped with the older Johnston couplers.|$|E
5000|$|While the [...] broad <b>gauge</b> <b>Cape</b> Town-Wellington Railway {{was still}} being built, the {{independent}} Wynberg Railway Company was formed. It constructed a broad gauge line to Wynberg from a junction with the Wellington line at Salt River. Work commenced on 19 December 1862 and the line was completed and opened to traffic two years later to the day, on 19 December 1864. The company acquired one 2-4-0 side-tank locomotive from Robert Stephenson and Company and named it after Mr. Watson, the general manager. When the Cape Government Railways was established, this locomotive became its engine no. 12.|$|R
500|$|Lobengula's {{weakened}} Matabele kingdom uneasily coexisted with Rhodes's Company {{settlements in}} Mashonaland {{and north of}} the Zambezi for about another year. The king was angered {{by the lack of}} respect he perceived Company officials to have towards his authority, their insistence that his kingdom was separated from Company territory by a line between the Shashe and Hunyani Rivers, and their demands that he stop the traditional raids on Mashona villages by Matabele impis. After Matabele warriors began slaughtering Mashonas near Fort Victoria in July 1893, Jameson, who Rhodes had appointed Company administrator in Mashonaland, unsuccessfully tried to stop the violence through an indaba. Lobengula complained that the Chartered Company had [...] "come not only to dig the gold but to rob me of my people and country as well". Monitoring events from <b>Cape</b> Town, Rhodes <b>gauged</b> Jameson's readiness for war by telegraph: [...] "Read Luke 14:31". Jameson wired back: [...] "All right. Have read Luke 14:31".|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While the {{importance}} of promoting equity to achieve health is now recognised, the health gap continues to increase globally between and within countries. The description that follows looks at how the <b>Cape</b> Town Equity <b>Gauge</b> initiative, part of the Global Equity Gauge Alliance (GEGA) is endeavouring to tackle this problem. We give {{an overview of the}} first phase of our research in which we did an initial assessment of health status and the socio-economic determinants of health across the subdistrict health structures of Cape Town. We then describe two projects from the second phase of our research in which we move from research to action. The first project, the Equity Tools for Managers Project, engages with health managers to develop two tools to address inequity: an Equity Measurement Tool which quantifies inequity in health service provision in financial terms, and a Equity Resource Allocation Tool which advocates for and guides action to rectify inequity in health service provision. The second project, the Water and Sanitation Project, engages with community structures and other sectors {{to address the problem of}} diarrhoea in one of the poorest areas in Cape Town through the establishment of a community forum and a pilot study into the acceptability of dry sanitation toilets. Methods A participatory approach was adopted. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The first phase, the collection of measurements across the health subdistricts of Cape Town, used quantitative secondary data to demonstrate the inequities. In the Equity Tools for Managers Project further quantitative work was done, supplemented by qualitative policy analysis to study the constraints to implementing equity. The Water and Sanitation Project was primarily qualitative, using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. These were used to gain an understanding of the impact of the inequities, in this instance, inadequate sanitation provision. Results The studies both demonstrate the value of adopting the GEGA approach of research to action, adopting three pillars of assessment and monitoring; advocacy; and community empowerment. In the Equity Tools for Managers Project study, the participation of managers meant that their support for implementation was increased, although the failure to include nurses and communities in the study was noted as a limitation. The development of a community Water and Sanitation Forum to support the Project had some notable successes, but also experienced some difficulties due to lack of capacity in both the community and the municipality. Conclusion The two very different, but connected projects, demonstrate the value of adopting the GEGA approach, and {{the importance}} of involvement of all stakeholders at all stages. The studies also illustrate the potential of a research institution as informed 'outsiders', in influencing policy and practice. </p...|$|R

50|$|There was a {{brief period}} of 15 months when broad and <b>Cape</b> <b>gauge</b> rolling stock could be seen working in Durban side by side. Although the Resident Engineer of the new NGR had taken over the new <b>Cape</b> <b>Gauge</b> line between Point and Durban from the {{contractors}} in February 1878 and had used this track regularly for goods traffic since that date, the broad gauge between Point, Durban and Umgeni was only abandoned on Saturday 11 May of that year. The work in connection with regauging it to the new <b>Cape</b> <b>gauge</b> commenced immediately after the arrival of the last train on the Saturday evening and was completed late on Sunday night.
