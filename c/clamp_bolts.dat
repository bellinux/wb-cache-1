5000|$|Sockets are {{available}} in various depths or lengths, often divided by most manufacturers into two categories of [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "deep" [...] according to the ANSI or DIN standard they are made to and the tolerances allowed by those specifications for each length of socket. Because the standards allow for some flexibility in tolerances, {{it is common to}} see two manufacturers make deep sockets of the same size but with slightly different depths even though both meet the same specification. Standard length, otherwise known as [...] "shallow" [...] sockets, have a lower profile and allow a user to access nuts in narrow spaces. Deep sockets are useful for turning nuts onto bolts when the bolt extends upwards into the socket (as in the case of many bolted joints), a very typical example being exhaust <b>clamp</b> <b>bolts</b> on a car.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Despite {{being an}} {{important}} element to connect the major building materials in a steel bridge, bolt joints have not been sufficiently studied in terms of each defect generated in them. Among defects in bolt joints of steel bridges currently in public use, the most frequently occurring problem is the insufficient axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force. To measure sliding load caused by change in axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force, a test sample of H-beam applied with pure bending was created and static tests were administered. Based on the axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force of the test sample where the designed axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force is 100 %, tests were carried out with different axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> forces of 75 %, 50 % and 25 %.

40|$|Details of {{a series}} of three point flexure tests on 101. 6 × 101. 6 × 6. 4 mm Wide Flange (WF) -section, {{pultruded}} Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) beams are presented.

Mid-span deflections and beam end rotations were recorded in the tests. The observed deflections and end rotations are compared with semi-rigid shear deformable beam theory predictions. Reasons are given for the differences (not large in the majority of cases) between the observed deflections and end rotations and the theoretical predictions. It is shown that deflection reduction and load enhancement performance indices provide a better basis for comparison of the experimental results and the theoretical predictions.

40|$|The {{performance}} optimisation of overhead conductors {{depends on}} the systematic investigation of the fretting fatigue mechanisms in the conductor/clamping system. As a consequence, a fretting fatigue rig was designed and a limited range of fatigue tests was carried out at the middle high cycle fatigue regime in order to access an exploratory S-N curve for a Grosbeak conductor, which was mounted on a mono-articulated aluminium clamping system. Subsequent to these preliminary fatigue tests, {{the components of the}} conductor/clamping system, such as ACSR conductor, upper and lower <b>clamps,</b> <b>bolt</b> and nuts, were subjected to a failure analysis procedure in order to investigate the metallurgical free variables interfering on the fatigue test results, aiming at the optimisation of the testing reproducibility. The results indicated that the rupture of the planar fracture surfaces observed in the external At strands of the conductor tested under lower bending amplitude (0. 9 mm) occurred by fatigue cracking (I mm deep), followed by shear overload. The V-type fracture surfaces observed in some At strands of the conductor tested under higher bending amplitude (1. 3 mm) were also produced by fatigue cracking (approximately 400 mu m deep), followed by shear overload. Shear overload fracture (45 degrees fracture surface) was also observed on the remaining At wires of the conductor tested under higher bending amplitude (1. 3 mm). Additionally, the upper and lower Al-cast clamps presented microstructure-sensitive cracking, which was folowed by particle detachment and formation of abrasive debris on the clamp/conductor tribo-interface, promoting even further the fretting mechanism. The detrimental formation of abrasive debris might be inhibited by the selection of a more suitable class of as-cast At alloy for the production of clamps. Finally, the bolt/nut system showed intense degradation of the carbon steel nut (fabricated in ferritic-pearlitic carbon steel, featuring machined threads with 190 HV), with intense plastic deformation and loss of material. Proper selection of both the bolt and nut materials and the finishing processing might prevent the loss in the clamping pressure during the fretting testing. It is important to control the specification of these components (<b>clamps,</b> <b>bolt</b> and nuts) {{prior to the start of}} large scale fretting fatigue testing of the overhead conductors in order to increase the reproducibility of this assessment.

It is shown that under optimized operating {{conditions it is}} possible to obtain the electrical performances of fuel cells at about 1 [*]W[*]cm− 2. The further improvements can be achieved by means of mechanical effects. In particular, the influence of mechanical properties of seal joints and <b>clamping</b> <b>bolt</b> torques on the electrical performance is studied experimentally. It is demonstrated that rigid seal joints improve the electrical performance in comparison with the soft seal joints. Concerning the influence of the bolt torques, a certain optimal value is found for different types of MEA. The numerical modelling of mechanical stresses in running fuel cell is made. The developed model includes the main components of a real fuel cell (the membrane, the gas diffusion layers, the graphite plates, and the seal joints) and the clamping elements (the steel plates, the bolts, and the nuts). The operating conditions have been taken into account by imposing heat sources and humidity field. The results of modelling illustrate the main mechanical effects arising in the entire fuel cell.
