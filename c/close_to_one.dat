5|$|In Heian-era Japan, {{husbands and}} wives kept {{separate}} households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she was very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> sister who died in her twenties.|$|E

Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E

It's almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Between 31 March and 1 April 2012, Arjona toured Guatemala, {{his native}} country. The two concerts he {{presented}} in the Mateo Flores stadium were both sold out performances, becoming the first artist in Guatemalan history to achieve this feat. As of 16 April 2012, his Metamorfosis World Tour has reached more than 400,000 fans, from which about 160,000 were only from his Buenos Aires tour dates on 12–15 April. On 25 April, Arjona's show on Mendoza, Argentina accumulated an attendance of 24,000 people, breaking the record set by Luis Miguel 10 years prior, and thus becoming the highest-grossing artist ever on that province. Hours before his performance on Mendoza, the Malvinas Argentinas stadium in which the concert was held, a fire burned <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the entries of the complex.|$|E
5|$|Bramblestar's Storm, {{the seventh}} volume in the Super Edition arc, {{features}} Bramblestar, {{the leader of}} ThunderClan. The book takes place after the Clans' victory over the Dark Forest cats. This book was released on 26 August 2014. All Clans are struggling due to the lake flooding; however, ThunderClan and ShadowClan appear to be suffering most. Deaths of Clanmates leads to tension and grief between those in ThunderClan as they simultaneously also try to survive outside of their usual territory, having been displaced by the flooding. On a border patrol, Bramblestar encounters some housecats that are taken into the Clan until they can return home. Bramblestar becomes <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the housecats, Jessy, which upsets Bramblestar's deputy (and former mate) Squirrelflight causing many quarrels between them. Ultimately, two of the housecats, Minty and Jessy, decide to leave, leaving only Frankie (later named Stormpaw) with ThunderClan. Jessy leaves because she feels {{that it would be}} better if Bramblestar and herself do not become mates because Bramblestar’s heart belongs with Squirrelflight. In the short manga chapter included at the book's end, it is revealed that Squirrelflight is pregnant with Bramblestar's kits.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War I, as Romania {{remained}} a neutral country, Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers, and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, which he never returned. Caragiale's own Germanophile preferences and traditionalist conservatism had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread that he himself was a spy for the German Empire.|$|E

5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another.|$|E
5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, {{so most of the}} teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end of}} the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another in GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a nightmare {{of a girl}} dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, all of which come true. Depending on the player's choices, Makoto ends up getting <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the girls, and on April 5, the story branches into different routes focusing on one of them. In each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled {{back in time to}} April 1, retaining the memories of the previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an infinite loop, he vows to keep the girl alive and break free of the loop. He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking free of the loop and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, historians {{tended to}} think ancient Egypt {{was the site}} of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian {{paintings}} about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, contained the skeletons, laid <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat, rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the Fertile Crescent {{around the time of the}} development of agriculture, and then were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|With Antón {{focusing}} on the Vuelta a España, Sánchez led the squad sent to the Tour de France. Team manager Igor González de Galdeano said that a stage win was an important objective, having come very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> with Sánchez in the 2010 Tour de France, only to have him lose a two-up sprint to Andy Schleck. He also hoped Sánchez would finish in the top three. With the stage 2 team time trial presenting such a clear detriment to Sánchez' overall hopes, the team gathered for a special training session about two weeks prior to the Tour to focus solely on that discipline. Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Velasco, Urtasun, Izagirre, and Rubén and Alan Pérez were also named to the squad.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{have lower}} {{foraging}} efficiency compared to adults {{and in most}} feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend to stay <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend {{long periods of time}} away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rest}} of his army, Theophilos then marched to interpose himself between the Cilician Gates and Ancyra, camping on the north bank of the river Halys, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the major river crossings. Ashinas crossed the Cilician Gates on 19 June, and the caliph himself with his main army set out on the march two days later. The Arab advance was slow and cautious. Anxious to avoid an ambush and learn the emperor's whereabouts, Mu'tasim forbade Ashinas to advance too deeply into Cappadocia. Ashinas sent out many {{scouting}} detachments to take captives, and from them finally learned of Theophilos's presence at the Halys, where he awaited the Arab approach to give battle. At the same time, around mid-July, Theophilos learned of the arrival of Afshin's army, comprising some 30,000 men, at the plain of Dazimon. Leaving a part of his army under a relative to watch the crossings of the Halys, Theophilos immediately departed with most of his army, some 40,000 men according to Michael the Syrian, to confront the smaller Arab force. Mu'tasim learned of Theophilos's departure from captives and tried to warn Afshin, but the emperor was faster and met Afshin's army in the Battle of Anzen on the plain of Dazimon on 22 July. Despite initial success, the Byzantine army broke and scattered, while Theophilos with his guard were encircled and barely managed to break through and escape.|$|E
