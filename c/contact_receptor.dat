40|$|Based {{primarily}} upon {{observation and}} also various research studies, {{it has been}} proposed that autistic children manifest a <b>contact</b> <b>receptor</b> dominance. Further, it is proposed that the abnormal response to sensory stimuli frequently observed in autistic children represents an arrest in perceptual development. Following the sequence outlined by Jones and Hart (1968) where they present {{the idea that the}} normal child develops from near- through mid- to far-space, an attempt was made to help the autistic child move beyond near-space employing sensory discrimination training. To this purpose, four autistic and four normal boys were matched according to their mean ages. These were later further divided into three groups: two autistic treated, two autistic control, and four normal control subjects. The aim of the study was to: (a) test whether there was <b>contact</b> <b>receptor</b> dominance (touch) in the autistic boys and distance receptor dominance (vision and audition) in the normal subjects; (b) whether training of the autistic experimental group could facilitate a shift in receptor dominance towards that shown by the normal controls. In the 5 -month program, each of the two treated boys received 50 hours of training aimed towards development from contact to distance receptor usage. On both the pre- and posttests for all three groups an 18 trial training period preceded the 36 trials of bimodal sensory stimulation where two stimuli were presented simultaneously, left and right. Subjects were required to indicate from which side of the apparatus they perceived the auditory, visual, or tactile stimulus. Results of the study showed a <b>contact</b> <b>receptor</b> dominance in the autistic group and a distance receptor dominance in the normal group. After training, the results indicated a substantial change in the receptor dominance of the treated autistic boys. This change was: (a) consistent over both subjects, (b) greater than proportional fluctuations in both controls, and (c) in the hypothesized direction. It was concluded that the treated autistic boys showed less <b>contact</b> <b>receptor</b> dominance after training...|$|E

40|$|RPTP mu is a {{transmembrane protein}} {{tyrosine}} phosphatase with an adhesion molecule-like ectodomain. It {{has recently been}} shown that RPTP mu mediates homophilic interactions when expressed in insect cells. In this study, we have examined how RPTP mu may function as a cell <b>contact</b> <b>receptor</b> in mink lung epithelial cells, which express RPTPmu endogenously, {{as well as in}} transfected 3 T 3 cells. We find that RPTP mu has a relatively short half-life (3 - 4 hours) and undergoes posttranslational cleavage into two noncovalently associated subunits, with both cleaved and uncleaved molecules being present on the cell surface (roughly at a 1 : 1 ratio); shedding of the ectodomain subunit is observed in exponentially growing cells. Immunofluorescence analysis reveals that surface expression of RPTPmu is restricted to regions of tight cell-cell contact. RPTPmu surface expression increases significantly with increasing cell density. This density-induced upregulation of RPTP mu is independent of its catalytic activity and is also observed when transcription is driven by a constitutive promoter, indicating that modulation of RPTPmu surface expression occurs posttranscriptionally. Based on our results, we propose the following model of RPTP mu function: In the absence of cell-cell contact, newly synthesized RPTP mu molecules are rapidly cleared from the cell surface. Cell-cell contact causes RPTPmu to be trapped at the surface through homophilic binding, resulting in accumulation of RPTP mu at intercellular contact regions. This contact-induced clustering of RPTPmu may then lead to tyrosine dephosphorylation of intracellular substrates at cell-cell contacts...|$|E
50|$|After {{finishing}} the defensive state (which usually occurs after laying eggs if having previously copulated), the female enters {{the state of}} passive acceptance.

50|$|Ca2+ plays a {{significant}} role in transmitting signals at chemical synapses. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are located within the presynaptic terminal. When an action potential invades the presynaptic membrane, these channels open and Ca2+ enters. A higher concentration of Ca2+ enables synaptic vesicles to fuse to the presynaptic membrane and release their contents (neurotransmitters) into the synaptic cleft to ultimately <b>contact</b> <b>receptors</b> in the postsynaptic membrane. The amount of neurotransmitter released is correlated with the amount of Ca2+ influx. Therefore, short-term facilitation (STF) results from a build up of Ca2+ within the presynaptic terminal when action potentials propagate close together in time.|$|R

40|$|Antennal joint receptors of carpus-flagella joint (C - F joint) and f lagellar <b>contact</b> <b>receptor</b> of Ligia exotica were studied. Movable {{range of}} each antennal joint was obsered and nerve {{responses}} to C-F joint movement were recorded. The nerve responses to joint movement were classified to two type responses; one is tonic type response which continued firing as joint flexion, second is phasic type which showed fast adaptation. Almost of units (about 90 %) responded with increase of firing to flexion but few units showed inhibition. Firing {{rate of the}} tonic type response depended on angle of the joint and, to a sustained flexion, the firing remained with steady rate depending on the angle. These tonic type receptors coded a joint position information. The phasic type receptor responded to a joint movement and a single cell responded to movement of only one direction (unidirectional), a flexion or an extension. Notwithstanding of steady rate of angular movement, the firing frequency reached maximum immediately after the initiation of the movement and rapidly adapted. Firing rate of these phasic unit depend on movement velocity. This phasic type response coded a movement direction and a rate. Unnatural opposite directional movement or lateral movement of the C - F joint which an animal cannot move itself caused also nerve responses. So {{it is suggested that}} these receptors have a rule not only as proprioceptors but also as extraceptors. Contact atimuli to the surface of flagellum caused nerve responses which seemed to be originated from tricorn like sensilla, indicating important rule for searching...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen locomotory {{embryonic}} cells become stationary, they acquire new substratum-adhesion properties. In particular, {{the distribution}} of fibronectin receptors shifts from diffuse and highly mobile on the cell membrane to immobilized in close association with fibronectin molecules and cytoskeletal elements in focal <b>contacts.</b> <b>Receptor</b> phosphorylation has been proposed as a possible regulator {{of the interaction between}} the receptor and its intracellular and extracellular ligands. In the present study, we have compared the phosphorylation state of the fibronectin receptor in motile neural crest and somitic cells, in stationary somitic cells, and in Rous-sarcoma virus transformed-chick embryo fibroblasts, using immunoprecipitation following metabolic labeling. While no receptor phosphorylation was detected in motile embryonic cells, the beta subunit of the receptor was phosphorylated in stationary cells. This subunit was also highly phosphorylated in Rous-sarcoma virus-transformed chicken cells. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the fibronectin receptor cannot account for its distribution in the cell membrane and for the nature of the interactions between this receptor and its ligands in embryonic cells...|$|R

40|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{receptor}} binding by the paramyxovirus attachment proteins (HN, H, or G) triggers the fusion (F) protein to fuse with the plasma membrane for cell entry. H-proteins of the morbillivirus genus {{consist of a}} stalk ectodomain supporting a cuboidal head; physiological oligomers consist of non-covalent dimer-of-dimers. We report here the successful engineering of intermolecular disulfide bonds within the central region (residues 91 - 115) of the morbillivirus H-stalk; a sub-domain that also encompasses the putative F-contacting section (residues 111 - 118). Remarkably, several intersubunit crosslinks abrogated membrane fusion, but bioactivity was restored under reducing conditions. This phenotype extended equally to H proteins derived from virulent and attenuated morbillivirus strains and was independent {{of the nature of}} the <b>contacted</b> <b>receptor.</b> Our data reveal that the morbillivirus H-stalk domain is composed of four tightly-packed subunits. Upon receptor binding, these subunits structurally rearrange, possibly inducing conformational changes within the central region of the stalk, which, in turn, promote fusion. Given that the fundamental architecture appears conserved among paramyxovirus attachment protein stalk domains, we predict that these motions may act as a universal paramyxovirus F-triggering mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an {{endogenous}} antagonist of the melanocortin receptors MC 3 R and MC 4 R {{found in}} the hypothalamus and exhibits potent orexigenic activity. The cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of this protein, corresponding to AGRP(87 – 132), exhibits receptor binding affinity and antagonism equivalent {{to that of the}} full-length protein. We recently determined the NMR structure of AGRP(87 – 132) and demonstrated that a portion of the domain adopts the inhibitor cystine-knot fold. Remarkably, this is the first identification of a mammalian protein with this specific architecture. Further analysis of the structure suggests that melanocortin <b>receptor</b> <b>contacts</b> are made primarily by two loops presented within the cystine knot. 10 To test this hypothesis we designed a 34 -residue AGRP analogue corresponding to only the cystine knot. We found that this designed miniprotein folds to a homogeneous product, retains the desired cystine-knot architecture, functions as a potent antagonist, and maintains the melanocortin receptor pharmacological profile of AGRP(87 – 132). 26 The AGRP-like activity of this molecule supports the hypothesis that indeed the cystine-knot region possesses the melanocortin <b>receptor</b> <b>contacts.</b> Based on these design and structure studies, we propose that the N-terminal loop of AGRP(87 – 132) makes <b>contact</b> with a <b>receptor</b> exoloop and helps confer AGRP's selectivity for the central MCRs...|$|R

40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) {{gives rise}} to a {{neurologic}} disease known as HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Although the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown, the presence of a remarkably high frequency of Tax-specific, cytotoxic CD 8 T cells may suggest a role of these cells in the development of HAM/TSP. Antigen-mediated signaling in a CD 8 T-cell clone specific for the Tax(11 - 19) peptide of HTLV-I was studied using analog peptides substituted in their T-cell <b>receptor</b> <b>contact</b> residues defined by x-ray crystallographic data of the Tax(11 - 19) peptide in the groove of HLA-A 2. CD 8 T-cell stimulation with the wild-type peptide antigen led to activation of p 56 lck kinase activity, interleukin 2 secretion, cytotoxicity, and clonal expansion. A Tax analog peptide with an alanine substitution of the T-cell <b>receptor</b> <b>contact</b> residue tyrosine- 15 induced T-cell-mediated cytolysis without activation of interleukin 2 secretion or proliferation. Induction of p 56 lck kinase activity correlated with T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, whereas interleukin 2 secretion correlated with [3 H]thymidine incorporation and proliferation. Moreover, Tax peptide analogs that activated the tyrosine kinase activity of p 56 lck could induce unresponsiveness to secondary stimulation with the wild-type peptide. These observations show that a single amino acid substitution in a T-cell <b>receptor</b> <b>contact</b> residue of Tax can differentially signal CD 8 T cells and further demonstrate that primary activation has functional consequences for the secondary response of at least some Tax-specific CD 8 T cells to HTLV-I-infected target cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{the fifth}} {{edition of the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5) the female sexual pain {{disorders}} vaginismus and dyspareunia have been merged into the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPPD). The major reason behind this merging is that in clinical practice {{it always has been}} difficult to make a categorical distinction between dyspareunia and vaginismus. In this thesis the role of pelvic floor muscles in GPPPD is explored. Does the vaginal canal, in analogy to the anal and urethral canal, also has a sphincter mechanism? We hypothesize that vaginal reflexive contractions {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of GPPPD and postulate the genito-pelvic reflex hypothesis, i. e. in acute dyspareunia, primarily voluntary contractions or inadequate relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles predominate to guard against the pain due to vaginal trauma/infection and/or stress/anxiety. In chronic dyspareunia, these voluntary contractions induce increasingly (sub) mucosal vaginal damage: contact- and pain receptors become more sensitive. The increased sensitivity of the <b>contact</b> <b>receptors</b> induces powerful autonomic reflexive contractions. These autonomic contractions provoke vulvar pain, which causes overreactive pelvic floor muscles. In lifelong vaginismus, autonomic reflexive contractions of the pelvic floor muscles predominate the entire disease process. In the thesis it is also shown that a multidimensional is a precondition for an optimal treatment outcome. Transcutaneous electrical neuro stimulation (TENS) as additional treatment of this multidimensional approach is very effective in reducing vulvar pain and the need of an operative intervention. However, even after a ‘successful’ multidimensional treatment, coitus remained a sensitive act in the majority women...|$|R

Capsids of environmentally transmitted viruses are phenomenally durable. Fortuitous properties of the capsid include antigenicity, isoelectric point(s), sometimes hemagglutination, and perhaps others.

40|$|The {{reversible}} {{association of}} alpha and beta gamma subunits of GTP-binding proteins {{is important for}} signal transmission {{from a variety of}} cell-surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Previous work showed that 1, 6 -bis(maleimido) hexane, which crosslinks cysteine residues, crosslinks alpha o and alpha i- 1 to beta gamma. These crosslinks are likely to form through a conserved cysteine because 1, 6 -bis(maleimido) hexane can also crosslink alpha i- 2, alpha 1, alpha s and Drosophila alpha 1 to give products of the same apparent molecular weight as crosslinked alpha o beta gamma and alpha i- 1 beta gamma. These proteins have only two cysteines in common. Therefore, we mutated each of the two conserved cysteines of alpha o to alanines. Mutation of Cys 215 prevents crosslinking to beta gamma, but does not affect binding of guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate or the ability of the mutated alpha subunit to bind beta gamma. In models of the alpha subunit based on the crystal structure of p 21 ras, Cys 215 is located on the face opposite to the GTP-binding site and near an area that changes conformation depending on the nucleotide bound. This surface on the alpha subunit overlaps a putative effector binding region, raising important questions about the spatial organization of the proteins as they form ternary complexes. Mutation of Cys 325 has no effect on crosslinking but, surprisingly, decreases by a factor of 10 the affinity of the mutated protein for GDP, relative to wild type, without changing the affinity for guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. This mutation falls within a region thought to <b>contact</b> <b>receptors</b> and may represent a site through which receptors enhance the release of GDP...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: None of {{the current}} {{theories}} on fecal incontinence can explain fecal continence adequately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the mechanism controlling fecal continence. DESIGN: Anal electrosensitivity, anorectal pressures, and rectal pressure volumetry tests were performed in 17 controls before and after superficial local anal anesthesia and in 6 controls before and after spinal anesthesia. The same tests were performed in 1 patient before and after injected local anal anesthesia and in 3 patients with spinal cord lesions at levels Th 3 to L 3. RESULTS: After superficial local anal anesthesia, anal electrosensitivity decreased, but basal anal pressure remained unaltered. Squeeze pressure decreased and rectal filling sensation levels remained. Local anesthesia reduced anal pressure recorded in the distal anal canal during progressive rectal filling. This was also the case, albeit more explicit, after the local anal anesthetic was injected. After spinal anesthesia, the anal canal became insensitive to electric stimulation, but basal and squeeze pressure values decreased substantially, {{and the increase in}} anal pressure during the balloon-retaining test disappeared completely. In the patients with spinal cord lesions, the external sphincter could not be squeezed on command, but during the balloon-retaining test, the anal sphincter did squeeze autonomously at more than 300 mmHg. LIMITATIONS: These were partially experimental measurements. The relevance of the found model in the daily clinical practice will have to be studied in a following study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the component of fecal continence mediated by contraction of the external sphincter depends on a anal external sphincter continence reflex without involving the brain. Presumably, the afferent receptors of this reflex are <b>contact</b> <b>receptors</b> located superficially in the mucosa or submucosa of the distal anal canal. A nonfunctioning anal external sphincter continence reflex would, therefore, result in fecal incontinence (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Orientation of organelles inside T cells (TC) toward antigen-presenting cells (APC) {{ensures that}} the immune {{response}} is properly directed, but the orientation mechanisms remain largely unknown. Structural dynamics of TC are coupled to dynamics of T-cell receptor (TCR), which recognizes antigen on the APC surface. Engagement of the TCR triggers its internalization followed by delayed polarized recycling to the plasma membrane through the submembrane recycling compartment (RC), which organelle shares intracellular location with the TC effector apparatus. TCR engagement also triggers TC-APC interface expansion enabling further receptor engagement. To analyze the interplay of the cell-cell <b>contact</b> and <b>receptor</b> dynamics, we constructed a new numerical model. The new model displays the experimentally observed selective stabilization of the contact initiated next to the RC, and only transient formation of contact diametrically opposed to the RC. In the general case wherein the TC-APC contact is initiated in an arbitrary orientation to the RC, the modeling predicts that the <b>contact</b> dynamics and <b>receptor</b> recycling can interact, resulting effectively in migration of the contact to the TC surface domain adjacent to the submembrane RC. Using three-dimensional live-cell confocal microscopy, we obtain data consistent with this unexpected behavior. We conclude that a TC can stabilize its contact with an APC by aligning it with the polarized intracellular traffic of TCR. The results also suggest that the orientation of TC organelles, such as the RC and the effector apparatus, toward the APC can be achieved without any intracellular translocation of the organelles...|$|R

The structures show that the amino acids N-terminally flanking the basic cluster make specific <b>contacts</b> with the <b>receptor</b> that are distinct from the interactions between bipartite NLSs and Impalpha. We confirm the important role of flanking sequences using binding assays.

Within this binding domain, two hypervariable regions, VRA and VRB, have been proposed to be important for receptor recognition. In order to specifically locate residues that are important for the interaction with Pit 2, we generated a number of site-specific mutations in both VRA and VRB and analyzed the resulting envelope proteins when expressed on retroviral vectors. Concurrently, we substituted portions of the amphotropic SU with homologous regions from the polytropic MuLV envelope protein. The amphotropic SU was unaffected {{by most of the}} point mutations we introduced. In addition, the deletion of eight residues in a region of VRA that was previously suggested to be essential for Pit 2 utilization only decreased titer on NIH 3 T 3 cells by 1 order of magnitude.

We propose that hyaluronan cross-linking is part of a protective mechanism, promoting adhesion of leukocytes to the hyaluronan complexes rather than enabling <b>contact</b> with inflammation-promoting <b>receptors</b> on the underlying tissues. Leukocytes are thus maintained in a nonactivated state by appropriate receptor clustering or receptor co-engagement. Additionally, hyaluronan network...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{anal fissure}} is a painful {{disorder}} caused by linear ulcers in the distal anal mucosa. Even though it counts {{as one of}} the most common benign anorectal disorders, its precise etiology and pathophysiology remains unclear. Current thinking is that anal fissures are caused by anal trauma and pain, which leads to internal anal sphincter hypertonia. Increased anal basal pressure leads to diminished anodermal blood flow and local ischemia, which delays healing and leads to chronic anal fissure. The current treatment of choice for chronic anal fissure is either lateral internal sphincterotomy or botulinum toxin injections. In contrast to current thinking, we hypothesize that the external, rather than the internal, anal sphincter is responsible for increased anal basal pressure in patients suffering from chronic anal fissure. We think that damage to the anal mucosa leads to hypersensitivity of the <b>contact</b> <b>receptors</b> of the anal external sphincter continence reflex, resulting in overreaction of the reflex. Overreaction causes spasm of the external anal sphincter. This in turn leads to increased anal basal pressure, diminished anodermal blood flow, and ischemia. Ischemia, finally, prevents the anal fissure from healing. Our hypothesis is supported by two findings. The first concerned a chronic anal fissure patient with increased anal basal pressure (170 mmHg) who had undergone lateral sphincterotomy. Directly after the operation, while the submucosal anesthetic was still active, basal anal pressure decreased to 80 mmHg. Seven hours after the operation, when the anesthetic had completely worn off, basal anal pressure increased again to 125 mmHg, even though the internal anal sphincter could no longer be responsible for the increase. Second, in contrast to previous studies, recent studies demonstrated that botulinum toxin influences external anal sphincter activity and, because it is a striated muscle relaxant, it seems reasonable to presume that it affects the striated external anal sphincter, rather than the smooth internal anal sphincter. If our hypothesis is proved correct, the treatment option of lateral internal sphincterotomy should be abandoned in patients suffering from chronic anal fissures, since it fails to eliminate the cause of high anal basal pressure. Additionally, lateral internal sphincterotomy may cause damage to the anal external sphincter continence reflex, resulting in fecal incontinence. Instead, higher doses of botulinum toxin should be administered to those patients suffering from chronic anal fissure who appeared unresponsive to lower doses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|The {{sense of}} taste {{is based on the}} {{detection}} of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have taste buds, which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells. Afferent nerves make <b>contact</b> with the <b>receptor</b> cells {{at the base of the}} taste bud. A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds. Fungiform papillae are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The salivary glands are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.|$|R
