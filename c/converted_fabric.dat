40|$|Abstract: Blend yarns spun from {{different}} blend ratio (70 / 30, 50 / 50, 30 / 70, 10 / 90) flax/cotton and 100 % cotton were <b>converted</b> into <b>fabrics</b> through {{the integration of}} warp and weft yarns. The blend yarns were used as weft in the fabric construction using plain weave pattern. The properties of the produced blended fabrics were studied. The results show useful indications of the differences that exist in their physical and mechanical properties such as the fabric tensile strength, tearing strength, abrasion resistance, crease recovery, fabric drape, fabric thickness, fabric crimp and fabric sett. From the study {{it was discovered that}} as the flax content in the blend is increased, both tensile, tearing, abrasion resistance, fabric and crimp reduces...|$|R
5000|$|The {{designers}} {{are given the}} challenge to create a textile design based on a profound moment or time in their lives. Their design will be <b>converted</b> into <b>fabric</b> that the designers have to use to make a garment of their choosing. The challenge is interrupted when the designers' loved ones make a surprise visit and work is suspended {{for the rest of}} the day. Emotions are high for most contestants after their family visits, particularly Valerie and Mondo. Seeing her mother distracted Valerie {{for the rest of the}} challenge, and her lack of inspiration and innovation landed her in the bottom. The episode is best remembered for Mondo as he struggles with a secret he has been keeping for ten years—that he is HIV positive—which he incorporates into his design and reveals during the runway show.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a physically-based technique for producing draping simulations {{of a variety}} of woven fabrics. Our approach employs an interacting-particle model which is based on the microstructure of woven cloth, rather than utilizing a continuum approximation. Empirical data from a fabric testing device is used to tune energy functions within the model. We describe the model, how we <b>convert</b> the <b>fabric</b> test data to energy functions, and two experiments conducted to evaluate the approach. The first experiment produces non-linear mechanical data from the model. The second experiment compares photographs of three different types of draping cloth with visualizations of simulation results. The experiments show that we are able to reliably recover quantitative mechanical information from the model, and to reproduce the unique largescale draping characteristics of a range of fabric types. iii 1 Introduction The drape of woven materials has intrigued humans for centuries. This is evident in [...] ...|$|R

[...] It was closed during the Armenian Genocide in 1915-1916, and was returned to the local Armenian community in 1960, although due to emigration in the 1970s and 1980s the local Armenian community was much diminished. According to some art historians, the church is the largest in the Middle East. The complex sprawls over 3,200 square meters and includes priests’ houses, chapels and a school. The church was seized by the Imperial German Army in 1913 and served as their local headquarters during World War I until 1918, when it was <b>converted</b> into a <b>fabric</b> warehouse.|$|R

The basic raw materials are (i) Filament yarns of Nylon 6. Nylon 66. Polyester and Lycra: (ii) Dyes and Chemicals. The yarns arc <b>converted</b> to narrow <b>fabrics</b> as per buyers' requirements by weaving or knitting machines and dyed and finished to match buyers' swatches using imported dyes and chemicals. To match the colour shade of the buyer's swatch. a computerised colour matching package namely "Data Color" is used to obtain few closely matching recipes. Using these recipes the respective fabrics are dyed and finished in laboratory scale equipment. These dyed sample swatches are sent for buyer's approval and the bulk is dyed using the buyer approved recipe...|$|R
40|$|The {{additives}} and contaminants which {{occur in}} textile fibers vary widely, {{depending on the}} type of fiber and the pretreatment which it has received. Synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester contain trace amounts of contaminants such as catalysts and catalyst deactivators which remain after the synthesis of the basic polymers. In addition, there are frequently a number of materials which are added to perform specific functions in almost all man-made fibers. Examples of these would include traces of metals or metal salts used as tracers for identification of specific lots of fiber, TiO 2 or similar materials added as delustrants, and a host of organic species added for such special purposes as antistatic agents or flame retardants. There may also be considerable quantities of residual monomer or small oligomers dissolved in the polymer matrix. The situation becomes even more complex after the fibers are <b>converted</b> into <b>fabric</b> form. Numerous materials are applied at various stages of fabric preparation to act as lubricants, sizing agents, antistats, bleaches, and wetting agents to facilitate the processing, but these are normally removed before the fabric reaches the cutters of the ultimate consumers and therefore usually do not constitute potential hazards. However, there are many other chemical agents which are frequently added during the later stages of fabric preparation and which are not designed to be removed. Aside from dyes and printing pigments, the most common additive for apparel fabrics is a durable press treatment. This generally involves the use of materials capable of crosslinking cellulosics by reacting through such functions as N-methylolated amides or related compounds such as ureas and carbamates. These materials pose some potential hazards due to both the nitrogenous bases and the formaldehyde which they usually release. There is usually also some residual catalyst in fabrics which have received such treatments. Other types of chemical treatments which are often applied to fabrics to achieve special effects include flame retardants, soil release agents, antistatic agents, softeners, water and/or oil repellents, ultraviolet absorbers, bacteriostats, and fungistats...|$|R
5000|$|Sambalpuri fabrics {{reflect an}} {{original}} style of craft known as Baandha. Traditionally, craftsmen created Baandhas {{with images of}} flora or fauna or with geometrical patterns. More recently, new types of Baandha depicting portrait, landscape and flower pods are being designed.Baandha fabric is created using a tie-dye technique. The yarns are tied according to the desired patterns to prevent absorption of dyes, and then dyed. The yarns or set of yarns so produced is called 'Baandha'. The unique feature of this form of designing is that the designs are reflected almost identically on both side of the fabric.Once the frabic is dyed it can never be belached in to other colour. This versatile technique enables a craftsman to weave colourful designs, patterns and images into a fabric capable of inspiring a thought or conveying a message. Thus Baandha {{can be defined as}} [...] "A length of systematically arranged yarn, dyed according to a preconceived design in such a manner so as to enable a weaver to portray the design when the yarn is <b>converted</b> to a <b>fabric</b> through the process of weaving". It is believed that this art migrated to Western Odisha along with the Bhulia community who fled Northern India in the year 1192 AD {{after the fall of the}} Chouhan empire at the hands of the Mughals. Since then and up to the year 1925 it flourished in Western Odisha in a limited number of designs and in vegetable colours and consisted mostly of saris used by the womenfolk of the Odisha. These saris were known as 'Bhulia-Kapta'. The demand was limited, distress sale was common and the craftsmen lived in penury.|$|R
40|$|The {{buildings}} of the Great Wardrobe are identifiable on the Agas map of 1561 - 70. They were located within the ward of Baynard's Castle and the parish of St Andrew's by the castle. The plot fronted onto Carter Lane, to the north, St Andrew's to the south, Puddle Dock hill {{to the west and}} Addle Hill to the east. The Great Wardrobe was attached to the royal household and a substantial number of the accounts and warrants subsidiary to the accounts have survived. Most of the accounts are in Latin but by Henry VII’s reign, the first accounts in English appear. The format of the accounts also changed under the first Tudor as the clerks started to record information about who received livery by the name of the recipient rather than listing the suppliers of cloth and furs. The early history of the Great Wardrobe was presented by T. F. Tout in the fourth volume of his definitive work Chapters in the Administrative History of Medieval England, (Manchester, 1928). Tout noted that the fourteenth century Great Wardrobe had five key functions: acquiring raw materials, <b>converting</b> the <b>fabric</b> and fur into clothes, storing of raw materials, distributing the completed garments and accounting for the money received and spent by the keeper. Much less has been written on the Great Wardrobe under the first two Tudor king’s and this volume will demonstrate that the basic function of the Great Wardrobe in the sixteenth century remained unchanged. However, the book will also offer far more. The Great Wardrobe employed a range of craftsmen who lived and worked in the city. The holders of the key posts, such as the king’s tailor and the king’s skinner, were often leading members of their respective livery companies and they were at the centre of a network of other tailors, embroiderers, skinners and tapestry weavers who were employed on a more adhoc basis. The accounts will be used to explore the range of garments were available in Tudor London and the spectrum of techniques that the king’s artificers used to create clothes for the king and his household. They record the charges made for making different garments. The accounts also make it clear that while bespoke clothes were the norm for the king, some ready-made items such as footwear, hats and hose were bought for some members of the household such as the officers of the hunts. The evidence from the accounts will be set in context using material from other sources such as the Book of Rates. The Great Wardrobe bought fabric, furs, passementerie and accessories from a network of suppliers. London was the focal point for this group of suppliers and most of them were Londoners. In addition there was a small group of Italian merchants who supplied a small range of very expensive silks. The accounts provide a view of the range of textiles that were for sale in London, in terms of weave, quality, cost and colour. For those studying the court, the Great Wardrobe accounts provide insights into who received livery from the king, as members of the king’s court, his household and elements of his government. Many of these individuals lived in London or at Westminster and royal pageantry ensured that they would have been seen wearing their livery in and around London. Finally, the Great Wardrobe also derived part of its income from the land and property that it owned in and around the streets where the Wardrobe was based. <br/...|$|R
