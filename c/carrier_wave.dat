5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} for the diode was the {{demodulation}} of amplitude modulated (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio <b>carrier</b> <b>wave,</b> whose amplitude or envelope {{is proportional to the}} original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) rectifies the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave.</b> The audio is then extracted from the rectified <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> using a simple filter and fed into an audio amplifier or transducer, which generates sound waves.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the {{modulated}} signal has three components: the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> c(t) which is unchanged, and two pure sine waves (known as sidebands) with frequencies slightly {{above and below}} the carrier frequency fc.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong invented his {{receiver}} as a {{means of}} overcoming the deficiencies of early vacuum tube triodes used as high-frequency amplifiers in radio direction finding equipment. Unlike simple radio communication, which only needs to make transmitted signals audible, direction-finders measure the received signal strength, which necessitates linear amplification of the actual <b>carrier</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ionospheric {{delay of}} a {{microwave}} signal {{depends on its}} frequency. It arises from ionized atmosphere (see Total electron content). This phenomenon is known as dispersion and can be calculated from measurements of delays for two or more frequency bands, allowing delays at other frequencies to be estimated. Some military and expensive survey-grade civilian receivers calculate atmospheric dispersion from the different delays in the L1 and L2 frequencies, and apply a more precise correction. This {{can be done in}} civilian receivers without decrypting the P(Y) signal carried on L2, by tracking the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> instead of the modulated code. To facilitate this on lower cost receivers, a new civilian code signal on L2, called L2C, was added to the Block IIR-M satellites, which was first launched in 2005. It allows a direct comparison of the L1 and L2 signals using the coded signal instead of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Longuet-Higgins, {{by means}} of {{numerical}} modelling of fully non-linear waves and modulations (propagating in the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> direction), presented {{a detailed analysis of}} the region of instability in deep water. In Longuet-Higgins studies of two-dimensional wave motion, as well as the subsequent studies of three-dimensional modulations by McLean et al., new types of instabilities were found – these are associated with resonant wave interactions between five (or more) wave components.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of an {{acoustic}} parametric array as a means for microbubble excitation. The excitation wave is generated during propagation in a nonlinear medium of two high-frequency <b>carrier</b> <b>waves,</b> whereby the frequency of the excitation wave is the difference frequency of the <b>carrier</b> <b>waves.</b> <b>Carrier</b> <b>waves</b> of around 10 and 25 MHz are used to generate low-frequency waves between 0. 5 and 3. 5 MHz at amplitudes in the range of 25 to 80 kPa in water. We demonstrate with high-speed camera observations {{that it is possible to}} induce microbubble oscillations with the low frequency signal arising from the nonlinear propagation process. As an application, we determined the resonance frequency of Definity contrast agent microbubbles with radius ranging from 1. 5 to 5 μm by sweeping the difference frequency in the range from 0. 5 to 3. 5 MHz. ...|$|R

25|$|In telecommunications, {{frequency}} modulation (FM) conveys information over a <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> by varying its frequency. While {{working in the}} basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong invented wide-band {{frequency modulation}} radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied {{the frequency of the}} wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.|$|E

25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} work {{by mixing}} a radio frequency (RF) signal {{of a specific}} frequency, the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave,</b> with the signal to be broadcast. The result {{is a set of}} frequencies with a strong peak signal at the carrier frequency, and smaller signals from the carrier frequency plus the maximum frequency of the signal, and the carrier frequency minus the maximum frequency of the signal. That is, the resulting signal has a spectrum with twice the bandwidth of the original input signal. In conventional AM radio, this signal is then sent to the radio frequency amplifier, and then to the broadcast antenna. Due {{to the nature of the}} amplification process, the quality of the resulting signal can be defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum signal energy. Normally the maximum signal energy will be the carrier itself, perhaps twice as powerful as the mixed signals.|$|E

500|$|Modulation {{can also}} be used to {{transmit}} the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the [...] "carrier wave") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [...] An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96MHz <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel [...] "96FM").

2500|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} (AM) is a {{modulation technique}} used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio <b>carrier</b> <b>wave.</b> In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is varied {{in proportion to}} the waveform being transmitted. [...] That waveform may, for instance, correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a loudspeaker, or the light intensity of television pixels.

[...] The audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> and determines the envelope of the waveform. In the frequency domain, amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and two adjacent sidebands. Each sideband is equal in bandwidth {{to that of the}} modulating signal, and is a mirror image of the other.
