40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{presents a}} basic introduction to DNA microarrays as employed for gene expression analysis, approaching the subject from a chemometrics perspective. The {{emphasis is on}} describing {{the nature of the}} measurement process, from the platforms used to a few of the standard higher-level data analysis tools employed. Topics include experimental design, detection, image processing, measurement errors, ratio calculation, background correction, normalization, and higher-level data processing. The objective is to present the <b>chemometrician</b> with as clear a picture as possible of an evolving technology so that the strengths and limitations of DNA microarrays are appreciated. Although the focus is primarily on spotted, two-color microarrays, a signi 01 cant discussion of single-channel, lithographic arrays is also included. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|To {{shed light}} on the {{specific}} contribution of HDA 101 in modulating metabolic pathways in the maize seed, changes in the metabolic profiles of kernels obtained from hda 101 mutant plants have been investigated by a metabonomic approach. Dynamic properties of chromatin folding can be mediated by enzymes that modify DNA and histones. The enzymes responsible for the steady-state of histone acetylation are histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDA). Therefore, it is interesting to evaluate the effects of up- and down-regulation of a Rpd- 3 type HDA on the development of maize seeds in terms of metabolic changes. This has been reached by analysing nuclear magnetic resonance spectra by different <b>chemometrician</b> approaches, such as Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structure-Discriminant Analysis, Parallel Factors Analysis, and Multi-way Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (N-PLS-DA). In particular, the latter approaches were chosen because they explicitly take time into account, organizing data into a set of slices that refer to different steps of the developing process. The results show the good discriminating capabilities of the N-PLS-DA approach, even if the number of samples ought be increased to obtain better predictive capabilities. However, using this approach, it was possible to show differences in the accumulation of metabolites during development and to highlight the changes occuring in the modified seeds. In particular, the results confirm the role of this gene in cell cycle control...|$|E

Classical pattern recognition techniques, as principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, have been applied {{in order to identify}} fingerprints of industrial sources and to highlight origin of unknown environmental samples.

40|$|Multiple {{regression}} with correlated {{predictor variables}} {{is relevant to}} {{a broad range of}} problems in the physical, chemical, and engineering sciences. <b>Chemometricians,</b> in particular, have made heavy use of principal components regression and related procedures for predicting a response variable from a large number of highly correlated predictors. In this paper we develop a general theory that guides us in choosing principal components that yield very good estimates of regression coefficients. Our numerical results suggest that the theory also can be used to improve partial least squares regression estimators and regression estimators based on rotated principal components.

40|$|Since MATLAB is {{very popular}} in {{industry}} and academia, and is frequently used by <b>chemometricians,</b> statisticians, chemists, and engineers, we introduce a MATLAB library of robust statistical methods. Those methods were developed because their classical alternatives produce unreliable results when the data set contains outlying observations. Our toolbox currently contains implementations of robust methods for location and scale estimation, covariance estimation (FAST-MCD), regression (FAST-LTS, MCD-regression), principal component analysis (RAPCA, ROBPCA), principal component regression (RPCR), partial least squares (RSIMPLS) and classification (RDA). Only {{a few of these}} methods will be highlighted in this paper. The toolbox also provides many graphical tools to detect and classify the outliers. The use of these features will be explained and demonstrated through the analysis of some real data sets. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} {{interest of consumers}} for safety, authenticity and quality of food commodities has driven the attention towards the analytical techniques used for analyzing these commodities. In recent years, rapid and reliable sensor, spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques have emerged that, together with multivariate and multiway chemometrics, have improved the whole control process by reducing the time of analysis and providing more informative results. In this progression of more and better information, the combination (fusion) of outputs of different instrumental techniques {{has emerged as a}} means for increasing the reliability of classification or prediction of foodstuff specifications as compared to using a single analytical technique. Although promising results have been obtained in food and beverage authentication and quality assessment, the combination of data from several techniques is not straightforward and represents an important challenge for <b>chemometricians.</b> This review provides a general overview of data fusion strategies that have been used in the field of food and beverage authentication and quality assessment...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire to}} use the tools and {{concepts}} of chemometrics when studying problems in the life sciences, especially biology and medicine, has prompted <b>chemometricians</b> to shift their focus away from their field‘s traditional emphasis on model predictivity and towards the more contemporary objective of optimizing information exchange via model interpretation. The complex data structures that are captured by modern advanced analytical instruments open up new possibilities for extracting information from complex data sets. This in turn imposes higher demands {{on the quality of}} data and the modeling techniques used. The introduction of the concept of orthogonal variation in the late 1990 ‘s led to a shift of focus within chemometrics; the information gained from analysis of orthogonal structures complements that obtained from the predictive structures that were the discipline‘s previous focus. OPLS, which was introduced in the beginning of 2000 ‘s, refined this view by formalizing the model structure and the separation of orthogonal variations. Orthogonal variation stems from experimental/analytical issues such as time trends, process drift, storage, sample handling, and instrumental differences, or from inherent properties of the sample such as age, gender, genetics, and environmental influence. The usefulness and versatility of OPLS has been demonstrated in over 500 citations, mainly in the fields of metabolomics and transcriptomics but also in NIR, UV and FTIR spectroscopy. In all cases, the predictive precision of OPLS is identical to that of PLS, but OPLS is superior {{when it comes to the}} interpretation of both predictive and orthogonal variation. Thus, OPLS models the same data structures but provides increased scope for interpretation, making it more suitable for contemporary applications in the life sciences. This thesis discusses four different research projects, including analyses of NIR, FTIR and NMR spectroscopic data. The discussion includes comparisons of OPLS and PLS models of complex datasets in which experimental variation conceals and confounds relevant information. The PLS and OPLS methods are discussed in detail. In addition, the thesis describes new OPLS-based methods developed to accommodate hyperspectral images for supervised modeling. Proper handling of orthogonal structures revealed the weaknesses in the analytical chains examined. In all of the studies described, the orthogonal structures were used to validate the quality of the generated models as well as gaining new knowledge. These aspects are crucial in order to enhance the information exchange from both past and future studies...|$|R
40|$|Signals are {{all around}} us! Electromagnetic {{broadcasts}} permeating the air, stock market ticker-tape on the floor, Voyager space probe emissions streaming into the universe, and electrical pulses through human nerves – all are different types of signals. Signals are broadly defined as a sequence of measurements that can either be continuous or discrete. Often, sequences are captured at varying intervals in time, frequency, wave numbers, or distance. (While introducing ideas about wavelets {{and how they can}} be applied in chemical settings, for simplicity and generality let us consider a signal to be a function of time.) A signal of particular interest is the absorption or reflection of electromagnetic radiation measured in intervals of wavelength, as this signal is characteristic of the chemical and physical composition of the substance being measured. Another property of signals is if two or more signals overlap, then the resulting overlap is also a signal. This signal addition is usually an undesirable property as it is usually impossible to measure the individual signals independently of each other. A classic example is when a sample contains two molecules having similar absorbance signals – absorption signals with overlapping wavelength regions. When the absorption signal of the sample is measured, {{a combination of the two}} absorption signals is recorded simultaneously. The addition of signals poses a problem when information regarding only one of the two molecules is sought. Sequential measurement and signal addition are essential principles for the analysis of signals. First, the sequential principle gives a signal a quintessential ‘shape’ and, second, signal addition distorts a sought-after signal/shape by the presence of other signals. Ideally, any method for the analysis of signals should aim at extracting the components of a signal such as expressing the signal as a series of shapes. Wavelet analysis incorporates the principles of both signal addition and sequential shape representation, making wavelets a suitable method for signal analysis. Wavelet analysis represents signals by a series of orthogonal basis functions. In Fourier analysis, the basis function is the sinusoidal function, whereas in wavelet analysis, the basis function is largely undefined with the exception that the basis function is localized and orthogonal onto itself upon translation or dilation. This flexibility of wavelet basis functions enables a wide range of signal shapes to be investigated within the context of signal addition. There exist a large suite of functions that fit the wavelet description such as the derivatives of the Gaussian, and because of the popularity of wavelets in the 1990 s and 2000 s, there exist a large variety of standard wavelet basis to choose from. Some of these basis functions have been given names such as Daubechies wavelets, Coiflets, the Haar wavelet, and the Mexican wavelet. The choice of the wavelet basis is an important issue because the basis function is typically meant to mimic localized information embedded in the signal. The <b>chemometricians</b> can investigate the performance of some of the ‘famous’ wavelet basis functions, or they can design their own wavelet basis functions. The latter allows wavelet basis functions to be designed to suit both the data set and subsequent analysis method. The objective of this chapter is to demonstrate how wavelet basis functions can be computed for a range of multivariate statistical tasks such as unsupervised mapping (Section 3. 23. 3. 1), discriminant analysis (Section 3. 23. 3. 2), regression analysis (Section 3. 23. 3. 3), and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) (Section 3. 23. 3. 4). Following a description of the wavelet theory in Section 3. 23. 2, the extension to adaptive wavelets is described in Section 3. 23. 2. 7. Section 3. 23. 3 surveys the statistical methods that utilize the adaptive wavelet coefficients, and Section 3. 23. 4 puts all the above to practice by providing worked examples of the adaptive wavelet feature transformation procedure using near-infrared (NIR) spectra...|$|R
