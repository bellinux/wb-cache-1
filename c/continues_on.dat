5|$|Unlike audible {{signatures}}, tornadic signatures {{have been}} isolated; {{due to the}} long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation. Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research <b>continues</b> <b>on</b> isolating it and understanding the process.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search <b>continues</b> <b>on</b> the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E

Fishery Point is {{at the southern end of}} the Allegheny Plateau, just west of the First Fork. The three features named Point are each part of the Allegheny Front, the edge of the Allegheny Plateau.|$|E
5|$|The land {{cleared of}} trees largely became pasture. From the 1880s, {{clearing}} {{of land for}} dairy farming increased, especially in the areas around Tahakopa and the Owaka River valley. Considerable sheep and dairy farming <b>continues</b> <b>on</b> the cleared hills {{on the periphery of}} the region, and this accounts for much of the Catlins' income. A rural polytechnic specialising in agricultural science (Telford Rural Polytechnic) is located south of Balclutha close to the northeastern edge of the Catlins.|$|E
