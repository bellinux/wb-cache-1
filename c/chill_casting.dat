50|$|Direct <b>Chill</b> <b>casting</b> is {{a method}} for the {{fabrication}} of cylindrical or rectangular solid ingots from non-ferrous metals, especially Aluminum, Copper, Magnesium and their alloys. The original ingots are usually further processed by other methods (rolling, forging, etc.). More than a half of global aluminum production uses the Direct <b>Chill</b> <b>casting</b> process.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 70 {{percent of}} {{aluminium}} ingots in the U.S. are cast using the direct <b>chill</b> <b>casting</b> process, which reduces cracking. A total of 5 percent of ingots must be scrapped because of stress induced cracks and butt deformation.|$|E

40|$|In 65 / 35 brass billet, {{cast into}} mould by the <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> and the {{continuous}} casting methods, {{were found in}} the ingots containing more or less of the beta phase. The residual bata was a massive shapein the <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> or a striped form in the continuous casting method.

50|$|Direct <b>Chill</b> <b>casting</b> {{operates}} by pouring liquid metal continuously into a short mold (7.5-15 cm deep) {{that is open}} at the bottom. Only {{an outer}} layer of metal solidifies within the water-cooled mold. After leaving the closed mold at its bottom (e.g. with 5-15 cm/min), water is directly sprayed on the new ingot, continuing the solidification until complete. Only about 20% of {{the heat of the}} molten metal is removed through the mold wall, the secondary cooling (Direct Chill) contributing the majority of cooling. Typically the process is started with a starter-dummy block {{at the bottom of the}} mold, and runs until the maximum length possible in the machine is reached (up to 10 m).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. By {{imposing}} a high frequency magnetic field, the surface quality and macro/micro {{structure of the}} direct <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> billets are improved. The casting speed can also be improved by simultaneous applying mold and electromagnetic coil, especially for the alloys with a wide freezing range such as Al-Cu-Mg alloy. The extent of macrosegregation in the Al-Cu-Mg alloy is reduced by application of the magnetic field. Moreover, the inverse segregation layer usually observed in the direct <b>chill</b> <b>cast</b> billet is eliminated by {{the effect of the}} electromagnetic field. The microstructure of the hot-rolled and heat treated billets cast under the high frequency field also show better characteristics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{a surface}} modification technique {{to evaluate the}} mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance of cast Iron surface used in engineering. Basic sand casting mold was used and a portion of {{it was designed to}} accommodate the external mild steel chill (MSC). Chill accelerates the cooling rate of molten metal which leads to directional solidification. Cooling rate is directly proportional to formation of carbides in the form of iron carbide (Fe 3 C) near the chill end By controlling the flow of liquid nitrogen, the temperature of chills was reduced (upto - 100 °C). Effect of using chills on mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance was evaluated and analyzed. The present work provides the effective chilling thickness, which gives higher hardness near the chilled surface and a fairly appreciable hardness conducive for a specific wear functional requirement. The mechanical properties of <b>chilled</b> <b>cast</b> iron (CCI) is compared with sub zero <b>chilled</b> <b>cast</b> iron (SZCCI) and normal cast iron without using chill.

In comparison with advanced commercial grades, tool wear decreases when the grain {{size of the}} ceramics is reduced to significantly less than 1 µm. When machining hardened steel at intermediate velocities, sub-micrometer Al 2 O 3 /Ti(C,O) composites exhibit the least wear. At higher speeds, however, new alumina tools best withstand the high processing temperatures, and {{they are also the}} favourite choice for discontinuous cutting despite their moderate creep resistance and toughness.

The top aluminium cover in the engine's valley was redesigned to house two packs of three coils each, with each coil having two high-tension terminals {{for a total of}} twelve.

The crankshaft in the V12 was switched from a forging to a <b>chill</b> <b>casting.</b> A visibly significant chromed pipe connecting {{the left and the right}} banks of the V12 in the XJ40 platform (intended to vent and route the crankcase blow-by gas to the intake plenum) was changed with the introduction of the X300 to an almost invisible design at the top center of the engine underneath a plastic cover that also hides fuel rails and coilpacks.|$|E
50|$|Ganz {{recognized}} that {{to develop his}} factory {{he had to make}} products that are mass-produced. In 1846 the Pest-Vác railway line was built. In that time the European foundries made wrought iron rims for spoked wagon wheels. They poured the casts in shapes in the sand, and leave it there to cool down. Meanwhile, in the United States and England they used a better method, the <b>chill</b> <b>casting</b> which was invented by the Englishman John Burn in 1812. The essence of this process is if you cool down the cast faster, the metal will be harder, and wear-proofer. That is possible if the casting frame is made of a good heat conductor. Ganz could made one in 1853 for the first time. And he could also improve this method by using antimony. He got a patent for this invention in 1856.|$|E
