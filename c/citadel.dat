5|$|The <b>citadel</b> {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the old walled city of Damascus, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, the <b>citadel</b> of Damascus was built on flat ground at the same level {{as the rest of the}} city, a feature it shares with the <b>Citadel</b> of Bosra. The location of the <b>citadel</b> ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of the <b>citadel.</b> The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of the <b>citadel.</b> The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of the <b>citadel</b> could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under the <b>citadel.</b> Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within the <b>citadel</b> were probably constructed under Al-Adil. The <b>citadel</b> was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus, with the city walls abutting the <b>citadel</b> on its southwest and northeast corners.|$|E
5|$|After his {{position}} as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus was secured, Al-Adil started an extensive rebuilding programme of the <b>citadel.</b> Between 1203 and 1216, the old fortifications were razed and a larger castle was built at the same location, incorporating parts of the old Seljuq <b>citadel.</b> The lower Ayyubid princes were each required to finance and build {{one of the large}} towers of the <b>citadel.</b> Several of Al-Adil's Ayyubid successors rebuilt many of the administrative and domestic structures inside the <b>citadel,</b> including residences, palaces, and a pool. As-Salih Ayyub was the only successor who also modified the defences.|$|E
5|$|After the Mamluk defeat by the Ottoman army under Sultan Selim I in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, Damascus and the <b>citadel</b> {{surrendered}} peacefully to the Ottomans. Damascus {{was given}} to Janbirdi al-Ghazali, a Mamluk who had submitted to Selim I. When Selim I died in 1520, al-Ghazali revolted and took the <b>citadel.</b> He marched upon Aleppo to expand his realm, but had to retreat and was eventually defeated and killed {{in the vicinity of}} Damascus in 1521. Damascus again changed hands, to the Ottomans. From 1658 onward, the <b>citadel</b> was controlled by the Janissaries—Ottoman infantry units. In 1738 and in 1746, they were involved in conflicts with the governors of Damascus; the Janissaries temporarily lost control of the <b>citadel</b> in 1746. The north gate of the <b>citadel</b> collapsed in 1752, and sustained heavy damage due to a severe earthquake in 1759. According to contemporary accounts, both the western and southern walls collapsed, but the damage was quickly repaired in 1761.|$|E
50|$|The Meuse <b>citadels</b> or Mosane <b>citadels</b> (Citadelles mosanes) are a {{group of}} forts {{situated}} along the Meuse river in Wallonia (southern Belgium). The <b>citadels</b> were originally intended to defend the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and County of Namur and were later modernized during the periods of French and Dutch rule. They include four <b>citadels,</b> at Namur, Liège, Huy and Dinant of which all are partially or totally preserved.|$|R

50|$|Local {{government}} {{systems in}} Taiwan underwent many changes during the Qing Dynasty period. But {{with regards to}} administrative levels lower than the county, including local villages, there were no major changes. The earliest organization and planning of Yilan consisted of seven <b>citadels.</b> In 1835, the seven <b>citadels</b> were further divided into 12 <b>citadels</b> based {{on the needs of}} the changing population and environment. This arrangement remained unchanged until the end of Qing Dynasty rule.|$|R

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the <b>Citadel,</b> an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the <b>Citadel</b> serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The <b>Citadel</b> projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the <b>Citadel</b> contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The <b>Citadel</b> also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{extensive}} docks {{had grown}} up around the <b>Citadel</b> and in 1802 the surrounding land was granted to the Hull Dock Company. The <b>Citadel</b> remained in military use until 1848, by when developments in military technology had made the fortification obsolete. In 1858 there were proposals to turn the site into a public park, but instead the <b>Citadel,</b> including Hull Castle and the South Blockhouse, was demolished in 1864 {{to make way for}} an expansion of the docks.|$|E

5|$|French {{military}} forces occupied the <b>citadel</b> during the French Mandate period in Syria (1920–1946). During the Great Syrian Revolt in 1925, the French shelled Al-Hariqa, the area immediately {{south of the}} citadel—where Syrian rebels {{were supposed to be}} present—from positions in the hills {{to the north of the}} city, and from the <b>citadel</b> itself. This bombardment resulted in widespread destruction. After the French Mandate period, the <b>citadel</b> continued to serve as a prison and barracks until 1986.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Nur ad-Din's {{death in}} 1174, Damascus {{was seized by}} Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In that year, Saladin rode from Egypt past the Crusader states to Damascus with only 700 horsemen. The city opened its gates to Saladin without resistance, except for the <b>citadel,</b> which surrendered to him later that year. Saladin added a tower to the <b>citadel</b> and refurbished the residential buildings. Like his predecessor Nur ad-Din, Saladin died of an illness in the <b>citadel</b> on 4 March 1193. He was initially buried inside the <b>citadel,</b> but later reburied in a mausoleum near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|In 1219, a {{group of}} Antiochene noblemen rose up against Raymond-Roupen who had lost Leo of Cilicia's support. Their leader, William Farabel, urged Bohemond to come to Antioch. Raymond-Roupen sought refuge in the <b>citadel,</b> but {{he was forced to}} leave Antioch. He {{entrusted}} the <b>citadel</b> to the Hospitallers. Bohemond hurried to Antioch and seized the principality. The Hospitallers abandoned the <b>citadel</b> without resistance.|$|E
50|$|Pryan {{was created}} as a great {{inverted}} globe with four small suns at its center. It {{was to be the}} power plant and center for all four worlds, but it too fell into chaos. Great <b>Citadels</b> collected the energy from Pryan's four suns and beamed it through conduits to the other three worlds (the Colossi on Abarrach, the Kicksey-winsey on Arianus and the seasun on Chelestra). Covered entirely by miles-thick jungle (only the dwarves had ever seen the legendary 'ground') the <b>Citadels</b> were to be the bastions of civilization, where the Mensch would live a life of plenty and comfort. However, as with the other worlds, the Sartan mysteriously began to die. In fear, some <b>citadels</b> banished the mensch to the jungle. The Tytans, great blind giants of immense power created by the Sartan to manage the power systems of the <b>citadels,</b> were also banished because of fear they could no longer be controlled by the remaining Sartan. The Tytans went on to be an unstoppable terror as they searched for the <b>citadels,</b> trying to get home.|$|R

5|$|In 2004 an {{agreement}} was signed between the DGAM and the Italian General Direction for Development Cooperation for a joint mission to renovate and reorganize the <b>citadel</b> and the National Museum of Damascus. This mission started {{working in the}} <b>citadel</b> in 2007. Much attention {{will be given to}} the reinforcement of damaged or structurally weak parts in the architecture. It is expected by the Syrian–Italian mission that, once renovations are finished, the <b>citadel</b> will be used for cultural and social events and activities.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire <b>citadel.</b> As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the <b>citadel</b> were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the <b>citadel</b> mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} some areas of the <b>citadel</b> to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the <b>citadel</b> mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the <b>citadel.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether a building {{stood on the}} site of the <b>citadel</b> before the 11th century AD. The Ghouta, the wider area in which Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, but there is no evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later <b>citadel</b> was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a <b>citadel</b> during the Hellenistic period {{is uncertain}}. Damascus certainly had a <b>citadel</b> during the Roman period, but whether it was located {{on the site of}} the present <b>citadel</b> is uncertain and subject to scholarly debate.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Vietnamese defence {{personnel}} were concentrated {{at the eastern}} gate of the <b>citadel,</b> where they stubbornly fought off the French. Rigault de Genouilly led 500 French troops in hand-to-hand combat for seven hours, having used explosives to breach the <b>citadel.</b> At 14:00, the French seized control of the <b>citadel.</b> Two hours later, de Genouilly declared the <b>citadel</b> as the new general headquarters of the French forces. The French seized a large arsenal. This included more than 200 cannons, 20,000 hand-held weapons such as firearms, pistols and swords, 100 tons of munitions, 80,000 tons of rice and 130,000 francs in cash. Saltpetre, shot and sulphur were also seized. The Vietnamese material losses were estimated to be around 20 million francs. The <b>citadel</b> commander fled to another village before committing suicide.|$|E
5|$|Nur ad-Din ruled as Zengid emir of Damascus from 1154 {{until his}} death in 1174. He took up {{residence}} in the <b>citadel</b> and rebuilt or refurbished its residential structures. After an earthquake hit Damascus in 1170, Nur ad-Din built a wooden house for sleeping and prayer next to the original stone residence of the <b>citadel.</b> In addition, he built a mosque and a fountain in the <b>citadel.</b> Between 1165 and 1174, Nur ad-Din re-fortified Damascus with a concentric wall, and it is possible that he also strengthened the defences of the <b>citadel.</b> Nur ad-Din died of an illness in the <b>citadel</b> on 15 May 1174 and was buried there; his body was later transferred to the Nur ad-Din Madrasah in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Saladin's brother Al-Adil {{rebuilt the}} <b>citadel</b> {{completely}} between 1203 and 1216 {{in response to}} the development of the counterweight trebuchet. After his death, power struggles broke out between the other Ayyubid princes and although Damascus switched hands several times, the <b>citadel</b> was taken by force only once, in 1239. The <b>citadel</b> remained in Ayyubid hands until the Mongols under their general Kitbuqa captured Damascus in 1260, thereby ending Ayyubid rule in Syria. After an unsuccessful revolt broke out in the <b>citadel,</b> the Mongols had most of it dismantled. After the defeat of the Mongols in 1260 by the Mamluks, who had succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of Egypt, Damascus came under Mamluk rule. Except for brief periods in 1300 and 1401, when the Mongols conquered Damascus, the Mamluks controlled the <b>citadel</b> until 1516. In that year, Syria fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. Damascus surrendered without a fight and from the 17th century onward the <b>citadel</b> functioned as barracks for the Jannisaries—Ottoman infantry units. The <b>citadel</b> started to fall into disrepair in the 19th century and its last military use was in 1925, when French soldiers shelled the old city from the <b>citadel</b> {{in response to the}} Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate of Syria. The <b>citadel</b> continued to serve as a barracks and prison until 1986, when excavations and restorations started. As of 2011, excavation and restoration efforts are still ongoing.|$|E

5|$|Sovereign {{reveals that}} the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and {{discover}} the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, with the bomb about to explode, Shepard hears that Ashley and Kaidan have both been pinned down, and must choose which one to rescue. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the Normandy: a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the <b>Citadel</b> Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via cryopreservation and then re-entered the <b>Citadel</b> Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the <b>Citadel</b> to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating the <b>Citadel</b> Mass Relay. Saren plans to reach the <b>Citadel</b> by using the Conduit to allow Sovereign to activate the <b>Citadel</b> Mass Relay and trigger the Reaper invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} {{occupation of the}} <b>citadel</b> mound dates to the 5th millennium BC, and possibly earlier. It appears {{for the first time}} in historical sources in the Ebla tablets around 2,300 BC, and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian period. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Christianity. After the Mongols captured the <b>citadel</b> in 1258, the importance of Erbil declined. During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil <b>Citadel</b> Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the restoration of the <b>citadel.</b> In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from the <b>citadel</b> as part of a large restoration project. Since then, archaeological research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the tell by various international teams and in cooperation with local specialists. The government plans to have 50 families live in the <b>citadel</b> once it is renovated.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the current <b>citadel</b> was first fortified in 1076 by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak, although it is possible but not proven that a <b>citadel</b> stood on this place in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. After the assassination of Atsiz bin Uvak, the project was finished by the Seljuq ruler Tutush I. The emirs of the subsequent Burid and Zengid dynasties carried out modifications and added new structures to it. During this period, the <b>citadel</b> and the city were besieged several times by Crusader and Muslim armies. In 1174, the <b>citadel</b> was captured by Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, who made it his residence and had the defences and residential buildings modified.|$|E
