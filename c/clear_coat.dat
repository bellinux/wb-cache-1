25|$|The balustrades on {{the second}} floor of the old rotunda were {{patterned}} after those in London's Royal Albert Hall. The details of the balustrades were hidden after years of paint. The old paint was removed and a special <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> was applied to prevent rusting of the wrought iron and to allow the details to be visible. Plaster works were carried out on the plaster motifs, cornices, balustrades, capitals and carving of the old building were either deteriorated or destroyed during the earlier renovations.

25|$|For 2010, {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic. It included a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine producing 150 horsepower, a standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack and six speakers, a rear-mounted spoiler, standard air conditioning, standard cruise control, standard tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), standard front and front and rear side SRS airbags, standard keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, standard ABS anti-lock brakes, standard sixteen-inch alloy wheels, and more. Optional features included leather seating surfaces, a power front driver's bucket seat, an engine block heater, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats. Pricing for the 2010 Chrysler PT Cruiser Classic, in MSRP, started at $18,275.00. Exterior color options were Bright Silver Metallic, Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat, Inferno Red Crystal Tinted Pearl Coat, Silver Steel Metallic, and Stone White <b>Clear</b> <b>Coat.</b> The only interior color option was Pastel Slate Gray.|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{performance of}} Al- 2024 substrates coated with an epoxy <b>clear</b> <b>coating</b> and a pigmented epoxy coating was investigated. The absorption {{of water in}} the pigmented coating was high compared to the <b>clear</b> <b>coating.</b> The <b>clear</b> <b>coating</b> provided a good barrier which is stable beyond 120 days of immersion in a 0. 5 M NaCl solution. The shape of the Nyquist plot of the pigmented coating changed with immersion time and reveals the existence of physico-chemical processes in the coating and/or at the interface. Its impedance magnitude at low frequencies remained very high (~ 109. cm 2) after 72 days of immersion in sodium chloride solution. Both coatings exhibited good dry adhesion on Al- 2024.

40|$|A testing {{protocol}} was established {{for measuring the}} flexure properties of thin-walled tubes constructed of a composite mixture of glass and carbon fibers and epoxy resin for use in Fly Fishing rods. Standard three point bend tests were conducted in accordance with ASTM standard D 7329 - 13 with a span length of six inches. All samples were of the sample length and diameter, allowing direct comparison of the maximum loads reached before failure, which are directly indicative of the Modulus of Rupture (MOR). Two constructions were tested both containing the same unidirectional fiber but with different support structure. These tubes were tested identically for both as delivered samples and for the samples having undergone ultraviolet, humidity, and elevated temperature exposure. Construction 1 reached higher maximum stresses than Construction 2 and displayed similar amounts of flexure. When coated and exposed, the strength of Construction 1 and 2 both increased when compared to uncoated and unexposed samples. In Construction 1, maximum loads achieved in samples painted, <b>clear</b> <b>coated</b> and exposed averaged loads at failure of 45. 33 lb, solely <b>clear</b> <b>coated</b> and exposed samples averaged 42. 9 lb at failure, uncoated and exposed averaged 38. 1 lb, and uncoated and unexposed averaged 40. 9 lb.

40|$|Reinforced <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> were {{prepared}} using nanosized silica and alumina particles in UV/EB curable acrylate formulations. For a firm embedding of the oxide nanofillers via covalent bonds {{to the network}} acrylates their surfaces were modified by polymerization-active trialkoxysilanes, e. g., methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and vinyltrimethoxysilane. The cured nanocomposite <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> showed improved scratch and abrasion resistance. However, oxide modifications accomplished by silanes having polymerization-inactive methyl, n-propyl, and isobutyl functionalities yield coatings with similar scratch and abrasion resistance. To explain these findings, infrared and multinuclear MAS NMR experiments, MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS n mass spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results were used to reveal the structure of surface-anchored organosilanes and their interaction with the acrylate matrix. Ladder-like polysiloxane chains chemically grafted onto the filler particles have been proposed. These ladder-like structures build a short range interpenetrating network with the polyacrylates.
