25|$|In Christian art {{the hand}} will often {{actually}} represent {{the hand of}} God the Son, or the Logos; this is demonstrated when later depictions start to substitute for the Hand a small half-length portrait of Christ as Logos in a similar <b>circular</b> <b>frame.</b> It is nearly always Christ in the East, but in the West God the Father will sometimes be shown in this way. However, in many contexts {{the person of the}} Trinity intended cannot be confirmed from the image alone, except in those images, like the Baptism of Christ, where Jesus the Incarnate Christ is also present, where the hand is clearly that of God the Father. Later Eastern Orthodox images often identify Hands as the Logos with the usual monogram used in icons.|$|E
2500|$|... the {{tambourine}} (called tammorra in Neapolitan dialect)--a <b>circular</b> <b>frame</b> with {{a single}} drum head [...] stretched across {{one side of the}} instrument. There are generally small metal [...] "jingles" [...] mounted {{around the perimeter of the}} instrument, that sound as the tammorra is struck by the knuckles or the open hand.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were a few}} {{different}} models that were either manufactured by Magnetic Signal or customized by the different railroads. [...] A few examples included two signals on the same pole for different traffic approaches, a circular upper quadrant signal in which the target swung in a <b>circular</b> <b>frame,</b> and three-position signals where the target was hidden behind a sign when the signal was inactive. The Norfolk and Western {{decided to make a}} change where the motion-limiting bumpers were placed {{on the front of the}} signal instead of inside at the rear. They felt that torque on the armature was reduced. They also had unique lights on their banners.|$|E

2500|$|The Mosque {{has several}} domes, the largest being over the mihrab and the {{entrance}} to the prayer hall from the courtyard. [...] The dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a <b>circular</b> <b>frame.</b> This dome, whose construction goes back to {{the first half of the}} ninth century (towards 836), is one of the oldest and most remarkable domes in the western Islamic world.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Great Mother", Cybele, as the Greeks and Romans knew her, was {{originally}} worshiped {{in the mountains}} of Phrygia, where she was known as [...] "Mountain Mother". In her typical Phrygian form, she wears a long belted dress, a polos (a high cylindrical headdress), and a veil covering the whole body. The later version of Cybele was established by a pupil of Phidias, the sculptor Agoracritus, and became the image most widely adopted by Cybele's expanding following, both in the Aegean world and at Rome. It shows her humanized though still enthroned, her hand resting on an attendant lion and the other holding the tympanon, a <b>circular</b> <b>frame</b> drum, similar to a tambourine.|$|E
2500|$|In {{so-called}} [...] "mystical" [...] images, {{such as the}} apse mosaic at the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna (549), the jewelled cross stands specifically as {{a symbol}} for Christ. A poem by St Paulinus of Nola allows a reconstruction of a mosaic apse he had (as bishop) commissioned in the basilica of St Felix of Nola at Cimitile in the early 5th century. The whole Trinity was shown, represented by a Hand of God for God the Father at the top, above a large crux gemmata with stars in a <b>circular</b> <b>frame,</b> so very similar to Sant' Apollinare in Classe, and below that a dove for the Holy Spirit. [...] At {{the bottom of the}} semi-dome were twelve lambs, six on each side, with a haloed Lamb of God on a raised hillock in the centre, looking up. The bottom of the mosaic at Santa Pudenziana in Rome originally also had a bottom level with this.|$|E

30|$|Some {{researchers}} have found that some hybrid and all-wire frames exhibit similar properties [21, 22]. Others have reported less ideal biomechanical characteristics for hybrid fixation in <b>circular</b> <b>frames</b> [23]. From our experience, we believe the hybrid fixation with the OSF to be more rigid, providing greater stability and as a result better healing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{covering}} of the prayer hall consists of painted ceilings decorated with vegetal motifs and two domes : one raised {{at the beginning}} of the central nave and the other in front of the mihrab. The latter, which its [...] cap is cut by 24 concave grooves radiating around the top, is based on ridged horns shaped shell and a drum pierced by eight circular windows which are inserted between sixteen niches grouped by two. The niches are covered with carved stone panels, finely adorned with characteristic geometric, vegetal and floral patterns of the Aghlabid decorative repertoire : shells, cusped arches, rosettes, vine-leaf, etc. From the outside, the dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a <b>circular</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very dull {{that you}} can only marry one husband, certainly," [...] Mrs. Hilbery reflected. [...] "I always wish that you could marry {{everybody}} who wants to marry you. Perhaps they'll come to that in time, but meanwhile I confess that dear William--" [...] But here Mr. Hilbery came in, and the more solid part of the evening began. This consisted in the reading aloud by Katharine from some prose work or other, while her mother knitted scarves intermittently on a little <b>circular</b> <b>frame,</b> and her father read the newspaper, not so attentively but that he could comment humorously now and again upon {{the fortunes of the}} hero and the heroine. The Hilberys subscribed to a library, which delivered books on Tuesdays and Fridays, and Katharine did her best to interest her parents in the works of living and highly respectable authors; but Mrs. Hilbery was perturbed by the very look of the light, gold-wreathed volumes, and would make little faces as if she tasted something bitter as the reading went on; while Mr. Hilbery would treat the moderns with a curious elaborate banter such as one might apply to the antics of a promising child. So this evening, after five pages or so of one of these masters, Mrs. Hilbery protested that it was all too clever and cheap and nasty for words.|$|E
6000|$|You are too far away--you are too absent--too invisible, inaudible, inconceivable. Life is {{too short}} a {{business}} and friendship too delicate a matter for such tricks--for cutting great gory masses out of 'em by the year at a time. Therefore come back. Hang it all--sink it all and come back. A little more and I shall cease to believe in you: I don't mean (in the usual implied phrase) in your veracity, but literally and more fatally in your relevancy--your objective reality. You have become a beautiful myth--a kind of unnatural uncomfortable unburied mort. You put forth a beautiful monthly voice, with such happy notes in it--but it comes from too far away, {{from the other side}} of the globe, while I vaguely know that you are crawling like a fly on the nether surface of my chair. Your adventures, no doubt, are wonderful; but I don't successfully evoke them, understand them, believe in them. I do in those you write, heaven knows--but I don't in those you perform, though the latter, I know, are to lead to new revelations of the former and your capacity for them is certainly wonderful enough. This is a selfish personal cry: I wish you back; for literature is lonely and Bournemouth is barren without you. Your place in my affection has not been usurped by another--for there is not the least little scrap of another to usurp it. If there were I would perversely try to care for him. But there isn't--I repeat, and I literally care for nothing but your return. I haven't even your novel to stay my stomach withal. The wan wet months elapse and I see no sign of it. The beautiful portrait of your wife shimmers at me from my chimney-piece--brought some months ago by the natural McClure--but seems to refer to one as dim and distant and delightful as a [...] "toast" [...] of the last century. I wish I could make you homesick--I wish I could spoil your fun. It is a very featureless time. The summer is rank with rheumatism--a dark, drowned, unprecedented season. The town is empty but I am not going away. I have no money, but I have a little work. I have lately written several short fictions--but you may not see them unless you come home. I have just begun a novel which is to run through the Atlantic from January 1st and which I aspire to finish by the end of this year. In reality I suppose I shall not be fully delivered of it before the middle of next. After that, with God's help, I propose, for a longish period, to do nothing but short lengths. I want to leave a multitude of pictures of my time, projecting my small <b>circular</b> <b>frame</b> upon as many different spots as possible and going in for number as well as quality, so that the number may constitute a total having a certain value as observation and testimony. But there isn't so much as a creature here even to whisper such an intention to. Nothing lifts its hand in these islands save blackguard party politics. Criticism is of an abject density and puerility--it doesn't exist--it writes the intellect of our race too low. Lang, in the D.N., every morning, and I believe in a hundred other places, uses his beautiful thin facility to write everything down to the lowest level of Philistine twaddle--the view of the old lady round the corner or the clever person at the dinner party. The incorporated society of authors (I belong to it, and so do you, I think, but I don't know what it is) gave a dinner the other night to American literati to thank them for praying for international copyright. I carefully forbore to go, thinking the gratulation premature, and I see by this morning's Times that the banquetted boon is further off than ever. Edmund Gosse has sent me his clever little life of Congreve, just out, and I have read it--but it isn't so good as his Raleigh. But no more was the insufferable subject.... Come, my dear Louis, grow not too thin. I can't question you--because, as I say, I don't conjure you up. You have killed the imagination in me--that part of it which formed your element and in which you sat vivid and near. Your wife and Mother and Mr. Lloyd suffer also--I must confess it--by this failure of breath, of faith. Of course I have your letter--from Manasquan (is that the idiotic name?) of the--ingenuous me, to think there was a date! It was terribly impersonal--it did me little good. A little more and I shan't believe in you enough to bless you. Take this, therefore, as your last chance. I follow all with an aching wing, an inadequate geography and an ineradicable hope. Ever, my dear Louis, yours, to the last snub-- ...|$|E

30|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>frames</b> are {{undoubtedly}} {{a valuable tool}} {{in the treatment of}} tibial non-union, particularly those complicated by malalignment, infection or bone loss. The experience can be arduous for the patient, and effective pre-operative counselling regarding the experience of living in a frame and the likely clinical outcome are essential to allow patients to make informed decisions. Using patient-reported outcomes in pre-operative discussions, surgeons can help to quantify anticipated outcomes following treatment and facilitate the decision-making process for their patients.|$|R

30|$|The {{use of an}} {{external}} fixator for bone transport to bridge a defect is {{an alternative to the}} shortening and staged reconstruction. It is indicated for larger defects. <b>Circular</b> <b>frames</b> are more popular than unilateral devices now for their greater stability and flexibility in the configuration. There is greater scope for correcting rotational or angular mal-alignment which may occur during the course of treatment [42]. It is usual to delay the osteotomy of bone transport by several weeks to ensure the soft tissue envelope has healed.|$|R
