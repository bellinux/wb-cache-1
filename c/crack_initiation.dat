The origin of the micro-pit was considered unknown at the time when the report was published. Also unknown is whether the fracture occurred momentarily or over several flight hours, and whether fracture fragments were spalled for detection by maintenance systems as happened in G-REDL.

2500|$|On 3 December 2010, the ATSB {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} report which contained a key finding of a manufacturing flaw: An area of fatigue cracking was found within a stub pipe that feeds oil to the engine HP/IP bearing structure. Bearing lubricating oil leaked from the crack, causing the subsequent engine fire and failure of the IPT disc. The fatigue fracture {{was a result of}} the misalignment of the stub pipe during the counter-boring process. That inaccurate alignment resulted in one side of the same stub pipe becoming too thin to resist fatigue fracturing. This [...] "could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>initiation</b> and growth, oil leakage and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire," [...] according to the agency.|$|E

In {{order to}} further study the <b>cracks</b> <b>initiation</b> and {{distribution}} mechanism of SiC coating, then optimize the coating {{structure and composition}} on surface of C/C composites, CVD method is used to deposit SiC coating on C/C composites and pyrolytic carbon. Through the analysis on the reasons of <b>cracks</b> <b>initiation</b> via SEM, the influence {{of different kinds of}} substrates and the toughening of SiC whisker on the <b>cracks</b> <b>initiation</b> and distribution are researched. The results show that the cracks easily form in the area near the defects and sample edge, and the cracks also mainly distribute in the direction which are perpendicular to the first fiber layer. Compared with pyrolytic carbon matrix, cracks on C/C composites matrix are width and numerous, and SiC whisker toughening coating can significantly reduce the number of cracks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{extended}} exposures on the near-surface fatigue resistance of a disk superalloy. Powder metallurgy processed, supersolvus heat-treated Udimet 720 (U 720) fatigue specimens were exposed in air at temperatures from 650 to 705 C for 100 hr to over 1000 hr. They were then tested using conventional fatigue tests at 650 C to determine the effects of exposure on fatigue resistance. The exposures reduced life by up to 70 % and increased the scatter in life, compared to unexposed levels. Fractographic evaluations indicated the failure mode was shifted by the exposures from internal to surface <b>crack</b> <b>initiations.</b> The increased scatter in life was related to the competition between internal <b>crack</b> <b>initiations</b> at inclusions or large grains producing longer lives, and surface <b>crack</b> <b>initiations</b> at an environmentally affected surface layer producing shorter lives...|$|R

Powder metallurgy processed, supersolvus heat treated Udimet (trademark) 720 and ME 3 fatigue specimens were exposed in air at temperatures of 650 to 704 C, for times of 100 h to over 1000 h.

Cyclic dwell verification tests were also performed to contrast the effects of intermixed exposures and fatigue cycles.

Fractographic evaluations indicated the failure mode was shifted by the exposures and cyclic dwells from predominantly internal to often surface <b>crack</b> <b>initiations.</b> The increased scatter in life was related to the competition between internal <b>crack</b> <b>initiations</b> at inclusions or large grains producing longer lives, and surface <b>crack</b> <b>initiations</b> at an environmentally affected surface layer producing shorter lives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A generic {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between fracture toughness and microstructure of ductile metals has been performed using a continuum damage model in a 2 D small scale yielding finite element setting. The damage model is an enhanced Gurson model incorporating void shape effects and a micromechanical law for void coalescence.

The effect of the flow properties and of the void shape on the fracture toughness is discussed. Transition between a void by void growth and a multiple void interaction is analysed. The paper also addresses the difference between the fracture toughness at true <b>cracking</b> <b>initiation</b> and the fracture toughness defined in an engineering sense, i. e. after a given amount of crack propagation...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for accurately estimating the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) at physical <b>cracking</b> <b>initiation</b> in ductile materials. The method requires a few precracked specimens to be loaded {{in such a}} way as to exhibit various crack extensions. The total opening of the blunted precrack, delta(1), the opening of the tearing crack, delta(2), and the ductile tearing extension are measured for each specimens. The unloaded CTOD at <b>cracking</b> <b>initiation</b> is equal to the difference of delta(1) - delta(2) extrapolated for zero crack extension. Results obtained in two different applications, one on plane strain specimens of copper and the other on TRIP assisted multiphase steel plates, illustrate the potential of the method. A model based on fracture mechanics arguments is proposed in order to account for the reverse plasticity during unloading. This model is compared to results obtained using more exact large strain finite element computations. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The Applied Element Method (AEM) is a {{numerical}} analysis used {{in predicting the}} continuum and discrete behavior of structures. The modeling method in AEM adopts the concept of discrete cracking allowing it to automatically track structural collapse behavior passing through all stages of loading: elastic, <b>crack</b> <b>initiation</b> and propagation in tension-weak materials, reinforcement yield, element separation, element contact and collision, as well as collision with the ground and adjacent structures.|$|E

50|$|Technologically {{advanced}} adhesive devices {{sometimes make}} use of microstructures on surfaces, such as the periodic posts described above.

By intermixing periodic breaks into smooth, adhesive surfaces, the interface acquires valuable crack-arresting properties. Because <b>crack</b> <b>initiation</b> requires much greater stress than does crack propagation, surfaces like these are much harder to separate, as a new crack has to be restarted every time the next individual microstructure is reached.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{its ability}} {{to take into account}} discontinuities, the {{discontinuous}} Galerkin (DG) method presents some advantages for modeling <b>crack</b> <b>initiations</b> and propagations. This concept has been recently applied to 3 D simulations and to elastic thin bodies. In this last case, the assumption of small elastic deformations before <b>crack</b> <b>initiations</b> or propagations reduces drastically the applicability of the framework to a reduced number of materials. To remove this limitation, a full-DG formulation of non-linear Kirchhoff-Love shells is presented and is used in combination with an elasto-plastic finite deformations model. The results obtained by this new formulation are in agreement with other continuum elasto-plastic shell formulations. Then this full-DG formulation of Kirchhoff-Love shells is coupled with the cohesive zone model to perform thin body fracture simulations. As this method allows considering elasto-plastic constitutive laws in combination with the cohesive model, accurate results compared to the experiments are found. In particular, the crack path and propagation rate of a blasted cylinder are shown to match experimental results. One of the main advantages of this framework is {{its ability to}} run in parallel with a high speed-up factor, allowing the simulation of ultra fine meshes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between microstructure and fracture resistance of TRIP-assisted multiphase steels {{has been investigated}} by processing and characterizing eight specifically designed microstructures differing {{in terms of the}} volume fractions of the constitutive phases, i. e. ferrite, bainite, retained austenite and martensite, by the stability of the retained austenite. and by the connectivity of the phases. Fracture resistance has been quantified by the fracture strain in uniaxial tension, epsilon(-f), the fracture toughness at <b>cracking</b> <b>initiation,</b> J(1 c). and by the essential work of fracture, w(e). The fracture mechanisms were characterized by microscopic observations and by profilometric measurements of the crack lip necking process typical in thin sheet fracture. The fracture toughness at <b>cracking</b> <b>initiation</b> of TRIP-aided steels corresponds to an equivalent Dual Phase steel in which martensite replaces retained austenite and is thus not affected by the retained austenite stability. The ductile tearing resistance of TRIP-aided steels, quantified by w(e), increases significantly with the retained austenite stability. This improved tearing resistance is explained by the effect of the additional work-hardening induced by the late transformation Of retained austenite within the crack tip necking zone.

50|$|Temperature has {{a direct}} effect on the {{fracture}} mechanics. At low temperatures, below the glass transition temperature of the rubber, the dispersed phase behaves like a glass rather than like a rubber that toughens the polymer. As a result, the continuous phase will fail by mechanisms characteristic of the pure polymer, as if the rubber was not present. As temperature increases past the glass transition temperature, the rubber phase will increase the <b>crack</b> <b>initiation</b> energy. At this point the crack self-propagates due to the stored elastic energy in the material. As temperature rises further past the glass transition of the rubber phase, the impact strength of a rubber-polymer composite still dramatically increases as crack propagation requires additional energy input.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper, the use of {{circumferentially}} cracked round bars (CRB geometry) for characterizing fracture toughness of a ductile material, namely copper, is assessed experimentally through a comparison with the single edge notched bend (SENB) geometry. The J(R) curve method with multiple-specimens was applied, but, as unstable cracking appeared very early in the CRB specimen, an engineering definition of fracture toughness was not pertinent. Unloaded specimens were analyzed metallographically to determine the CTOD at physical <b>cracking</b> <b>initiation.</b> The fracture toughness measured using the CRB geometry was 50 % larger than using the SENB geometry. The second part of the paper aims at justifying this difference of fracture toughness at <b>cracking</b> <b>initiation.</b> Finite element simulations revealed a slightly higher constraint in the SENB specimens. The main difference between the two specimen geometries lies in a 50 % larger extension of the finite strain zone with respect to the CTOD in the case of the SENB specimens. Based on the observation that, in the studied material, the critical CTOD is one order of magnitude larger than the void spacing, we conclude that the geometry dependence of the fracture toughness is caused by the difference in the finite strain zone extension rather than by a stress triaxiality effect...|$|R
