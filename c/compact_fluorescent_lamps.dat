25|$|Ballasts {{vary greatly}} in complexity.

25|$|Energy-efficient {{buildings}} {{reduce the}} amount of energy wasted in buildings through efficient heating, cooling or lighting systems. In particular, the replacement of incandescent light bulbs with <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> can have a drastic effect on energy consumption. New buildings can also be constructed using less carbon-intensive input materials.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps emit a {{small amount}} of {{ultraviolet}} (UV) light. A 1993 study in the US found that ultraviolet exposure from sitting under fluorescent lights for eight hours is equivalent to one minute of sun exposure.

25|$|Fluorescent lamp {{fixtures}} {{are more}} costly than incandescent lamps because they require a ballast {{to regulate the}} current through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost. <b>Compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an energy-saving alternative in homes.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent {{lights were}} first {{available}} to the public at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes (such as <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps).</b> Some high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{activities}} defined under PRONUREE is the national program to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2011 in Argentina. The program, financed by the government, aims to replace incandescent bulbs with energy efficient <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (CFLs) in all households connected to the electricity grid and selected public buildings. The program, which has initially undergone a pilot phase and expects to replace 5 million incandescent lamps {{in the next six}} months, foresees the distribution of 25 million lamps overall. Staff from the distribution companies will visit each household to replace the incandescent lamps and to inform residential users on the advantages of replacing the bulbs and of the efficient use of energy in general.|$|E

25|$|However, most {{contemporary}} authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound {{effect in the}} research literature. Although Khazzoom {{did not use the}} term, he raised {{the idea that there is}} a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in energy efficiency and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product. His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the price elasticity of demand for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in garden lighting after the introduction of energy-saving <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the Jevons paradox).|$|E
2500|$|Incandescent bulbs {{have been}} {{replaced}} in many applications by other types of electric light, such as fluorescent lamps, <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (CFL), cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL), high-intensity discharge lamps, and light-emitting diode lamps (LED). Some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, China, Canada and United States, {{are in the process}} of phasing out the use of incandescent light bulbs while others, including Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina [...] and Brazil, have prohibited them already.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{progress}} has been made recently under the Generación Autónoma y Uso Racional de Energía Eléctrica (...) project, financed by the European Union between 2000 and 2007. The GAUREE 2 project aims at increasing the use of energy-efficient <b>Compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (CFLs), lowering the consumption of energy by 50 million kW·h per year. The plan of action includes giving away, in a three-phased operation, a free 20 W CFL bulb to 800,000 households (the majority of Honduran households still use inefficient 60 W, 75 W, and 100 W bulbs).|$|E
2500|$|By {{using an}} amalgam {{with some other}} metal, the vapor {{pressure}} is reduced and the optimum temperature range extended upward; however, the bulb wall [...] "cold spot" [...] temperature must still be controlled to prevent migration of the mercury out of the amalgam and condensing on the cold spot. Fluorescent lamps intended for higher output will have structural features such as a deformed tube or internal heat-sinks to control cold spot temperature and mercury distribution. Heavily loaded small lamps, such as <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> also include heat-sink areas in the tube to maintain mercury vapor pressure at the optimum value.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent lamp {{tubes are}} {{typically}} straight and range in length from about [...] for miniature lamps, to [...] for high-output lamps. Some lamps have the tube bent into a circle, used for table lamps or {{other places where}} a more compact light source is desired. Larger U-shaped lamps are used to provide {{the same amount of}} light in a more compact area, and are used for special architectural purposes. <b>Compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> have several small-diameter tubes joined in a bundle of two, four, or six, or a small diameter tube coiled into a helix, to provide a high amount of light output in little volume.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, from June 2007, all homes (and other buildings) in the UK {{would have}} to undergo Energy Performance Certification (also {{commonly}} known as an EPC Certificate) before they are sold or let, {{in order to meet}} the requirements of the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Directive 2002/91/EC). [...] The scheme provides the owner or landlord with an 'energy label' so that they can demonstrate the energy efficiency of the property, and is also included in the new Home Information Packs. The scheme has been criticized for its methodology and superficial approach, especially for old buildings. For example, it ignores thick walls with their low heat transmission, and its recommendations for <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> which can damage sensitive textiles and paintings.|$|E
2500|$|CFLs, {{like all}} {{fluorescent}} lamps, contain {{small amounts of}} mercury, as both vapor and droplets inside the glass tubing, averaging 4.0mg per bulb. The inclusion of liquid mercury is specifically prohibited from other domestic products in some jurisdictions, notably Europe. [...] Safe cleanup of broken <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> is different from cleanup of conventional broken glass or incandescent bulbs. After a proper cleanup, any potential short term exposure offers no significant health risks to adults, including pregnant women, or to children. If all electricity was generated by a coal power plant (which produce about half the electricity the U.S. consumes) and fluorescent light bulbs were all recycled with no mercury being lost, nearly 75% less mercury could be released in power plant emissions if incandescent bulbs were replaced by fluorescents, and with significantly less total mercury release even if no recycling occurred. However, a concern is that broken bulbs will introduce the mercury directly into a populated indoor area. Though more recent analysis indicates that the concerns about mercury release from broken bulbs may be overstated, and can be ameliorated by taking a few simple steps.|$|E
2500|$|This {{may occur}} in <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> with {{integral}} electrical ballasts or in linear lamps. Ballast electronics failure is a somewhat random process {{that follows the}} standard failure profile for any electronic device. There is an initial small peak of early failures, followed by a drop and steady increase over lamp life. Life of electronics is heavily dependent on operating temperature—it typically halves for each 10nbsp&°C temperature rise. The quoted average {{life of a lamp}} is usually at [...] ambient (this may vary by country). The average life of the electronics at this temperature is normally greater than this, so at this temperature, not many lamps will fail due to failure of the electronics. In some fittings, the ambient temperature could be well above this, in which case failure of the electronics may become the predominant failure mechanism. Similarly, running a compact fluorescent lamp base-up will result in hotter electronics, which can cause shorter average life (particularly with higher power rated ones). Electronic ballasts should be designed to shut down the tube when the emission mix runs out as described above. In the case of integral electronic ballasts, since they never have to work again, this is sometimes done by having them deliberately burn out some component to permanently cease operation.|$|E
