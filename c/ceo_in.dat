The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant, who was later appointed as interim <b>CEO.</b> <b>In</b> 2000 Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment.|$|E

The next feature, Robin Hood (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features.

40|$|We examine {{managerial}} decision horizons {{for target}} and acquirer firms in stock financed {{mergers and acquisitions}}.

Acquirer <b>CEOs</b> <b>in</b> cash financed mergers and acquisitions also have longer decision horizons than target <b>CEOs.</b> Acquirer <b>CEOs</b> <b>in</b> both stock and cash financed mergers have significantly higher proportions of equity based compensation and significantly lower proportions of cash based compensation than target <b>CEOs.</b> <b>In</b> logistic regressions, measures of decision horizons for target and acquirer CEOs are not {{significantly related to the}} odds of stock financing in mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, measures of managerial decision horizons are not uniformly higher for stock acquirers or uniformly lower for stock targets on comparison with CEOs of firms of similar size.

5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new <b>CEO</b> <b>in</b> January 1991, he drew {{a symbolic}} salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E

Diversified firms also experience less forced turnover than focused firms.

5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{first entered}} into the {{electronic}} accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based accounting software developer in 1960. The software division was doing well in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came {{at a cost of}} more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed <b>CEO</b> <b>in</b> 1989. He led the company's first large-scale lay-off in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in profit and revenues.|$|E
