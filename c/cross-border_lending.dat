We use a loan-level dataset of Austrian banks to study the characteristics as well as the major driving forces of direct <b>cross-border</b> <b>lending</b> in CESEE and the CIS. Direct <b>cross-border</b> <b>lending</b> to nonbanks by Austrian banks expanded rapidly over the last few years; the bulk of loans is extended to corporate customers and is denominated in a foreign currency, with the euro taking a prominent position. By means of a series of univariate analyses, we provide support for the relevance of geographic proximity – small and mediumsized banks mainly lend to neighboring countries. Banks’ direct lending also seems to follow nonfinancial FDI by Austrian corporates to CESEE and the CIS. We furthermore analyze the interdependencies between direct (i. e. by Austrian headquarters) and indirect (i. e. by local subsidiaries) <b>cross-border</b> <b>lending</b> and find support for a complementary effect between the two.

Our evidence suggests that both FDI and CROSSBANK exert a positive impact on African countries as a whole; an interesting comparison is that consistently, the former has a larger impact than the latter. Moreover, the effect of CROSSBANK becomes negative when the sample is restricted to oil countries. Also, financial reforms {{have a positive impact on}} economic growth in nonoil countries, while they have no growth effect on oil countries.

However, the uncertainties with the advanced economies, particular in the US and the European Union, had negatively affected the local economy and exposed a number of apparent weaknesses with the Indonesian economy.

40|$|This study assesses how banking sector {{integration}} and especially <b>cross-border</b> <b>lending</b> affect macroeconomic stability. I use a two-country {{general equilibrium model}} with heterogeneous banks that are hit by idiosyncratic shocks. According {{to the concept of}} granularity, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms (or: banks) do not have to cancel out under a skewed distribution of firm sizes. Given the highly skewed distribution of bank sizes, macroeconomic stability may thus be affected by shocks to large banks. Hence, to grasp the impact of financial liberalization on aggregate fluctuations, the presence of large banks as measured by high concentration in the banking industry has to be accounted for. I study the role of different forms of banking sector integration - i. e. arms-length crossborder lending versus lending via foreign affiliates - for the stability of aggregate lending. I find that banking sector integration decreases the aggregate volatility of lending due to intensified competition. The model implies that <b>cross-border</b> <b>lending</b> is more stable under lending via foreign affiliates than under arms-length <b>cross-border</b> <b>lending.</b> Cross-border banking, large banks, granularity, volatility...|$|E

In turn, programs oriented towards crisis resolution actually discourage private capital flows. This worrisome finding, given the importance of crisis resolution for the Fund, is mitigated for FDI inflows in the case studies analysed. Finally, all case studies point to the role of conditionality –as opposed to signalling and liquidity– as the strongest channel through which IMF catalyzes private flows. imf, catalytic role, private capital flows...|$|R

Although both types of liberalization can increase the cost-efficiency of lending in the liberalizing country, the distinction arises because opening toward <b>cross-border</b> <b>lending</b> increases competitive pressures (contestability) in the credit market, while takeovers do not.

We identify three reasons for a lack of integration: A lack of international arbitrage, a limited pass-through of interest rate changes onto lending rates, and a limited national and international competitive retail banking environment. The results also suggest that the introduction of the single currency may have already made a positive impact on retail banking market integration. ...|$|R
