5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, Minneapolis {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people.

Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates {{around the turn of the}} <b>century</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of this system. This growth also allowed Minneapolis to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's inner ring suburbs.|$|E
