40|$|Agriculture {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the food chain and water resources for agriculture are essential. A problem is that the water transport systems present low efficiencies in practice. Crop yields must be optimized, and the goal of an operational water manager is to deliver water to irrigation sites accurately and efficiently. In order to fulfill this objective, we propose a centralized overall <b>control</b> <b>diagram</b> to optimize the management of the canal. Our <b>control</b> <b>diagram</b> in real time is mainly composed of two algorithms, CSE and GoRoSoBo. The first one is a powerful tool in canal management, and is able to estimate the real extracted flow in the canal and the hydrodynamic canal state from measured level data at selected points. The second one is an essential tool in the management of the canal, a feedback control algorithm operating in real time. The GoRoSoBo algorithm (Gómez, Rodellar, Soler, Bonet) is able to calculate the optimum gates trajectories for a predictive horizon taking into account the current canal state and the real extracted flow, both obtained by CSE.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{realization}} of a proposed system involving the speed control of induction motor and monitoring of its parameters coupled with overload and overcurrent protection. The applications of induction motors are almost too numerous to mention and hence functioning of these machines at proper speed is necessary to ensure good productivity and safety at affordable costs. Monitoring simplifies the outcomes of complex analysis through detailed diagnosis thereby preventing unscheduled downtimes that result in lost production. Speed control is carried out using Direct Torque Control Space Vector Modulation (DTC-SVM) and monitoring is achieved using LabVIEW software. This paper profoundly explains the vector <b>control</b> <b>diagram</b> of SVM {{as well as the}} LabVIEW software which generates flexible and scalable design, control and test applications at minimal cost supplemented with overload and overcurrent protection, This proposed system improves the adaptability of prevailing systems...|$|E

40|$|Transient faults {{are hard}} to be {{detected}} and located due to their unpredictable nature and short duration, {{and they are the}} dominant causations of system failures, which makes it necessary to consider transient fault-tolerant design in the development of modern safety-critical industrial system. In this paper an approach based on system theory is proposed to tolerate the transient faults in tunnel construction wireless monitoring and control systems (TCWMCS), in which the effects of transient faults are expressed by dysfunction of interactions among software applications. After analyzing the dysfunctional interactions of the system by the operational process model and educing the causes of dysfunction in the functional <b>control</b> <b>diagram,</b> a safety enhancement way was proposed for the designers, in which effictive safety constraints were set up to tolerate the transient faults.
