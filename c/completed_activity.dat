5000|$|A {{network diagram}} {{can be created}} by hand or by using diagram software. There {{are two types of}} network diagrams, {{activity}} on arrow (AOA) and activity on node (AON). Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret. To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named start. This [...] has a duration of zero (0). Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (a and b in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node. Next, since both c and d list a as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from a. Activity e is listed with b and c as predecessor activities, so node e is drawn with arrows coming from both b and c, signifying that e cannot begin until both b and c have been <b>completed.</b> <b>Activity</b> f has d as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities. Likewise, an arrow is drawn from e to g. Since there are no activities that come after f or g, it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled finish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Collaboration is {{understood}} as a central theme in CSCL studies. In this paper, collaboration is explored {{in terms of the}} ways that interactants in a CSCL setting transition from one activity to a next. Rather than simply initiate a next activity upon completion of a current activity, students using the Virtual Math Teams (VMT) environment initiated nextsequence selection sequences, making the choice of a next activity a collaborative matter. While differences in skill and competency may mask the collaborative orientation of actors engaged in math problem solving, the way actors transition from a <b>completed</b> <b>activity</b> to a next activity will demonstrate their orientation to collaboration. In this paper, different nextsequence selection sequences as they are deployed in VMT sessions are identified, described and examined for how they support collaboration. Collaboration and the Coordination of Action Social interaction is comprised of sequences of actions (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973; Sacks, 1992; Schegloff, 2007). When one interaction sequence is completed, a transition to another sequence becomes relevant. How the transition between sequences is accomplished is both consequential for and a consequence of the way participants conduct themselves within sequences. In face-to-face interactions, turn-taking mechanisms an...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral {{students}} {{have often been}} described as apprentices engaged in workplace learning. Further, assumptions are frequently made in the literature about the common nature of such learning experiences, e. g., in the sciences, research-related practices are learned in a lab within the supervisor’s program and team. A few recent studies of the science doctoral experience have challenged this view arguing such assumptions may overlook considerable variation. This longitudinal study, using frequently <b>completed</b> <b>activity</b> logs and an interview, reports on the research-related practices of twelve UK science doctoral students. The analysis, particularly of the logs, challenged some of the literature-based assumptions: students often chose to work in institutional offices, non-institutional sites and their homes rather than in labs; they did not necessarily engage regularly with a research team, nor were they necessarily engaged in a project directly linked to their supervisors’. That students chose not to work in traditionally assumed places suggests the importance of attending to: a) student agency, b) how research-related practices may be changing, and c) how sites of doctoral learning might need to be reconceived. As well, the findings suggest the value of non-traditional data collection methods in capturing variation in experience...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} promote low {{threshold}} smoking cessation, a campaign was organized by the Swiss Society of Pharmacists in 616 Swiss pharmacies. The evaluation of this project took into consideration the actual smoking cessation counselling and the attitudes towards the campaign and tobacco prevention of {{the person responsible for}} the campaign in the pharmacy. Consultations with smokers were documented in activity statistics one week before and throughout the six weeks of the campaign. The attitude was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. 32 % of the participating pharmacies <b>completed</b> <b>activity</b> statistics, 58 % participated in the attitude survey. Frequency of counselling was best predicted by the customer pattern of pharmacies. The highest frequency was observed among pharmacies with a majority of non regular customers. Intensity of counselling was best predicted by the extent of preliminary training of the pharmacy personnel. The most positive view towards tobacco prevention and the highest degree of interest in a future campaign were shown by the campaign responsibilities of pharmacies characterized with both frequent and intensive counselling activity. The results of this study show that pharmacies can play a role in offering low threshold smoking cessation programs. Major pre-requisites for this are motivation with regard to prevention, as well as continuing education of pharmacists and the pharmacy personnel...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a random {{continuing}} professional development (CPD) portfolio audit to assess the portfolios of pharmacists who completed CPD training in the state of North Carolina and reported adopting it in place of the annual 15 -hour continuing education (CE) requirement when applying for re-licensure. Methods: The NC Board of Phar-macy (NCBOP) staff randomly selected 30 pharmacists to provide CPD portfolio documentation to the Board electronically or in paper format. This documentation included their completed learning plan, a learning activity worksheet for each <b>completed</b> <b>activity,</b> and the Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE) universal activity number for the CPD training program attended. The Task Force used a multicomponent audit tool to assess each portfolio. Results: Eighty percent of portfolios had at least 15 hours of learning reported. Portfolio assessments indicated an average of 5 learning objectives per individual. Based on the scale of 1 to 5, the Measurable and Specific sections of the objectives scored the lowest with an average score of 3 on both sections. An overall assessment of ‘‘adequate’ ’ or ‘‘comprehensive’ ’ was noted for 60 % of the portfolios. Conclusion: Phar-macists completing CPD training are capable of following the CPD process with some potential challenges in documentation.

40|$|Introduction A {{reported}} {{advantage of}} simulation-based learning environments (SLE) over clinical placements (CPs) {{is that the}} former can provide a greater number and breadth of opportunities to practice level-appropriate clinical skills compared with the random patient presentations provided during the latter. Although logical and widely accepted as fact, we find no published evidence to demonstrate the magnitude, nor indeed veracity, of this assumption. We therefore sought to quantify the clinical skills practiced by entry-level paramedicine students attending a well-selected CP compared with an equal dosage of SLE. Methods N= 37 first-year paramedicine students <b>completed</b> <b>activity</b> diaries during 3  days of CP and 3  days of SLE. Opportunities to practice clinical skills were quantified and coded as either: level-appropriate, beyond-level or of non-discipline relevance. Results During SLE, the average student was exposed 226 times to 11 level-appropriate clinical procedures. During CP the average student was exposed 48 times to 24 clinical procedures, the majority relevant to paramedicine (63 %), but a minority level-appropriate (38 %). Students’ opportunities for supervised, ‘hands on’ practice represented only 10 % of exposures in either SLE or CP {{but in terms of}} raw numbers of level-appropriate opportunities, SLE provided more than CP (n= 23 vs 2). Discussion Our results confirm that SLE provides substantially more opportunities than CP for students to practice level-appropriate skills and is therefore more appropriate for repetitive practice. However, CP is likely to remain useful to students for practicing interpersonal skills and contextualisation of knowledge within the broader health system. Educators should therefore carefully articulate learning objectives before choosing between SLE and CP...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The authors {{evaluated}} {{the accuracy of}} three automated accelerometer wear-time estimation algorithms against self-report. Direct effects on sedentary time (= 1952 cpm) time were examined. Methods A subsample from the 2004 / 2005 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (n= 148) <b>completed</b> <b>activity</b> logs and wore accelerometers {{for a total of}} 987 days. A published algorithm that allows movement within non-wear periods (Algorithm 1) was compared with one that allows less movement (Algorithm 2) or no movement (Algorithm 3). Implications for population estimates were examined using 2003 / 2004 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. Results Mean difference per day between the criterion and estimated wear time was negligible for all three algorithms (= 2 h). Respectively, the algorithms (1, 2 and 3) misclassified sedentary time as non-wear on 31. 9 %, 19. 4 % and 18 % of days and misclassified non-wear time as sedentary on 42. 8 %, 43. 7 % and 51. 3 % of days. Use of Algorithm 2 (compared with Algorithm 1) affected population estimates of sedentary time (higher by 20 min/day) but not MVPA time. Agreement between Algorithms 1 and 2 was good for MVPA time (mean difference - 0. 08, LOA: - 2. 08, 1. 91 min), but not for wear time or sedentary time. Conclusion Accelerometer wear time can be estimated accurately on average; however, misclassification can be substantial for individuals. Algorithm choice affects estimates of sedentary time. Allowing very limited movement within non-wear periods can improve accuracy...|$|E

Ss <b>completed</b> <b>activity</b> levels 1, 2, and 3, as well as Stages 1 and 2 of the DiGXT. Means and standard error of the means were {{used to describe the}} data in a descriptive fashion. An ANOVA with repeated measures and a Scheffe test were used to analyze the following variables : HR, SBP, and DBP. A t-test for paired means also was used to analyze HR, SBP, and DBP. Sig diff (pC. 01) were found among the resting DBP values. There were no sig diff between the resting and post-exercise HR, SBP, and DBP responses to the 4 activity levels. Sig diff (pC. 01) was found among the HR and SBP responses to the 2 activity levels as compared to the 2 stages of the DiGXT. Sig diff (pC. 01) was found between the HR response to activity level 4 and the DiGXT stage 3. Thus, sig diff were demonstrated among the HR and SBP responses recorded after completing phase I activities and the responses recorded during the DiGXT at similar MET levels.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{challenges}} and {{prospects of the}} teaching of the Doppler Effect to grade 12 learners. The challenges of teaching the Doppler Effect were established and these findings influenced the development of activities. These activities were tested, refined and re-tested in an iterative cycle and finally provided prospects on teaching the Doppler Effect. Educational Design Research (EDR) was used to bridge theory and practice in education. This study was done in the Vhembe district in the Limpopo province. In the first cycle, questionnaires and interviews with 32 teachers and a subject advisor were used to establish the baseline with regards to the challenges of teaching the Doppler Effect. After the analysis of the data which forms the first cycle of EDR, the content and methodological problems faced by teachers when teaching the Doppler Effect were revealed. In the second cycle of the EDR, learning activities were developed that was informed by the analysis and tried out in 2 schools by learners and their teachers. <b>Completed</b> <b>activity</b> sheets were marked and the results were used to determine if there were a correlation between the activity sheets and the written test. Problems were documented and changes to the activities were again made and tried out in 10 schools by 216 learners with the help of 10 teachers. The data collected from the learners` work sheets were analysed. Pearson`s product moment correlation has shown that there is a statistically significant relationship (r = 0. 65; p < 0. 01) that exists between these design-research activities and solving of problems on the Doppler Effect.

Of 2353 Sydney schoolchildren surveyed (median age 12. 7 years), 1, 213 were re-examined 5 years later at age 17 - 18. Children <b>completed</b> <b>activity</b> and food-frequency questionnaires. An unhealthy behavior score was calculated, allocating 1 point for the following: ≤ 60 minutes of total physical activity/ day; ≥ 2 hours of screen time/ day; consumed salty snack foods and/or confectionery ≥ 5 times per week; ≥ 1 serves of soft drinks and/or cordial/ day; and not consuming both ≥ 2 serves of fruit and ≥ 3 serves of vegetables/ day. Health-related QOL was assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). The prevalence of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lifestyle risk factors was 4. 2 %, 17. 1 %, 30. 7 %, 30. 5 %, 13. 9 % and 3. 6 %, respectively. After multivariable- adjustment, children engaging in 5 versus 0 unhealthy behaviors had 9. 2 -units lower PedsQL physical summary score (ptrend= 0. 001), five years later. Boys reporting 4 or 5 lifestyle risk factors compared to their peers reporting none or one at baseline, had lower total and physical summary scores at follow-up, ptrend= 0. 02 and 0. 01, respectively. Girls engaging in 4 or 5 versus 0 or 1 unhealthy behaviors, had 4. 6 -units lower physical summary score (ptrend= 0. 04), five years later. The number of obesogenic lifestyle risk factors was independently associated with subsequent poorer QOL, particularly physical health, during adolescence.
