40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} the proposal that a central function of <b>commitments</b> within joint action {{is to reduce}} various kinds of uncertainty, and that this accounts for the prevalence of <b>commitments</b> in joint action. While this idea is prima facie attractive, we argue that it faces two serious problems. First, <b>commitments</b> can only reduce uncertainty if they are credible, and accounting for the credibility of <b>commitments</b> proves not to be straightforward. Second, {{there are many other}} ways in which uncertainty is commonly reduced within joint actions, which raises the possibility that <b>commitments</b> may be superfluous. Nevertheless, we argue that the existence of these alternative uncertainty reduction processes does not make <b>commitments</b> superfluous after all but, rather, helps to explain how <b>commitments</b> may contribute in various ways to uncertainty reduction. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{credible}} <b>commitments</b> in alliance. management {{in general and}} joint venture (JV) management in particular is under-developed. Credible <b>commitments</b> are a key concept in both new institutional economics (NIE) and transaction costs economics (TCE). Yet, the term is not clearly defined. Within joint ventures, credible <b>commitments</b> are both the cause and solution to alliance opportunism. As a solution, making and seeking credible <b>commitments</b> serve the purpose of safeguarding JV partnership by creating a mutual holdup situation. But on the other hand, credible <b>commitments</b> often appear in conjunction with relation-specific investment and become a cause of opportunism.

40|$|This report {{examines}} services schedules of <b>commitments</b> in 56 {{regional trade}} agreements (RTAs) where an OECD {{country is a}} party. The preferential content of RTAs is assessed through an analysis of market access and national treatment <b>commitments</b> {{at the level of}} the 155 sub-sectors of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Sectoral Classification List. Partial <b>commitments</b> are broken down according to nine categories of non-conforming measures. The report confirms that on average RTAs in services go beyond GATS with <b>commitments</b> in about 72 % of sub-sectors, among which 42 % correspond to preferential bindings (GATS-plus <b>commitments).</b> In addition, the report provides an overview of rules of origin for services providers and MFN clauses in services chapters in order to see whether <b>commitments</b> granted might be extended to non-parties to minimise discrimination among foreign services suppliers. Despite the heterogeneity found in schedules of <b>commitments,</b> there is a certain degree of commonality in new and improved <b>commitments</b> that suggests that multilateralising RTAs is achievable. The multilateralisation of services <b>commitments</b> would however imply a more symmetric and systematic liberalisation than what is seen in the schedules of RTAs.

40|$|International {{trade in}} {{educational}} services has grown substantially {{over the past}} decades. Now it is a billion dollar industry including recruitment of international students, establishment of university campuses abroad, franchised provision and on line education. WTO requires each member nation to make its own schedule of <b>commitments</b> in education services, and to explain its limitations on market access and national treatment {{as well as other}} limitations. In the schedules of <b>commitments,</b> <b>commitments</b> are split into two sections: First, “horizontal” <b>commitments</b> which stipulate limitations that apply to all of the sectors included in the schedule; these often refer to a particular mode of supply, notably commercial presence and the presence of natural persons. Any evaluation of sector-specific <b>commitments</b> must therefore take the horizontal entries into account. Second, specific <b>commitments</b> which apply to trade in services in a particular sector or subsector are listed.

Current approaches into <b>commitments</b> have conceived these representations and evolved the <b>commitments</b> as “world-wide” states called moments.

The contributions of this paper are threefold: first, we reformulate BST-logic from philosophical perspective to computational logic being used in computer science discipline; second, we enhance this logic with social <b>commitments</b> (propositional and conditional) and space-like modalities; and third, we present a new semantics model for social <b>commitments</b> and twoparty operations that manipulate <b>commitments</b> in the same framework...|$|R
