METHOD An experimental, randomized, controlled, prospective, interventional clinical case study using a quantitative approach. The sample consisted of 32 diabetic patients of both genders. Participants were randomly divided into four groups. Doppler Ultrasound evaluation of the Ankle-Brachial Index, brief pain inventory and analog pain scale were performed at baseline and after 30 days. RESULTS Reduced pain was observed in the Low-level laser therapy and Low-level laser therapy associated with Essential Fatty Acids groups (p< 0. 01). Regarding the Ankle-Brachial Index and Doppler Ultrasound, all groups remained stable. By analyzing lesion area reduction, Low-level laser therapy associated with Essential fatty acids group showed a significance of p= 0. 0032, and the Low-level laser therapy group showed p= 0. 0428.

The present study is based on the preparation of DFS topical gel for the purpose of obtaining optimized gel which will give better results considering the formulation and patient compliance. For the preparation of topical gel carbopol polymer and different excipients are used for final preparation. The <b>calendula</b> <b>oil</b> is used as penetration enhancer in this final formulation in different concentration. These formulations with and without <b>calendula</b> <b>oil</b> were compared with marketed preparation with respect to its permeation, pH, viscosity, spreadability, extrudability.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Aging can be {{described}} as an extremely complex occurrence from which no organism can be excluded. Intrinsic and extrinsic aging make out the two components of skin aging and they differ on the macromolecular level while sharing specific molecular characteristics which include elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) while collagen synthesis decreases. The skin functions as a protective barrier against the harsh environment and is essential for regulating body temperature. The stratum corneum (SC) is responsible for the main resistance to the penetration of most compounds; nevertheless the skin represents as an appropriate target for delivery. The target site for anti-aging treatment includes the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. <b>Calendula</b> <b>oil</b> and L-carnitine L-tartrate was utilised as the cosmeceutical actives as they can be classified as a mixed category of compounds/products that lie between cosmetics and drugs. Both show excellent properties which can prove valuable during anti-aging treatment, whether it is due to the scavenging of ROS (<b>calendula</b> <b>oil),</b> moisturising effects (<b>calendula</b> <b>oil</b> and L-carnitine L-tartrate) or the improvement of the skin turnover rate (L-carnitine L-tartrate). The Pheroid™ delivery system can enhance the absorption of a selection of active ingredients. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the Pheroid™ delivery system will enhance the flux and/or delivery of the named actives to the target site by performing Franz cell diffusion studies over an 8 h period, followed by tape stripping experiments. The Pheroid™ results of the actives were compared to the results obtained when 1 00 % <b>calendula</b> <b>oil</b> was applied and the L-carnitine L-tartrate was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. In the case of <b>calendula</b> <b>oil</b> only a qualitative gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method could be employed. No <b>calendula</b> <b>oil</b> was observed to permeate through the skin, but linoleic acid (marker compound) was present in the epidermis and dermis layers. Components in the Pheroid™ delivery system hampered the results as the marker compound identified is a fundamental component of the Pheroid™, making it difficult to determine whether or not the Pheroid™ delivery system enhanced calendula oil's penetration. The aqueous solubility and log D partition coefficient of L-carnitine L-tartrate was determined. Inspection of the log D value of - 1. 35 indicated that the compound is unfavourable to penetrate the skin, whereas the aqueous solubility of 16. 63 mg/ml in PBS at a temperature of 32 º C indicated favourable penetration. During the Franz cell diffusion and tape stripping studies it was determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) that carnitine may be inherent to human skin. Pheroid™ enhanced the flux (average of 0. 0361 µg/cm 2. h, median of 0. 0393 µg/cm 2. h) of the L-carnitine L-tartrate when compared to PBS (average of 0. 0180 µg/cm 2. h, median of 0. 0142 µg/cm 2. h) for the time interval of 2 - 8 h. The PBS was more effective in delivering the active to the target site (0. 270 µg/ml in the epidermis and 2. 403 µg/ml in the dermis) than Pheroid™ (0. 111 µg/ml and 1. 641 µg/ml in the epidermis and dermis respectively). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed the entrapment of L-carnitine L-tartrate in the Pheroid™ vesicle, while in the case of <b>calendula</b> <b>oil</b> it was impossible to differentiate between the oil and the Pheroid™ components.

40|$|The {{difference}} in <b>Calendula</b> <b>oil</b> quality from fractions obtained after seed classification is enormous. The oil quality varies from excellent to very poor, according to important aspects {{such as in}} the hulls and dust fraction, high free fatty acid values (13 % vs. 0. 6 %) are found. This {{can be explained by the}} presence of active lipase enzymes in this fraction, possibly from fungal or microbial sources. In general, <b>Calendula</b> <b>oil</b> deterioration will occur after long periods of post-harvest storage due to seed damage and unfavourable quality conditions regarding moisture, temperature and enzymatic activity. The dark oil colour is probably caused by chemical/enzymatic oxidation and hydrolyzation and is very persistent during the chemical refining steps as degumming, refining, bleaching and deodorising. Processing the oil directly after harvesting, combined with nitrogen flushing and cold storage will probably prevent the formation of a dark colour. Lab-scale refining has shown that an excellent oil quality can be produced using a good initial oil quality. The use of high temperatures (200 °C or higher) for oil deodorisation will cause modification and polymerisation and the formation of calendic acid isomers. <b>Calendula</b> <b>oil</b> is rich in gamma (1800 - 1900 ppm) and alpha (270 ppm) tocopherol and its content is not affected by processing or refining and is relatively high compared to other tocopherol-rich sources such as soybean or maize oil. Recovery of these tocopherols can be of interest, both as a by-product (vitamin E) and to obtain reactive oils (low in anti-oxidant). However, special care must be taken to avoid changing the reactive character of the conjugated triens present in the oil. High temperatures should similarly be avoided while developing a mild process for oil deodorisation and tocopherol removal.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycoplasmosis is {{a common}} {{infection}} in human and veterinary medicine, and is associated with chronic inflammation and high morbidity. Mycoplasma species are often intrinsically resistant to many conventional antimicrobial therapies, and the resistance patterns of pathogenic mycoplasmas to commonly used medicinal (antimicrobial) plant extracts are currently unknown. Methods Aqueous extracts, ethanol extracts, or oils of the targeted plant species and colloidal silver were prepared or purchased. Activity against the wall-less bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri was determined and compared to activities measured against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution assays. The lethal or inhibitory nature of each extract was determined by subculture into neat growth medium. Results Growth of M. mycoides capri, E. coli, and B. subtilis was inhibited by elderberry extract, oregano oil, ethanol extract of oregano leaves, and ethanol extract of goldenseal root. No inhibition was seen with aqueous extract of astragalus or <b>calendula</b> <b>oil.</b> Growth of M. mycoides capri and B. subtilis was inhibited by ethanol extract of astragalus, whereas growth of E. coli was not. Similarly, M. mycoides capri and E. coli were inhibited by aqueous extract of thyme, but B. subtilis was unaffected. Only B. subtilis was inhibited by colloidal silver. Measured MICs ranged from 0. 0003 mg/mL to 3. 8 mg/mL. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects differed by species and extract. Conclusions The atypical pathogen M. mycoides capri was sensitive to extracts from many medicinal plants commonly used as antimicrobials in states of preparation and concentrations currently available for purchase in the United States and Europe. Variation in bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities between species and extracts indicates that multiple effecter compounds are present in these plant species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Daughter {{products}} of vegetable oils {{can be used}} as binders and additives. The author presents a research project carried out at iLF Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft Lacke und Farben mbH (Magdeburg, Germany). Within the scope of this research project the daughter {{products of}} vegetable oils are used as binders of lacquers. Especially, the author investigates cationically and radically ultraviolet cured lacquer systems and binary materials whose components are connected thermally by vinolygic addition reactions or epoxide-amine addition reactions. Source materials are rapeseed oil, rapeseed methyl ester, linseed oil, ricinus oil, dragon's head oil, oligomerized derivates of linseed oil and alkyd resins of linseed pil. The PRILESHAEV reaction with buffered peracetic acid provides the best results with respect to the production of epoxidized vegetable oils. This type of reaction is not suitable for the synthesis of conjuene oils such as <b>calendula</b> <b>oil.</b> Epoxides and epoxyacrylates are synthesized on the basis of rapeseed oil and dragon's head oil. The properties of these epoxides and epoxyacrylates are comparable to the properties of commercial epoxides or epoxyacrylates of soya oil or linseed oil. Polyols as intermediates are prepared from epoxidized vegetable oil. Due to ether bridges in polyol molecules, polyols have higher molecular weights and less hydroxyl groups as theoretically expected. These polyols are transfered into acetoacetate functionalized binders by transesterification with tert-butyl acetoacetate. A consecutive reaction with n-butyl amine yields to corresponding enamines. Vegetable oil acetoacetates as well as the enamines of the vegetable oils can be cross-linked thermally by vinylogic addition reactions with acrylates. The mechanical and chemical resistance of the epoxides and epoxyacrylates depends on the cross-linking density. In the light of the use of vegetable oils as a lacquer ressouce, one should look at a high functionality, low viscosity and a minimal molecular size.
