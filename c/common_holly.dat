"I {{must say}} {{it is the most}} {{peculiar}} present I ever saw, and it is my belief that the boy who brought it stole whatever article of value it contained, for it was very carelessly done up. No person in their senses would send a few sprigs of <b>common</b> <b>holly</b> to a young lady in this odd way," [...] said Prue, poking here and there in hopes of finding some clue.|$|E
60|$|In {{the several}} works which I have consulted, one author alone {{says that the}} holly is dioecious. (7/13. Vaucher 'Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe' 1841 tome 2 page 11.) During several years I have {{examined}} many plants, but have never found one that was really hermaphrodite. I mention this genus because the stamens in the female flowers, although quite destitute of pollen, are but slightly and sometimes not at all shorter than the perfect stamens in the male flowers. In the latter the ovary is small and the pistil is almost aborted. The filaments of the perfect stamens adhere for a greater length to the petals than in the female flowers. The corolla of the latter is rather smaller {{than that of the}} male. The male trees produce a greater number of flowers than the females. Asa Gray informs me that I. opaca, which represents in the United States our <b>common</b> <b>holly,</b> appears (judging from dried flowers) to be in a similar state; and so it is, according to Vaucher, with several other but not with all the species of the genus.|$|E
50|$|The main {{trees in}} the range are willow and European alder close to water courses, as well as chestnut, ash, common hazel, oak and <b>common</b> <b>holly.</b> Above 1600 m there is brushland with tree heath and juniper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resemblance}} of {{the foliage}} {{to that of}} the <b>common</b> European <b>holly</b> Ilex aquifolium, has led to its common and botanic names. The name [...] was originally the classical Latin name for the holm oak, but later adopted as a botanical genus name for the hollies.|$|R
5000|$|Comarostaphylis diversifolia, {{known by}} the <b>common</b> names summer <b>holly</b> and California comarostaphylos, is a species of shrub in the heath family.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the plant}} species {{protected}} in the forst include; common beech, common chestnut (largest deposit in the country), <b>common</b> yew, European <b>holly,</b> Heldreich's maple, Albanian lilly, Medicago carstiensis.|$|R
50|$|Patches of scrub with {{emergent}} {{tree species}} have developed on slopes, common components {{of which are}} hawthorn (Crataegus sp.), buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), <b>common</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium), wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), whitebeam and field maple (Acer campestre). Ash and wych elm (Ulmus glabra) form two stands on north-facing slopes on the eastern margins of the downs. The ground cover in these woods contains several species typical of those found in ancient woodland.|$|E
50|$|Avala {{is known}} for its diverse plant life, despite not being a tall mountain. There are over 600 plant species living on the mountain. Some of them are {{protected}} by the law as natural rarities, like certain types of laburnum, box tree, black broom, <b>common</b> <b>holly</b> and martagon lily. The area is also abundant in medical herbs, like the early-purple orchid and belladonna. Almost 70% of Avala is forested. High woods mostly consist of durmast oak, Turkey oak, hornbeam, beech, linden, black pine, black locust and other trees.|$|E
5000|$|Ilex aquifolium (holly, <b>common</b> <b>holly,</b> English holly, European holly, or {{occasionally}} Christmas holly), is {{a species}} of holly native to western and southern Europe, northwest Africa, and southwest Asia. I. aquifolium is the species familiar in Christmas decoration, and {{is regarded as the}} type species of the genus Ilex, which by association is also called [...] "holly". It is a evergreen tree or shrub found, for example, in shady areas of forests of oak and in beech hedges. It has a great capacity to adapt to different conditions and is a pioneer species that repopulates the margins of forests or clearcuts.|$|E
50|$|Insect life is also {{rich and}} varied, {{with more than}} 20 kinds of {{butterfly}} seen on the reserve, including ringlet, <b>common</b> blue, <b>holly</b> blue, peacock, red admiral, painted lady, green-veined white, comma, gatekeeper, small skipper, large skipper, meadow brown, purple hairstreak, small heath and small copper and, rarely, brimstone and clouded yellow. There {{is also a great}} variety of damselflies and dragonflies.|$|R
50|$|Grevillea aquifolium is a shrubby or {{scrambling}} plant {{endemic to}} South Australia and Victoria. <b>Common</b> names include <b>holly</b> grevillea, prickly grevillea or variable prickly grevillea. In occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and heathland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scientific}} name heterophyllus, [...] "different leaves", {{refers to the}} variation in leaf shape between spiny and entire. The <b>common</b> name <b>holly</b> osmanthus refers to the similarity in leaf shape {{to that of the}} holly (Ilex aquifolium), an example of convergent evolution with a common objective of deterring browsing; the two may be distinguished easily by the leaf arrangement, alternate in Ilex aquifolium and opposite in Osmanthus heterophyllus.|$|R
5000|$|The area of Relva was {{pristine}} {{forest and}} unoccupied grasslands, virgin fields, {{where the first}} explorers discovered forests of laurel, <b>common</b> <b>holly,</b> Portuguese laurel and Juniperus brevifolia, interspersed by local Vaccinium. The region, which extends to the border with Santa Clara and Feteiras, became {{a place where the}} pigs sent ashore by the first settlers congregated, and where many of nobles of Vila Franca do Campo hunted. Travelling by boat to the shore Santa Clara, these hunters would disembark and spend several days hunting for the semi-feral pigs, then returned to the settlements with their prizes. Slowly, the region began to be occupied by the first families, houses, fields and estates, developing the community of Ponta Delgada, and encroaching on the unspoiled lands to the west.|$|E
40|$|A {{phytochemical}} {{study of}} the outer bark of native <b>common</b> <b>holly</b> (Ilex aquifolium), led to the isolation and identification of nine novel fatty acid esters of the pentacyclic triterpene a-amyrin. These compounds were the oleate, linoleate, hepladcctrienoate, decanoate, myristate, pentadecanoate, palmitate, heptadecanoate and stearate esters of the triterpene. Studies on the outer bark of native birch (Betula ubescens) led to the isolation and identification of the pentacyclic triterpenes betulin and lupeol. Oxidation of belulin {{led to the formation}} of betulonic acid, which in turn was reduced and acetylated to yield betulinic monoacetate. Both of these derivatives are naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoids. The barks of two non-native or exotic species of birch (Betula ermanii and Betula papyrifera) were also investigated and this study resulted in the isolation of two further pentacyclic triterpenes; oleanolic acid and oleanolic monoacetate. The molecular structures of these compounds and their synthetic derivatives were elucidated using the following modern chemical and spectroscopic methods and techniques; 13 C & JH NMR, FT-IR and GC/MS. In addition, an extensive literature review for the medicinal and commercial applications of the triterpenoids was undertaken...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{project will be}} centred on the revegetation of mine waste in Frank Milles mine situated in Teign Valley, Devon. The Teigh Valley {{has a long history}} of mining activity, which has left a legacy of metalliferous spoil tips, with serious implications for the environmental suitability, quality of soils and water systems in the Teign catchment. This research compared spoil waste and revegetated soil on mine tailings that can be found in the site, in order to assess the success of reclaimed area in terms of fertility, pH, and water retention improvement in soil and reduction of total metal concentration and metal bioavailability. To study the success of the reclaimed site, 3 different sampling points in the soil and spoil were taken for determination of total metals concentration, nutrients and concentration metals bioavailability by ICP-MS, determination of nitrogen content by skalar instrument, loss on ignition, determination of soil pH and soil buffer pH and composition of organic matter by CHN analyser. Heavy metal accumulation in leaves of common bent (Agrotis Capillaris), common goarse (Ullex Europeaus, <b>common</b> <b>holly</b> (Illex aquifollium) and Beech (Fagus Silvatica) were also determined by EDTA extraction before to ICP- MS analysis. The results from this study conclude that the Frank Mills revegetated site is an example of reclamation success in terms of a self- sustainable system. High moisture content (45 %), organic matter (27 %) and higher concentration of nutrients were encountered at a 10 - 40 cm depth, hence, the fertility of the site had improved. Similar characteristics (pH, moisture and organic matter content, grain size and metals concentrations) of soil and spoil were encountered at more than 45 cm depth. High concentrations of metals in the soil have been reported in Frank Mills, as a consequence of its closeness to the spoil. This is a result of site contaminated by dispersion of heavy metals through wind, water and gravitational as pathway of dispersion. Also, the revegetation Frank Mills provides benefits to the environment. Reduction of visual impact and improvement of landscape and reduction of metal pollution into the environment thanks to vegetation cover and canopy of trees reduce metal dispersion by fluvial, aeolean and gravitational pathways...|$|E

50|$|Michael tells Holly he {{will treat}} her poorly {{in front of}} Jan during her baby shower {{because he has a}} vested {{interest}} in Jan's baby, which is not his. Despite being told of this, she is shown to be uncomfortable with Michael's attitude toward her. However, despite witnessing Michael's treatment of Holly throughout the day, Jan notices the two of them have a lot in <b>common</b> after <b>Holly</b> makes jokes in front of her. Jan then orders Michael not to date Holly before driving away. This, in addition to feeling no connection with Jan's baby, prompts Michael to apologetically hug Holly and ask her out on a date, which she accepts, visibly moved.|$|R
50|$|Dendles Wood is a {{representative}} example of upland oakwood, consisting predominantly of pedunculate oak. However, {{there are also}} a number of beech trees, located to the east and south-west of the wood and growing in number. Beech is a genus that is not thought to be a native to any other part of Dartmoor. There are also a few species of shrub found throughout the wood, namely the <b>common</b> hazel, European <b>holly</b> and rowan.|$|R
5000|$|Most hollies (members of {{the genus}} Ilex) are dioecious. Each plant {{produces}} either functionally male flowers or functionally female flowers. In Ilex aquifolium (see the illustration), the <b>common</b> European <b>holly,</b> both kinds of flower have four sepals and four white petals; male flowers have four stamens, female flowers usually have four non-functional reduced stamens and a four-celled ovary. Since only female plants are able to set fruit and produce berries, this has consequences for gardeners. Amborella represents the first known group of flowering plants to separate from their common ancestor. It too is dioecious; at any one time, each plant produces either flowers with functional stamens but no carpels, or flowers with a few non-functional stamens {{and a number of}} fully functional carpels. However, Amborella plants may change their [...] "sex" [...] over time. In one study, five cuttings from a male plant produced only male flowers when they first flowered, but at their second flowering three switched to producing female flowers.|$|R
