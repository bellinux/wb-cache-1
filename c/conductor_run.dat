50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper <b>conductors</b> <b>run</b> within wall or ceiling cavities, passing through joist and stud drill-holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes, and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|R
50|$|The {{small wooden}} house has hinged walls and carries a brass rod {{representing}} a lightning rod. A {{section of the}} <b>conductor</b> <b>runs</b> along {{a piece of wood}} placed on the façade. Inside the house is a spark gap housed in a small brass cylinder containing a small quantity of gunpowder.When the piece of wood is removed, the lightning-conductor circuit is broken. The lightning bolt, simulated by a spark generated by a Leyden jar, ignites the powder, whose explosion causes the house to collapse. If, instead, the piece of wood is positioned correctly, the electricity will be discharged to the ground, leaving the house intact.Filippo Lucci depicted a similar device in the Stanzino of the Matematiche of the Uffizi Gallery in 1780—clear evidence of the popularity of such demonstrations in the late eighteenth century.|$|R

50|$|The main {{benefits}} of fiber are its exceptionally low loss (allowing long distances between amplifiers/repeaters), its {{absence of ground}} currents and other parasite signal and power issues common to long parallel electric <b>conductor</b> <b>runs</b> (due to its reliance on light rather than electricity for transmission, and the dielectric nature of fiber optic), and its inherently high data-carrying capacity. Thousands of electrical links {{would be required to}} replace a single high bandwidth fiber cable. Another benefit of fibers is that even when run alongside each other for long distances, fiber cables experience effectively no crosstalk, in contrast to some types of electrical transmission lines. Fiber can be installed in areas with high electromagnetic interference (EMI), such as alongside utility lines, power lines, and railroad tracks. Nonmetallic all-dielectric cables are also ideal for areas of high lightning-strike incidence.|$|R

50|$|Laithwaite {{developed}} a repulsive-based maglev using two long conductors set {{on either side}} of a flux plate. The <b>conductors</b> <b>ran</b> down the top of the plate off the end, were bent through 180 degrees, and then ran back {{along the top of the}} plate, forming a long U-shape. Running current through the loops of wire caused magnetic fields that were repulsive over the loops, and attractive in the area between them. This meant that if the motor became uncentered compared to the stator plate, it would naturally feel a force pulling it back to the center. The only downside of this approach is that the vehicle in proper alignment feels both attractive and repulsive forces, meaning that greater energy is needed to provide the required amount of lift. The system did not provide thrust, only lift, so the team proposed to place a thin LIM between the two lift coils.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{electric}} utilities built by Thomas Edison {{in the early}} 1880s ran on direct current (DC) at 110 V, {{considered to be a}} [...] "safe" [...] voltage for consumers. Alternating current systems that started appearing mid decade used a high distribution voltage but stepped that down via transformers to the same 110 volt customer utilization voltage that Edison used. In 1883 Edison patented a three wire distribution system to allow DC generation plants to serve a wider radius of customers to save on copper costs. By connecting two groups of 110 volt lamps in series, more load could be served by the same size <b>conductors</b> <b>run</b> with 220 volts between them; a neutral conductor carried any imbalance of current between the two sub-circuits. AC circuits adopted the same form, allowing lamps to be run at around 120 volts and major appliances to be connected to 240 volts.

40|$|The transvenous {{defibrillation}} {{lead was}} a critical tech-nological step that enabled widespread adoption of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. This lead is the most vulnerable component of the ICD system. It must remain chemically inert in a hostile biological envi-ronment, withstand flexing for {{hundreds of millions of}} car-diac cycles, and retain electrical integrity during shocks that would trip a household circuit breaker. Reliability issues concerning leads have led to the rethinking of lead design, reexamination of preclinical testing, implementation of algorithms that warn of lead failure and reduce inappropriate shocks, design of leads that can be extracted more easily, and development of a totally subcutaneous ICD system. The present review summarizes clinical aspects of defibrillation leads and reviews diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lead failure. Design and Failure Modes: Engineering–Clinical Correlations Please see the online-only Data Supplement for a brief sum-mary of the engineering of lead design. Structural Overview Right ventricular (RV) defibrillation leads comprise a distal tip electrode with a fixation mechanism that anchors the lead to the heart, proximal terminals that connect to the genera-tor, and a lead body that connects the two (Figure 1 A). The lead body consists of a flexible insulating cylinder with 3 to 6 parallel longitudinal lumens through which <b>conductors</b> <b>run</b> from the proximal terminals to small pace-sense electrodes and larger shock coil electrodes. This multilumen design (Figure 1 B) permits more conductors in smaller-diameter leads than older coaxial designs. 1 The subcutaneous ICD uses a parasternal electrode in which the larger shock coil is strad-dled by 2 small sensing electrodes (Figure 1 C) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{standardised method}} of wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was knob and tube (K&T) wiring: single <b>conductors</b> were <b>run</b> through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs {{attached to the}} structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires.

This line, which {{is only in the}} proximity of {{the converter}} station and the cable terminal equipped with a ground conductor, was originally used by the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1 and from Vester Hassing until a point a few kilometres south of the cable terminal by the electrode line, which turned there eastwards to the ground electrode at Soera. At implementation of Konti-Skan 2 the whole overhead electrode line was replaced by two 27 km long underground cables and the second conductor of the overhead line got the high-voltage pole of Konti-Skan 2. The 23 km long submarine cable to the Danish island of Laeso starts at Stensnaes and consists of 3 parallel cables. Each of these cables has two copper conductors with a copper cross section of 310 square millimeters. One of these cables was used by Kontiskan 1 and one is used by Kontiskan 2. From the third cable, one conductor was used by Kontiskan 1 and the other is used by Kontiskan 2. Konti-Skan crosses Laeso-Island on a 17 km long overhead line with two conductors. Before the implementation of Konti-Skan 2 both conductors were switched parallel, today one conductor is used for the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1, while the other is used by that of Konti-Skan 2. Between Laeso and Sweden each high voltage pole of Konti-Skan uses a monopolar copper cable with a cross section of 1200 square millimetres.|$|R

50|$|Copper {{is vital}} to the {{electrical}} grounding system for wind turbine farms. Turbine masts attract lightning strikes, so they require lightning protection systems. When lightning strikes a turbine blade, current passes along the blade, through the blade hub in the nacelle (gearbox/ generator enclosure) and down the mast to a grounding system. The blade incorporates a large cross-section copper <b>conductor</b> that <b>runs</b> along its length and allows current to pass along the blade without deleterious heating effects. The nacelle is protected by a lightning conductor, often copper. The grounding system, {{at the base of the}} mast, consists of a thick copper ring conductor bonded to the base or located within a meter of the base. The ring is attached to two diametrically opposed points on the mast base. Copper leads extend outward from the ring and connect to copper grounding electrodes. The grounding rings at turbines on wind farms are inter-connected, providing a networked system with an extremely small aggregate resistance.|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} cables {{different conditions}} govern, and installation regulations normally specify {{that the most}} severe condition along the run will govern each cable <b>conductor's</b> rating. Cables <b>run</b> in wet or oily locations may carry a lower temperature rating than in a dry installation. Derating is necessary for multiple cables in close proximity. When multiple cables are in close proximity, each contributes heat to the others and diminishes the amount of external cooling affecting the individual cable conductors. The overall ampacity of insulated cable conductors in a bundle of more than three cables must also be derated, whether in a raceway or cable. Usually the derating factor is tabulated in a nation's wiring regulations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Overhead-line power <b>conductors</b> do not <b>run</b> {{parallel}} to the ground; they actually sag between adjacent towers, defining catenary curves. However, {{in the analysis of}} inductive coupling phenomena between power lines and neighboring circuits, the standard approach to deal with the sag effect is to assign a constant average height to power line conductors. The purpose of this research is to assess the accuracy of such an ordinary procedure. To do that, two different approaches are developed in order to more accurately account for the sag effect: a pure segmentation method, and a corrected segmentation method which takes into consideration the real curvature of the sagged conductors. The latter, and novel, approach is compared with the other options. Calculations presented in this work utilize magnetic vector potential as an analysis tool. 1...|$|R

Special cable fittings may be applied to prevent explosive gases from flowing in the interior of jacketed cables, where the cable passes through areas where flammable gases are present. To prevent loosening of the connections of individual conductors of a cable, cables must be supported near their entrance to devices and at regular intervals along their runs. In tall buildings, special designs are required to support the <b>conductors</b> of vertical <b>runs</b> of cable. Generally, only one cable per fitting is permitted, unless the fitting is rated or listed for multiple cables.|$|R

Twenty-five three-component magnetometers simultaneously recorded disturbance fields of magnetic storms and substorms, in addition to the quiet daily variation. Curious anomalous effects were observed which showed partial consistency for horizontal fields of given polarization. Transfer functions were computed for the stations and these indicate, to first order, a long curved conductor running approximately north-south through the array and a second, more resistive conductor running east-west to the north of the array. Other structures are also present. The north-south <b>conductor,</b> which <b>runs</b> close to the Flinders Ranges, may represent a feature important in the continental tectonics of Australia. 1. Observations Studies with two-dimensional arrays of three-component recording magneto-meters enable transient induced electric currents and, by inference, electrically conductive regions to be mapped and to some extent interpreted in terms of conduc-tive structure. Quantitative interpretation involves non-linear three-dimensional inversion and is very difficult, though appreciable progress has been made in some cases (Gough 1973). Structure in the electrical conductivity is of interest largely because this parameter is linked to temperature: anomalously hot regions of the upper mantle are highly conducting; conducting regions may be at high temperature.
