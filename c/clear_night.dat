5|$|On a <b>Clear</b> <b>Night</b> drew {{mixed reviews}} from critics both in Australia and abroad. More {{positive}} reviews compared Higgins to Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette, and praised the album's maturity and assertiveness compared to The Sound of White.

Higgins was nominated for four awards at the 2007 ARIA Music Awards and won 'Best Female Artist'.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a <b>clear</b> <b>night</b> you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

25|$|The last {{blockade}} runner to make Savannah was the British {{steam ship}} Fingal. Its cargo {{of arms and}} munitions reached the entrance to Wassaw Sound {{at the mouth of}} the Savannah River on a <b>clear</b> <b>night</b> in mid November, but heavy fog in the early morning masked the ship’s progress across the bar and upriver. Later she made two unsuccessful attempts at escaping the blockade before being converted into an ironclad. Pulaski’s share on ship's manifest was two 24-pounder Blakely rifles and a large consignment of British-made Enfield infantry rifles. As the Union Flag Officer Du Pont sought to close the alternative channels local ships used, he sank stone-filled ships in the Savannah River channel, and stationed gunboats at two southerly estuaries, Wassaw Sound, south of Wilmington Island, and Ossabaw Sound at Skidaway Island.|$|E
25|$|Captain Pearson of Serapis {{had only}} limited {{knowledge}} of the escalating chaos aboard Bonhomme Richard. He too was losing many men from Alliance’s attacks, {{and he could not}} move his ship. Alliance, still effectively undamaged, could keep firing at will. On the other hand, nearly every ship in the convoy he had been sent to protect had reached safety before the battle even began. Following the second of Alliance’s new round of broadsides, like Piercy before him, he decided that he could achieve nothing more by continuing to fight. Not long after 10:30pm, he called for quarter and struck his colours in person. Thus the Americans finally got the chance to board the Serapis, but this did not go quite as well as it could have. Three shots were fired by British sailors who had not got the message. Midshipman John Mayrant, following First Lieutenant Dale aboard, got a pike stuck through his leg. Pearson’s first lieutenant was among those reluctant to believe that his captain had surrendered, and Dale made sure that he stayed with Pearson rather than leaving him to his own devices. A short time later, as Captain Pearson was boarding Bonhomme Richard to hand over his ceremonial sword, the main-mast of Serapis finally fell overboard, perhaps as a result of work to separate the two ships, dragging the damaged mizzen-top-mast with it. As Bonhomme Richard got under way, Dale attempted to follow in Serapis, and learned two important facts in quick succession. First, Serapis would not move, and second, he had a very large splinter in his leg, which now caused him to fall over. The first problem was rectified by cutting the anchor cable, the second by returning Dale to Bonhomme Richard for treatment. Boats from both Serapis and Alliance were used to begin the evacuation of Bonhomme Richard’s crew. One or two of these boats went missing during the night, as ex-captive British crewmen took the opportunity to go home (hence the eyewitness newspaper stories). The combatants, although they probably cared little, had been observed by thousands of onlookers, for on that <b>clear</b> <b>night,</b> with a near-full moon, the action could be seen from a long stretch of the high Yorkshire coastline, from Scarborough in the north to Flamborough Head itself in the south.|$|E

500|$|In the US, reviews {{were also}} mixed but {{generally}} positive. Andrew Leahey of Allmusic said that On a <b>Clear</b> <b>Night</b> marks a development from The Sound of White {{and that the}} second album combines [...] "sass with sweet sentiment" [...] although at times is [...] "a bit too calculated". He compared Higgins to Sarah McLachlan and Amy Winehouse, calling her [...] "family friendly" [...] but said that her popularity in Australia has not successfully spread to the US. A reviewer for Billboard noted that with this album, Higgins was trying to broaden her market and said that On a <b>Clear</b> <b>Night</b> would appeal to fans of KT Tunstall and the [...] "Grey's Anatomy-soundtrack crowd". They said that [...] "Steer" [...] was a highlight and that Higgins sounded assured. Writing for Mix, Sarah Benzuly commented on Higgins' increased assertiveness with her second album and compared her to Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette. She called the album lyrically rich and [...] "beautifully stirring".|$|E

500|$|On a <b>Clear</b> <b>Night</b> is {{the second}} studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, {{released}} by [...] on 28 April 2007. Higgins started work on the album straight after finishing her 2004 debut, The Sound of White. She spent six months of 2006 in Broome, Western Australia, writing new material. She composed songs inspired by the landscape, and by past relationships. She wrote more material while touring the US {{and at the end}} of the year travelled to Los Angeles to record with Mitchell Froom.|$|E
500|$|She left Broome to {{tour the}} United States, and {{continued}} to write material on the road. While much of her first album revolved around the piano, most of the songs from On a <b>Clear</b> <b>Night</b> were guitar-based. This was because Higgins had easier access to a guitar than keyboards while touring. She said, [...] "I hadn't been playing guitar very long for the first album so I think I'm definitely a better guitar player, and probably a worse piano player because I haven't been able to play it much {{over the last few}} years".|$|E

USS Andrew Doria and HMS Glasgow spotted each other between 1:00 and 2:00 am on April 6, about eight leagues (20 to 24 nautical miles) southeast of Block Island with the fleet headed in a generally southerly direction. Glasgow was heading west, destined for Charleston. Captain Howe came about to investigate the fleet and closed to within hailing distance over the next 30 minutes. Commodore Hopkins gave no signals during this time, so the fleet formed no battle line. This resulted in a battle that Captain Nicholas Biddle of Andrew Doria later described as [...] "helter-skelter".|$|E
500|$|During 2006, Higgins {{lived in}} Broome, Western Australia for six months, {{away from the}} {{entertainment}} industry. The relaxed lifestyle helped her focus on writing new material.

40|$|This lecture {{describes}} {{some recent}} attempts at unravelling {{the mechanics of}} the temperature distribution near ground, especially during calm, <b>clear</b> <b>nights.</b> In particular, a resolution is offered of the so-called Ramdas paradox, connected with observations of a temperature minimum some decimetres above bare soil on calm <b>clear</b> <b>nights,</b> in apparent defiance of the Rayleigh criterion for instability due to thermal convection. The dynamics of the associated temperature distribution is governed by radiative and convective transport and by thermal conduction, and is characterised by two time constants, involving respectively quick radiative adjustments and slow diffusive relaxation. The theory underlying the work described here suggests that surface parameters like ground emissivity and soil thermal conductivity can exert appreciable influence on the development of nocturnal inversions...|$|R
