50|$|His {{professional}} career spans {{decades in the}} financial sector and includes working in various capacities at Citibank (then Nigeria International Bank), Fidelity Bank, Guaranty Trust <b>Bank,</b> and <b>Crystal</b> <b>Bank</b> Plc. (later Standard Trust Bank, and now UBA Plc.), which he joined as General Manager and where later rose to MD/CEO. Emerhor was renowned as the youngest bank MD/CEO in the Nigerian banking industry in 1995. In 1998, he led investors to acquire Comet Merchant Bank, which later transformed to First Atlantic Bank Plc., where he served as Chairman. Emerhor was later appointed as Vice-Chairman of First Inland Bank Plc (which was later renamed FinBank Plc.), where {{he served as a}} director until February 2009.|$|R
30|$|Series of MoSe 2 {{films were}} epitaxially grown on graphenized SiC {{substrates}} in a home-built MBE system with base pressures of 1  ×  10 − 10  Torr. We used 6 H-SiC single crystal substrates, {{supplied by the}} <b>Crystal</b> <b>Bank</b> at Pusan National University. We prepared bilayer graphene on the 6 H-SiC substrates by annealing at 1300  °C for ~ 5  min, following the reported recipe [1]. On the graphene surface, we grew epitaxial MoSe 2 films with lattice mismatch of ~ 0.3 %. Molybdenum and selenium were evaporated with e-beam evaporator and effusion cell, respectively. We deposited the films at growth temperature of 250  °C with growth rate of 0.1 ML/min, followed with post-annealing at 600  °C for 30  min [1]. We monitor the film surface with in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) with high voltage of 18  kV.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades {{frequency}} synthesizer has progressed from a relatively <b>crystal</b> <b>bank</b> synthesizer to multi-loop phase locked loops. But in recent years direct digital synthesizers (DDS) have witnessed an increase in demand over their analog counterparts. The DDS offers a wide range of advantages over phase locked loops such as high frequency range, fast switching response, and sub-hertz frequency resolution. However, the conventional DDS suffers limitations due to its architecture involving digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and read-only-memory (ROM) with respect to high clock speeds. The Pulse Output Direct Digital Synthesizer (PODDS) presented in this thesis eliminates the necessity for a DAC and ROM, and replaces the phase conversion block present in the conventional DDS with an Analog filter bank to generate the sine wave. The PODDS operates at a frequency of 2. 25 GHz, with a 16 -b phase accumulator designed using carry look-ahead adder. The analog filter bank was designed using an array of low-pass Chebyshev filters. A frequency range of 1. 1 MHz to 1. 125 GHz was achieved with average power consumption of 83 mW...|$|R
60|$|Having thus made a {{holocaust}} of humanity, Mr. Whistler turned to nature, {{and in a}} few moments convicted her of the <b>Crystal</b> Palace, <b>Bank</b> holidays, and a general overcrowding of detail, both in omnibuses and in landscapes, and then, in a passage of singular beauty, not unlike one that occurs in Corot's letters, spoke of the artistic value of dim dawns and dusks, when the mean facts of life are lost in exquisite and evanescent effects, when common things are touched with mystery and transfigured with beauty, when the warehouses become as palaces and the tall chimneys of the factory seem like campaniles in the silver air.|$|R

In his joy he listens, forgetting all his grief; then {{the heart of the}} man cries out for its own, and he struggles to cross the stream to join her. In the struggle the dream vanishes; he wakens to find his eyes wet and his head on the little mound that marks the spot where his heart is buried.|$|R

Calvin {{is a thin}} and {{intelligent}} boy, while [...] "Juicy" [...] is overweight and slow-witted. Juicy's parents are morbidly obese shut-ins, leaving Calvin and Thurgood as a surrogate family. Juicy is often made to wear a sign stating [...] "Please Do Not Feed [...] " [...] when he leaves his apartment. In late episodes they are rival admirers of Sharique.|$|R
50|$|Johnny and {{his gang}} are closing down kung fu schools and making a name for themselves. Jet meets May (<b>Crystal</b> Kwok), a <b>bank</b> worker {{responsible}} for the loan on Tak's store - but neither knows where Master Tak is. Jet finds himself {{in the middle of}} a robbery at a carpark. He finds himself fighting beside Johnny, but Johnny recognizes him from one of Tak's pictures and makes it clear he intends to kill both Jet and Tak. Anna and Jet's friends get beaten up, so Jet trains his friends to defend themselves. Jet is eventually re-united with Tak, but Tak claims he's no longer interested in either teaching Kung Fu or doing herbal medicine.|$|R
40|$|The FireDB {{database}} is a databank for functional information {{relating to}} proteins with known structures. It contains the most comprehensive and detailed repository of known functionally important residues, bringing together both ligand binding and catalytic residues in one site. The platform integrates biologically relevant data filtered from the close atomic contacts in Protein Data <b>Bank</b> <b>crystal</b> structures and reliably annotated catalytic residues from the Catalytic Site Atlas. The interface allows users to make queries by protein, ligand or keyword. Relevant biologically important residues are displayed in a simple and easy to read manner that allows users to assess binding site similarity across homologous proteins. Binding site residue variations can also be viewed with molecular visualization tools. The database is available a...|$|R
40|$|A {{stationary}} Josephson {{effect in}} point contacts between triplet superconductors is analyzed theoretically for most probable {{models of the}} order parameter in UPt_{ 3 } and Sr_{ 2 }RuO_{ 4 }. The consequence of misorientation of <b>crystals</b> in superconducting <b>banks</b> on this effect is considered. We show that different models for the order parameter lead to quite different current-phase dependences. For certain angles of misorientation a boundary between superconductors can generate the parallel to surface spontaneous current. In {{a number of cases}} the state with a zero Josephson current and minimum of the free energy corresponds to a spontaneous phase difference. This phase difference depends on the misorientation angle and may possess any value. We conclude that experimental investigations of the current-phase dependences of small junctions can be used for determination of the order parameter symmetry in the mentioned above superconductors.
