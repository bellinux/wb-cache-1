40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the prototype design {{and development of}} a miniature MRI-compatible fiber optic force sensor suitable {{for the detection of}} forces during cardiac catheterization. The working principle is based on light intensity modulation where a fiber optic cable interrogates a reflective surface at a predefined distance inside a <b>catheter</b> <b>shaft.</b> When a force is applied to the tip of the catheter, a force sensitive structure, which connects the tip {{with the rest of the}} catheter, reduces the distance between optical fiber and reflective surface or rotates the reflective surface against the fixed fiber. In both cases the light is modulated accordingly and the axial or lateral force can be estimated. The developed prototype passed preliminary experiments successfully. The sensor exhibits adequate linear response, having a good working range, very good resolution and good sensitivity in both axial and lateral force directions.

The authors report their experience in counterpulsation-related complications of 201 consecutive patients who underwent 212 percutaneous counterpulsation balloon insertions from June 1989 to June 1996 by use of balloons with 8 - 9. 5 French shafts. Of these, 82 % were men and 36 (18 %) were women, {{with a mean age}} of 61 &plusmn; 12 years. Indications for counterpulsation were acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (67 %), severe left ventricular failure without AMI (20 %), dilated cardiomyopathy (4 %), unstable angina (3 %), high-risk supported percutaneous coronary angioplasty (2 %), and others (4 %). IABP was instituted at the bedside in the intensive care unit in 82 patients (39 %) and in the catheterization laboratory in 130 (61 %). Median duration of counterpulsation was 48 hours (range 30 minutes to 25 days) with successful weaning from counterpulsation in 70 % (148 of 212) of procedures.

40|$|Cardiac {{ablation}} {{therapy is}} an effective minimally invasive treatment for cardiac arrhythmia. Catheter steering in the constrained environment during the procedure is considered difficult, particularly in providing accurate catheter tip positioning for ablating or for diagnosing the cardiac tissue.

40|$|Forward looking (FL) imaging {{catheters}} {{would be}} an important tool for several intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) applications. Single chip capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays fabricated on front-end CMOS electronics with simplified electrical interconnect have been previously developed for highly flexible and compact catheters. In this study, we present a custom built real time imaging system utilizing catheters with single chip CMUT-on-CMOS arrays and show initial imaging results. The fabricated array has a dual-ring structure with 64 transmit (Tx) and 56 receive (Rx) elements. The CMUT arrays fit on a 2. 1 mm diameter circular region with all the required front-end electronics. The device operates at 12 MHz center frequency and has around 20 V collapse voltage. The single-chip system requires 13 external connections including 4 Rx channels and power lines. The electrical connections to micro cables in the catheter are made from the top side of the chip using polyimide flex tapes. The device is placed on a 6 -Fr <b>catheter</b> <b>shaft</b> and secured with a medical grade silicon rubber.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives: With {{the advent}} of interventional {{vascular}} procedures, objective and reproducible tools are needed to assist clinical decision-making and to assess intervention efficacy. The success of quantitative coronary arteriography (QVA) in objectively assessing cardiovascular morphology has initiated the software development for quantitative analysis of peripheral vasculature. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the applicability and quality of a new QVA package applied to renal arteries. Methods: A calibration method was developed using markers mounted on a <b>catheter's</b> <b>shaft,</b> ensuring accurate calibration even with small catheter sizes. Given the high prevalence of ostial stenoses in peripheral vessels, a dedicated vessel analysis method was developed to assess these stenoses. Its reproducibility was determined in renal angiography. Variance component analysis was performed to evaluate sources of variability, using angiograms from 74 patients suspected of renovascular hypertension. Results: For intraobserver variability, the 95 % confidence intervals of differences in percent diameter stenosis and minimal lumen diameter were - 1. 99 %- 1. 04 % (P = 0. 53, n = 48) and - 0. 081 mm- 0. 023 mm (P = 0. 27, n = 48), respectively. For the interobserver variability, intervals were - 1. 86 %- 2. 80 % (P = 0. 69, n = 66) and - 0. 46 mm- 0. 053 mm (P = 0. 12, n = 46), respectively. Conclusions: The contribution of intraobserver variation was negligible. The contribution of interobserver variation for different parameters was negligible or comparable with the variation caused by image acquisition. These conclusions demonstrate that QVA can reproducibly measure renal artery geometry...|$|R

Methods and Results: Two bipolar electrograms (E 1 and E 2) were recorded: between E and the distal ring electrode and between E and the proximal ring electrode. Interpole distance varied for both as the E traversed the slide <b>shaft.</b> Given the <b>catheter's</b> concept, these bipoles are orientated exactly along the line of lesion creation. Prior to ablation, unitary bipolar electrograms were recorded along the <b>catheter</b> slide <b>shaft</b> position. As the CTI lesion was created (E moved along the <b>catheter</b> slide <b>shaft</b> in 2 -mm steps with radiofrequency energy delivered to achieve 65 °C for 60 sec at each), double potentials (DP) were observed. Interpotential distance became maximal with completion of the linear lesion and bidirectional block. DPs were noted in all these procedures. With pacing from the low septal right atrium at bidirectional block creation, interpotential timing was 140. 9 ± 15 msecand from the low right atrial free wall was 145. 13 ± 18 msec. In sinus rhythm, DP interpotential timing was less(35. 13 ± 9 msec) as activation fronts arrived from both septal and anterior atrial aspects. Conclusion: Bipolar recordings from the coaxially moveable electrode catheter provide unique electrogram data. DPs recorded during and after linear lesion creation can define conduction block across that lesion without the need for additional mapping catheters or complex mapping technology...|$|R
40|$|There {{are over}} 30 million Foley urinary {{catheters}} used annually, {{and the greatest}} problem with Foley catheters is catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). CAUTIs are the number one cause of hospital-acquired infections and make up to 40 % of nosocomial infections. Biofilms on urinary catheters are critical to the progression of symptomatic CAUTIs, but are difficult to treat due to the protective effect of the biofilm matrix against antibiotics. The anti-fouling catheter technology proposed and demonstrated herein uses a mechanical, non-antibiotic approach to physically remove biofilms and thereby provide an appealing option for potentially stopping the progression of symptomatic infections. Additionally, because the anti-fouling technology is mechanical, it can circumvent the persistent failings of chemical and biological approaches that have failed to address catheter-associated urinary tract infections for the last 50 + years since Foley catheters were introduced. We designed and optimized urinary catheter prototypes capable of on-demand removal of biofilms from the previously-inaccessible main drainage lumen of catheters. The concept uses pressure-actuated chambers in elastomer constructs to generate regio-selective strain and thereby remove biofilms. We first grew mature Proteus mirabilis crystalline biofilms on flat silicone elastomer substrates, and showed that application of strain to the substrate debonded the biofilm, and that increasing the strain rate increased biofilm detachment. A quantitative relationship between the applied strain rate and biofilm debonding was found through {{an analysis of the}} biofilm segment length and the calculated driving force for debonding. We then constructed proof-of-concept prototypes of sections of anti-fouling <b>catheter</b> <b>shafts</b> using silicone and 3 D printed reverse molding in methods akin to those used for soft robotics. The proof-of-concept prototypes demonstrated release of mature P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms from their strained surfaces, and prompted our development of more advanced multi-lumen prototypes. The multi-lumen prototypes were designed and optimized using successive rounds of finite element modeling to adjust the number and postion of intra-wall inflation lumens. We then constructed prototypes based on the optimized design with clinically relevant dimensions and showed they were able to generate greater than 30 % strain on the majority of the luminal surface, and along their full length. Those catheter prototypes were able to on-demand, and repeatedly, remove greater than 80 % of a mixed community biofilm of P. mirabilis and E. coli. In summary, this study shows (1) strain in the elastomeric substrate actively debonds crystalline biofilms in vitro (2) modeling based on characterization of biofilm properties and understanding of substrate strain informs and facilitates prototype catheter design (3) urinary catheter prototypes utilizing inflation-induced substrate strain are capable of on-demand and repeatedly removing biofilms in vitro.

40|$|Abstract Background Catheter {{visualization}} {{and tracking}} remains {{a challenge in}} interventional MR. Active guidewires can be made conspicuous in "profile" along their whole shaft exploiting metallic core wire and hypotube components that are intrinsic to their mechanical performance. Polymer-based catheters, on the other hand, offer no conductive medium to carry radio frequency waves. We developed a new "active" catheter design for interventional MR with mechanical performance resembling braided X-ray devices. Our 75 cm long hybrid <b>catheter</b> <b>shaft</b> incorporates a wire lattice in a polymer matrix, and contains three distal loop coils in a flexible and torquable 7 Fr device. We explored the impact of braid material designs on radiofrequency and mechanical performance. Results The incorporation of copper wire into in a superelastic nitinol braided loopless antenna allowed good visualization of the whole shaft (70 cm) in vitro and in vivo in swine during real-time MR with 1. 5 T scanner. Additional distal tip coils enhanced tip visibility. Increasing the copper:nitinol ratio in braiding configurations improved flexibility {{at the expense of}} torquability. We found a 16 -wire braid of 1 : 1 copper:nitinol to have the optimum balance of mechanical (trackability, flexibility, torquability) and antenna (signal attenuation) properties. With this configuration, the temperature increase remained less than 2 °C during real-time MR within 10 cm horizontal from the isocenter. The design was conspicuous in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion We have engineered a new loopless antenna configuration that imparts interventional MR catheters with satisfactory mechanical and imaging characteristics. This compact loopless antenna design can be generalized to visualize the whole shaft of any general-purpose polymer catheter to perform safe interventional procedures. </p...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the {{healthcare}} setting has seen a vast increase in the use of medical devices and whilst this may have improved clinical outcomes for patients their increase in use has given rise to an increase in medical - device associated infections. It has been reported that urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for up to 40 % of all healthcare associated infections and about 80 % of those are associated with catheter use [1]. Urinary catheters are hollow, flexible, tubular devices designed to drain urine when inserted into a patient‟s bladder. They are widely used both on patients requiring short - term urinary catheterisation e. g. during and after some types of surgical procedures or long - term urinary catheterisation e. g. due to urinary incontinence. For patients undergoing long - term indwelling urinary catheterisation (LTC) it is almost inevitable that their catheter will become colonised with bacteria and a biofilm (an accumulation of microorganisms and their extracellular products that form a functional, structured community on a surface) [2] develop which can result in a symptomatic or asymptomatic catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat due to the bacteria within the biofilm being insusceptible to antibiotic treatment. Often to resolve the infection, removal and replacement of the catheter is required and antibiotic treatment if necessary. Certain patients may require their catheter to be changed frequently, often causing considerable distress and morbidity and giving rise to increased medical costs. Biomaterials used to produce long - term urinary catheters that are able to completely resist bacterial colonisation for significant periods, remain elusive. The development of antimicrobial urinary catheters has, however, shown some success in clinical trials but only in the short-term. This project proposes to modify a silicone urinary catheter used for LTC by impregnating it with a suitable combination and concentration of antimicrobial agents. The aim of the study is to develop an antimicrobial catheter that will provide protection from bacterial colonisation and subsequent biofilm development by the principle organisms involved in CAUTIs over a prolonged period (12 weeks). Silicone material was processed using an impregnation method. A variety of agents were assessed using drug screening tests to establish their potential duration of antimicrobial activity and ability to prevent bacterial colonisation. The combination of agents showing the most potential were selected and impregnated into the catheter material. They were: rifampicin, sparfloxacin and triclosan. Further testing involved the development of an in - vitro model designed to test the ability of the antimicrobial catheter to resist colonisation following repeated bacterial challenges. The emergence of bacterial resistance was also monitored during this time. In addition, the total antimicrobial content, drug release profiles and uniformity of drug distribution were elucidated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) respectively. The effect impregnating antimicrobial agents into the catheter had on its surface properties and the impact on mechanical performance of the <b>catheter</b> <b>shaft</b> and balloons were also examined. Drug screening tests revealed a combination of rifampicin, sparfloxacin and triclosan had the potential to deliver a long duration of protective activity against principal uropathogens. In - vitro model results demonstrated the antimicrobial catheter was able to prevent colonisation by Escherichia coli and Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus for > 12 weeks, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis for 8 weeks but only 8 days against Enterococcus faecalis. K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis colonised catheters did, however, show an increase in the sparfloxacin and triclosan minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), highlighting that the development of bacterial resistance could be an issue. The catheter was found to contain (w/w) 0. 006 % rifampicin, 0. 16 % sparfloxacin and 0. 17 % triclosan of which 19. 8 % sparfloxacin and 29. 9 % triclosan were released by a diffusion process over the first 28 days. Rifampicin release was not detected possibly due to low concentrations. With the drug release trend suggesting a continued steady release of sparfloxacin and triclosan above the MIC and with 80. 2 % of sparfloxacin and 70. 1 % of triclosan remaining, this would suggest there should be sufficient drug to provide protection from bacterial colonisation over a 12 week duration. However, why the MICs increased as catheters became colonised with K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis could be due to a number of factors. ToF-SIMS revealed the drugs which could be traced (sparfloxacin and triclosan) were mostly uniformly distributed on the catheter surface, with some drug localization being seen which may have added to the initial burst effect and could be important in the prevention of bacterial colonisation during catheter insertion. Surface analysis techniques also showed the incorporation of antimicrobial agents lead to an increase in the surface hydrophilicity but following exposure to an aqueous environment no difference was seen compared to control catheters. As drugs eluted from the catheter the surface topography marginally deteriorated but the impact of this in terms of bacterial colonisation is not thought to be of a clinical significance. No adverse affect to the mechanical performance of the antimicrobial <b>catheter</b> <b>shaft</b> or balloon compared to the conventional silicone Foley urinary catheter was shown, indicating that it would be as mechanically stable as the catheter in clinical use and therefore suitable if applied to clinical practice. Further work on the drug release concentrations and ratios are needed to help overcome the potential of bacterial resistance. The catheter could have a greater effect on reducing bacterial colonisation and potential for resistance development if drug concentrations were adjusted to release at higher concentrations and equal ratios and more data could be gathered if drug release studies were taken to the end point of 12 weeks rather than 28 days. In - vitro model challenges using urine as the perfusion medium and a larger array of microorganisms is required and investigations are also necessary to assess the antimicrobial catheters ability to prevent encrustation, a further complication of LTC. This preliminary study has shown with further work there is potential that the antimicrobial catheter could have a substantial effect on reducing/delaying colonisation by several of the main organisms involved in CAUTIs over a prolonged course. This in turn would help reduce CAUTI rates, reduce the frequency at which catheters need to be replaced and {{improve the quality of life}} for patients on LTC.

40|$|ObjectiveThe radial {{approach}} is currently gaining {{popularity in the}} setting of coronary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) because it decreases the incidence of vascular complications. This study reports our initial results with radial access for peripheral PTA. MethodsBetween November 2011 and January 2014, we performed peripheral PTA in 526 patients. PTA was performed through left radial access in 24 ambulatory patients (4. 6 %) presenting with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus A or B lesions on preoperative computed tomography angiography. Materials included a 110 -cm-long introducer, a 0. 018 -inch 400 -cm-long wire, 150 -cm-long angiography <b>catheters,</b> 180 -cm-long <b>shaft</b> balloons and stents. Data were prospectively collected. ResultsThere were 22 men (92 %), median age was 65  years (range, 45 - 88  years), and 38 target lesions were treated. Indication for revascularization was disabling claudication in 22 patients (92 %) and critical ischemia in two (8 %). Indication for choosing the radial approach was bilateral hostile groins in 12 patients (50 %), bilateral infrainguinal lesions in 4 (17 %), need for a contralateral femoral approach {{in the setting of}} kissing iliac stents or bifurcated surgical aortic grafts in 3 (13 %), and elective in 5 (21 %). Radial puncture failed in one patient (4 %), and PTA was performed through brachial access. Technical success was 91 % (20 of 22 patients). Thirty-seven stents were implanted. Total procedure duration was 45  minutes (range, 30 - 120  minutes). Fluoroscopy time was 9  minutes (range, 5 - 35  minutes), and 40  mL (range, 20 - 90  mL) of contrast was necessary. Radial artery rupture secondary to spasm was noted {{at the end of the}} procedure in two patients (8 %). All patients could ambulate 2  hours after the procedure. No patient died. Median follow-up was 8  months (range, 1 - 23  months). Three radial arteries (13 %) were occluded at the last follow-up. At 6  months, freedom from target lesion revascularization and target vessel revascularization were 91 % and 91 %, respectively, for iliac lesions and 93 % and 86 %, respectively, for infrainguinal lesions. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the feasibility of radial access for peripheral PTA. Radial access could represent an alternative to brachial access for peripheral and visceral interventions. Although complication rates of the present series are concerning, larger studies are needed to determine the role of transradial PTA once the learning curve is overcome. A wider diffusion of the technique mandates (1) smaller-diameter sheaths, (2) longer shaft devices, and (3) the development of specifically designed rescue devices such as covered stents and thromboaspiration catheters...|$|R
