The paper argues that VET reforms disturb VET teachers and managers work. Uncertainties in working life, plus top down reforms and funding constraints, drive innovations. Yet these are often unsustainable because new initiatives-identities cannot compete with established identities in the competition for recognition and resources. The effect runs counter to government efforts aimed at engineering change in VET.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{hypothesis}} "Building <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> sustainable <b>innovation,</b> enabled by broader employee engagement and improved capabilities, increases both employee and organizational fulfillment". A deep understanding is first {{built around the}} relationship between individual fulfillment, organizational fulfillment, and innovation. We then examine <b>capacity</b> building <b>for</b> <b>innovation,</b> both {{in the context of}} capability as well as broader engagement of employee's in innovation. The intellectual bases of the thesis are literature surveys based upon the work of Peter Senge, in The Fifth Discipline and The Dance of Change; the work of Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett in The Individualized Corporation; the work of Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahlad in Competing for the Future; the work of Clayton Christensen in The Innovator's Dilemma; as well as current professional journal publications from these authors, and other literature relevant to the topic. Further intellectual support comes from author conducted interviews with Peter Senge, Sumantra Ghoshal, and Clayton Christensen, and exchanges with Gary Hamel.

40|$|Human {{populations have}} {{extraordinary}} capabilities for generating behavioural diversity without corresponding genetic diversity or change. These capabilities and their consequences can be grouped into three categories: strategic (or cognitive), ecological and cultural-evolutionary. Strategic aspects include: (i) a propensity to employ complex conditional strategies, some certainly genetically evolved but others owing to directed invention or to cultural evolution; (ii) {{situations in which}} fitness payoffs (or utilities) are frequency-dependent, {{so that there is}} no one best strategy; and (iii) the prevalence of multiple equilibria, with history or minor variations in starting conditions (path dependence) playing a crucial role. Ecological aspects refer to the fact that social behaviour and cultural institutions evolve in diverse niches, producing various adaptive radiations and local adaptations. Although environmental change can drive behavioural change, in humans, it is common for behavioural change (especially technological innovation) to drive environmental change (i. e. niche construction). Evolutionary aspects refer to the fact that human <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> and cultural transmission lead to diversification and cumulative cultural evolution; critical here is institutional design, in which relatively small shifts in incentive structure can produce very different aggregate outcomes.

40|$|Background: Megatrends are {{long-lasting}} global {{developments in}} society, technology, economy and political conditions that their effects are {{not restricted to}} a particular geographic area. In future studies, megatrends in social, technology, environment, politics, and values (STEEP-V) should be considered. Material and Methods: The megatrends shaping healthcare {{in the new millennium}} were selected from the future studies. Trend analysis (macro to micro approach) was used to emerge key fields of action or areas of innovation in healthcare and related technologies that might be reflected in the health policies of I. R.

High <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> in emerging health technologies, policies for health insurance, paradigm shift from volume to value in healthcare delivery, and infrastructure for participatory medicine were found in the health policies of I.
