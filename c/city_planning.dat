5|$|<b>City</b> <b>planning</b> {{and urban}} lifestyles had been {{influenced}} by the Greeks from an early period, and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the local development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of <b>city</b> <b>planning</b> and architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E

50|$|Author of a {{large number}} of <b>city</b> <b>plans,</b> Christophe Lukasiewicz {{developed}} a new design of the Town Planning: parks and gardens surrounded by terraced buildings, shopping streets and markets. He developed the classic <b>city</b> <b>plan</b> (London crescent) or garden <b>city</b> <b>plan</b> seeking to build a city resulting from a millennium urbanisation (diversity of scenery, withdrawal alignment, arcades, terraces). Using industrial prefabrication process, he created an aesthetic in which useful constructions becomes decorative by his play (See Melun-Senart The arcades ILM). With this project, he initiated the creation of a cubist city.|$|R

5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{was mostly}} routed along {{existing}} rights-of-way, but three commercial properties, including {{a gas station}} and a vacant building, were seized and demolished {{to make way for}} the AirTrain alignment.

A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, {{while they were still}} besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the <b>city,</b> <b>planning</b> to attack the Normans the next day.|$|E

5|$|Deir al-Balah's first village {{council was}} {{established}} in 1946 and an elected local government continued to administer the city until 1982 when the Israeli military authorities dissolved the council and appointed a mayor.

The Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, appointed Samir Mohammed Azayiza as mayor until 2000 when he replaced him with Sami Abu Salim, a wealthy businessman from the city.

5|$|Manila, {{being the}} seat of {{political}} power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the <b>city.</b> <b>Planning</b> for the development for being the center of government started {{during the early years}} of American colonization when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Daniel Burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington, D.C. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. Quezon.|$|E
5|$|The American {{occupation}} in 1898 {{introduced a new}} breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of <b>city</b> <b>planning</b> using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila. Part of the Burnham's plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture. In Iloilo, a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American {{occupation in}} the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real.|$|E

5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise <b>city</b> <b>planning</b> activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E
