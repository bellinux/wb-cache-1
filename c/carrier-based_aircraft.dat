5|$|After commissioning, Bolt was {{assigned}} as a cadet training instructor, training aviation cadets at Naval Air Station Jacksonville and at Naval Auxiliary Air Station Green Cove Springs, Florida, until December 1942, when the unit was deactivated. Until May 1943 he was {{trained on the}} F4F Wildcat, a <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft,</b> in preparation for movement to a front-line combat unit. Over the next few months, Bolt was stationed at Naval Air Station Glenview in Glenview, Illinois, where he trained for 60 hours aboard the paddlewheel aircraft carrier USS Wolverine. After qualifying to operate <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft,</b> he {{was assigned}} to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California, until June 1943, when he and his class departed for the Pacific Theater aboard the USS Rochambeau.|$|E
5|$|Related {{work on a}} {{supersonic}} aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, was cancelled in 1965. As a result, the P.1127 (RAF), {{a variant}} more closely based on the Kestrel, was ordered into production that year, and named Harrier - the name originally intended for the P.1154 - in 1967. The Harrier served with the UK and several nations, often as a <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{termination}} of the P.1154, the RAF then began studying a straightforward upgrade of the Kestrel as a production aircraft; accordingly, it issued Requirement ASR 384, which sought a V/STOL ground attack jet, known as the P.1127 (RAF). In late 1965, the RAF placed an order for six pre-production P.1127 (RAF) aircraft. On 31 August 1966, {{the first of these}} P.1127 (RAF) aircraft made its maiden flight. In early 1967, an order for 60 production aircraft was formally received by Hawker Aviation; at this time the aircraft received the Harrier GR.1 designation. The Harrier {{went on to become a}} successful aircraft in British service, and was exported to several nations, often seeing usage as a <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|HMS Vindex was a Royal Navy {{seaplane}} carrier {{during the}} First World War. The ship spent {{the bulk of}} her career operating the North Sea, where she twice unsuccessfully attacked the German Zeppelin base at Tondern and conducted anti-Zeppelin patrols. One of her Bristol Scout aircraft made the first take-off from an aircraft carrier in late 1915. Another made the first interception of an airship by a <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft</b> on 2 August 1916, when it unsuccessfully attacked the Zeppelin LZ17. Vindex {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean in 1918 and was sold back to her original owners in 1920. She was requisitioned again in 1939 and served through the Second World War as a troopship under a different name. After the end of the war, the ship was returned to her owners and was sold for scrapping in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft),</b> a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
5|$|Reassigned, Bolt flew to Hawaii, then to Long Beach, California. He {{reunited with}} Dorothy Wiggins in San Francisco, {{and the two}} married on 23 May 1944 in Oakland, before going on a one-month honeymoon. His next {{assignment}} was with the newly formed VMF-471 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. While posted to VMF-471, he attended the Aviation Ground Officer's School at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico, Virginia, from November 1944 through February 1945. He saw no combat {{for the rest of}} the war, but did manage to break the Corsair endurance record by keeping an aircraft aloft for 14 hours and 9 seconds. After briefly returning to VMF-471, Bolt was reassigned to VMF-215 in March 1945, tasked with training pilots for new <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft.</b> He remained in this role until V-J Day, the end of hostilities.|$|E

5|$|Commissioned in mid-1942, Musashi was {{modified}} {{to serve as}} the flagship of the Combined Fleet, and {{spent the rest of the}} year working up. The ship was transferred to Truk in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American submarine, Musashi was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. She was present during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft</b> on 24 October 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Over half of her crew was rescued. Her wreck was located in March 2015 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and his team of researchers.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of both the TSR-2 and P.1154 programmes, the RAF were still left with a requirement to replace both the Canberra and Hunter in the long-range strike, close air support and reconnaissance roles. This resulted in the procurement of two aircraft, the General Dynamics F-111K, intended for the long-range interdiction roles {{carried out by the}} Canberra, and the F-4M Phantom, which would be used in the close air support role undertaken by the Hunter. The F-111K was cancelled within a year of being ordered, but the order for 150 Phantoms went ahead alongside the Phantom order for the Royal Navy; the final 32 units of the RAF order were eventually cancelled. The RAF Phantom, given the designation FGR.2, was broadly similar to the naval version, with some minor variations in terms of engines, avionics and structure, which related to its use as a land-based, rather than <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} plan—drafted {{under the}} direction of the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Toyoda Soemu—called for Yamato and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island. Yamato and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between Higashi and Yomitan and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight U.S. forces on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from US <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama, Yamaguchi, off Mitajiri, Japan, on 29 March. However, despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō—commander of the Ten-Go force—still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out, believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.|$|E

25|$|Developed by the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) at China Lake, California {{during the}} mid-to-late 1950s, the Hopi missile was an {{improved}} {{development of the}} earlier BOAR (Bombardment Aircraft Rocket).

25|$|Likewise in the Battle off Samar on 25 October 1944, Yahagi fought her {{way through}} the battle without damage. On 26 October 1944, Force A was {{attacked}} by 80 carrier aircraft off Panay, followed by 30 USAAF B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and an additional 60 <b>carrier-based</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Throughout these attacks Yahagi was not hit and returned to Brunei safely.|$|E

50|$|The Grumman F9F/F-9 Cougar was an <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier-based</b> fighter <b>aircraft</b> for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. Based on Grumman's earlier F9F Panther, the Cougar {{replaced}} the Panther's straight wing {{with a more}} modern swept wing. Thrust was also increased. The Navy considered the Cougar {{an updated version of}} the Panther, despite having a different official name, and thus Cougars started off from F9F-6 upward.|$|R

25|$|The Bombardment Aircraft Rocket, {{also known}} as BOAR, the Bureau of Ordnance Aircraft Rocket, and officially as the 30.5-Inch Rocket, Mark 1, Mod 0, was an unguided air-to-surface rocket {{developed}} by the United States Navy's Naval Ordnance Test Station during the 1950s.
