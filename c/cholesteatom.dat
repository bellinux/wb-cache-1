40|$|Introduction: This study {{carried out}} a {{comparison}} in {{the frequency with which}} the infecting pathogens were detected in the suppuration caused by cholesteatoma and simple chronic otitis media in the period from 2006 to 2008. Objective: To carry out a comparative study between the bacterial findings found in the simple and cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media secretion. Method: We studied the bacterioscopy of 83 patients (125 ears) with chronic otitis media, 43 (52 ears) with <b>cholesteatom...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Labyrinthine fistula {{can lead}} to hearing loss, dizziness, and {{intracranial}} complications. The management of labyrinthine fistula is con-troversial, and hearing preservation represents a major challenge. In this study, the authors sought to identify factors related to postoperative bone conduction threshold. MATERIALS and METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using the clinical records of 23 cases operated on for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma from 2004 - 2011. Symptoms, physical examination finings, fistula test results, pre-/postoperative bone conduction results, and high-resolution temporal bone computed tomograpghy and intraoperative findings were evaluated. RESULTS: The most common symptom at presentation was hearing disturbance, and the most commonly affected site was the lateral semicircular canal. High-resolution temporal bone computed tomograpghy {{was found to be}} much more precise and effective at fistula detection than the fistula test. CONCLUSION: Postoperative hearing results are not affected by fistula location, size, or number. Complete resection at the site of a cholesteatoma-tous labyrinthine fistula is the treatment of choice. KEY WORDS: Labyrinthine fistula, hearing, bone conduction, <b>cholesteatom...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: There is a {{relationship}} between the local lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration in cholesteatoma and local bone resorption in chronic otitis media (COM) with cholesteatoma. Background: During the past decade, it has become known that the recruitment of osteoclasts is the main causative factor that induces bone destruction in COM with cholesteatoma. Cellular inflammation factors like cytokines may trigger the osteoclast. Sequel to this, LPS is able to up-regulate cytokines. This makes it of interest to study whether the local LPS concentration is related to bone resorption in cholesteatoma. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four cholesteatoma samples and control tissue from COM patients without cholesteatoma were collected. During surgery, the degree of bone resorption was established and classified. Retrospectively, the authors checked whether patients had chronic purulent otorrhea. LPS concentration of the tissue samples was measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate test. The one-way analysis of variance test was used to determine the relation between LPS concentration, otorrhea, and local bone resorption. Results: A significantly higher concentration of LPS was measured in samples from patients with cholesteatoma with bone resorption and otorrhea compared with cholesteatoma without bone resorption and control tissue. There {{were no significant differences between}} the LPS levels of the different groups of patients with bone resorption. Conclusion: It is suggested that LPS is one of the first factors in the cascade of bone resorption in COM with <b>cholesteatom...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{congenital}} and acquired cholesteatoma in the petrous apex were operated on via the translabyriathine approach. The cholesteatoma was removed, leaving {{a part of}} the matrix membrane in both cases as the matrix membrane was difficult to remove. Spaces including the mastoid and middle ear after removal of cholesteatoma were obliterated with only fibrin glue in order to pneumatize the operated space after surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the internal auditory meatus was prevented using a tiny fascia. The spaces occupied by the cholesteatoma were clearly pneumatized within 6 months after surgery in both patients. The advantage of creating pneumatized spaces after removal of <b>cholesteatoms</b> in the petrous apex was discussed...|$|R
40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden Gefrierschnitte von 28 Cholesteatomen mit unterschiedlichen Entzündungsgraden immunhistochemisch untersucht. Ziel dieser Studie war es, durch immunologische Färbemethoden eine {{quantitative}} und qualitative Bestimmung immunkompetenter Zellen im histologischen Präparat der Cholesteatomperimatrix durchzuführen. Dabei wurde die indirekte Immunperoxidase-Methode angewandt. Als Zelloberflächenmarker dienten dabei CD 25, CD 28, CD 40, CD 40 Ligand, CD 69, B 7 - 1 und B 7 - 2. Die Ergebnisse zeigten eine allgemeine Tendenz zu Zellhäufungen im Bereich der Perimatrix und stützen die These, daß sich die Entzündungsreaktion vorwiegend in der Perimatrix abspielt. Ein weiteres Resultat war, daß aktivierte T-Zellen in Abhängigkeit von der klinischen Aggressivität des <b>Cholesteatoms</b> vermehrt auftreten. Within {{this work}} I tested deep freezed probes of 28 cholesteatomas with different inflammation stadiums by using immuno histochemical methods. Aim {{of the study}} was not only to make a quantitative but also a qualitative analysis of immunocompetent cells of the cholesteatoma´s perimatrix by using immunological dyeing techniques. In this case the Indirect Immunoperoxidase Method was applied. As cell surface marker CD 25, CD 28, CD 40, CD 40 ligand, CD 69, B 7 - 1 and B 7 - 2 were used. The gained results showed a tendency of cell accumulation in the perimatrix. So it was possible to support the theory that inflammation predominantly takes place within the perimatrix. In addition to {{that it was possible to}} show that activated t-cells are occurring with increased frequency in correlation to the clinical aggression of the cholesteatoma...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the use of}} multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) in the diagnostic interpretation of superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) or thinning and its association with ear pathologies and to find whether it is an acquired condition and its association with increase in age. Materials and methods: study was performed in a tertiary care institute present in a village, following approval of the institutional ethical committee. Retrospective review of temporal bone CT examinations performed between September 2016 and March 2017 was done. 1  mm interval axial images with sagittal and coronal reformatted images were reviewed {{for the presence of}} canal dehiscence and thinning by investigators. We characterised the Superior semicircular canal status as normal, frank dehiscence or thinning. Frank dehiscence was further classified anatomically as anterior limb, apex and posterior limb dehiscence. The patient list was then subcategorized into 5 age groups, and the prevalence of SSCD was calculated for each group. Results: Retrospective review yielded 80 positive cases which included SSC dehiscence (N =  39) and thinning (N =  41). 80 normal scans were selected as control group retrospectively. Statistical analysis was performed to assess for differences between the groups studied. Pearson chi-square test applied. there was a significant association of SSC pathologies prevalence with increasing age (p = <  0. 001). No significant relationship was found between SSCD and presence of either CSOM or Cholesteatoma (p =  0. 285). Vertigo rather than Tullio phenomenon was the statistically significant complaint (p = < 0. 001). which brought the patient to the hospital. Conclusions: The SSCD and thinning belong to the same spectrum and are acquired conditions. Increasing prevalence in old age suggests it to be an acquired condition rather than a congenital one. No significant association of these condition was seen with CSOM and cholesteatoma. Vertigo is the predominat symptom bringing the patient to hospital along with Tullio phenomenon.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the value of ear {{endoscopy}} in cholesteatoma surgery and to demonstrate its consequence in improving surgical outcome. Materials and Methods: A total of 92 ears with acquired cholesteatoma (primary or secondary) were operated on. In this prospective study, 82 cases were operated on by using canal wall up (CWU) technique, and 10 cases were on operated on by using canal wall down (CWD) procedure. Endoscopically guided ear surgery was incorporated complementary to the microscope as a principal part in the procedure. Second-look endoscopic exploration was performed on some selected cases, depending on the finding during the primary surgery and the postoperative findings of clinical and computed tomo-graphic studies. Results: In the primary surgery after completion of micro-scopic cleaning, the overall incidence of intraoperative residu-als detected with the endoscope was 22. 8 %. Sinus tympani was the most common site of intraoperative residuals in both CWU and CWD groups, followed by the facial recess and the under-surface of the scutum in the CWU cases. Reconstruction of the hearing mechanism was performed in the primary surgery in 86 cases (93. 5 %) and postponed to the second stage in only six cases (6. 5 %). Out of the 82 CWU cases, 35 second-look en-doscopic explorations (42. 7 %) were performed. Three recur-rences (8. 6 %) were identified. Two cases showed a tiny re-sidual cholesteatoma pearl, and the third showed a larger open residual cholesteatoma filling the sinus tympani and extending to the aditus. In this series, no morbidity or complication was encountered secondary to the use of endoscopes in the mastoid or middle ear. Conclusion: Incorporating the endoscope into the surgical ar-mamentarium in otology contributes much to the concept of minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive endoscopic ear surgery should be accepted as a new horizon in ear surgery. In this study, it became obvious that despite the use of the endo-scope in conjunction with the operating microscope, 100 % eradication of the disease still could not be achieved; however, the use of endoscopes did reduce the residual <b>cholesteatom...</b>|$|E
