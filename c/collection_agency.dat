5|$|In 2004 the Public Roads Administration {{published}} a report documenting high administration {{costs in the}} 46 toll companies throughout the country. Along with the company for the Osterøy Bridge, SBT received the harshest criticism in the report. Especially a trip made by Chairman Harry Herstad and his wife to San Francisco to participate at a conference was criticized, as it cost the toll company NOK118,000. Also annual board member fees of NOK200,000 and excessive trips for the board were commented as wasted money. The internal audit concluded with that there were costs of NOK300,000 in 2002 and 2003 which were not properly documented or were not used in line with regulations. The report {{was rejected by the}} board, who claimed that several of the issues were misunderstandings and that the Public Roads Administration was using the report in a campaign to establish a state-run toll <b>collection</b> <b>agency.</b> Øyvind Halleraker withdrew as managing director of SBT and as chairman of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association in January 2005. He was at the time also member of parliament for the Conservative Party.|$|E
25|$|Tax {{collection}} agreements enable different {{governments to}} levy taxes through a single administration and <b>collection</b> <b>agency.</b> The federal government collects personal income taxes {{on behalf of all}} provinces and territories except Quebec and collects corporate income taxes on behalf of all provinces and territories except Alberta and Quebec. Canada's federal income tax system is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).|$|E

2500|$|In March 2009, the IRS {{announced}} that it would no longer outsource the collection of taxpayers debts to private debt <b>collection</b> <b>agencies.</b> The IRS decided not to renew contracts to private debt <b>collection</b> <b>agencies,</b> and began a hiring program at its call sites and processing centers across the country to bring on more personnel to process collections internally from taxpayers. [...] As of October 2009, the IRS has ceased using private debt <b>collection</b> <b>agencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Collection</b> <b>agencies</b> {{attempt to}} collect debt by making debtors {{believe that they}} are legally obligated to pay their debts when the debts are past the statute of {{limitations}} or were settled through a bankruptcy court.

25|$|However, {{the debt}} is still legally valid, and the {{creditor}} can attempt {{to collect the}} full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually three to seven years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside <b>collection</b> <b>agency.</b> If the amount is large (generally over $1,500–2,000), {{there is the possibility}} of a lawsuit or arbitration.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, Peru's {{international}} currency reserves were built up from nearly zero at the end of García's term to almost US$10 billion. Fujimori also left a smaller state bureaucracy and reduced government expenses (in contrast to the historical pattern of bureaucratic expansion), a technically minded (but widely perceived as politicized) administration of public entities like SUNAT (the tax <b>collection</b> <b>agency),</b> a large number of new schools (not only in Lima but in Peru's small towns), more roads and highways, and new and upgraded communications infrastructure. These improvement led to the revival of tourism, agroexport, industries and fisheries.|$|E

She was chair of the Visual Arts Board of the New South Wales Ministry for the Arts, and of the National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Organisation from 1993 to 1996. In the lead-up to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Bancroft was a member of the design {{committee}} that advised on the development of the games' official logo, and has acted as a judge for the $35,000 Country Energy Art Prize. Bancroft was a member of the board of directors of the Australian copyright <b>collection</b> <b>agency,</b> Viscopy, and while serving in that position has been an advocate of resale royalty rights for artists. She has observed that [...] "resale royalties are an intrinsic link to the improvement of the inherent rights of Australian artists to a fair income". She was a member of the Sydney Museum of Contemporary Art's Artist Advisory Group in 2005, and is a member of the Museum's Artists Board.

The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Bengali, Burmese, Khmer, Kyrgyz, Laotian, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and some material offensive to Muslims. In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain youtube.com.tr. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law. In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty <b>collection</b> <b>agency</b> PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009. In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Sutton did an {{in-depth}} qualitative study into bill collectors at a <b>collection</b> <b>agency.</b> He found that {{unlike the other}} jobs described here where employees need to act cheerful and concerned, bill collectors are selected and socialized to show irritation to most debtors. [...] Specifically, the <b>collection</b> <b>agency</b> hired agents {{who seemed to be}} easily aroused. The newly hired agents were then trained on when and how to show varying emotions to different types of debtors.

5000|$|Some <b>collection</b> <b>agencies</b> are {{departments}} or subsidiaries of {{the company}} that owns the original debt.

Opponents are also worried about the agencies' being paid on percent collected, because it will encourage the collectors to use pressure tactics to collect the maximum amount.

2500|$|The 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was [...] "the first covert (military intelligence) <b>collection</b> <b>agency</b> in {{the history}} of the United States Air Force". Begun by Major Donald Nichols as an impromptu {{extension}} of his pre-Korean War espionage in 1950, it was first dubbed [...] "Special Activities Unit Number One". In April or May 1951, it officially became the 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron. The 6004th was an unorthodox unit that engaged in espionage and aircrew escape and evasion, as well as collecting information. It was Far East Air Force's primary supplier of intelligence for the war, generating as many as 900 reports per month.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1953, {{after the}} {{fighting}} ceased, Nichols' 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was dubbed the [...] "primary [...] <b>collection</b> <b>agency</b> of FEAF [...] ". Despite {{the fact that}} the Air Force effort was as large as the CIA and Naval intelligence units in Korea, the relatively junior Nichols remained entrusted with command. However, throughout the war, agent casualties had steadily climbed as the communists increased their security measures. From the end of 1952 onwards, insertions into the north had become virtual suicide missions. Nichols was haunted by the situation: [...] "I hate to call myself a man. I had {{to be the one to}} give the orders when I knew someone was going to be killed." ...|$|E

The trailer's success was partially attributed to the film's stars promoting the trailer on their personal social networks. [...] The Fast and the Furious series marketing attempted to cultivate an online fan base which was also considered to have helped promote the film; the filmmakers responded to fan interaction, conducted an online poll to decide the title of Fast & Furious 6, brought back the character of Letty Ortiz based on fan feedback and encouraged fans to document the film's production with unofficial photos. Universal marketing co-president Michael Moses said: [...] "We’re trying to remove the studio filter as much as possible, which is a little scary because you’re ceding control... But it makes for more authentic and organic interaction with fans."
