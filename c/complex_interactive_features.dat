40|$|This article {{examines}} {{what kind of}} <b>interactive</b> <b>features</b> {{are available on the}} websites of Swedish newspapers, and what factors seem to influence the utilization of those features. Using Chung’s typology of <b>interactive</b> <b>features,</b> we can discern four types: human (features that facilitate interpersonal communication), human–medium (allowing users to express their personal opinions), medium (allowing users choice options in experiencing news stories) and medium–human (allowing users to customize news to their liking) <b>interactive</b> <b>features.</b> Factors believed to have influence over <b>interactive</b> <b>features</b> are tested using statistical analysis. Even though different factors tend to influence different types of interactivity, results indicate that the most interactive newspaper websites belong to large, national newspapers with younger web staff...|$|R
40|$|Consensus {{clustering}} and <b>interactive</b> <b>feature</b> selection {{are very}} useful methods to extract and manage knowledge from texts. While consensus clustering allows the aggregation of different clustering solutions {{into a single}} robust clustering solution, the <b>interactive</b> <b>feature</b> selection facilitates the incorporation of the users experience in text clustering tasks by selecting a set of high-level features. In this paper, we propose an approach to improve the robustness of consensus clustering using <b>interactive</b> <b>feature</b> selection. We have reported some experimental results on real-world datasets that show the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R

Types of features have also been studied in correlation to categories of news content. Theory: Marketing, marketing communications theory, and web theory are applied for the purpose of describing the differences and similarities in choices made by tabloids and broadsheets, in regards to selection and use of <b>interactive</b> <b>features.</b> Method: A quantitative method of analysis has been applied. The content of four of Sweden’s best known newspapers, Aftonbladet, Expressen, Dagens Nyheter (DN) and Svenska Dagbladet (SvD), has been analysed during the length of a week in December 2015. Results: Results indicate that tabloids interact more with their readers than broadsheets, using a broader variety of types of <b>interactive</b> <b>features</b> connected to a spectrum of social media outlets. Broadsheets use fewer types of <b>interactive</b> <b>features,</b> but offer them to their audience as much as the tabloids do. Tabloids let their readers comment on news more often than broadsheets, but broadsheets present more of actively solicited user generated content in their content. Tabloids offer most <b>interactive</b> <b>features</b> in news categorized as sports and entertainment. Broadsheets offer most <b>interactive</b> <b>features</b> in content categorised as news and entertainment...|$|R
