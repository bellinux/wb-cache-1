50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horns</b> is still unknown, {{but it is}} {{believed}} that exposure to radiation can trigger the condition. This is evidenced by a higher rate of cases occurring on the face and hands, areas that are often exposed to sunlight. Other cases have reported <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horns</b> arising from burn scars. As with many other wart-like skin conditions, a link to the HPV virus family, especially the HPV-2 subtype has been suggested.|$|R

50|$|The lesion at {{the base}} of the keratin mound is benign in the {{majority}} of cases. Malignancy is present in up to 20% of cases, with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common type.

50|$|In {{very rare}} cases, HPV may cause epidermodysplasia verruciformis in {{individuals}} with a weakened immune system. The virus, unchecked by the immune system, causes the overproduction of keratin by skin cells, resulting in lesions resembling warts or <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background : <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>horns</b> are hard, {{yellowish}} gray cornified skin growths. They {{are more}} common in white races and believed to be rare in Africans. There are few case reports of the lesion in African populations in the English literature. Materials and Methods : This report documents six patients with this lesion seen over a fourteen month period. There were three males and three females, aged 22 to 62 (mean= 47). Results : One lesion was on the scalp, the remaining on the extremities. The underlying pathologies were squamous cell carcinoma (1), Kaposi sarcoma (1), cutaneous myxoma (1), eccrine poroma (1) and the remaining two showed only chronic inflammatory changes with subepidermal lymphocytic and macrophage cell infiltrates. Conclusion : Unless cases are well documented, the perception of rarity in Africans will most likely persist. The risk of underling malignancy underscores the need for detailed evaluation and prompt management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Papillomaviruses, group-specific {{papillomavirus}} antigens, or extrachromosomal papillomavirus DNA {{were detected}} in cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and pulmonary tumors affecting {{a colony of}} European harvest mice (Micromys minutus). Skin lesions were classified as acanthomatous hyperplasia, epidermal inclusion cysts, squamous papillomas, inverted papillomas, trichoepitheliomas, and sebaceous carcinomas. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>horns</b> (hyperkeratotic papillomas) were on mucocutaneous junctions of one animal.

In contrast, by Southern blot hybridization all 28 lesions tested contained papillomavirus DNA. Papillomavirus DNA was demonstrated in two of ten benign cutaneous lesions by in situ hybridization.

40|$|Abstract Background Cutaneous horns (cornu cutaneum) are {{uncommon}} lesions {{consisting of}} keratotic material resembling {{that of an}} animal horn. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>horn</b> may arise {{from a wide range}} of the epidermal lesions, which may be benign, premalignant or malignant. Patients and methods In this respective study, we describe our experience of eleven patients with <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horn</b> treated at our centre between January 2000 and January 2004. The clinical, pathological and treatment details were extracted from the case records. Data is presented as frequency distribution. Results There were 8 male and 3 female patients with a median age of 57 years. Most of the lesions were located on the ear, hand and scalp. Surgical resection was carried out in all the lesions. There were two cases of squamous cell carcinoma, and one case of basal cell carcinoma, other 8 cases were benign. None of the lesions recurred and no adjuvant treatment was given to any of the malignant lesions. Conclusion <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>horn</b> is a clinical diagnosis that refers to a conical projection above the surface of the skin. The lesions typically occurs in sun exposed areas, particularly the face, ear, nose, forearms, and dorsum of hands. Even though our 60 % of the cutaneous horns are benign possibility of skin cancer should always be kept in mind. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{report a}} case of {{seborrheic}} keratosis of the inner canthus presenting as <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horn.</b> ObservationA 67 -year-old Asian male presented with a rod-shaped, pedunculated mass on his inner canthus. The mass grew rapidly and within 2 months measured 3. 0 cm in length and 0. 5 cm in diameter. It was completely excised and submitted for microscopic examination. The specimen consisted of a proliferation of basaloid cells arranged in a papillary pattern and associated with significant hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis of the overlying squamous epithelium. The pathological diagnosis was reported as seborrheic keratosis from {{the skin of the}} inner canthus. Conclusions and importanceSeborrheic keratosis can develop into a rapidly expanding lesion such as a <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horn</b> and can be found in unusual locations.

40|$|Abstract Introduction A <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horn</b> is a conical {{projection}} of hyperkeratotic epidermis. Though grossly resembling an animal horn, it lacks a bony core. These lesions {{have been well}} described in Caucasian patients, {{as well as in}} a number of Arabic and Asian patients. Case presentation A young female presented with a large 'horn' of five-year duration, arising from a burn scar. Excision and scalp reconstruction were performed. Histology was reported as verrucoid epidermal hyperplasia with <b>cutaneous</b> <b>horn.</b> Conclusion This may be the first documentation of this lesion in a black African. Although likely rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dermatologic lesions. Up to 40 % of cutaneous horns occur as part of a premalignant or malignant lesion, and surgical extirpation with histological examination is thus more important than the curiosity surrounding these lesions. </p...|$|E
