40|$|In {{the past}} decade, Queensland has {{introduced}} legislative measures that fundamentally affect {{the application of}} contract law to residential land and retail shop lease contracts. This article examines whether the scheme of consumer protection under these Acts, consisting of warning statements. disclosure statements, advice certificates, and <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>periods,</b> addresses fundamental bargaining inequality through {{creation of a new}} order within these markets. It proposes that the framework of rhe Acts differs from the traditional principle/counter-principle dichotomy of classical contract law, whereby the norm of the contract is supported by exceptions that reinforce the same paradigm. In doing so, this paper critically examines the formalism and objectivism of classical contract theory using the framework of the critical legal studies movement (CLS) and seeks to assess whether the consumer protection regime under these Acts answers the CLS critique of common law contract...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{conveyancing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} regulated consumer transactions in Australia with innumerable statutes nationally aimed at the regulation of the transaction or parties to it. Commonly these statutes employ a variety of mechanisms such as vendor disclosure statements, <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> rights and implied warranties all aimed at redressing the perceived information imbalance between buyers and sellers. Although the mechanisms are similar, all states and the Australian Capital Territory except Western Australia and the Northern Territory employ the statutory mechanisms in different combinations and ways. This is evident in the area of <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>periods</b> which vary in length, starting point and regulatory complexity across all relevant jurisdictions. These parochial differences are commonly recognised as increasing compliance costs for businesses operating nationally with little or no research emerging as to the consumer benefits from the regulation. Through a comparative analysis of <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> regulation in each participating jurisdiction, the article suggests that increasing the complexity of regulation creates an imbalance in the relationship allowing the consumer to take advantage of a seller's technical non-compliance despite the fact the buyer is receiving substantially what was bargained for. The article concludes by suggesting considerations for achieving a degree of regulatory equilibrium between buyers and sellers under <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> legislation which should satisfy the interests of sellers while meeting consumer protection objectives for the buyer. ...|$|R

2500|$|When the 1946 {{collective}} bargaining agreement expired in 1949, the United Steelworkers demanded that U.S. Steel provide each worker a pension. The Taft-Hartley Act's provisions permitting an injunction against a strike in an industry critical to national security were invoked {{an hour after the}} United Steelworkers walked off the job on July 7. Cyrus S. Ching, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, attempted to mediate a solution to the strike, but these talks broke down on July 11. President Truman proposed a 60-day <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>period,</b> but Fairless rejected it. Fairless proposed a fact-finding board (which had worked in the 1946 strike) and 60-day <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>period</b> on July 14, and President Truman accepted the plan the following day. As the fact-finding board conducted its hearings, in August Fairless publicly denounced what he called was [...] "dictatorial" [...] governmental regulation of wages and prices. On September 14, the fact-finding board issued its report, and said that U.S. Steel should provide pensions for its workers. [...] Fairless denounced the recommendation as a [...] "revolution" [...] against free enterprise, and rejected the fact-finding panel's report wholesale. Nonetheless, Fairless agreed to attend a mediation session in Washington, D.C., two days later. On September 17, Murray accused Fairless of imposing a double-standard on workers when he revealed that U.S. Steel was paying the pensions of its executives. Public opinion turned sharply against Fairless, and with the Taft-Hartley injunction due to expire Murray announced that the union would strike. Fairless opened bargaining with the union, and President Truman won a postponement of the strike until October 1 in order to allow negotiations to bear fruit. But the negotiations did not result in a contract, and the union struck on schedule. Murray announced on October 13 that the union would settle for a pension plan funded by a 29 cents per hour contribution from U.S. Steel. Fairless continued to resist the pension plan idea. But as layoffs spread throughout the steel industry, other steel companies began meeting with Ching to seek a resolution. [...] On October 18, Fairless quietly sent an aide to meet with Ching and to discuss the pension plan proposal. On October 31, Bethlehem Steel reached an agreement with the United Steelworkers that implemented a pension plan. [...] Under pressure to agree to the same terms, Fairless agreed to meet with Ching and Murray. But no agreement was forthcoming. [...] Jones & Laughlin Steel signed a pension plan deal with the union on November 7, and Youngstown Sheet & Tube agreed to the union's terms two days later. With all the other major steel companies resuming production, Fairless set aside his previous opposition to the pension plan and signed with the union on November 11.|$|E
2500|$|On August 20, 2005, {{after months}} of negotiations, an impasse {{declared}} by the NMB and a 30-day <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>period,</b> the over 4,750 Northwest aircraft mechanics, janitors, and aircraft cleaners represented by AMFA went on strike against the company. After numerous negotiation sessions, no agreement was reached, and the company began hiring permanent replacement workers. In mid-October, after permanently hiring about 500 non-union workers, Northwest made a final offer to the union. The offer would have saved 500 union jobs and offered four weeks of severance pay to terminated employees. This offer was worse than the original declined by the union, which would have saved over 2,000 jobs and offered 16 weeks of severance pay. On October 20, 2005, AMFA {{announced that it would}} not allow its members to vote on the offer, citing that parts of the contract would violate the union's commitment to its members. Finally, in late December 2005, Northwest made what it termed its [...] "final offer" [...] to the union. The agreement would have terminated all striking workers and given them rights to unemployment compensation. The union voted down the offer. On October 9, 2006, AMFA leadership and Northwest reached an agreement. Under the settlement, all AMFA workers still on strike as of that date will be converted to lay-off status with 5 weeks of severance pay (10 weeks if they resign from Northwest). However, these employees will have a right of recall to their old jobs. Approval of the settlement was on November 6, 2006.|$|E

40|$|The most {{fundamental}} issues in labor and employment law involve the choice among three alternatives: waivable employers 2 ̆ 7 rights, waivable employees 2 ̆ 7 rights, and nonwaivable employees 2 ̆ 7 rights. By combining standard contract analysis with a perspective informed by behavioral economics, {{it is possible}} to obtain a much better understanding of the underlying issues. Contrary to the conventional view: workers are especially averse to losses, and not so much concerned with obtaining gains; workers often do not know about legal rules, including key rules denying them rights; workers may well suffer from excessive optimism; workers care a great deal about fairness, and are willing to punish employers who have treated them unfairly, even at workers 2 ̆ 7 own expense; many workers greatly discount the future; and workers often care about relative economic position, not absolute economic position. These points suggest the advantages, in many cases, of relying on waivable employees 2 ̆ 7 rights, an approach designed to inform workers without providing the rigidity and inefficiency associated with nonwaivable terms. At the same time, these points suggest, though more ambiguously, the hazards of allowing workers to waive their rights in accordance with standard contract principles. Procedural constraints (e. g., <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>periods)</b> and substantive constraints (e. g., “floors”) on waiver may be appropriate. Norm change and preference change are also discussed. Applications include job security; parental leave; vacation time; health care; unionization; occupational safety and health; {{discrimination on the basis of}} age, race, and sex; waivers by unions; and workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation. The basic conclusion is that waivable employees 2 ̆ 7 rights are a promising and insufficiently explored option in many areas of labor and employment law...|$|R

Lust serial murder is the act of deviant behaviors by the means of brutally and sadistically killing multiple victims to achieve ultimate sexual satisfaction with <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>periods.</b> The most common motives within the lust crimes are the gaining of pleasure, control, and satisfaction toward hostile fantasies through the resulting of crimes. Lust murderers are likely to repeat the crimes {{over a long period of}} time with increase of aggressive paraphilia process. The paraphilia within the lust murders are usually involving of mutilation, flagellation, picquerism, cannibalism, vampirism, and necrophilia with victim bodies. Defines by the FBI, lust serial murderers are premeditate of each sexual offenses. Both of nature and content of the killing consistence with their sexual fantasy. Lust murderer cannot escape from his own fantasy and over time the imagines increasingly violent and deadly to escalate the lust offenders to attack. The result of the attack satisfies the offender sexual lust including power, domination, molestation, and degradation or humiliation of others. The creation of fantasy and paraphilia within the lust murderers are through their childhood development. They were predispose to trauma events; such as being sexually abuse or violently abuse by caregivers or other adults. Those individual cannot cope with past trauma events will likely to foster feelings of self-doubt, hopelessness, and helplessness. The lack of self-esteem lead the individual to isolate from society and the ability to form attachment with others. From this stage, the individual will daydreaming and fantasy become a stand-in for the social relationships that maladjusted individual is incapable of forming. Fantasy then become a safe place for that individual to fall into once encounter similar trauma events in the past experiences. Sexual fantasy active paraphilia system and eventually become process in and of itself. Most sexual lust offenders sustain their paraphilia process through fantasy, compulsive masturbation, and facilitators. Lust murderers increase the use of drug, alcohol, and pornography can escalate their paraphilic that eventually engaging in sexual homicide or lust murder.|$|R
2500|$|As World War II ended, Fairless led U.S. Streel through {{yet another}} major steel strike. [...] The United Steelworkers demanded a {{significant}} pay increase {{in order to}} once more bring pay {{in line with the}} heavy inflation brought about by the war. [...] With prices still strictly regulated by the federal government, in November 1945 Fairless refused to grant any pay increase unless the government approved a $2 per ton increase in the price of steel. Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach urged the parties to come to an agreement out of a concern for national security, but Fairless refused without a price increase. Steel industry executives asked the National Labor Relations Board to prevent a strike, but the agency said it lacked the power. The Office of Price Administration on November 24 declined to permit a price increase, arguing it would violate its price regulations. But the union agreed to a 30-day <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> <b>period,</b> and on December 31 President Harry S. Truman won agreement from Fairless and Murray to establish a fact-finding board to study the issue. One week later, the president conferred with OPA Administrator Chester Bowles, and Bowles agreed to consider a $2.50 per ton increase in the price of steel. But OPA's fact-finding was nowhere near complete. [...] With the steel strike scheduled to begin on January 13, Truman summoned Fairless and Murray to the White House on January 11. Truman convinced Murray to delay the strike one week, but the two sides were still far apart on the pay rise (Murray demanding 19 cents an hour, and Fairless offering just 15 cents an hour). On January 13, Fairless consulted with other steel industry executives about the talks. The following day, Truman indicated publicly that he would approve a $4 per ton price increase, but only if the two sides came to agreement via collective bargaining on a wage increase. Murray indicated he would accept Truman's offer. But Murray also reportedly said that the steel industry was engaged in a [...] "conspiracy" [...] to destroy the labor movement, a statement which outraged Fairless and led to a breakdown in talks. With no resolution, the strike occurred as scheduled on January 19. [...] Fairless denounced the strike as an attack on the president's wartime reconversion program, industry, and the public good. On January 24, Fairless asked the president to call a national wage and price conference covering all major industries to establish new national wage and price levels. But Truman rejected the plan, and reiterated that his basic proposal from January was the only one he would consider. On January 28, Fairless opened talks with the United Steelworkers. As the strike continued into February 1946 without resolution, Congress began holding hearings on the issue. [...] On February 9, Murray testified that Fairless had offered him a 19 cents per hour wage increase on January 12. Congressional and public opinion turned against Fairless, and on February 15 he and Murray agreed to an 18 cent an hour wage increase.|$|E
