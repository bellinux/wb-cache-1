5|$|In 2002, Chabon {{published}} Summerland, {{a fantasy}} novel written for younger readers that received mixed reviews but sold extremely well, {{and won the}} 2003 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. Two years later, he published The Final Solution, a novella about an investigation led by an unknown old man, whom the reader <b>can</b> <b>guess</b> to be Sherlock Holmes, during {{the final years of}} World War II. His Dark Horse Comics project The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, a quarterly anthology series that was published from 2004 to 2006, purported to cull stories from an involved, fictitious 60-year history of the Escapist character created by the protagonists of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. It was awarded the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Anthology and a pair of Harvey Awards for Best Anthology and Best New Series.|$|E

When he first read them, Smith found Croft and Sim's lyrics to be [...] "purposely ambiguous so people can relate to them", saying in an interview for Uncut, [...] "I mean… if I listen carefully, I do know about their lives intimately so I <b>can</b> <b>guess</b> what they’re about. But they don’t even tell each other what they’re singing about." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Owen had {{expertise}} in comparative anatomy and his professional judgements revealed {{a succession of}} similar species in the same locality, giving Darwin insights which he would later recall as being central to his new views. Owen met Darwin on 29 October 1836 and quickly took {{on the task of}} describing these new fossils. At that time the only fully described fossil mammals from South America were three species of Mastodon and the gigantic Megatherium. On 9 November Darwin wrote to his sister that [...] "Some of them are turning out great treasures." [...] The near complete skeleton from Punta Alta was apparently very closely allied to anteaters, but of the extraordinary size of a small horse. The rhinoceros sized head bought for two shillings near Mercedes was not a megatherium, but [...] "as far as they <b>can</b> <b>guess,</b> must have been a gnawing animal. Conceive a Rat or a Hare of such a size— What famous Cats they ought to have had in those days!" [...] Over the following years Owen published descriptions of the most important fossils, naming several as new species.|$|E

2500|$|Chikmagalur {{district}} {{gets its}} name from its headquarters of Chikmagalur town. It is alternatively spelt as Chickmagalur or Chikmagalur. Chikmagalur literally means [...] "The town of the younger daughter" [...] in the Kannada language. The town {{is said to have}} been given as a dowry to the younger daughter of Rukmangada, the legendary chief of Sakkarepatna and hence the name. As one <b>can</b> <b>guess,</b> there is indeed a town called Hiremagaluru which means [...] "The town of the elder daughter" [...] which is about 5km from Chikmagalur town.|$|E
2500|$|Around 2004, after most {{computer}} software became compatible with Unicode UTF-8 or UTF-16 systems, use of Greeklish was strongly discouraged in many Greek online Web discussion boards (forums) where Greeklish was in use before. Administrators threatened to ban users {{who continued to}} use Greeklish, thus making the use of Greek mandatory; but using Greeklish failed to become a serious reason to get banned. Examples include the , the [...] , the [...] , the , the [...] forum, the [...] and the [...] Greek student forum. The {{reason for this is}} the fact that text written in Greeklish is considerably less aesthetically pleasing, and also much harder to read, compared to text written in the Greek alphabet. A non-Greek speaker/reader <b>can</b> <b>guess</b> this by this example: [...] "δις ιζ χαρντ του ριντ" [...] would be the way to write [...] "this is hard to read" [...] in English but utilizing the Greek alphabet.|$|E
2500|$|After the Liberation of Paris, {{the first}} post-World War II Salon d'Automne {{was to be}} held in the fall of 1944 in the newly freed capital. Picasso was given a room of his own that he filled with {{examples}} of his wartime production. It was a triumphant return for Picasso who had remained aloof from the art scene during the war. The exhibition however, was [...] "marred by disturbances that have remained unattributed" [...] according to Michèle C. Cone (New York-based critic and historian, author of French Modernisms: Perspectives on Art before, during and after Vichy, Cambridge 2001). On Nov. 16, 1944, Matisse wrote a letter to Camoin: [...] "Have you seen the Picasso room? It is much talked about. There were demonstrations in the street against it. What success! If there is applause, whistle." [...] One <b>can</b> <b>guess</b> who the demonstrators might have been, writes Cone, [...] "cronies of the Fauves, still ranting against the Judeo-Marxist decadent Picasso".|$|E

2500|$|Although her {{previous}} album {{was a huge}} success, Yener decided to improve and refine her music style once more. She would leave the Türk pop, paving the way to incorporate a more dance-friendly Europop sound, along with changing [...] her appearance as well. She cut and dyed her black from blonde. The result was [...] "Apayrı" [...] (Totally Different), which came out in early 2006. Some of the hit singles that came out from [...] "Apayrı" [...] included, [...] "Kelepçe" [...] (Handcuffs), [...] "Aşkın Ateşi" [...] (The Fire of Love) and [...] "Kim Bilebilir Aşkı" [...] (Who <b>Can</b> <b>Guess</b> What Love Is). Each of these singles featured different genres that simply wowed Turkey. [...] "Kelepçe" [...] had a groovy disco sound to it. [...] "Aşkın Ateşi" [...] was a sweet pop track and [...] "Kim Bilebilir Aşkı" [...] featured a Far-Eastern sound that had hints of techno felt throughout the song. The album sold 200 000 copies.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 December he {{returned}} to London and began finding takers for his specimens, with Thomas Bell and the Revd. William Buckland interested in the reptiles. Darwin's reputation was being made by the giant mammal fossils. Owen's first surprising revelation was that a hippopotamus sized fossil skull 2feet4inches (710mm) long which Darwin had bought for about two shillings near Mercedes while on a [...] "galloping" [...] trip 120miles (190km) from Montevideo was of an extinct rodent-like creature resembling a giant capybara, which Owen named Toxodon. Darwin wrote to his sister Caroline that [...] " [...] are turning out great treasures" [...] and of the Toxodon, [...] "There is another head, {{as large as a}} Rhinoceros which as far as they <b>can</b> <b>guess,</b> must have been a gnawing animal. Conceive a Rat or a Hare of such a size – What famous Cats they ought to have had in those days!" [...] The College of Surgeons distributed casts of the fossils to the major scientific institutions.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they <b>can</b> <b>guess</b> which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E
