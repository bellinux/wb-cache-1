5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
25|$|Most {{butterflies}} have bright colours {{on their}} wings. Nocturnal moths {{on the other}} hand are usually plain brown, grey, white or black and often with obscuring patterns of zigzags or swirls which help camouflage them from predators as they rest during the day. However, many day-flying moths are brightly coloured, particularly if they are toxic. These diurnal species evolved to locate their mates visually and not primarily by pheromone as their drab nocturnal cousins. A few butterflies are also plain-coloured, like the <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> butterfly or the baron butterfly.|$|E
50|$|In {{tests in}} Uganda it was {{determined}} that when offered six brassicaceous crops, <b>white</b> <b>cabbage,</b> broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Chinese cabbage and Indian mustard, the insect preferred to lay its eggs on Chinese cabbage and broccoli. Offered the choice of Chinese <b>cabbage</b> and <b>white</b> <b>cabbage,</b> the reduction of egg-laying on the <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> ranged from 69 to 100%.|$|R

50|$|Glucosinolates {{occur as}} {{secondary}} metabolites {{of almost all}} plants of the order Brassicales (e.g. families Brassicaceae = Cruciferae, Capparidaceae, and Caricaceae), {{but also in the}} genus Drypetes (family Putranjivaceae). For example, glucosinolates occur in <b>cabbages</b> (<b>white</b> <b>cabbage,</b> Chinese cabbage, broccoli), watercress, horseradish, capers and radishes. They are typically in parts consumed, with the pungent taste of these vegetables due to breakdown products (isothiocyanates or mustard oils) of glucosinolates. The glucosinolates are also found in the seeds of these plants.|$|R
500|$|Before the Stones {{opened their}} set, Jagger {{addressed}} the crowd, {{asking them to}} be quiet so he could read something {{as a tribute to}} Jones. He then read two stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem on John Keats's death, Adonaïs, from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> butterflies were released, despite the Royal Parks authority having stipulated before the concert that any butterflies released by the Stones should be sterilised and should certainly not be of the voracious <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> genus (Pieris spp.). 2,500 butterflies were due to be released, but due to the hot weather, many of them died from lack of air in storage. Watts later said that the butterflies [...] "were a bit sad, there were casualties. It was like the Somme".|$|E
500|$|Fans {{started to}} arrive at the park with candles on 4 July in tribute to Jones, and by the morning of 5 July, 7,000 people had already gathered. Mick Jagger read a short eulogy on stage before the Stones' set began, reading two stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem on John Keats's death, Adonaïs, from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> {{butterflies}} were released. The setlist for their performance was [...] "I'm Yours & I'm Hers", [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash". [...] "Mercy Mercy", [...] "Down Home Girl", [...] "Stray Cat Blues", [...] "No Expectations", [...] "I'm Free", [...] "Loving Cup", [...] "Love in Vain", [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", [...] "Honky Tonk Women", [...] "Midnight Rambler", [...] "Street Fighting Man" [...] and [...] "Sympathy for the Devil".

500|$|Pests include root-knot {{nematodes}} {{and cabbage}} maggots, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; aphids, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; harlequin bugs, which cause white and yellow leaves; thrips, {{which lead to}} leaves with white-bronze spots; striped flea beetles, which riddle leaves with small holes; and caterpillars, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves. The caterpillar stage of the [...] "small <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> butterfly" [...] (Pieris rapae), commonly known in the United States as the [...] "imported cabbage worm", is a major cabbage pest in most countries. The large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae) is prevalent in eastern European countries. The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops. In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide. Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) and the cabbage maggot (Hylemya brassicae), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.|$|E

40|$|In two field experiments, {{growth of}} <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> in pure stands was {{compared}} with that of cabbage grown in living mulch systems to reduce pest attacks. The roots of the living mulch were pruned early in the season, with the aim of reducing competition and increasing growth of the <b>white</b> <b>cabbage.</b> Root pruning was shown to increase the above-ground biomass of <b>white</b> <b>cabbage,</b> with two prunings giving higher cabbage yields than one, but there were clear differences between the living mulch species tested (red clover, birdsfoot trefoil, salad burnet, winter rye). Below-ground growth and competition were examined by measuring root distribution in minirhizotrons and uptake of 15 N placed at different soil depths.

40|$|Present {{studies were}} made to {{investigate}} the association between epidermal thickness and resistance of <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> against onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, 1889 (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Six <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> varieties including three susceptible (‘Green Gem’, ‘Hurricane’ and ‘Quisor’) and three resistant to onion thrips (‘Balashi’, ‘Bloktor’ and ‘Riana’) {{were involved in the}} studies. Additionally, the extent of antixenotic resistance during head formation and the level of thrips damage at harvest were also assessed and compared between varieties. A higher density of onion thrips was observed on susceptible than on resistant varieties. The results indicate that the epidermis is of the same thickness in susceptible <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> varieties as in resistant ones; therefore, we conclude that the thicknesses of either the adaxial or the abaxial part of the epidermis of head-forming leaves is not responsible for cabbage resistance to thrips. The study thus confirms that antixenotic resistance of <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> to thrips is not determined by epidermal thickness...|$|R

50|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} not only an {{activator}} of male sexual behavior: Its absence may also stop an approaching male and his attempt to copulate. Female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies are not always receptive to male <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies and to communicate this message, they assume the mate refusal posture. This behavior consists of opening the wings and straightening the abdomen. Opening of the wings in this manner exposes the dorsal side of the female wings which are known to be unable to reflect ultraviolet light. In effect, females are removing the ultraviolet signal that initiates male sexual behavior, resulting in the abrupt halt of male sexual behavior. Female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies take advantage of the personal butterfly ultraviolet communication system to also reject males by removing an ultraviolet reflectance signal.|$|R
