50|$|The first <b>time</b> <b>clock</b> {{was invented}} on November 20, 1888, by Willard Bundy, a jeweler in Auburn, New York. A year later his brother, Harlow Bundy, {{organized}} the Bundy Manufacturing Company, and began mass-producing <b>time</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R

He, however, failed to realize that the <b>time</b> <b>clock</b> also allowed for double overtime when they came in to clean the diner on Sunday. He eventually was forced to pay them for the ten hours of work they did and threw out the <b>time</b> <b>clock,</b> but not without making a fuss about it.|$|R

50|$|The highway changes {{time zones}} not once, but twice, during its trek through Kansas, the only highway {{in the state}} to do so. <b>Central</b> Standard <b>Time</b> is {{observed}} in Morton and Stanton Counties after entering Oklahoma, but the time zone changes to Mountain Standard Time when the highway crosses from Stanton into Hamilton County. Hamilton and the next three counties to the north (Greeley, Wallace, and Sherman) observe Mountain <b>time,</b> but <b>clocks</b> revert to <b>Central</b> <b>Time</b> at the Sherman County-Cheyenne County line.|$|R

50|$|In {{mechanical}} <b>time</b> <b>clocks</b> {{this was}} accomplished by inserting a heavy paper card, called a time card, into a slot on the <b>time</b> <b>clock.</b> When the <b>time</b> card hit a contact {{at the rear of}} the slot, the machine would print day and time information (a timestamp) on the card.|$|R

50|$|The mass {{production}} of clocks and watches further tightened time {{discipline in the}} Western world; before these machines were made, and made to be more accurate, it would be pointless to complain about someone's being fifteen, or five, minutes late. For many employees, the <b>time</b> <b>clock</b> was the clock that told the time that mattered: it was the clock that recorded their hours of work. By the <b>time</b> that <b>time</b> <b>clocks</b> became commonplace, public, synchronized <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> was considered a fact of life. Uniform, synchronized, public <b>clock</b> <b>time</b> did not exist until the nineteenth century.|$|R

The user status window is used by employees to start work, stop work, change activities, open their mailbox, or print their timecard. Employees can access their user status window via several different interfaces, like selecting their name from an in & out list, using a numeric PIN, an alphanumeric passcode, or an individual interface that creates a personal <b>time</b> <b>clock.</b> The administration window is used by managers and administrators to edit timecards, print reports, approve payroll, and configure your <b>time</b> <b>clock.</b> The administration window is only available from the Pro Client...|$|R
