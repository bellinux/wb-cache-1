40|$|<b>Central</b> venous <b>line</b> {{is one of}} a {{creative}} instrument that saves human’s life in critical medical situation. <b>Central</b> venous <b>line</b> access is frequently involved in the disease management. It is used for rapid fluid therapy, transvenous pacemakers, infusion of some medications, hemodialysis or plasmapheresis and etc. Most of the emergency departments have some staffs that are trained for <b>central</b> venous <b>line</b> insertion but related complications occur during <b>central</b> venous <b>line</b> placement. <b>Central</b> venous <b>line</b> might have some complications and complication follow-up should be considered. Thromboembolism and infection are two important medical complications. Arterial puncture, hematoma, pneumothorax and hemothorax are mechanical <b>Central</b> venous <b>line</b> complications. Chest X-ray and some other techniques should be used for detecting these complications. <b>Central</b> venous <b>line</b> tip misplace is a considerable problem for emergency department staffs, previously chest X-ray has been used for <b>central</b> venous <b>line</b> misplace detection. In some recent studies, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and intravascular electrocardiography have been used for <b>central</b> venous <b>line</b> misplace...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{surfaces}} with microscale checkerboard patterns consisting of continuous <b>central</b> <b>lines</b> and discontinuous lateral lines were fabricated. The surface wetting properties of these checkerboard patterns {{were found to}} be anisotropic. The <b>central</b> continuous <b>lines</b> were found to have a strong influence on the dynamic wetting properties and moving trajectories of the water droplets. The droplets move more easily in the direction parallel to the <b>central</b> continuous <b>lines</b> and less easily in the direction perpendicular to the <b>central</b> continuous <b>lines.</b> Meanwhile, the droplets' moving path tends to incline toward the <b>central</b> continuous <b>lines</b> from a tilting direction. When the microsurface was modified with a layer of nanowire, the surface wettability was found to be isotropic and superhydrophobic...|$|R
5|$|The CLR {{employed}} the engineers James Henry Greathead, Sir John Fowler, and Sir Benjamin Baker {{to design the}} railway. The official opening of the CLR (now the <b>Central</b> <b>line)</b> by the Prince of Wales took place on 27 June 1900; it was {{opened to the public}} on 30 July. Oxford Circus station opened as part of the first section of the line, between Shepherd's Bush and Bank. As part of the 1935—40 New Works Programme, the misaligned tunnels of the central section on the <b>Central</b> <b>line</b> that slowed running speeds were corrected and the platforms lengthened to accommodate longer trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in London fare zone 1.

Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally <b>Central</b> <b>line</b> trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:53 to 00:30 westbound and 05:51 to 00:33 eastbound.

5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the <b>central</b> <b>line</b> of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its <b>central</b> <b>line.</b> This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out.

Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built {{in the basement of the}} Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the <b>Central</b> <b>line</b> and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the <b>Central</b> <b>line</b> platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 Liverpool Street {{became the}} new {{terminus}} of the Central London Railway {{after the completion}} of an extension project from Bank. The deep-level <b>Central</b> <b>line</b> platforms 4 and 5 opened on 28 July 1912 as the eastern terminus of the Central London Railway.

50|$|The National Patient Safety Goals require {{documentation}} of a checklist for CVC insertion and Disinfection of intravenous (IV) access ports before use (scrub the hub). Some literature has suggested {{the use of}} a safer vascular access route, like intraosseous (IO) vascular access, when <b>central</b> <b>lines</b> are not necessary (for example, when <b>central</b> <b>lines</b> are being placed only for vascular access). Infection risks were initially thought to be less in jugular lines, but the decreased rate of infection is only seen in obese people.|$|R
2500|$|While some <b>central</b> <b>lines</b> {{have their}} {{catheter}} {{pass through the}} skin and then directly into the vein, other <b>central</b> <b>lines</b> called [...] "tunneled catheters" [...] insert through the skin and then pass or [...] "tunnel" [...] a significant distance before inserting into the vein. [...] This {{reduces the risk of}} infection, since bacteria from the skin surface are not able to travel directly into the vein. These catheters are also often made of materials that resist infection and clotting. These include the Hickman line or Broviac catheter.|$|R
