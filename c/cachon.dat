50|$|Juan {{gets the}} job as chauffeur with Empresas Farel, {{but in order to}} empress Marely, he tells the <b>Cachon</b> family that he is {{actually}} a lawyer with the company. He becomes Paula's chauffeur and falls in love with her as well.|$|E
50|$|At {{approximately}} 14:00 {{local time}} the ships RFA Sir Tristram and RFA Sir Galahad were badly damaged by five A-4Bs of Grupo 5. Three A-4s targeted Sir Galahad, which {{was hit by}} three bombs from First Lieutenant Carlos <b>Cachón.</b> The second Skyhawk was unable to drop its bombs, and the third overshot the British ship.|$|E
50|$|This {{neighborhood}} {{is named after}} the bridge over the Arroyo de <b>Cachón,</b> {{a tributary of the}} Guadarranque which separates this village from a large industrial park across the river. Puente Mayorga lies along CA-34. The highway CA-2321 links with Guadarranque. A regular bus runs between Puente Mayorga and the towns of San Roque and La Línea de la Concepción.|$|E
50|$|The first trilingual Japanese {{dictionary}} incorporating French {{was written}} in 1854 by Murakami Eishun, and the first large Franco-Japanese dictionary was published in 1864. The French language was taught by Mermet de <b>Cachon</b> in Hakodate in 1859, or by Léon Dury in Nagasaki between 1863 and 1873. Léon Dury, who was also French Consul in Nagasaki, taught to about 50 students every year, among whom were future politicians such as Inoue Kowashi or Saionji Kinmochi.|$|E
50|$|Juan Dominguez, {{while walking}} the streets of Mexico City, comes across an {{attractive}} older woman, Nidia <b>Cachon</b> (Sylvia Pasquel). After flirting with her, they proceed {{to go back to}} her house, where she attempts to seduce him. He starts to lose interest when her two daughters, Yadira (Dacia Arcaraz) and Marely (Florencia de Saracho) comes into the house. He instantly falls in love with Marely, quickly losing complete interest in Nidia. Not long after that, Nidia's husband returns home.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Juan, {{who has been}} living in the <b>Cachon</b> household, decided to get a job, since the family no longer had any money. When he coincidentally finds a job as a chauffeur for Empresas Farell, he enlists the help of Enrique to learn how to drive. Enrique is a bus driver and after much persuasion, allows Juan to use his bus. Juan gets into an {{accident}} and then gets into a fight with the other driver.|$|E
5000|$|Weston has met {{and become}} friends with First Lieutenant Carlos <b>Cachon,</b> the Argentine pilot who dropped the bomb which caused his injuries. He was criticised for this move by {{families}} of those who fought in the Falklands War, which he simply dismissed, saying [...] "I don't {{have a problem with}} other people criticising me for things I do, as long as people understand why I did them. Then I don't have a problem to walk away and say 'you're entitled to your opinions'." ...|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, Juan makes {{friends with}} one of the other company chauffeurs, Fernando. Juan is looking for an excuse to take Marely out on a date. He convinces Fernando to come with him, taking out Yadira to make the whole thing seem more innocent. Fernando tells Yadira that he is also an {{executive}} lawyer for Empresas Farell. Because of this, Yadira breaks off her relationship with Enrique for the person who supposedly has more money. The whole <b>Cachon</b> family, at this point, thinks both Juan and Fernando are very important people in this company.|$|E
5000|$|Important towns {{near the}} shores of Enriquillo include Neiba, the capital of Baoruco Province, on the northeast, and Jimaní, the capital of Independencia Province, at {{the western end of}} the lake near the border with Haiti. La Descubierta is the town nearest to the {{entrance}} of Lago Enriquillo e Isla Cabritos National Park. [...] The community of Boca de <b>Cachon,</b> near the lake and severely affected by the rising waters, {{has been the subject of}} government relocation efforts including the construction of a new town further from {{the shores of}} Enriquillo.|$|E
50|$|She {{began her}} career in the soap opera, Las vías del amor (2002) {{in the role of}} Pamela Fernandez. Then she joined the cast of Piel de otoño, in 2005, in a role with Alessandra Rosaldo. She was {{featured}} in the role of Liliana Mendoza in Sueños y Caramelos. In 2006, she was a contributor to teen telenovela Rebelde as Romina and appeared in Yo amo a Juan Querendón as Marely <b>Cachón</b> de la Cueva. In 2008,she portrayed the evil Mariela Fregoso in Juro que te amo and in the following year, played Elena Parra-Ibañez in Mar de Amor joining in 2010, the cast of Cuando me enamoro substituting Wendy González in the role of Adriana Beltran.|$|E
50|$|After much {{deliberation}} and arguing, Ana and Paula {{decide to}} go to the viewing. Well before they arrive, the characters of the <b>Cachon</b> Family begin to show their true colors, and two more characters are introduced. Nidia acts the part of the bereaved wife, while constantly hitting on Juan. The family lawyer, Alfirio Perefan, (Roberto D’amico) also tries to comfort Nidia, while subtly hinting that he is in love with her. Yadira is grieving with her boyfriend Enrique Bueno (Eugenio Bartilotti), who is only there because Yadira wants him to be. He often sleeps when bored and not actively engaged in conversation. Marely grieves by herself, getting angry with her mother and sister periodically because they are not acting appropriately.|$|E
5000|$|Les fosses del silenci also {{investigates the}} {{circumstances}} of the murder of a miner activist, Jose Landera <b>Cachon,</b> known as Periquete. In Armengou and Belis's book of the filming details of Periquete's great-nephew's search for Periquete's killers are given - and how he managed to meet an elderly Falangist implicated in the killing - by telling him he is interested {{in the history of the}} Falange in the region. At the moment he reveals he is the great-nephew of Periquete, Arturon (the Falangist), [...] "became very pale. Three days later he died of a heart attack." [...] On a road on the outskirts of the town of Prado de Paradina (Province of León) he confronts another Falangist, reported by Arturon to have been involved in the murder of Periquete. The Falangist is challenged and questioned - [...] "Through this simulation of judicial process, Landera - and the filmmakers - emulate a prosecutory process unlikely to ever take place in the courtrooms of Spain." [...] During Jose Maria Aznar's presidency, the state run television station la 2, refused to purchase and air Les fossses del silenci.|$|E
50|$|While the {{existence}} of the bullwhip effect has been extensively documented (e.g., Forrester (1961), Sterman (1989), and Lee et al. (1997)) Croson and Donohue (2006), there have been arguments about its existence in the overall economy or in supply chains encompassing numerous companies. <b>Cachon</b> et al. (2007) recently argued that no evidence of {{the existence}} of the bullwhip effect could be found. Fransoo and Wouters (2000) and Chen and Lee (2009) argue that in order to observe the bullwhip effect it is crucial to measure it correctly. Both these papers argue that improper aggregation essentially takes away the opportunity to observe the bullwhip effect. In the beer distribution game (Sterman, 1989), the bullwhip effect is created by a single pulse. In Sterman's experiment, this single pulse is an increase in the demand level. In the case of the Lehman Wave that started in September 2008 the single pulse is a synchronized decrease in the target inventory level along the entire supply chain. A reduction of inventories under stable or slightly decreasing sales can only be achieved if purchases are reduced or postponed. As a consequence of the decision to reduce inventory, therefore, many companies substantially reduced their purchases of supplies or raw materials. Obviously, companies further upstream in the supply chain were hit more than companies downstream. So the Lehman Wave can be described as a synchronized bullwhip.|$|E

30|$|If SC members {{coordinate}} their {{decision based on}} the whole SC optimal objective, the performance of SC will be improved (<b>Cachon</b> 2003). A comprehensive literature review of supply chain coordination through contracts has been provided by <b>Cachon</b> (2003). Among various SC coordination mechanisms, buyback policies (Yao et al. 2011; Ai et al. 2012), revenue-sharing mechanisms (Palsule-Desai 2013), sales rebate contracts (Saha 2013), quantity-flexibility models (Karakaya and Bakal 2013) and quantity discount contracts {{are the most common}} ones.|$|E

30|$|Fast fashion apparels {{are highly}} fashionable {{products}} with affordable {{prices in the}} mid-to-low range, which demands for quick response and frequent assortment changes (Vecchi and Buckley 2016; Elavia 2014; Caro and Martínez-de-Albéniz 2015; <b>Cachon</b> and Swinney 2011). As mentioned by Bhardwaj and Fairhurst (2009), Jovanovic et al. (2014), Memic and Minhas (2011) and <b>Cachon</b> and Swinney (2011), frequent fluctuation of customer demand with smaller batch quantities and, short production and distribution lead-times, are the key characteristics of fast fashion apparels. Because of the increasing consumer demand, fast fashion segment in apparel industry has shown a rapid growth internationally during past few years (Mo 2015; Jovanovic et al. 2014; Moretta Tartaglione and Antonucci 2013; Aus 2011). More importantly, Caro and Martínez-de-Albéniz (2015) stated it as a high growth potential area of international apparel business.|$|E
30|$|Some papers link goods {{delivery}} {{supply chain}} design to emissions impacts. <b>Cachon</b> [4] investigates {{the relationship between}} retail store density and greenhouse gas emissions while considering cost implications. Stoopen [25] evaluates three scenarios in terms of routing and cost, determining that results depend heavily on “several factors, such as order volumes, vehicle size, distance, fees, and government regulations”.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} price-only contracts in supply chain capacity procurement games. For a two-party supply chain, comprising a manufacturer and a supplier that both invest in capacity, we prove {{the existence of}} a class of coordinating price-only contracts that arbitrarily allocate the supply chain profit. Moreover, if the supplier's reservation profit is below a certain threshold, the manufacturer's optimal contract is a quantity-premium price-only schedule, that is, the average wholesale price per unit increases in the order size. We prove that the manufacturer prefers simple piecewise-linear quantity-premium contracts to linear contracts and show numerically that such contracts are highly efficient. We extend our results for piecewise-linear price schedules to N-supplier assembly systems. We also enrich the voluntary compliance regime of <b>Cachon</b> and Lariviere (2001). With this enrichment, we prove that share-the-pain contracts, such as firm commitment and options contracts, increase supplier capacity in the full information case, a result that contrasts with that of <b>Cachon</b> and Lariviere. Finally, {{we investigate}} when a manufacturer prefers single-breakpoint quantity premiums to firm commitments. Supply Chain, Capacity, Pricing, Coordination...|$|E
