In Experiment 1, a pea-corn diet was supplemented with 5 levels of methionine (0 to. 3 %) in combination with amprolium-etho-pabate (125 to 140 ppm), lasalocid (125 ppm), or monensin (121 ppm). In the second experiment, two different types of diets (corn-soy and pea-corn) were used which differed primarily in the source of protein. These two diets were supplemented with methionine (. 1 %), lincomycin (2 ppm), or a combination of lincomycin and methionine. Either lasalocid (100 ppm) or monensin (100 ppm) was used as a coccidiostat. At a suboptimum level of sulfur-containing amino acids (SAA), lasalocid in Experiments 1 and 2 and lincomycin in Experiment 2 were found to have growth and feed efficiency stimulating effects. The SAA requirement for growth was reduced by as much as. 1 % in the presence of lasalo-cid.

Four phytochemicals were selected on the basis that they reduce the virulence of Eimeria spp. and/or provide immune modulatory benefits to host cells: betaine, carvacrol, curcumin and Echinacea purpurea extract (EP). Madin–Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were covered by medium containing phytochemicals at the highest concentration which was non-toxic to the cells. Salinomycin 50 μg/ml was positive control; negative control was medium only. E. tenella (Houghton strain) sporozoites were added to wells and after incubation for 2, 4 or 20 h at 37 °C, cells were fixed and stained with hematoxylin–eosin. Ten evenly spaced fields per well were photographed and the percentage of cells invaded by sporozoites was calculated and normalized to the control. At 2 h, carvacrol, curcumin and EP showed a significantly lower percentage of sporozoite invasion than the untreated control; in contrast, betaine treatment represented a significantly higher invasion percentage. Combining carvacrol with EP inhibited E. tenella invasion more effectively than applying the compounds individually, but the further addition of curcumin did not reduce invasion further. In conclusion, this study shows that invasion of MDBK epithelial cells by E. tenella sporozoites is inhibited in the presence of carvacrol, curcumin, or EP and enhanced by betaine.

The leaves of Azadirachta indica and Rauvolfia vomitoria were harvested and dried in the sun until they became crispy but still greenish in coloration. They were washed and then boiled (40 g of chopped leaves in 9 L of water). The decoctions were placed in separate sterilized bottles ready for use and were offered ad libitum.

The total replacement of antibiotics <b>and</b> <b>coccidiostat</b> resulted in non-significant depression (p< 0. 05) in final body weight and weight gain in experimental birds. However, feed intake was slightly affected (p< 0. 05) by administration of RVD to broilers. There was no significant effect of decoctions on water intake, feed conversion efficiency and mortality. Decoction had no significant influence on the dressing percentage, weights of crop (full), heart, proventriculus (full), intestines (full), feet and head.

The concentration level of the target analytes at which the validation experiments {{have been carried out}} varied between 1 and 9 mg kg. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by a clean-up by solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified either by matrix matched standards or by the standard addition technique, obtaining the following performance profile of the method for the various analyte/matrix combinations. When quantifying against matrix matched standards, the concentration independent intermediate precision expressed in terms of relative percentage standard deviation varied between 4 and 10 % and the relative percentage recovery rates ranged from 87 to 120 % depending on the target analyte and matrix. When using the standard addition technique, the corresponding values for the intermediate precision varied between 2 and 8 % and the relative percentage recovery rate ranged from 73 to 115 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix combinations but were in all cases below 0. 014 mg kg and 0. 046 mg kg respectively. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for {{the determination of}} ionophore coccidiostats in target feed. The main field of application of the validated method is to enforce European legislation regarding the authorisation of coccidiostats, focusing on the measurement at the authorised levels and at low level in feed during the withdrawal period at which the coccidiostats must not be added to the feed.

The combination of sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim plus lasalocid significantly (P<. 01) improved weight gain and final body weight, but the length of time that sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim were fed did not have any effect. Sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim plus monensin treatment resulted in better feed conversion as compared with the other treatments.

40|$|White {{striping}} (WS) is {{a muscle}} alteration {{characterized by the}} presence of white striations parallel to the direction of muscle fibers that affects poultry meat. To evaluate the age of WS onset in broiler chickens, and the effect of diet and different coccidiosis control programs on WS prevalence an experimental study was conducted on 180 chickens. One-day-old chicks were randomly divided into four experimental treatments: control, <b>coccidiostat,</b> vaccinated, <b>and</b> vaccinated fed with a low energy diet. Twenty animals per treatment were sacrifi ced at 12 and 25 days of age, breasts were scored for WS (0 =absence, 1 =mild, 2 =severe) and a sample of each breast was collected for histology. The remaining chickens were slaughtered at 51 days of age and breasts were scored for WS. WS appearance was detected grossly only at 25 and 51 days, but histological lesion were present since 12 days of age. At 51 days the WS prevalence was above 90 % in all groups, no {{differences were found between the}} two different diets, but a signifi cantly higher prevalence of score 2 was present in the Coccidiostat group vs others (P< 0. 001), suggesting a coccidiostat effect on WS appearance...|$|R
40|$|Due to an {{increasing}} demand for natural products to control coccidiosis in broilers, we investigated {{the effects of}} supplementing a combination of ethanolic extracts of Artemisia annua and Curcuma longa in drinking water. Three different dosages of this herbal mixture were compared with a negative control (uninfected), a positive control (infected <b>and</b> untreated), chemical <b>coccidiostats</b> (nicarbazin+narazin <b>and,</b> later, salinomycin), vaccination, and a product based on oregano. Differences in performance (weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion rate), mortality, gross intestinal lesions and oocyst excretion were investigated. Broilers given chemical coccidiostats performed better than all other groups. Broilers given the two highest dosages of the herbal mixture had intermediate lesion scores caused by Eimeria acervulina, which was higher than in broilers given coccidiostats, but less than in broilers given vaccination, oregano and in negative controls. There was a trend for lower mortality (P = 0 center dot 08) in the later stage of the growing period (23 - 43 days) in broilers given the highest dosage of herbal mixture compared with broilers given chemical coccidiostats. In conclusion, the delivery strategy of the herbal extracts is easy to implement at farm level, but further studies on dose levels and modes of action are needed...|$|R
40|$|Poultry farming {{represents}} 30 % of {{meat production}} worldwide. The occurrence of animal parasites {{is an enormous}} problem of poultry farming. This problem is recorded from factory farming {{as well as from}} small farming and causes financial losses. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain basic data about the occurrence of coccidia in the intestines and about the occurrence of coccidia oocysts in the excrements of indoor broilers and carrier hens. Broilers and carrier hens were fed by dietary supplements which were supposed to have influence on native gut microflora composition and on weight gain. The experiment was conducted on 250 individuals of broilers. Broilers were divided into 5 groups according to dietary supplement (one group consisted of 50 individuals). Experimental groups were as follows: prebiotics, probiotics, homeopathic, coccidiostatics. One control group was also made. In the experimental groups dietary supplements were served every day from the 8 th to 22 nd day after the birth. The samples of excrements were tested in a laboratory twice a week. During 42 nd and 57 th day after the birth the samples of intestines of death chicken were tested three times (five individuals was chosen from every experimental group). Every individual was weighted before the slaughter, the samples of intestines were screened for occurrence, amount and type of coccidia right after the slaughter. The decrease of frequency of coccidia oocysts occurrence in the excrements in the experimental group prebiotics, homeopathics and control group in comparison with experimental group probiotics <b>and</b> <b>coccidiostats</b> was proved. The frequency of coccidia oocysts occurrence was the lowest by the experimental group prebiotics and by control group. The frequency of coccidia oocysts occurrence was the highest by the experimental group probiotics <b>and</b> <b>coccidiostats.</b> The highest weight gains were recorded by the control group (ø 2. 55) in comparison with the group with coccidiostats (ø 1. 99) ...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{pressures to}} reduce or eliminate the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion purposes in production animals, {{there is a growing}} need to better understand the effects elicited by these agents in order to identify alternative approaches that might be used to maintain animal health. Antibiotic usage at subtherapeutic levels is postulated to confer a number of modulations in the microbes within the gut that ultimately result in growth promotion and reduced occurrence of disease. This study examined the effects of the <b>coccidiostat</b> monensin <b>and</b> the growth promoters virginiamycin and tylosin on the broiler chicken cecal microbiome and metagenome. Using a longitudinal design, cecal contents of commercial chickens were extracted and examined using 16 S rRNA and total DNA shotgun metagenomic pyrosequencing. A number of genus-level enrichments and depletions were observed in response to monensin alone, or monensin in combination with virginiamycin or tylosin. Of note, monensin effects included depletions of Roseburia, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus, and enrichments in Coprococcus and Anaerofilum. The most notable effect observed in the monensin/virginiamycin and monensin/tylosin treatments, but not in the monensin-alone treatments, was enrichments in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the metagenomic dataset identified enrichments in transport system genes, type I fimbrial genes, and type IV conjugative secretion system genes. No significant differences were observed with regard to antimicrobial resistance gene counts. Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive glimpse of the chicken cecu...|$|R

Other EU control laboratories and one laboratory from Switzerland also joined the exercise. This report presents the results of the proficiency test (PT). Thirty-two laboratories from 22 countries registered to the exercise. Three test items were produced, homogenised and distributed by the EURL-FA Control. Two contained 4 <b>and</b> 3 selected <b>coccidiostats</b> respectively <b>and</b> the third one was a blank. Laboratory results were rated using z- and ζ-scores (zeta-scores). Between 64 % and 80 % of the laboratories reported satisfactory results for monensin, narasin, nicarbazin and maduramicin. For lasalocid, only 59 % of the laboratories submitted satisfactory results, 58 % for diclazuril and 53 % for halofuginone. The results are summarised in the following Table 1. The laboratories also reported qualitative results as regards the presence of {{one or more of the}} other authorised coccidiostats. On the whole, the rate of false positive results was 3 % for lasalocid, 4 % for maduramicin, 5 % for halofuginone and 0 % for all the others. JRC. D. 5 -Standards for Food Bioscienc...|$|R

40|$|Direct-Fed Microbials (DFM) are a {{putative}} {{alternative to}} the feeding of sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics {{in the production of}} poultry and other livestock species. This study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} a commercial DFM (Primalac®), or salinomycin (SAL), a commonly used antibiotic <b>and</b> <b>coccidiostat</b> supplement, on fermentation patterns and lactate production in the cecum and the lower intestinal tract of broiler chickens. L-lactate and total lactate concentrations in the digesta fluid of the ileum decreased (P< 0. 01) with the DFM feeding in comparison to CON and SAL treatments while d-lactate concentration increased (P< 0. 04) in comparison to CON. Total cecal VFA concentration was lower (P< 0. 003) with DFM feeding and SAL than the CON. In the present study both dietary supplements, DFM and SAL, altered lactic acid and VFA concentrations in the cecum and intestines of experimental animals; however the full spectrum of mechanisms responsible for antibacterial properties and growth promotion associated with those changes remains to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of antibodies to a veterinary drug requires conjugation {{of the low}} molecular weight compound to a larger molecular weight substance (carrier protein) to enable immune recognition. The resulting immunogen is usually mixed with an adjuvant to create a prepnration thnt will elicit a strong and lasting inullune response to the complex when administered to the host animal. Fretmd's adjuvant has been previously used but can produce adverse side effects in the host. A replacement adjuvant for Fretllld's was sought: Montanide ISA 50 V {{was found to be}} suitable for the {{production of}} antibodies to three veterinary clmg haptens without the adverse effects associated with FreundÃ‚Â·s. Antibodies were required for the development of inummoassays for the <b>coccidiostats</b> diclazuril <b>and.</b> robenidine. TIle lack of a suitable fimctional group for coupling to the protein made immtlllogen preparation difficult for both these compounds. lvlimics possessing part of the relevant structures and more open to chemical manipulation were used as haptens to prepare inummogens and subsequently specific antibodies for diclazuril and robenidine were obtained.
