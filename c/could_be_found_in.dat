5|$|For {{those who}} {{remained}} new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism. During the summer season in the 1860s and 1870s five thousand inhabitants of Lewis <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Wick on the mainland of Scotland, employed on the fishing boats and at the quaysides. Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. By 2001 the population of North Uist was only 1,271.|$|E
5|$|Golem Arcana {{was funded}} through a Kickstarter {{campaign}} that launched in September 2013 {{and went on}} to raise over $500,000. The game was released just under a year later, on 13 August 2014. Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and executive producer Ray Winninger had extensive experience developing both video games and tabletop games, and one of their primary motivations in creating Golem Arcana was to merge the two gaming types. They also sought to create a more social experience than <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> traditional multiplayer video games.|$|E

Some American clothes from Lend-Lease <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Soviet secondhand shops. Still others bought their {{clothing}} from “fartsovshchiks”, people who dealt in the illegal business of acquiring and selling foreign goods and currency. “Stilyagi” listened to jazz and rock-and-roll, and frequented clubs like Hotel Evropeiskaia in Leningrad, which featured the Yosif Vainshtein orchestra and played American swing melodies.|$|R
5|$|In the High Middle Ages {{there were}} {{new sources of}} education, such as song and grammar schools. These were usually {{attached}} to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were most common in the developing burghs. By {{the end of the}} Middle Ages grammar schools <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> all the main burghs and some small towns. Early examples including the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.|$|E
5|$|Many fire temples, {{with their}} four axial arch openings, were usually turned into mosques simply by setting a mihrab (prayer niche) {{on the place}} of the arch nearest to qibla (the {{direction}} of Mecca). Zoroastrian temples converted into mosques in such a manner <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Bukhara, as well as in and near Istakhr and other Persian cities. Urban areas where Arab governors made their quarters were most vulnerable to such religious persecution, great fire temples were turned into mosques, and the citizens were forced to conform or flee. Many libraries were burnt and much cultural heritage was lost.|$|E
5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of populations and {{individuals}} vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 plants in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 plants. In 1988, however, only four populations comprising 300 plants were found; surprisingly, only fifty plants <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the location where a population of 300 had previously been reported; yet there were no dead plants, and no evidence of disturbance. Since then the number of populations reported have ranged from 6 to 11, and reports {{of the total number of}} plants have ranged from 340 to 580.|$|E

This demography changed during the Holocene period; during this time, the species <b>could</b> only <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the swamp lands and wetlands of southern China. Due to hunting and land reclamation, the demography of the Père David's deer became even smaller. By 1939, {{the last of the}} wild species were shot and killed.|$|R
5|$|Shafi'i {{accepted}} {{cases in}} which he had to be more flexible with the application of Qisas. Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik, he developed a tertiary source of legislation. The Shafi'i school adopted istidlal or inference, a process of seeking guidance from the source. Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case where no clear precedent <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> <b>In</b> this case, public interest was distinguished as a basis for legislation.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} quoll (D. hallucatus) <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{the northern}} third of Australia a century ago. Presently, it resides in high rocky areas and areas with heavy rainfall. It is abundant on the minor islands surrounding northern Australia.

Genetic analysis indicates it is the earliest offshoot from the ancestors of other quolls.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by {{the lay of the land}} (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> a typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold. Millinery was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.|$|E
