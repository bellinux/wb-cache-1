40|$|In South African law, {{affirmative action}} {{has been a very}} {{controversial}} topic over the years. 5 Controversial issues such as perceptions and reactions of affirmative action in the South African context are varied. 6 These reactions are often categorised as politically explosive and emotionally charged. 7 Most people fear the implications of affirmative action, more specifically the impact thereof on their individual positions within the workplace. 8 Those who feel threatened by these measures, tend to question the political and ethical legitimacy thereof. 9 Those who stand to benefit from these measures often dislike the labelling associated with these measures. 10 Confusion also exits in greater society about relationship between the equal opportunity, black advancement, affirmative action and diversity management paradigms and related practices. The sources of conflicting reactions to affirmative action stem from individual, group and cultural believes and values which were both shaped by the political realities of the previous regime and the ideals people cherish for themselves in the current dispensation. Colonialist and apartheid laws, policies and practices which were racist and patriarchal provided for separate societies for blacks, whites, Indians and coloureds. 11 At this point in time separate labour systems with job reservation were applicable for whites. There were also wage differentiations between white and black people and between sexes. 12 Furthermore, disabled people were kept dependant and there were also discriminatory legislative provisions against them. 13 This history of systemic discrimination and its resulting inequality and entrenched disadvantage for black, coloured and Indian women and the disabled, was and still is well-known both nationally and internationally. 14 Internationally, apartheid has been extensively disapproved. Examples hereof include the United Nations that declared apartheid and its impact a “crime against humanity” and a negation of the United Nations Charter, 15 expressions of censure culminated in the adoption of the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment <b>of</b> the <b>Crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Apartheid</b> 16 and the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations and its agencies. 17 Nationally, on the other hand, South Africa promulgated several legislative pieces namely, the Constitution, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000 and the Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{winding down}} its work of hearing {{testimony}} {{to human rights}} abuses <b>of</b> the <b>apartheid</b> era, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is an ambitious undertaking. A counterpart to the Reconstruction and Development Programme, a long-term scheme {{for the creation of}} housing, infrastructure and jobs, the Truth Commission is part of a vast effort at nation-building in post-apartheid South Africa. By asking South Africans to remember, the Truth Commission seeks to come to terms, not only with the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>apartheid</b> era, but with a 350 -year history of white domination. In the words of Justice Richard Goldstone, former UN Chief Prosecutor for War Crimes Tribunals in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, (One of the most important advantages of the TRC [is] that it w[ill] write the past forever into South Africa 2 ̆ 7 s history 2 ̆ 7 (Pretoria News August 18 1997).

40|$|This thesis tackles {{a pivotal}} {{commitment}} of post-apartheid South Africa. A country {{that still has}} to re-think the urgent demands of sociality and cohabitation on the ruins and the wounds of the past. The critical perspective here adopted is sceptical towards every unproblematic ‘grand narrative’ that celebrates {{the triumph of the}} ‘Rainbow Nation’. It proceeds {{side by side with the}} recovery of Krotöa’s traces, the Khoikhoi interpreter who was partially acculturated to Dutch customs and then abandoned and imprisoned in Robben Island until her death. After centuries of silence her traces emerged in 1950, when a politically committed archivist strove to undo the material and bio-political racist archive <b>of</b> <b>apartheid.</b> Such traces are here collected in the vibrant tissue of differently committed art works, which during the Transition period (1989 - 1995 ca.) focused on her figure. At the heart of this interrogation are not the historical documents: this research talks about the archive in order to reopen its conceptual dualisms and epistemological, philosophical premises, and to discuss again the “messianic” bind between memory, future and their spectres (Jacques Derrida, Mal d’archive. Une impression freudienne, 1995). 	Chapter I deals with the aporiae of forgiveness and testimony in the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (the court-like restorative justice body which collected hearings from the victims <b>of</b> the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>apartheid,</b> granting amnesty to the perpetrators who confessed and repented). In the background, as if bearing witness, there is Krotöa in her role of “Mother Africa”, whose iconic epistemic validity icon is here questioned. Chapter II offers a philosophical, genealogical and postcolonial research on the archive, which emerges as a ‘forthcoming’ promise, more bounded to the multiple possibilities of the present and the future than to commemoration and the past. Chapters III and IV are dedicated to the literary works that present Krotöa, commencing with the Dutch company’s diaries and the incredibly violent prototype of colonial, racist and sexist discourse that appeared, after the interpreter’s death, in the guise of an obituary in a Cape Town journal. Another paramount theoretical issue discussed in the fourth chapter deals with representation as well as with cultural and artistic translation in the Occidental scopic field. The latter is marked by the epistemic violence of conceptual binarisms which confine the ‘black’ woman to the margins of humankind. In chapter IV Jacques Lacan’s theorization of the gaze as the desiring pulsion in the scopic field proves useful to approach an artistic-psychoanalytical querelle on the legitimacy of writing of Krotöa (as an object of personal scopic desires). In chapter V, more focused on the overcoming of perceptive and discursive limits through visual art and a meta-theoretical approach to translation. Here Krotöa lives on ‘in-between’, in the artistic network which draws on her figure to complicate further the myth of reconciliation, through the fractured horizons of the discursive structures which preceeds and exceeds every form of political hegemony. ...|$|R
