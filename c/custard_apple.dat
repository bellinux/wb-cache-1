500|$|In South Bay, {{nearly all}} houses were {{destroyed}} and several buildings were unroofed. The structures not suffering any damage floated away. Many boats and barged in the canal were [...] "resting at all angles.", {{some of which}} were sunk or disabled, while many homes were washed to the banks of the canal. The streets were littered were broken lumber. Debris such as the remains of <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> trees, twisted metal roofing, and wood were piled against the bridges. At least 160fatalities occurred in the city, while the American Red Cross indicated 247deaths. Throughout the 1920s, Okeelanta suffered several floods and muck fires. Finally, the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned. Bean City was also destroyed during the hurricane, but it was eventually rebuilt by Arthur Wells.|$|E
500|$|Five {{types of}} peat {{appear in the}} Everglades system; each type {{supports}} {{a specific type of}} vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as the peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately [...] of soil depth. Between the 1880s and 2005, an estimated 3.4 billion metric tons of soil has been lost in the Everglades due to oxidation. Most of that loss occurs in the Everglades Agricultural Area; the least amount of loss is found in Everglades National Park.|$|E

60|$|The {{first thing}} that caught our eye on board the negro boats which were {{alongside}} was, of course, the baskets of fruits and vegetables, of which one of us at least had been hearing all his life. At St. Thomas's we had been introduced to bananas (figs, as they are miscalled in the West Indies); to the great green oranges, thick- skinned and fragrant; to those junks of sugar-cane, some two feet long, which Cuffy and Cuffy's ladies delight to gnaw, walking, sitting, and standing; increasing thereby {{the size of their}} lips, and breaking out, often enough, their upper front teeth. We had seen, and eaten too, the sweet sop {25a}--a passable fruit, or rather congeries of fruits, looking like a green and purple strawberry, of the bigness of an orange. It is the cousin of the prickly sour-sop; {25b} of the really delicious, but to me unknown, Chirimoya; {25c} and of the <b>custard</b> <b>apple,</b> {25d} containing a pulp which (as those who remember the delectable pages of Tom Cringle know) bears a startling likeness to brains. Bunches of grapes, at St. Kitts, lay among these: and at St. Lucia we saw with them, for the first time, Avocado, or Alligator pears, alias midshipman's butter; {26a} large round brown fruits, to be eaten with pepper and salt by those who list. With these, in open baskets, lay bright scarlet capsicums, green coconuts tinged with orange, great roots of yam {26b} and cush-cush, {26c} with strange pulse of various kinds and hues. The contents of these vegetable baskets were often as gay-coloured as the gaudy gowns, and still gaudier turbans, of the women who offered them for sale.|$|E
