5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or <b>chatter</b> sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The <b>chatter</b> is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

40|$|International audienceChattering is a {{fundamental}} phenomenon that is unique to hybrid systems, due to the complex interaction between discrete dynamics (in the form of discrete transitions) and continuous dynamics (in the form of time). In practice, simulating <b>chattering</b> hybrid systems is challenging in that simulation effectively halts near the <b>chattering</b> time point, as {{an infinite number of}} discrete transitions would need to be simulated. In this paper, formal conditions are provided for when the simulated models of hybrid systems display <b>chattering</b> behavior, and methods are proposed for avoiding <b>chattering</b> “on the fly” in runtime. We utilize dynamical behavior analysis to derive conditions for detecting <b>chattering</b> without enumeration of modes. We also present a new iterative algorithm to allow for solutions to be carried past the <b>chattering</b> point, and we show by a prototypical implementation how to generate the equivalent chattering-free dynamics internally by the simulator in the main simulation loop.

30|$|Depending on the {{terminal}} conditions, the optimal solution of (P_S) may involve a singular arc of order two, and {{the connection with}} regular arcs generates <b>chattering.</b> The occurrence of <b>chattering</b> causes {{the failure of the}} indirect approach.

5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They <b>chatter</b> while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E

5|$|Three {{types of}} song have been described: the day song {{is the most}} common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an antiphonal duet, {{generally}} {{over the course of}} the day and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. The whisper song is sung more commonly in wet or windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree warbling soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the breeding song at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and more complex than the day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may <b>chatter</b> or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also <b>chatter</b> when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant <b>chatter.</b> When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E

Although, the SMC is simple structure control. It can be more complicated to overcome the <b>chattering</b> effect.|$|R

5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often <b>chatter</b> together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E

Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
