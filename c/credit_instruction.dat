40|$|Research {{findings}} The IFC project {{provided a}} significant evidence {{base from which}} future endeavours may benefit. Findings discussed in this report include:  Online education can assist people in regional and remote areas into higher education when courses are tailored {{to meet the needs}} of specific cohorts.  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student support needs are diverse: students in pathways courses generally required a high level of student support, including literacy support and technical assistance. Those in Bachelor degrees were found to have similar needs to non-Indigenous students enrolled through Swinburne Online. Providing good support for all online degrees students is likely {{to meet the needs of}} Indigenous learners.  For pathways courses, blended delivery may be more successful than fully online delivery.  Digital exclusion remains a barrier for a significant number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students living in remote areas, and for some in non-remote areas.

40|$|Purpose – The authors teach a three-credit, upper-division, {{information}} literacy (IL) course {{to students in}} various majors. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to share the various philosophies and activities the authors use to engage their students and create a cohesive interdisciplinary course and to describe the various assessment tools utilized. Design/methodology/approach – In this case study, the authors give specific examples of engaging assignments and methods for evaluating student work in a credit-bearing IL course. Findings – It is found that if students are engaged, and effective assessment tools are employed, library <b>credit</b> <b>instruction</b> in a face-to-face setting with upper-classmen from diverse majors is an impactful way to teach IL. Practical implications – This article provides ideas on how to use a topical theme in teaching an interdisciplinary IL credit course; concrete approaches on engaging students in an IL course; and new strategies for assessing an IL credit-bearing course. Many of the engagement and assessment methods the authors share may also be applied to one-shot instruction sessions. Originality/value – The paper provides a practical case study of the authors 2 ̆ 7 experiences engaging students and assessing their work in an upper level, three-credit, face-to-face class, a type of course not well represented in the {{information literacy}} literature at this point in time...|$|E
40|$|Dual Credit {{programs}} allow {{secondary students}} to earn {{high school and}} college credit simultaneously upon completion of the requisite course. Over the past decade, the number of states that have established legislation authorizing these programs has nearly doubled. However, there is very little existing research that conclusively demonstrates this investment in Dual Credit is justified. None of the existing research looks at the effect of Dual Credit program location on student success, or presents a conclusive finding as to whether the number of Dual Credit courses students enroll in affects student success differently. This thesis takes a first look at these two research questions relative to the academic performance of New Mexico students {{in the first year of}} college. 	 The findings indicate that students who enrolled in a Dual Credit program on high school campuses outperformed those at college campuses in New Mexico. In addition, students who took a higher number of Dual Credit courses also were better prepared for college-level academics. These results can be compared with the outcomes from other studies conducted in different states to help determine what type of Dual <b>Credit</b> <b>instruction</b> model produces the best results to attain student success, something vital in guiding national discussions as to how Dual Credit programs should be implemented.

40|$|A {{part of the}} Virtual University of Finland, {{the eastern}} Finland {{universities}} offer high school students {{an opportunity to take}} their first 15 university credits of Computer Science over the Web. At the University of Joensuu courses consist of three parts: general introduction to computers (three credits), introduction to Computer Science (five credits), and programming (seven <b>credits).</b> <b>Instruction</b> is almost entirely delivered over the Web. The students follow a schedule given at the web site, learn the related chapters from their textbooks, and return exercises by strict deadlines. The students live as far as hundred kilometers away from the university and their local high schools {{have not been able to}} hire qualified programming teachers. We solved the problem by organizing on-line teachers at the university to answer students questions and assigning a tutor - with hardly any experience in programming - to encourage the students at the local school. To intensify the learning outcomes, we are planning to use three different learning tools in the web-based course environment: Excel, Jeliot, and BlueJ. Each of these can be used to visually understand a given program. In particular, the environments serve as virtual laboratories for real problems: the students can study their own programs. At the University of Joensuu, the course started in August 2000. Out of the 80 enrolled students, more than 65 were active after the first three months. Altogether, the course will take 16 months.

40|$|Teacher {{education}} is a significant component in CWU’s academic profile, with about 1500 quarter <b>credits</b> of <b>instruction</b> provided by the Professional Education Program alone. The 32 endorsement programs in three colleges require at least that many more. More than 500 student teachers each year are assessed with the edTeacher Performance Assessment (edTPA), and in turn their component scores are aggregated to assess the teacher preparation programs that {{must be approved by}} the state. Furthermore, these scores are published, and reflect directly on the stature of CWU. We are particularly vulnerable in several subtests of the edTPA, which are complicated by the complexity and range of all the programs under the accreditation unit. We have recently achieved state approval for another five years, but we must still deliver on the promises we have made to continue improvement. There is a need for intuitive understanding of the logic and purpose of the edTPA instead of the coercive nature of its being a very expensive high stakes test. This orientation activity uses an original instructional method informed by current theory and research regarding student engagement, self-regulation, and multiple modalities. An ongoing challenge in teacher {{education is}} to “walk the talk”, that is, to employ the very instructional methods that we promote.

40|$|Abstract One of the {{important}} parts of the educational system is the instructional system. The instructional system should be formulated well so that the effective and efficient education can be reach. The effective and efficient instructional system {{is expected to be}} able to guide the whole instructional process so that the instruction can reach the instructional goals. Credit system is one of the innovations related to the instructional system. In the system, the students are able to decide their own study capacity and the subjects in each semester. However, actually, it is not a new instructional system since there are some rules that have described the system for a long time. In Indonesia, the guideline in implementing credit system for Senior High School students has been launched by Badan Standard Nasional Pendidikan (BSNP). It describes the policy, the concept and the principals in implementing the credit system related to the process of deciding the learning capacity, arranging the curriculum structure, facilitating the choices of learning capacities and the subjects, and arranging the schedule. The rules are helpful for the curriculum implementer at schools. In conjunction with the explanation, the English instruction should also be designed based on the rules.

40|$|In today’s {{climate of}} fiscal {{constrains}} many university science courses are {{left without a}} laboratory component. Lecture demonstrations remain virtually the only vehicle to bring experimentation into large introductory science courses. Unfortunately, just showing the demonstrations during the lectures has very little effect on students’ learning. In {{order to make a}} real difference, the lecture demonstrations need to be embedded into students’ activities. Interactive Lecture Demonstrations (ILDs) 1 method is proven to be very effective in combating students misconceptions. ILDs employ “elicit/confront/resolve” cycle: the students make written predictions before they see a demonstration, and reconcile their ideas with the results of the demonstration once it is completed. However, a valid complain about ILDs is that the predictions need to be recorded and marked for <b>credits.</b> Fortunately, Peer <b>Instruction</b> (PI) pedagogy can be used to support ILDs procedure, where the pre-demo clicker questions are built to collect the predictions about the experiment, and post-demo questions are built to follow up on the results. Although it appears that “clicker ILDs” are not as effective as the ILDs with written predictions, using clicker questions related to the demonstration is an acceptable alternative to the standard ILD procedure, in particular, for large-enrollment classes. This is a work in progress, as sets of matching questions for popular class demos are being developed. Several examples will be provided. 1. D. R. Sokoloff, R. K. Thornton (2006).

30|$|The PD program, {{designed}} {{in partnership with}} the school districts, consisted of four 3 credit hour courses, for a total of 12 <b>credit</b> hours of <b>instruction,</b> with a mandatory on-site coaching and mentoring component. The first two courses focused on instructional and assessment methods that emphasized a socio-cultural perspective for second language development and have their theoretical foundation supported by SFL. The third course, coupled with a fourth course on the special needs of linguistically diverse learners, offered in the second semester, formally introduced the teachers to SFL for language education focusing on the functions of language in linguistic resources for meaning through application. Specifically, teachers were introduced to the concept of the KF and the six basic KSs. Then, using the KF, teachers {{designed in}}structional units that analyzed academic tasks for their functions and the associated linguistic features at the levels of lexicon (vocabulary), syntax (sentence), and discourse, so as to provide linguistically responsive instruction. An example of the instructional design based on the KF developed by a participating teacher is presented in Table  5 for a unit on Genetic Diseases. Teachers in this study were trained using the KF that demands analysis of academic tasks for their functions—what is being discussed (field), who/how it is being discussed (tenor), and the medium through which it is discussed (mode)—and the associated linguistic features at the levels of lexicon, syntax, and discourse. For example, in the Genetic Diseases example (Table  5), the field is biological science; the tenor will be informal when small groups of peers discuss the “principles” of genetic science; and, the tenor will be more formal when the “choice” around genetics is presented. The mode for conveying understanding of the “principles” is oral while {{there are at least two}} modes for the presentation: written messages on slides, and oral messages of support for those slides. We pushed the teachers to never settle for non-native English speakers simply drawing a picture for the determination of understanding since success in schooling depends greatly upon linguistic means.|$|R

This study examined the impact of the part-time faculty upon the mission of the community college by interviewing board members, administrators, national experts, and by surveying full-time and part-time faculty. Empirical data were gathered regarding load and student credit hours generated in each mission function by part-time and full-time faculty. Financial allocations associated with salary were reviewed. Responses from those interviewed were determined to be imbedded in four themes: position within the organization, the concept of "appropriateness," mission support activities other than teaching, and the personal goals of faculty. Experts, board members and administrators indicated that the use of part-time faculty was more acceptable in some mission functions than in others. They endorsed the use of part-timers in the community/continuing education and occupational/career functions but they had strong reservations about their use in the transfer function. They indicated that while part-timers had limited impact on the counseling/guidance function they had strong impact on the remedial/developmental, occupational/career, and community/ continuing education functions. Intergroup faculty responses were more divergent. For all mission functions, the full-timers indicated that part-timers had less impact than part-timers indicated for themselves. Based on direct instruction, the empirical data evidenced that the impact of part-time faculty varied with the mission function. Ranked from least to greatest part-time faculty impact, the mission functions were: counseling/guidance; community-continuing education; general education; academic transfer; occupational/career; and, most heavily impacted, remedial/developmental. Financial data affirmed that the use of part-time faculty had saved millions of dollars and that it costs two-and-one-half times as much for a full-timer to generate one <b>credit</b> hour of <b>instruction</b> as it does for a part-timer. Full-time and part-time faculty did not differ greatly in their goals for teaching students.
