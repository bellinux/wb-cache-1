First, after reviewing the previous works of the <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> analysis, {{the significance of the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> analysis is stated using hazard and risk concept that associates <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> with <b>traffic</b> accidents. Second, the conventional <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> indicators, such as TTC, approximate-TTC, PET, etc. are demonstrated. The characteristics of these conflict indicators are discussed. Then, third, based on these discussions, the requirements for desired conflict indicators for truly appropriate and effective to alert drivers under congested and high-speed traffic are discussed for ITS-assisted safety system.

25|$|Stop {{signs are}} often used in North America to control <b>conflicting</b> <b>traffic</b> {{movements}} at intersections that are not busy enough to justify the installation of a traffic signal or roundabout. In the United States, the stop sign is not intended {{for use as a}} traffic calming device; it is intended to be installed mainly for safety and/or to assign right-of-way for a certain direction. Nevertheless, in the United States, Mexico and Canada, stop signs are commonly deployed as supposed safety measures in residential areas and near places where children play or walk (such as schoolyards), or that experience frequent automobile collisions, making extra precautions necessary. Stop signs may be erected on all intersecting roads, resulting in three- and four-way stops. However, studies have confirmed that stop signs do not offer measurable safety benefits over the Yield approach adopted in the countries listed above based on original European research dating back many decades.|$|E

Based upon the model, assuming that other factors remain constant, when time headway or speed of eastbound traffic on major road, which is crossed by left-turning traffic from minor road, increases, the number of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> at the intersection decreases. When volume of left-turning traffic on minor road or speed of left-turning vehicles on minor road increases, the number of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> at the intersection increases if other factors remain constant.

At the end of 2011, the population of motorcycles reached 67. 83 million units and increased the composition of motorcycle on the road approximately from 60 to 70 %. The huge number of motorcycles showed the changing of traffic flow characteristics and decreased signalized intersection performance. Motorcycles movement at intersection approach is usually caused <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> between motorcycle and other types vehicles. The <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> is potential to cause the accident. Therefore, red box for motorcycle at signalized intersection is designate a space for motorcyclists to wait at a red light. Motorcyclists stop in front of other types vehicles and can proceed through the intersection first when the light turns green. This is one of the solution to reduce conflict between motorcycle and other types vehicles and increase intersection performance. Aim of this paper to analyze the influence of red motorcycle box to the <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> and <b>traffic</b> flow at intersection. The traffic flow analysis method used MKJI (Indonesia road capacity manual) while the <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> analysis used Bagulay C. J. method.

Traffic performance measures {{expressed in terms of}} average delay suffered by vehicles on minor roads were used in the statistical analysis. A negative binomial regression model, jointly applied to <b>conflict</b> <b>traffic</b> volume (VHPc) and traffic volume entering intersection from minor roads (VHPe), was used to model the average delay.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> under {{congested}} {{conditions is}} one of the main safety issues of motorcycle traffic in developing countries. Unlike cars, motorcycles often display non-lane-based movements such as swerving or oblique following of a lead vehicle when traffic becomes congested. Very few studies have quantitatively evaluated the effects of such non-lane-based movements on <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict.</b> Therefore, in this study we aim to develop an integrated model to assess the <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> of motorcycles under congested conditions. The proposed model includes a concept of safety space to describe the non-lane-based movements unique to motorcycles, new features developed for <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> assessment such as parameters of acceleration and deceleration, and the conditions for choosing a lead vehicle. Calibration data were extracted from video clips taken at two road segments in Ho Chi Minh City. A simulation based on the model was developed to verify the dynamic non-lane-based movements of motorcycles. Subsequently, the assessment of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> was validated by calculating the probability of sudden braking at each time interval according to the change in the density of motorcycle flow. Our findings underscore the fact that higher flow density may lead to conflicts associated with a greater probability of sudden breaking.

In addition, the use of collision records for {{safety analysis}} is reactive: {{a significant number of}} collisions has to be recorded before action is taken. Therefore, the observation of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> has been advocated as a complementary approach to analyze traffic safety. However, incomplete conceptualization and the cost of training observers and collecting conflict data have been factors inhibiting extensive application of the technique.
