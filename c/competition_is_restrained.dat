In {{focusing on the}} voting-rights section of my article, he indeed identifies an analytic error. A national rule that commands all municipalities to confer voting rights {{in a particular way}} prevents them from engaging in Tieboutstyle competition along that particular dimension.

The analysis of the competition structure of Russian industrial sectors reveals that domestic concentration ratios remain high at regional level. We find that foreign entry has positive effect on the productivity of most efficient domestic firms. The effect of foreign entry on productivity of inefficient firms is negative. Our findings show that positive effect from foreign <b>competition</b> appears to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> by barriers preventing exit of inefficient firms. competition; fixed effects estimations; foreign direct investment; total factor productivity; stochastic frontie...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{challenges the}} dominant situational theory developed by Deutsch (1949) that conceptualizes cooperation and competition as situational factors equally shape all team members’ behaviors. Based on interdependence theory and social network techniques, I offer a configural theory {{that accounts for}} the complex, nonlinear patterns of within team cooperation and competition. Acknowledging the tension between team setting and conventional competition, I argue that within team <b>competition</b> <b>is</b> a <b>restrained</b> form of competition as its participants are bonded together by the team membership. Instead of competing for limited prizes or ranks that place individuals against each other, in typical team settings, team members compete for within team status. It has three dimensions, including demonstrating superiority over each team member on competence, participation and connection. I also argue that within team cooperation has three dimensions – sharing, helping and voicing that are directed towards each team member. I developed and validated social network-based measures of within team cooperation and competition based on a student sample in Study 1. The theoretical factor structure was supported. I then tested the overall research model in a field sample in Study 2. Utilizing quadratic assignment procedures, I found that characteristics of each dyad, including dependence, similarity and liking, are able to influence the cooperative behaviors within the dyad. However, why within team <b>competition</b> <b>is</b> differentiated was less consistent with what I expected. The overall pattern of within team cooperation and competition, captured by three network indices, density (i. e., overall connectedness), centralization (i. e., tie distribution), and subgrouping (i. e., disconnection), did not predict team performance. Future research directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} CNTF and BDNF on a {{proteolytic}} complement instrumental to invasion and on differentiation was studied in two murine neuroblastoma clones, N 1 and N 7. At the membrane level, gelatinase MMP- 2 [...] mainly the activated form [...] <b>was</b> <b>restrained</b> by CNTF and BDNF to a residual 34 % with both factors; membrane-type 1 MMP was down-regulated to 50 % (10 h) and 34 % (24 h) with both factors; and urokinase-type plasminogen activator <b>was</b> <b>restrained</b> mainly by BDNF to 70 %.
