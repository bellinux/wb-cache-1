25|$|Interior {{space is}} limited, and divers {{generally}} travel and kit up while {{sitting on the}} tubes opposite a central <b>cylinder</b> <b>rack</b> where the fully rigged scuba sets are stowed. Water entry is commonly by simultaneous rolling backwards over the side, {{and return to the}} boat by climbing back in over the tubes one at a time after removing the heavy parts of the diving equipment and handing it up to the crew. Some boats have ladders which hook over the tubes to make boarding easier for the less athletic diver, others rely on assistance from the crew. An advantage of this type of boat compared with similar-sized rigid boats is that the inflated tubes make the boat very stable during the entry and exit of the divers and if the boat is filled with water during surf transit maneuvers. These boats are usually fairly fast, maneuverable, seaworthy in surf and rough conditions, and relatively uncomfortable. They seldom provide any shelter from the elements, and their advantages are that they get the diver to the site and back fairly quickly, are generally good for operation through surf, are usually trailerable and can be launched at slipways and beaches.|$|E
25|$|When transiting a surf line, or {{in other}} rough sea conditions, the {{movement}} of the boat can cause poorly secured equipment to move, which can directly injure the occupants, and adversely affect trim and stability, and thereby the safety of the vessel and its occupants. Dedicated dive boats usually provide <b>cylinder</b> <b>racks</b> to stow the scuba sets, and may also provide bins or racks to stow other heavy equipment. Larger vessels, particularly live-aboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive.|$|R

5000|$|The 0-6-0 [...] "Dowlais" [...] {{built by}} Neath Abbey in 1836 had the {{inclined}} cylinders mounted {{at the front}} (unlike the previous locomotives which had rear mounted <b>cylinders)</b> and <b>rack</b> drive for use on the incline to Dowlais.|$|R
50|$|The bellman is {{responsible}} for the operation of the bell gas panel. This includes switching between surface supplied gas delivered via the bell umbilical to on-board gas stored in high pressure gas <b>cylinders</b> <b>racked</b> around the bell. The default gas supply is from the surface, but the on-board supply must be used if the surface supply fails for any reason, or there is reason to suspect that it may be contaminated or the mix is wrong for the depth, and may be hypoxic or hyperoxic. The bell gas panel may also be used to control the water level in the dome of a wet bell, and to produce bubble signals in the event of voice communications failure.|$|R

2500|$|... "The Time Ball {{consists}} of a cast iron <b>cylinder,</b> piston, <b>rack</b> and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills {{the bottom of the}} cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a slide gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|R
50|$|Thermoforming {{has benefited}} from {{applications}} of engineering technology3, although the basic forming process {{is very similar to}} what was invented many years ago. Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheet into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been hugely improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus air <b>cylinders,</b> gear <b>racks,</b> and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than air cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat..|$|R
50|$|In 1905, two rack tank {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for the CSAR by Vulcan Foundry, for use on the steep rack section between Waterval Onder and Waterval Boven {{on the line to}} Mozambique. Designed as two-cylinder locomotives by Hyde, the design was modified by the builders to four cylinders with the inside <b>cylinders</b> driving the <b>rack</b> equipment, but without a compensating increase in boiler capacity. The locomotives were failures on the rack section, their rack equipment was removed within a year of entering service and they were reassigned to shunting duty. In 1912, they were considered obsolete by the SAR and not classified, but they remained in service until 1915.|$|R
50|$|The X class {{locomotives}} are a {{class of}} metre gauge 0-8-2T rack and pinion compound locomotives working on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India. They are used on the 20 km section between Coonoor and Mettupalayam where the gradient of the track can be as steep as 1 in 12.5. At these steep sections, the railway uses the Abt system. The X class locomotives are compound locomotives with two high-pressure and two low-pressure cylinders. All cylinders are outside the locomotive's frames. The two low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> drive the <b>rack</b> wheels. These <b>cylinders</b> are positioned above the two main high-pressure cylinders, which drive the main wheels.|$|R
