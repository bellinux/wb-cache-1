40|$|Abstract Higher order {{finite element}} method {{requires}} valid curved meshes in 3 D domains to achieve the solution accuracy. When applying adaptive higher order finite elements in large-scale simulations, complexities that arise include moving the <b>curved</b> <b>mesh</b> adaptation along with the critical domains to achieve computational efficiency. This paper presents a procedure which combines Bézier mesh curving and size driven mesh adaptation technologies to address those requirements. Curved local mesh modification operations are applied to eliminate invalid curved elements and mesh size field is properly controlled to generate valid curved meshes which have been successfully used by Standford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) to simulate the short-range wakefields in particle accelerators. The analysis results for a 8 -cavity cryomodule wakefield demonstrate that valid curvilinear meshes not only make the time domain simulations more reliable but also improve the computational efficiency up to 30 %.

40|$|A {{parallel}} {{distributed approach}} to refine a mesh while preserving the curvature {{of a target}} geometry is presented. Our approach starts by generating a coarse linear mesh of the computational domain. Second, the former coarse mesh is curved to match the curvature of the target geometry. Then, the <b>curved</b> <b>mesh</b> is partitioned and the subdomain meshes are sent to the slaves. Finally, the curved elements are uniformly subdivided in parallel targeting the geometry approximated by the <b>curved</b> <b>mesh.</b> The result is a distributed finer linear mesh featuring improved geometric accuracy. The key ingredient of our implementation is to approximate the target geometry as a linear mesh equipped with an elemental field corresponding to an element-wise polynomial geometry representation. Thus, {{the distribution of the}} curved geometry is equivalent to partitioning the linear mesh and sending the subdomain meshes and the elemental fields to the slaves. The main application of the obtained finer linear mesh is to compute in parallel steady state flow solutions on real topographies. The qualitative results show that for 2 D and 3 D steady state flow solutions, on real and synthetic topographies, our parallel subdivision approach mitigates the artificial artifacts that might appear with standard straight-sided subdivision methods. We also check the parallel performance of the implementation by performing a weak scalability test in 2 D.

Not only the normal physical growth in the orofacial region, but also the developmental process of stomatognathic function in this period are necessary to clarify, because the functional development of children is always progressing and leads to the maturation of masticatory function in adulthood. Jaw motion provides a lot of important information about oral function because it is performed by the functional integration of teeth, maxillary and mandibular bones, masticatory muscle, nervous system, and other organs. The application of six degree of freedom jaw movement tracking devices must be the most suitable method to evaluate jaw motion, and to detect in detail the dynamic characteristics of the whole mandibular function.

40|$|The {{development}} of high-order computational methods for solving partial differen- tial equations on unstructured grids has been underway for many years. Such meth- ods critically {{depend on the}} availability of high-quality curvilinear meshes, as one badly-shaped element can degrade the solution in the whole domain (J. Shewchuk, “What Is a Good Linear Finite Element? Interpolation, Conditioning, Anisotropy, and Quality Measures”, Preprint, 2002). The usual way of generating curved meshes is to first generate a straight sided mesh and to curve mesh entities that are classified on the boundaries of the domain. The latter operation introduces a “shape-distortion” that should be controlled if we suppose that the straight sided mesh is composed of well-shaped elements. Quality measures allow to quantify to which point an element is well-shaped. They also provide tools {{to improve the quality of}} meshes through optimization opera- tions. Many quality measures has been proposed for quadratic triangular finite element. Recently, X. Roca et al. (“Defining Quality Measures for High-Order Planar Triangles and <b>Curved</b> <b>Mesh</b> Generation”, Proceedings of the 20 th Interna- tional Meshing Roundtable, 2011) proposed a technique that allows extending any Jacobian based quality measure for linear elements to high-order iso-parametric planar triangles of any interpolation degree. In this work we propose an efficient method to provide accurate bounds on the mag- nitude of the shape distortion of any triangular and quadrangular curved element. The shape distortion is measured with respect to an ideal element, which can e. g. be an equilateral triangle or the element from the original straight-sided mesh. The key feature of the method is that we can adaptively expand functions based on the Jacobian matrix and its determinant in terms of Be ́zier functions. Be ́zier functions have both properties of boundedness and positivity, which allow sharp computation of minimum or maximum of the interpolated functions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a new {{framework}} to validate and generate curved high-order meshes for complex models is proposed. The main {{application of the}} proposed framework is to generate curved meshes that are suitable for finite element analysis with unstructured high-order methods. Note {{that the lack of}} a robust and automatic <b>curved</b> <b>mesh</b> generator {{is one of the main}} issues that has hampered the adoption of high-order methods in industry. Specifically, without curved high-order meshes composed by valid elements and that match the domain boundary, the convergence rates and accuracy of high-order methods cannot be realized. The main motivation of this work is to propose a {{framework to}} address this issue. First, we propose a definition of distortion (quality) measure for curved meshes of any polynomial degree. The presented measures allow validating if a high-order mesh is suitable to perform finite element analysis with an unstructured high-order method. In particular, given a high-order element, the measures assign zero quality if the element is invalid, and one if the element corresponds to the selected ideal configuration (desired shape and nodal distribution). Moreover, we prove that if the quality of an element is not zero, the region where the determinant of the Jacobian is not positive has measure zero. We present several examples to illustrate that the proposed measures can be used to validate high-order isotropic and boundary layer meshes. Second, we develop a smoothing and untangling procedure to improve the quality for curved high-order meshes. Specifically, we propose a global non-linear least squares minimization of the defined distortion measures. The distortion is regularized to allow untangling invalid meshes, and it ensures that if the initial configuration is valid, it never becomes invalid. Moreover, the optimization procedure preserves, whenever is possible, some geometrical features of the linear mesh such as the shape, stretching, straight-sided edges, and element size. We demonstrate through examples that the implementation of the optimization problem is robust and capable of handling situations in which the mesh before optimization contains a large number of invalid elements. We consider cases with polynomial approximations up to degree ten, large deformations of the curved boundaries, concave boundaries, and highly stretched boundary layer elements. Third, we extend the definition of distortion and quality measures to curved high-order meshes with the nodes on parameterized surfaces. Using this definition, we also propose a smoothing and untangling procedure for meshes on CAD surfaces. This procedure is posed in terms of the parametric coordinates of the mesh nodes to enforce that the nodes are on the CAD geometry. In addition, we prove that the procedure is independent of the surface parameterization. Thus, it can optimize meshes on CAD surfaces defined by low-quality parameterizations. Finally, we propose a new mesh generation procedure by means of an a posteriori approach. The approach consists of modifying an initial linear mesh by first, introducing high-order nodes, second, displacing the boundary nodes to ensure that they are on the CAD surface, and third, smoothing and untangling the resulting mesh to produce a valid curved high-order mesh. To conclude, we include several examples to demonstrate that the generated meshes are suitable to perform finite element analysis with unstructured high-order methods.

40|$|Barycentric {{coordinates}} {{provide a}} convenient way {{to represent a}} point inside a triangle as a convex combination of the triangle's vertices, and to linearly interpolate data given at these vertices. Due to their favourable properties, they are commonly applied in geometric modelling, finite element methods, computer graphics, and many other fields. In some of these applications it is desirable to extend the concept of barycentric coordinates from triangles to polygons. Several variants of such generalized barycentric coordinates have been proposed in recent years. An important application of barycentric coordinates consists of barycentric mappings, which allow to naturally warp a source polygon to a corresponding target polygon, or more generally, to create mappings between closed curves or polyhedra. The principal practical application is image warping, which takes as input a control polygon drawn around an image and smoothly warps the image by moving the polygon vertices. A required property of image warping is to avoid fold-overs in the resulting image. The problem of fold-overs is a manifestation of a larger problem related {{to the lack of}} bijectivity of the barycentric mapping. Unfortunately, bijectivity of such barycentric mappings can only be guaranteed for the special case of warping between convex polygons or by triangulating the domain and hence renouncing smoothness. In fact, for any barycentric coordinates, it is always possible to construct a pair of polygons such that the barycentric mapping is not bijective. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we illustrate three methods to achieve bijective mappings. The first method is based on the intuition that, if two polygons are sufficiently close, then the mapping is close to the identity and hence bijective. This suggests to ``split'' the mapping into several intermediate mappings and to create a composite barycentric mapping which is guaranteed to be bijective between arbitrary polygons, polyhedra, or closed planar curves. We provide theoretical bounds on the bijectivity of the composite mapping related to the norm of the gradient of the coordinates. The fact that the bound depends on the gradient implies that these bounds exist only if the gradient of the coordinates is bounded. We focus on mean value coordinates and analyse the behaviour of their directional derivatives and gradient at the vertices of a polygon. The composition of barycentric mappings for closed planar curves leads to the problem of blending between two planar curves. We suggest to solve it by linearly interpolating the signed curvature and then reconstructing the intermediate curve from the interpolated curvature values. However, when both input curves are closed, this strategy can lead to open intermediate curves. We present a new algorithm for solving this problem, which finds the closed curve whose curvature is closest to the interpolated values. Our method relies on the definition of a suitable metric for measuring the distance between two planar curves and an appropriate discretization of the signed curvature functions. The second method to construct smooth bijective mappings with prescribed behaviour along the domain boundary exploits the properties of harmonic maps. These maps can be approximated in different ways, and we discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. We further present a simple procedure for reducing their distortion and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by providing examples. The last method relies on a reformulation of complex barycentric mappings, which allows us to modify the ``speed'' along the edges to create complex bijective mappings. We provide some initial results and an optimization procedure which creates complex bijective maps. In the second part we provide two main applications of bijective mapping. The first one is in the context of finite elements simulations, where the discretization of the computational domain plays a central role. In the standard discretization, the domain is triangulated with a mesh and its boundary is approximated by a polygon. We present an approach which combines parametric finite elements with smooth bijective mappings, leaving the choice of approximation spaces free. This approach allows to represent arbitrarily complex geometries on coarse meshes with curved edges, regardless of the domain boundary complexity. The main idea is to use a bijective mapping for automatically warping the volume of a simple parametrization domain to the complex computational domain, thus creating a <b>curved</b> <b>mesh</b> of the latter. The second application addresses the meshing problem and the possibility to solve finite element simulations on polygonal meshes. In this context we present several methods to discretize the bijective mapping to create polygonal and piece-wise polynomial meshes...|$|E

To further demonstrate the power of the coupling procedure, we show how it allows for the developments of a provably energy stable coupling between curvilinear nite di erence methods and a curved-triangle discontinuous Galerkin method.

40|$|A {{reconstruction}} algorithm for blade surface {{from less}} measured points of section curves is given based on B-spline surface interpolation. The less measured points {{are divided into}} different segments by the key geometric points and throat points which are defined according to design concepts. The segmentations are performed by different fitting algorithms with consideration of curvature continuity as their boundary condition to avoid flow disturbance. Finally, a high-quality reconstruction surface model is obtained by using the B-spline <b>curve</b> <b>meshes</b> constructed by paired points. The advantage of this algorithm is the simplicity and effectivity reconstruction of blade surface to ensure the aerodynamic performance. Moreover, the obtained paired points {{can be regarded as}} measured points to measure and reconstruct the blade surface directly. Experimental results show that the reconstruction blade surface is suitable for precisely representing blade, evaluating machining accuracy, and analyzing machining allowance...|$|R
40|$|Conservation laws, in for example, electromagnetism, {{solid and}} fluid mechanics, allow an exact {{discrete}} representation {{in terms of}} line, surface and volume integrals. We develop high order interpolants, from any basis that is a partition of unity, that satisfy these integral relations exactly, at cell level. The resulting gradient, curl and divergence conforming spaces have the property that the conservation laws become completely independent of the basis functions. This means that the conservation laws are exactly satisfied even on <b>curved</b> <b>meshes.</b> As an example, we develop high order gradient, curl and divergence conforming spaces from NURBS - non uniform rational B-splines - and thereby generalize the compatible spaces of B-splines developed by Buffa et al. [1]. We give several examples of 2 D Stokes flow calculations which result, amongst others, in a point wise divergence free velocity field.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the least-squares technique for gradient reconstruction on unstructured meshes is examined. While least-squares techniques produce accurate results on arbitrary isotropic unstructured meshes, serious difficulties exist for highly stretched meshes {{in the presence of}} surface curvature. In these situations, gradients are typically under-estimated by up to an order of magnitude. For vertex-based discretizations on triangular and quadrilateral meshes, and cell-centered discretizations on quadrilateral meshes, accuracy can be recovered using an inverse distance weighting in the least-squares construction. For cell-centered discretizations on triangles, both the unweighted and weighted least-squares constructions fail to provide suitable gradient estimates for highly stretched <b>curved</b> <b>meshes.</b> Good overall flow solution accuracy can be retained in spite of poor gradient estimates, due to the presence of flow alignment in exactly the same regions where the poor gradient accuracy is observed. However, the use of entropy fixes has the potential for generating large but subtle discretization errors...|$|R
40|$|The local {{variation}} in strain and {{rotation of the}} Si substrate due to overlying Ni thin film features has been observed using X-ray microdiffraction. Residual tensile stress in 1 µm thick, 190 µm diameter Ni dots of 990 MPa imparted an average compressive stress in the underlying Si substrate. Ni Kα fluorescence scans, acquired simultaneously with Si (333) diffraction data, allow for a precise determination of the Ni feature edge location relative to the observed shift in Si (333) peak position. Rocking <b>curve</b> <b>mesh</b> scans, in which the sample was translated perpendicular and parallel to the diffraction plane, were used to deconvolute the effects of substrate strain due to d-spacing shifts and rotation of the local Si surface. In addition, shear strains at the dot edge imparted a significant shift in the Si (333) diffraction peak, producing a secondary diffraction peak in modified reciprocal space scans...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{spatially}} high order accurate semi-implicit discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of the two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on staggered unstructured <b>curved</b> <b>meshes.</b> While the discrete pressure is defined on the primal grid, the discrete velocity vector field is defined on an edge-based dual grid. The flexibility of high order DG methods on <b>curved</b> unstructured <b>meshes</b> allows to discretize even complex physical domains on rather coarse grids. Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation into the discrete continuity equation yields one sparse block four-diagonal linear equation system for only one scalar unknown, namely the pressure. The method is computationally efficient, since the resulting system is not only very sparse but also symmetric and positive definite for appropriate boundary conditions. Furthermore, all the volume and surface integrals needed by the scheme presented in this paper depend only on the geometry and the polynomial degree of the basis and test functions and can therefore be precomputed and stored in a preprocessor stage, which leads to savings in terms of computational effort for the time evolution part. In this way also the extension to a fully curved isoparametric approach becomes natural and affects only the preprocessing step. The method is validated for polynomial degrees up to $p= 3 $ by solving some typical numerical test problems and comparing the numerical results with available analytical solutions or other numerical and experimental reference data...|$|R
