40|$|Statement of Problem: Giant cell {{granuloma}} (<b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G)</b> is a reactive lesion {{which affects}} the jaws and oral mucosa of gingiva. This lesion is classified to central and peripheral ones. The histopathologic aspects {{of central and}} peripheral <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> is the same. The central lesions are aggressive and cause osseous destruction. The peripheral <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> produces ulcerative swellings similar to pyogenic granuloma or peripheral ossifying fibroma. Since the peripheral and central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> are common lesions, the awareness of dentists of different aspect of <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> is very important. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was a statistical evaluation of variables such as age, gender and location of peripheral and central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> in oral and maxillofacial pathology department of Dental Faculty of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Materials and Methods: This study was a cross-sectional, case series one. The medical records of oral and maxillofacial pathology department of Dental Faculty of Tehran University of Medical Sciences was assessed in two steps: In the first stage, the medical records of patients with pathologic report of peripheral and central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> were selected and reviewed. In the next step, the informations such as age, gender and location of peripheral and central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> were registered in data forms. The obtained data were analyzed by SPSS statistical software. Results: The results showed that the age range in peripheral and central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> were 2 - 90 and 4 - 70 years, respectively. The peak incidence of peripheral and central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> was in the third and second decades, respectively. The peripheral <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> was more common in men (52. 70 %) than women (47. 30 %). This finding in central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> was 37. 19 % for men and 62. 88 % for women. 57. 06 % of peripheral <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> cases were in mandible and 42. 94 % in maxilla. The occurrence of central <b>G.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>G</b> was 67. 07 % in mandible and 32. 93 % in maxilla.
