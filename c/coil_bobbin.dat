5000|$|This {{crossover}} type is {{mechanical and}} uses {{the properties of the}} materials in a driver diaphragm to achieve the necessary filtering. Such crossovers are commonly found in full-range speakers which are designed to cover as much of the audio band as possible. One such is constructed by coupling the cone of the speaker to the voice <b>coil</b> <b>bobbin</b> through a compliant section and directly attaching a small lightweight whizzer cone to the bobbin. This compliant section serves as a compliant filter, so the main cone is not vibrated at higher frequencies. The whizzer cone responds to all frequencies, but due to its smaller size only gives a useful output at higher frequencies, thereby implementing a mechanical crossover function. Careful selection of materials used for the cone, whizzer and suspension elements determines the crossover frequency and the effectiveness of the crossover. Such mechanical crossovers are complex to design, especially if high fidelity is desired. Computer aided design has largely replaced the laborious trial and error approach that was historically used. Over several years, the compliance of the materials may change, negatively affecting the frequency response of the speaker.|$|E
50|$|This type of winding {{structure}} {{creates an}} optimal fill factor (90.7%) for round wires. In {{order to do}} so, the windings of the upper layer need to be placed into the grooves, provided by the lower layer. If the circles are superposed, it can be seen, that the most compact design {{can be achieved by}} using an arrangement with a 60 degree angle. The ratio of provided space to the part of the circle can be determined mathematically.The best spatial use can be achieved if the winding is parallel to the coil flange for most of its circumference, in order to fulfill the stated requirement. When the winding has been placed around the coil body it will meet with the previous positioned wire and needs to make a step with the size of the wire gauge. This movement is called winding step. The winding step can occupy an area of up to 60 degree of the coil circumference for round coil bobbins and takes one side of rectangular coil bobbins. The area of the winding step is dependent on the wire gauge and <b>coil</b> <b>bobbin</b> geometry. If the winding step cannot be executed properly then the self-guiding ability of the wire is lost and a wild winding is produced. Overall, the first intruding wire mainly determines the location and quality of the winding step. It should be recognized that the wire needs to enter in a possibly flat angle into the winding space. That way an unnecessary bending of the wire is being avoided and the needs space for the second winding step is minimized. For orthocyclic wound coils, the winding step areas is always located at the area of wire entering the winding space and is being continued in helical form against the winding direction. As a consequence a bigger winding width of the coil, leads to a bigger winding step area along the circumference of the coil. The created offset leads to a different position of the layer step, from the first to the second layer, in comparison to the wire entry. This behavior repeats itself with every layer which leads to a spiral shaped crossover section {{at the side of the}} winding.Due to the fact that wires are crossing within the crossover section the resulting winding height is increased. As a result, orthocyclic wound coils with a round coil ground are never circular in the cross over section, but the radial moving winding and layer step creates a hump shape. Experience has shown that, depending on the winding width, coil and wire diameter, the crossover section is about 5 to 10 percent higher than the regular winding height.|$|E

The double electromagnet {{was replaced by}} a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a small <b>coil</b> or <b>bobbin</b> of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877.

50|$|During 1837-38 Professor Page of Massachusetts had {{discovered}} that a needle or thin bar of iron, placed {{in the hollow of}} a <b>coil</b> or <b>bobbin</b> of insulated wire, would emit an audible 'tick' at each interruption of a current, flowing in the coil, and if these separate ticks followed each other fast enough, by a rapid interruption of the current, they would run together into a continuous hum, to which he gave the name galvanic music. He also found that the pitch of this note corresponded to the rate of the current's interruption. These faint sounds were due to magnetostriction. From these and other discoveries by Noad, Wertheim, Marrian, and others, Reis knew that if the current which had been interrupted by his vibrating diaphragm were conveyed to a distance by wires and then passed through a coil like that of Page's, the iron needle would emit notes like those which had caused the oscillation of the transmitting diaphragm. Acting on this knowledge, he constructed his rudimentary telephone. Reis' prototype is now in the museum of the Reichs Post-Amt, Berlin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{degradation}} modes {{can affect the}} integrity of both heat exchanger (HX) and balance of plant tubing, resulting in expensive repairs, tube plugging or replacement of tube bundles. One key component for ensuring tube integrity is inspection and monitoring for detection and characterization of the degradation. Inservice inspection of HX and balance of plant tubing is usually carried out using eddy current (EC) <b>bobbin</b> <b>coils,</b> which are adequate {{for the detection of}} volumetric degradations. However, detection and quantification of additional modes of degradation such as pitting, intergranular attack (IGA), axial cracking and circumferential cracking require specialized probes. The need for timely, reliable detection and characterization of these modes of degradation is especially critical in Nuclear Generating Stations. Transmit-receive single-pass array probes, developed by AECL, offer high defect detectability in conjunction with fast and reliable inspection capabilities. They have strong directional properties, permitting probe optimization for circumferential or axial crack detection. Compared to impedance probes, they offer improved performance in the presence of variable lift-off.

Boundary conditions are applied on the truncation planes where we suppose that the tangential electric field is zero. In order to ensure that the predicted field is close to that expected in the corresponding unbounded domain problem, the truncation planes are far apart, well away from the coil and the groove. The solution is expressed as series expansions for different regions that are matched across cylindrical boundaries using the continuity properties of the electromagnetic field. This process gives the expansion coefficients in the series in terms of the expansion coefficients that represent the field of the source coil.

Reliable prediction of failure pressure and leak rate in tubes with complex cracking requires more detailed information about the geometry and extent of degradation than is generally available from conventional <b>bobbin</b> <b>coil</b> examinations. High-resolution inspections with EC rotating probes are thus carried out on selected regions of tubing to provide the more extensive nondestructive evaluation (NDE) information {{that is needed to}} better assess flaw size and distribution. Interpretation of signals from complex cracking that are often distorted by coherent and incoherent noise can be a challenging NDE task. Studies at Argonne National Laboratory have demonstrated that computer-aided data analysis can be used for more accurate and efficient processing of the large amounts of data collected by such probes. The basic structure of a rule-based multiparameter data analysis algorithm is described in this paper. Multiple-frequency inspection data from a standard rotating pancake coil were used for the analyses.

Graphical user interface tools were devised to read the information needed to carry out various stages of data processing. These interactive tools allow conversion, calibration, analysis, and display of data in various formats. Representative cases of estimated flaw profiles are shown for tube specimens with laboratory-grown cracks (with and without simulated artifacts) that were used to assess sizing accuracy.

40|$|Potential Drop (PD) and Eddy Current Testing (ECT) are {{two common}} Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods, {{which have been}} used for decades. The {{modeling}} research of these problems can help in designing and improving testing technologies, explaining inspection results, and even making the more complex problem solvable, like inverse analysis of flaws and cracks in ECT and case-hardening problem with alternating current potential drop (ACPD). In this dissertation, extensive theoretical modeling research work has been developed. For direct current potential drop (DCPD) problems, first, an analytical solution of modeling edge effects of metal plates with finite thickness has been presented. When dealing with plates somewhat thicker than the probe dimensions, a method-of-images is applied with fast convergence. For thinner ones, a Fourier series summation method, which is obtained using expressions originally developed to evaluate lattice sums in solid-state physics, can overcome traditional slow convergence problem and effectively reduce the triple infinite summation that results from the method-of-images to a double one. Next, an analytical model of DCPD on uniformly layered conductive cylinders of finite length is developed. The solution is expressed in terms of a Green 2 ̆ 7 s function, which satisfies Neumann boundary conditions, and can be extended to a conductive cylinder with an arbitrary number of uniform layers, like the common case-hardening problems. This model can be used to determine the thickness or the conductivity of layered cylinders, especially helpful in monitoring wall thickness in power or chemical plants due to its high sensitivity to the thin tube thickness. For ECT problems, first, an analytical model of an axisymmetric eddy current ferrite-cored coil above a multi-layered conductive half-space is presented by radially truncating the domain of the problem. In this work, the reflection and transmission coefficient matrices due to the end effects of the ferrite core have been introduced, then by using a recursion relationship, the reflection coefficient of a conductor with an arbitrary number of uniform layers has been determined. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to other axisymmetric ferrite core shapes, such as U-shape and E-shape. It is also possible to extend this approach to 3 D problems in Cartesian coordinates using a double truncated series. Then, a semi-analytical model of a differential <b>bobbin</b> <b>coil</b> impedance variation due to a common coaxial circular tube support plate has been developed. Within a truncated domain, the magnetic vector potential can be represented by a Fourier series and the effect of the tube support plate is evaluated theoretically.

Bağlantı standartları sayısının her geçen gün arttığı ve kullanımının karmaşıklaştığı günümüzde, kablolu şarj cihazları sebebiyle ortaya çıkabilecek tehlikeleri önleyecek, verimli, araçların mobilitesini arttıracak ve kullanıcılar açısından önemli kolaylıklar sağlayacak bir kablosuz şarj cihazı üretimi hedeflenmiştir. Seri rezonans çevirici devresi ile enerji transferi gerçekleştirilmiştir. Literatürde önerilen eş değer devre incelenmiş, hiç bir eleman ideal kabul edilmeyerek çok detaylı olarak analizi yapılmıştır ve verim ifadesi elde edilmiştir. Bu önerilen model daha sonra deneysel sonuçlarla karşılaştırılarak test edilmiştir, üstünlükleri ve eksiklikleri belirlenmiştir. Eksiklikleri aşmak için de, öneriler sunulmuştur. Bunlara ek olarak, kablosuz enerji transferi (KET) sistemlerinin durum uzay modeli çıkartılmıştır. Tam köprü seri rezonans devresi yapılarak; manyetik akı yoğunluğu arttırılmıştır, reaktans sıfırlanmış dolayısıyla iletilen enerji arttırılmıştır ve MOSFET üzerindeki anahtarlama kayıpları azaltılmıştır. Bu rezonans evirici için 500 V 50 A dayanımlı MOSFET yarıiletkenler kullanılmış, TMS 320 F 28335 ezDSP geliştirme kartı ile de kontrol sağlanmıştır. Projede sistemin uygun çalışması açısından çok önemli olan bobin tasarımı konusuna detaylı olarak yoğunlaşılmıştır. Deri etkisi ve {{proximity}} etkisi de hesaba katılarak sistemin yüksek verimde çalışmasını sağlayacak özel yapısal özelliklere sahip hava çekirdekli bobin tasarımı yapılmıştır. Bu bobin 35 cm yarıçapında ve 3. 5 cm yüksekliğinde solenoid biçimindedir. Tasarlanan bu bobinle karşılaştırmak üzere aynı çapta aynı endüktans değerine sahip bir spiral bobin tasarlanmıştir. En iyi bobin tasarımı için ANSYS MAXWELL programı kullanılmıştır ve bu program sayesinde sonlu elemanlar modeli ile sistemin elektromanyetik benzetimi elde edilmiştir. Maxwell’in yanısıra bobin tasarımı için gerekli değerleri hesaplayan birçok nümerik metod incelenmiştir ve Matlab kodu hazırlanmıştır. Birinci ve ikinci bobin arasındaki ortak endüktansa bağlı olarak, sistem rezonans frekansı değişmektedir. Bu nedenle aracın park ediliş biçimine göre, sistem rezonans frekansı değişkenlik göstermektedir. Tasarlanan kontrolör, park ediliş kalitesine göre verimi maksimize etmektedir. Buradaki yaklaşım, ikinci taraf akım ve geriliminin ölçülerek bluetooth teknolojisi ile birinci taraftaki kontrolöre vermesidir. HC 05 Bluetooth modülü yardımıyla Ardunio ile hesaplanan ikinci taraf gücü bilgisi, birinci tarafa iletilmiştir. Daha sonra ezDSP kitinin seri haberleşme pini kullanılarak bilgi alınmıştır. Bunlara ek olarak; verim bir sınır değerinden küçük olduğu zaman, güç transferi durmaktadır. Böylelikle enerji tasarrufu sağlanmıştır. Elde edilen maksimum verim bobinler arası mesafe 4 santimetre olduğunda % 30 ’dur. Wireless {{energy transfer}} (WET) has become popularized recently {{and it is}} being planned {{to be used by}} plenty of technologic devices such as electrical cars, medical applications, laptops, mobile phones, even sensors and so on. The main causes of lately intense interest of WET are the power electronics technology that is almost sufficiently advanced and the sharp increase in the usage of the electrical devices variously powered and sized, which have battery, in the daily life and industry. The main purposes of WET researchers are transferring as much power as possible, taking into account high system efficiency in spite of low mutual inductance between coils, human and animal health. It is obviously accepted that the WET systems can not be replaced with plug-in systems, unless these purposes are carried out. The main purpose of this project is that designing and developing a wireless energy transfer system that can charge the battery of an electrical vehicle without a wire by using magnetic coupling method and control the system efficiency adaptively. The number of connectivity standards is increasing day by day and the usage of connectivity has been becoming complicated, as a solution, high efficient wireless charge device which can prevent from danger revealing due to wired charger, also increases the mobility of electrical cars and provides some significant simplicity for users, as well. It can be basicly said that the magnetic coupled method principle and the transformer working principle are the same. The current flowing through the first coil creates magnetic fields, and then this magnetic field induces a voltage in the second coil because of faraday’s law. As a result, the time - varying current is necessity to accomplish coil-to-coil wireless energy transfer. In resonance frequency, the magnetic flux density of the transmitted energy has been increased via the total reactance of magnetic circuit has been eliminated. Moreover, high frequency contributes to more power transfer. Last of all, resonance power converter is very convenient in order to fulfill these needs. In addition, the stress on the switching element has been decreased by designing the full bridge series resonance power electronic circuit. The equivalent circuit of WET system {{can be found in the}} literature. Nevertheless, the components are assumed to be ideally. In this dissertation, the efficiency expression is derived assuming all the components are non-ideally for series resonance converter and parallel resonance converter. The grid voltage is rectified by using KBFC 3510 full bridge rectifier at which voltage and current rate is 700 V 35 A. After rectifying, 1000 V 1 mF capacitor is used to absorb voltage ripple from the rectified voltage. Four IXFH 50 N 50 P Nchannel MOSFETs are used to invert dc voltage. Almost sinusoidal current is obtained by switching MOSFETs in the resonance frequency. The gate signals are produced by TMS 320 F 28335 ezDSP development kit. However, the gate signal produced by TMS 320 F 28335 does not have enough voltage and power, so that its power and voltage are increased by using FOD 3180 optocoupler. These all components compose the power resonance converter. The PCB of this converter is drawn using ALTIUM DESIGNER. The power is wirelessly transferred from primary coil to secondary coil. The almost sinusoidal voltage induced in the secondary coil is rectified by using high frequency full bridge rectifier, the diodes of rectifier is chosen VFT 4045 BP Schootky diode since the voltage drop of selected Schootky diode is 0. 4 V. After the high frequency rectifier, 63 V 3300 μF capacitor is used to absorb voltage ripple. The mutual inductance between coils is crucial in order to get higher efficiency. There are some iterative methods that provide to find analytically the mutual inductance between coils. These methods are named respectively, Sidhu method, Neumann method and Approximated Neumann method. However, when the coils are not aligned each other, the mutual inductance between coils can be found easily. A different method must be applied to find the mutual inductance between misaligned coils. This special method is called as a Grover method. Then, the matlab codes are written for all methods and the codes are added to the Appendix. The coupling factor is a value of how the coils is connected each other. The coupling factor is ratio of mutual inductance value and coil’s inductance value. The coupling factor serves the two purposes. The first one is that the higher coupling factor causes the higher efficiency. The second one is about operating frequency. In the wireless energy transfer system, there are two optimum frequency. In these frequencies, the system work most efficiently. These frequencies depends on resonance frequency and coupling factor. The issue of the designing coil being extremely important for the project has been intensified. The quality factor is the most important factor for designing coil. Calculating inductance value with small error is crucial for defining the quality factor of a coil. There are a lot of methods based on iteration or approximated formulas. These methods can be count respectively Sidhu’s method, Lundin’s method and Wheeler’s method. The Matlab codes are written for all methods and the codes are added to the Appendix. Skin and proximity effects inevitably increase the self-resistance of coils which leads to the lower quality factor. Skin effect results in that current density in surface of wire is more than at the center of cable. Moreover, proximity effect causes that flowing current induces another current flow in a near wire magnetically and this distributed and induced current produces irregular current density. For this reason, the study presents some limits such as the critical height and critical winding pitch of coils. These limits lead to decrease in proximity effect on resistance of coil in high frequency. The solenoid coil having specially structural features provides high efficient system taking into account skin effect and proximity effect. The solenoid bobbin’s radius is 35 cm and the height of the solenoid bobbin is 3. 5 cm. A spiral coil’s inductance value is same as solenoid <b>coil.</b> The spiral <b>bobbin</b> is also designed and is wounded to compare the solenoid coil. Ansys MAXWELL program is used for the best coil design. The system resonance frequency is changed by the mutual inductance between the primary coil and the secondary coil. As a result, the resonance frequency varies with parking status of electrical vehicle. The used controller maximizes the efficiency in accordance with parking style. Theoretical point of this view is based on measuring the dc current and the dc voltage of the secondary side, then calculating the power to the load, after that this power data is sent via bluetooth to the primary side controller, DSP. In addition, the dc current and the dc voltage of the primary side are measured and the input power is calculated. Then the efficiency of total system is calculated in the DSP. If the efficiency is lower than critical value, the system closes oneself. HC 05 bluetooth module and HCPL 7520 optocoupler are used to accomplish control of system. Finally, state space analysis of wireless energy transfer system is done, the all components are assumed non - ideally and the transfer function of wireless energy transfer with non - ideal components is proposed. The test of designed circuit, coils and control algorithm are performed. The maximum efficiency of total system is 30 percent. According to experimental results, the system with the designed solenoid coils is at least 7 % higher efficiency than the system with the spiral coils. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
