40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} percutaneous biopsy with <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumors. METHOD: Retrospective review of 22 patients with mediastinal lesions who were submitted to percutaneous <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> biopsy, oriented, but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax, between 1999 and 2002. RESULTS: Percutaneous biopsy with <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> provided adequate material in 18 / 22 cases, with a total positive sample rate of 82 %. In 4 / 22 cases, the material was insufficient to define the diagnosis (18 %). Percutaneous <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> biopsy established a specific histologic diagnosis in 82 % of the patients: 8 / 22 (36 %) lymphoma; 5 / 22 (28 %) thymoma; 2 / 22 (11 %) thymic carcinoma; 1 / 22 (6 %) metastatic adenocarcinoma; 1 / 22 (6 %) neuroectodermic primitive tumor; and 1 / 22 (6 %) plasmocytoma. All the patients were submitted to a thoracic X-ray after the biopsy. No complications were found in these patients.

40|$|AbstractAim: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} percutaneous biopsy with <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> (Trucut) in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumours. Method: Retrospective review of 56 patients with mediastinal lesions who underwent percutaneous <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> biopsy, oriented but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax, 1999 – 2008. Results: Percutaneous biopsy with <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> provided adequate material in 49 / 56, with a total positive sample rate of 88 %. In 7 / 56 (12 %) cases the material was insufficient to define the diagnosis. Percutaneous <b>core</b> cutting <b>needle</b> biopsy established a specific histological diagnosis in 88 % of the patients: 23 / 56 (41 %) lymphomas; 12 / 56 (21 %) thymomas; 5 / 56 (3 %) thymic carcinomas; 3 / 56 (2 %) small cell carcinoma and 1 / 56 (0. 6 %) metastatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine primitive carcinoma, plasmocytoma, teratoma and goiter.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} value of <b>needle</b> <b>core</b> biopsy to replace frozen {{sections}} in palpable breast masses highly suspicious for malignancy. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: University Hospital Leiden, the Netherlands. METHOD: In 274 patients with 279 palpable breast masses a <b>needle</b> <b>core</b> biopsy was performed {{in addition to the}} triple diagnostic approach (i. e. physical examination, imaging by mammography and ultrasound and cytologic examination), if highly suspicious for malignancy. The core biopsy was performed by means of a 18 -gauge needle in 89 lesions guided by palpation and in 190 lesions under ultrasound guidance. The results were compared with the final diagnosis: 19 benign lesions and 260 malignant lesions. RESULTS: In 63 lesions the results of the triple diagnostic approach were unequivocally malignant, this was confirmed in all cases. In 208 lesions the results of the <b>needle</b> <b>core</b> biopsy were malignant, without false positive results. However, there were 3 false negative results. The proportion of inconclusive <b>needle</b> <b>core</b> biopsies was higher when performed on palpation (35 %) than when performed under ultrasound guidance (7 %). When the specimen showed non-invasive carcinoma, a reliable prediction of invasion was not possible. In 264 cases excision of the lesion was performed.

The effects of needle gauge on diagnostic outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) of pancreatic mass lesions remain unknown. This study compared procurement rates of histologic cores obtained from EUS-FNB of pancreatic masses using 25 - and 22 -gauge <b>core</b> biopsy <b>needles.</b> From March 2014 to July 2014, 66 patients with solid pancreatic mass underwent EUS-FNB with both 25 - and 22 -gauge <b>core</b> biopsy <b>needles.</b> Among them, 10 patients were excluded and thus 56 patients were eligible for the analyses. Needle sequences were randomly assigned, and two passes were made with each needle, consisting of 10 uniform to-and-fro movements on each pass with 10 mL syringe suction. A pathologist blinded to needle sequence evaluated specimens {{for the presence of}} histologic core. The mean patient age was 65. 8 ± 9. 5 years (range, 44 - 89 years); 35 patients (62. 5 %) were men. The mean pancreatic mass size was 35. 3 ± 17. 1 mm (range 14 - 122. 3 mm). Twenty-eight patients (50 %) had tumors at the pancreas head or uncinate process.

30|$|Needle {{choice is}} based on the size and {{location}} of the lesion, intended needle trajectory, information expected from the pathologic sample, status of the lung parenchyma and operator preference. Some of the more commonly used fine-needle aspiration (FNA) devices include Chiba, Franseen, Westcott, MaxiCELL, Greene (Cook) and Turner (Cook) needles, which have circumferentially sharpened tips allowing for sampling. <b>Core</b> biopsy <b>needles</b> are designed to collect a small piece of tissue intended for surgical pathology analysis and can be designed as end-cutting or side-cutting devices. The most commonly used <b>core</b> biopsy <b>needle</b> is the Tru-Cut, which consists of an outer cutting cannula and an inner slotted stylet. The Temno core biopsy device is another similar commonly used automatic <b>core</b> biopsy <b>needle.</b> The Biopince full core is an automated end-cutting needle that produces a full cylindrical core specimen. The decision to perform core biopsy or both core biopsy and FNA is multifactorial and highly institution-/operator-dependent [28]. The number of passes needed per procedure has not been defined, but the decision to perform more than one puncture depends on procedure difficulty, risk of complications, quality of the first specimen obtained and the pathologist’s requests. The presence of an on-site pathologist may reduce the number of biopsies needed [5]. Also the use of a coaxial, a larger-bore needle that is kept in place to maintain access to the target lesion, may allow multiple tissue sampling, reducing repeated pleural or soft tissue punctures [32]. Several techniques have been proposed to seal the path of the needle after its removal {{to reduce the risk of}} pneumothorax and haemorrhage; the most successful option is to create a blood patch with autologous venous blood [33, 34].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse {{the length}} of <b>needle</b> <b>cores</b> sampled as a quality {{indicator}} in systematic transperineal prostate biopsy. We assessed the correlation of core length with the other clinical and topographic parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated data from 509 consecutive patients who underwent a first set of transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal prostate biopsy for suspected prostate cancer. Fourteen cores were sampled from each patient. <b>Needle</b> <b>cores</b> were stretched and placed in tissue cassettes between two nylon meshes according to the pre-embedding methods of prostate needle biopsy specimens. For single biopsy core, the measurement of length (in millimetres) and any percentage of cancer in the biopsy specimen were reported. RESULTS: The mean length of 7, 126 analysed cores was 14. 14 +/- 4. 35 mm. All cores were longer than 10 mm. The mean length of <b>needle</b> <b>cores</b> sampled did not correlate with patient age, total prostate-specific antigen value, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume. The whole mean length of the six samples from the peripheral zone of the right lobe was higher than the mean corresponding value of the six samples from the left lobe peripheral zone (p< 0. 001). The transperineal approach allows a greater sampling of the prostate apex than of the midgland and prostate base (p< 0. 001).
