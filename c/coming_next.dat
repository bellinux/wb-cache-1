25|$|Around 700, {{the island}} of Pantelleria was {{captured}} by Arabs, {{and it was only}} discord among the Arabs that prevented an attempted invasion of Sicily <b>coming</b> <b>next.</b> Instead, trading agreements were arranged with the Byzantines, and Arab merchants were allowed to trade goods at the Sicilian ports.

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2005, a new post-6:00p.m. {{advertising}} style was developed for older audiences, which used a much simpler logo and sleeker packaging with barely any gross-out tactics. In the spring of 2006, the simple logo first appeared on YTV's promos and even appeared on credits of newer original programming. In 2007, this look was adopted for the entire channel. In September 2009, the logo was changed slightly: it featured new colours, and the background was simplified. Variations to the bumpers were reduced. Instead, there are large, opaque digital on-screen graphics telling viewers which programs are <b>coming</b> <b>next,</b> and promotions of the programs. In September 2012, the logo was changed aesthetically.|$|E

Whedon noted he had decided {{at the end of}} season three to direct an episode in season four after doing some second unit work on [...] "Spacetime" [...] under Kevin Tancharoen.

2500|$|The {{waveforms}} {{allow the}} DJ {{see what is}} <b>coming</b> <b>next</b> in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information {{can be used by}} the DJ to help manually beatmatch like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. Digital signal processing algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the tempo of recordings independently of their pitch (and musical key, a feature known as [...] "keylock". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with ReplayGain and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply effects.|$|E
