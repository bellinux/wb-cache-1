5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
25|$|Jääkarhu {{was also}} the most {{powerful}} steam-powered icebreaker ever commissioned in Finland. Her three triple-expansion steam engines, two with a maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of 2,500 ihp driving four-bladed nickel steel propellers weighing about 11 tons each in the stern at 120 rpm, and one turning a third propeller {{of the same size}} in the bow at 130 rpm with a maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of 2,600 ihp. However, for short periods of time during icebreaking operations, the combined output of the engines could reach 9,200 ihp. Unlike the previous coal-burning icebreakers, Jääkarhu had eight oil-fired boilers with mechanical ventilation that consumed 2.5 to 4.5 tons of fuel oil per hour. Although she was the most expensive to operate, and for that reason she was always the last one to enter service and first one to sail back to her summer moorings, her endurance and range were considerably better than those of the older icebreakers since she could hold nearly 1,000 tons of fuel and required refueling only two or three times during normal winters.|$|E
25|$|With {{an overall}} {{propulsion}} power of 22,000hp, Moskva {{was at the}} time the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world. She was second only to the nuclear-powered Lenin which, at 44,000hp, had twice the power of the Moskva-class icebreakers. While the most powerful western icebreaker at the time, the 1955-built USS Glacier, had two propulsion motors rated at 10,500hp each and was thus nearly as powerful as Moskva, the American icebreaker could maintain this power level only for a period of four hours at a time and the total <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> was only 16,900hp.|$|E

25|$|Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg have a {{diesel-electric}} powertrain {{with two}} six-cylinder Wärtsilä 6L26 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines, {{each with a}} maximum <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of , driving van Kaick DGS generators rated 2,250 kVA at 690 V. According to the power plant principle, the main generators in the forward engine room provide electrical power for all shipboard consumers, including propulsion. For emergency and harbour use the ships also have Valmet 612 diesel engines, rated at , coupled to 163 kVA alternators. The vessels are propelled by two ABB Azipod VI1100A electric azimuth thrusters rated at 1,620kW each. Arcticaborg and her sister ship {{were among the first}} icebreakers fitted with Azipod units that allow the ships to operate astern in heavy ice conditions with excellent maneuverability. In addition the ships have one 150kW bow thruster for harbour operations.|$|E
25|$|High-resistance {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the fault current to 25A or less. They have a <b>continuous</b> <b>rating,</b> and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed <b>continuous</b> <b>rating</b> of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E
